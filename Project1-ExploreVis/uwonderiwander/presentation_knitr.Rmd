# Why

### **Nearly 70% of all the freight tonnage moved in the U.S. goes on trucks**
### **Without the industry and our truck drivers, the economy would come to a standstill**

- Move 9.2 billion tons of freight annually 
- Requires nearly 3 million heavy-duty Class 8 trucks and 
- Over 3 million truck drivers 
- Takes over 37 billion gallons of diesel fuel to move all of that freight 

### **Simply â€“ without trucks, America stops**

### **Trucking is leading indicator of the economy**
