I  read this book two years ago and has since written 3 reviews about it, one highshcool essay and read countless reviews and seen it on endless lists, and I mean the top of the lists and it just really is not worth the hype at all, I really don't want to sound like one of those people but certain books do deserve the attention that is given to them and this one, to me, really does not. 

Of course, this book is of great literary merit, considering how it, in a way, foreshadowed the Great Depression, and had a good lot to say about materialism and illusions and mostly the rotten bases of the American dream. 
But, BUT if you are familiar with the authors life story you'l see how so many elements of his life seemed to match gatsby's, a poor man falling love with a wealthy girl who refused him only because he had no money, even though she loved him too. 
Fitzgerald never really got over the hurt of Zelda's refusal, and wrote the, to me, very angry book The Great Gatsby, in which he portrayed himself as a helpless victim of the cruelty of society, having nick caraway feel so immensely compassionate and empathetic towards him, completely disregarding certain things like how Gatsby was often naive, reckless, childish and obsessive, and that he was in no way a helpless victim. 

The book however is important and eventually summed up nicely the cruelty of our idealistic dreams and how, once completely taken over a person, can be actually deadly. 

I liked the great Gatsby, I did, but I don't think its brilliant. Certainly not s brilliant as it's often made out to be. I thought the curious case of Benjamin button was far more charming and moving. Although definitely not as important.

I understand that this is one of the required readings in high school and even some colleges in the USA. This is probably is the main reason why this novel is included in almost all lists of the Best American Novels ever. If am not saying that it is not good but I was not as amazed as when I read the other popular American classic, The Grapes of Wrath of John Steinbeck (which is not at the top of those lists) in February of this year. Maybe I am not an American and too young to relate to the Jazz Age (the roaring 20’s) where most Americans – the baby boomers - were prosperous as it was in between the two world wars and it was before the Great Depression in the 30’s.

This is basically a tragic love story between Gatsby and Daisy. He constructed the huge palatial house for Daisy whose family rejected him because he was not rich. After retiring from the army (first World War) he got rich because of big time illegal activities such as fixing games, drugs, etc. However, before he saw Daisy again, she had already married John Buchanan (whom she loved but not as much as the love she had for Gatsby). John, however was keeping a mistress Mrytle who had a simpleton unsuspecting husband. Later this husband killed Gatsby because John told him that Gatsby is his wife’s lover who accidentally ran over her.

This book was first publish in 1925 and said to be the basis of many other love stories. For example, the house that Noah built for his mistress in Nicholas Spark’s The Notebook is basically copied from this classic novel. The syndicate-with-a-heart theme of The Godfather series should have been loosely based on this too.

The famous narrative style used by Fitzgerald is noteworthy although not altogether remarkable. It is as if he was just there beside you telling the story that happened almost a century ago. It felt like a legend though there were no fairies, gnomes nor giants. The green light at the end of Daisy wharf has a poetic tone although of course I am not sure what it is all about nor what it signifies.
