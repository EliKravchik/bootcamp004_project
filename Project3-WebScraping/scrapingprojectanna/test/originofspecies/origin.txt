Edits for NR because I love him that much  This  This preservation of favourable variations and the rejection of injurious variations  I call Natural Selection  Variations neither useful not injurious would not be affected by natural selection  and would be left a fluctuating element  as perhaps we see in the species called polymorphic  We shall best understand the probable course of natural selection by taking the case of a country undergoing some physical change  for instance  of climate  The proportional numbers of its inhabitants would almost immediately undergo a change  and some species might become extinct  We may conclude  from what we have seen of the intimate and complex manner in which the inhabitants of each country are bound together  that any change in the numerical proportions of some of the inhabitants  independently of the change of climate itself  would most seriously affect many of the others  If the country were open on its borders  new forms would certainly immigrate  and this also would seriously disturb the relations of some of the former inhabitants  Let it be remembered how powerful the influence of a single introduced tree or mammal has been shown to be  But in the case of an island  or of a country partly surrounded by barriers  into which new and better adapted forms could not freely enter  we should then have places in the economy of nature which would assuredly be better filled up  if some of the original inhabitants were in some manner modified  for  had the area been open immigration  these same places would have been seized on by intruders  In such case  ever slight modification  which in the course of ages chanced to arise  and which in any way favoured the individuals of any of the species  by better adapting them to their altered conditions  would tend to be preserved and natural selection would thus have free scope for the work of improvement  We have reason to believe  as stated in the first chapter  that a change in the conditions of life  by specially acting on the reproductive systems  cause or increases variability  and in the foregoing case the conditions of life are supposed to have undergone a changes  and this would manifestly be favourable to natural selection  by giving a better chance of profitable variations occurring  and unless profitable variations do occur  natural selection can do nothing    I DIDN T WRITE THIS  DARWIN DID IN THIS BOOK  Or This  qd ykwn hdh lktb hw   Zm ktb ntjth lbshry   drwyn Gyr kl shy fy msr lbshry  mn nZr  lbshr l nfshm Ht  nZr  lbshr tjh lkwn wlTby  mn

this book for is the science  or in an effort to either defend or refute the argument for evolution  The core of Darwin s argument certainly is still what was taught in my Catholic high school biology class  taught by a nun   In a nutshell  the theory is that given there are wide ranging subtle Variations among organisms  the Malthusian Struggle for Existence causes by means of Natural Selection of the inheritable traits that are the best Adaptations to the environment the Origin of Species or as Darwin calls it  the  theory of descent with modification  But  after all  this book is now over 150 years old  Science is about explaining natural phenomenon and correcting mistakes through observation  experimentation and falsification  not dogma  and so is always a moving target  I know that  But I still raised an eyebrow when in the first chapter of the book Darwin said he believed the  most frequent cause of variability  was caused by the experiences of the parents before conception  such as cows  udders being larger in countries where they re milked because the habit of milking by itself alters in the reproductive organs what is inherited by the next generation  WTF Darwin  When Darwin first propounded his theory of evolution  a word never used in the book by the way  through natural selection  Mendel had yet to discover the basic principles of genetics in his experiments with peas and Watson and Crick had yet to unravel the structure of DNA  Nor was continental drift known and understood  so there were notable gaps in Darwin s reasoning that has since been filled  Stephen Jay Gould  one of the staunchest defenders and popularizers of evolution is famous within science particularly for where he differs from Darwin  Darwin thought changes in species were very gradual  Gould favors  punctuated equilibrium  where there are rapid changes followed by long periods of stability  That s why scientists today talk of the  theory of evolution   not of  Darwinism  as if a scientific principle is an unchanging creed and Origin of Species scripture So  the book is dated and filled with lots of details I m sure are just plain wrong and might be onerous to unlearn  That does make me reluctant to give this book top marks despite its profound impact  Someone interested in modern evolutionary science would be better off picking up a copy of a book by Jared Diamond  Richard Dawkins  Carl Sagan  although by now I suppose his very readable Dragons of Eden is dated  or Stephen Jay Gould  So  was there no value in reading On the Origin of Species  I wouldn t say that  It s surprisingly readable  or at least understandable  There are definitely dry passages that were a slog to get through  my eyes glazing over as Darwin gave example after exhaustive example to make his points  However  I couldn t help but be impressed by the knowledge of nature shown by his wide ranging examples from every continent from ants and bees and algae to pigeons to zebras  Given the way he cited various authorities and spoke about his own experiments  I definitely felt that here was a master generalist and enthusiast on nature  Moreover Darwin does have a gift for metaphor and illustrative examples  I was particularly taken by his explanation of  inter crossing  and the function of sex in creating biological diversity  I also was struck by how cautious and civil in tone Darwin is in his arguments  devoting an entire chapter on what he saw could be the flaws and holes in his theory  particularly the issues of transitions between species and intermediate forms  Bottom line  Arguably this specific book had as much influence on the literature and politics of the next century as Freud or Marx  so I think there is historical value in reading this  preferably in the first edition  which is what I read  that exploded upon the world in 1859  l  tqd  nh ywjd mn l lm mn  Hdth  thran fy Hy  lbshr wm tqdthm wthwbthm km f l drwyn  wfy drsth tlk yqdm ln khlS  tjrbh

that it s not always easy reading   there s that verbose quality to its style that characterizes most writing from the Victorian era  That said  I should point out that  The Origin of Species  is completely understandable to any general reader willing to give it a careful reading  You don t have to be a biologist to follow Darwin s argument  Two aspects of the book are astonishing  both underscore the brilliance of Darwin s accomplishment  The first is just how right he got things  the second is that he managed to fit all the major pieces of the puzzle in place with no knowledge of the actual mechanics of heredity  Mendel s work on genetics adn the elucidation of the structure of DNA would subsequently flesh out the details of the scheme proposed by Darwin  one has to bear in mind the actual state of knowledge in Darwin s time  and the prevailing intellectual climate  to appreciate fully the revolutionary nature of his argument  Upon re reading the book this past weekend  I was reminded of certain endearing aspects that I had forgotten  One is Darwin s willingness to point out  and try to answer  what he perceived as the potential weaknesses in his argument  This is another   Believing that it is always best to study some special group  I have  after deliberation  taken up domestic pigeons   Not quite as glamorous as the beasties he got to see from The Beagle  but he s continually observing  gathering data from any source available  always asking questions  You gotta love this book  But you gotta read it to love it    Sl l nw nZry  lnshw wlrtqtshlz drwynqbl

laly  lwHyd   Viewed now the Apollo moon program was even more astounding than the discovery of America by Christopher Columbus  The Apollo guidance computer had less computing power than average modern family car  This is how we should view Darwin s  Origin Of The Species   It is an absolute triumph of empirical evidence based science  By the most constant and careful observation of the natural world Darwin not only worked out the theory of evolution he also quite correctly realised that all life forms on this planet are related to one another   by which all living and extinct beings are united by complex radiating  and circuitous lines of affinities into one grand system The first two chapters and the last chapter are where the general reader can feel the sparkle of Darwin s ideas and his profound infatuation with nature and its works  These chapters are also the best written and not surprisingly are a thrilling rush of theory and ideas The vast bulk of the work is the minutiae of his ideas  It is  I have to say  cumbersome to read  It is the sort of sub clausal slog that a lot of nineteenth century writing gets bogged down in  Darwin s modesty in quoting and attributing to others and his unfailing scientific fearlessness in saying  OK here is where my theory falls over  makes him a figure of unimpeachable scientific integrity After reading this book I can understand the affection and respect that Darwin has been held in by those who try to base their lives in reason and science  Sudah lama saya ingin membaca buku ini  salah satu buku paling berpengaruh yang pernah ditulis dalam sejarah peradaban manusia  Secara kebetulan  saya menemukannya di toko buku  namun yang saya dapatkan adalah edisi terjemahan bahasa Indonesianya yang diterbitkan oleh Yayasan Obor Indonesia  Di bagian awal pembuka  tim penerjemahnya sendiri sudah mengungkapkan bahwa begitu rumitnya menerjemahkan kalimat bahasa Inggris era Victoria ke dalam kalimat bahasa Indonesia yang mudah dipahami tanpa mengubah maknanya Buku ini sebenarnya merupakan hasil pemikiran selama 20 tahun dari Charles Darwin sepulangnya dari perjalanan panjang bersama kapal HMS Beagle ke Kepulauan Galapagos untuk meneliti keragaman flora dan fauna  Sadar akan kontroversi ide bahwa evolusi dan seleksi alamlah yang membentuk kehidupan dan bukan tangan surgawi  selama kurang lebih 20 tahun  Darwin bimbang menerbitkan buku ini  Hanya karena tiba tiba sahabatnya  sesama ilmuwan biologi  Alfred Russel Wallace  meminta pendapatnya mengenai teorinya akan evolusi  akhirnya Darwin memutuskan untuk  mendahului  pemikiran sahabatnya tersebut  Bila saat itu Darwin tetap bimbang  boleh jadi saat ini dunia lebih mengenal Wallace lah pencetus teori evolusi  bukan Darwin Bagi siapa pun yang dengan semena semena mencela teori evolusi karena menganggap itu tidak rasional dan tidak lebih dari fantasi Darwin semata  saya sarankan untuk membaca buku ini dengan pikiran terbuka  Ternyata Charles Darwin menulis buku ini dengan begitu detail dan sangat hati hati  Bahkan sebenarnya ia sendiri pun masih menuliskan keterbatasan teori ini dengan menunjukkan beberapa bagian yang menganggunya  misalnya  bagaimana proses evolusi yang mengandalkan pada kebetulan secara acak bisa menciptakan organ serumit mata Satu hal yang sangat saya suka dari buku ini adalah saat Darwin menulis bahwa anggapan kaum kreasionis bahwa semua mahluk diciptakan sesuai dengan kondisi habitatnya  sebenarnya adalah keliru karena ia menemukan beberapa spesies yang justru memiliki kebiasaan yang janggal atau hidup di tempat yang tidak sesuai dengan morfologinya  misalnya  burung pelatuk yang hidup di daerah tanpa pepohonan  burung murai yang bisa menyelam  dan angsa angsa yang hidup di dataran tinggi tetapi kakinya masih berselaput  Fakta fakta tersebut menurut Darwin  menunjukkan bahwa spesies terkadang melakukan tindakan di luar instingnya  demi bisa mengambil alih habitat tersebut dari spesies alami yang mendiami teritori tersebut  Hal itu secara tidak langsung juga menunjukkan bahwa naluri   insting sebenarnya diturunkan lewat pengalaman dan bukan bersifat bawaan Sekilas seperti  bolos sekolah bersama pacar  mengadakan kencan rahasia yang menyenangkan ke kebun binatang di luar kota   Sl l nw    tshrlz drwyn lktb hy l     mshrw  qr  hdh lktb kn mt b bqdr m kn mthyr wmmtly an bldhsh

zdn  lm I listened to an abridged audio version of this book and it was enough for me to get the point  This isn t the devil book that many people want it to be  Darwin doesn t spend much time on the theological implications of his theory  He is on a mission to present evidence of his theory  What I wasn t expecting was how often he talked about the alternate theory of  creation   which has little to do with the biblical passages in Genesis and everything to do with the idea of spontaneous generation of new species  Darwin even quotes Genesis to illustrate a point having to do with genetics  In the end  Darwin isn t out to foil the Christian faith  He is presenting evidence and defending critiques of his theory of natural selection  Read this one because it is hard to listen to  To be completely honest  I wanted the notch on my belt for this one  Which didn t hinder it one bit from being so genuinely not dry and engrossing and arresting to read  No wonder Darwin set the world on edge in the most damning way possible  quietly and thoughtfully with these soft spoken facts  Spoiler alert  this book contains references to the existence and likely validity of modern science Reading this was an interesting experience  I didn t find it a thrilling read  and I wouldn t recommend it as a must read  but it was enlightening to be exposed to the time and environment of science and the world when this was written  It s kind of shocking to the system to think that he s having to make an argument to prove that all of his theories in this book are more likely to be true than creationism when they are so deeply ingrained in our current fundamentals as fact  and yet also immediately relevant again with the resurgent debate on creationism  It is also interesting to re explore the foundation of how why Survival of the fittest dictates our world  If those things sound interesting  I think you ll be happy exploring the book  It took me a lot of patience and perseverance to absorb all of the information and stick with him through the entire process of stating his case  I m glad I didn t quit  This book is surprisingly easy to follow  Darwin did not  of course  have access to the 150 years of scientific advancement we have now  but he was still surprisingly correct and the evidence he provides would be enough to silence even modern day creationists  It is also a great example of the humility of science and of Darwin himself  He calmly explains his reasoning and his conclusions and gives people example of exactly how to disprove his theory  Some of the more dated problems he brings up are also quite entertaining to read  For example  one of the biggest problems he foresaw was how animals could have gotten from one continent to another  to then diverge into the diversity we now see  He thought maybe seeds drifted across the ocean and maybe a bird managed to fly across but he never really thought they were satisfying answers  Of course  we now have a completely satisfying answer  arrived at independently by geologists  Namely  that the earth was at one point all together  Anyway  this was a fun book to read  Reading it yourself will give you some interesting science background    Books have been around for as long as I can remember  The first book I read was  Green Eggs and Ham  by Dr  Suess  As I grew older  my vocabulary improved  my knowledge improved  and also been informed about history by reading and researching  Do I believe books should be banned  I say no because books are written for many reasons  Books address society problems that everybody will face one day in life  What s the point of having a book if people are going to ban them  I believe that if parents have a problem with a book then they shouldn t let their child read it  but don t jeopardize every other child s knowledge  Sex drugs murder and lies are what goes on in every community all over the world Nobody can escape these things because the world isn t perfect and this occurs everywhere Books adress these issues and in some cases tell you how to handle them The book  Joy Of Sex  talks about sex and many other things that deals with sex  Is this bad  No because every person in this world have heard of sex on way or another  so why can t one read about their dessires without it being banned Whats the point of haveing a book  To read  I believe people who bann books are banning books out of their own self interest   Theory of Evolution  was a THEORY not a FACT and parents took it all the way to court for what  Ending many kids of learning about different beliefs in this world  Parents have a right to tell kids weather or not they can read a book  Every child is different so is every parent  I believe if a parent doesnt want their child to read a book DON T BUY IT  but don t jeperdize every other person who enjoys reading  I honestly love books and with books being banned my reading isn t improving  So I m anti banning books because books were written to be read not to be banned  The Origin of Species is an amazing book  Reading it  I felt as though I was looking in at Darwin s life  experiencing his anxiety over publishing such controversial work and feeling his excitement as he unraveled the theory  It surprised me how much Darwin covered and the lengths to which he was able to flesh out the theory of Natural Selection without the use of genetics  At times  it almost seemed as if he was on the verge of actually discovering it  The language is a little hard to get through  very eloquent but also very   shall I say   stuffy old man English  After the first couple chapters though  I found that I adapted to it and was able to understand most of what he was saying  The book is thorough  In the sixth edition  he added a whole chapter to deal with the various objections that people had made against his theory  including the lack of transitional fossils  no longer a problem   He dealt with all of these arguments fairly and articulately To anyone who wants to learn more about evolution  I would say this  Don t start with the Origin because there is outdated information in it  I would start with the Ancestor s Tale by Richard Dawkins  But THEN  READ THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES  because it is a wonderful book and probably one of the most controversial and revolutionary books in the field of biology  it also takes center stage in the creationism debate  being popularly quote mined   It is also a good lesson in history and the evidence and arguments that he makes clearly demonstrates the mood in the scientific community at the time   Very convincing argument  hardly long at all  related in a calm voice that inspires interest in what must have consumed Darwin for over a decade   with all the experiments he writes about one can imagine him in his backyard  examining bird droppings  or in his lab  testing how long an apple would float in salt water  How he need to write how much he trusts others informing him  even his own son at one point  For all of his calm  rational explanation  there is still enough digs at contrary naturalist and Creationists to keep thing interesting  Congratulations to the modern day naturalist Peter and Rosemary Grant for getting the much needed hard data to back up Darwin s  very long argument   Interesting  too  how often he keeps leaving things unsaid  mention how he will explain points more fully in his larger work that was to follow   nevertheless  enough has already been said on this fascinating theory of his  and I would look forward to finding out how much other scientific pioneers  such as Sigmund Freud  own Charles Darwin in debt  Cassandra just reminded me why I enjoyed reading Origin of Species so much In college I had to read a fair amount of it in some very non bio course   I can t remember which one  Maybe a social sciences course  I gobbled the whole thing in my almost non existent free time  and I still have my copy in my bedroom  Naughty Parts were fairly dry  but it felt like you were watching Darwin s mind churn and grow and fit the pieces together with him A year or two later I was so excited to go to the Natural History Museum in London to see the actual specimens Darwin chose to ship back to England  I would like to quote a passage directly from the book to describe my review  It is interesting to contemplate an entangled bank  clothed with many plants of many kinds  with birds singing on the bushes  with various insects flitting about  and with worms crawling through the damp earth  and to reflect that these elaborately constructed forms  so different from each other  and dependent on each other in so complex a manner  have all been produced by laws acting around us    from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been  and are being  evolved   Fairly profound work for its time  Darwin anticipated that his contemporaries most likely would not accept his conjecture  He published in order to rest his case with future generations who would be more likely to see his ideas as being a framework for biology It stands to be that this work  while a work of science  is also a work of speculative science  Darwin obviously did not have access to the theoretical apparatuses of game theory  or scientific instruments and data such as genetics  Yet most of us today when looking at his work would say that it was  good for its time  when compared to the information we have today  missing the point of this book  The radical nature of this work is that Darwin laid out the lines of thought by which others could understand biology  Origin of species  while profoundly radical in its generation had a very modest domain  Darwin was interested mainly in introducing a generative apparatus for understanding taxonomy  He was not out to discover the origin of nature  or life  or anything wild such as man s purpose  He stuck to a very immanent goal within biology  that of mere classification  Darwin thus provided the radical approach of looking at a living creatures environment and its relation to its surroundings through genealogy and environmental context  such as geological time   This double part idea has often been dismissed by  pure  biologists who seek to render biology as a purely immanent field  reserving validity only for biologists  and not appeal to other disciplines such as paleontology or geology  as having any agency for explaining or exploring life  consciousness and the social totality of human purpose  Those seeking political fame through this immanent justificationism have this kind of intention as an academic endeavor  they buffer it with  physics envy  as mathematicalization can only easily render statistics for measurable variation  such as the frequency of genes  Attempting to quantize external parameters such as geological shift is far more open to speculation because there is no easy metric for this kind of physics envy approach In a way  the causal truth of Darwin s ideas can only be expressed through the rational approbation of instrumentalization deemed to be rational  If we accept only tools that allow for the quantization of causation through immanent causes  such as a   of genes  then only those causes will be considered a historically of external factors  Being a mathematics  we can always calibrate the relationship to be dependent on a reselection of criteria  For example  when Speed   Rate X Distance we can also see Distance as a Speed   Rate and so on  Purely formal relations can suggest agency through a variety of altercating circumstances which does not force agency to be determined in one particular way or another  Is change a function of time  Or is it a function of force  Or a function of space  In the same way  immanent instrumentalization of purely biological objects  such as genes  or the presence of a particular phenotypical adaptation  can be seen as having agency for natural selection or it can be understood through a variety of external criteria  To center the study as a matter of biological objects  genes  is one view  but we could also see it as a plausible calculation through the flow of entropy  or a shift of the ecology through mass change which takes us beyond the realm of biology inasmuch as it may take us beyond our current instrumental models In many ways this book was kind of dull to read because it cycled through many familiar examples and ideas  It was however  refreshing because it allows us to calibrate positions within the various current debates in biology as they may attempt to  steal  the authenticity of Darwin s idea by emphasizing certain areas and ignoring others  Personally  I find appeals to the authenticity of Darwinism as a justification for the veracity of a particular theory to be ludicrous yet many very intelligent scientists will attempt to force the plausibility of their pet ideas through this authoritarian sublimation of Darwinism  So in that sense  reading Darwin allow us to see that Darwin was very careful in writing this book    he took many years to do it    in order to strike the correct balance in presentation so as to not upset his contemporary audience of naturalists  His very modest idea  that natural selection and evolution be utilized as a taxonomy has a very obvious utility that is present today Yet we have 100 years removed from Darwin  an attempt to utilize this taxonomy as more than a model of understanding adaptation    but also as an argument for progress  prestige and human organization  The implicit key for me here  is that knowledge is always a trace of material agency  that causal links enact a certain criteria for material interaction    which  as stated above  as a formalism    runs both ways People will read Darwinism and see in it the ideology of various contemporary big headed scientists who have pretentious to absolutist elitism  claiming that their methodology is in the same  spirit  as Darwinism  And that s sad  It s bad readership to see something in the past today and then dismiss the past as being  you might as well read so and so   In that sense  you ve simply read your own conclusions in a text  and while satisfying your own sense of justification  wasted your time reading a book that you ve already read before instead of reading the book that is right in front of you  ktb Sl lnw  ldrwyns bd  mn lnhy    f nd lHZ  nhy y lktb   khdhtny nZr  t ml fy tTwr l lm  nd lGrb w mjlt lbHth l lmy   m  wjwd fDly  w jwd m

l    So often we learn about what Darwin said through the works of more contemporary scientists  It is for this reason reading Darwin s own words is important  He is a beautiful writer with a brilliant mind  Easy to read  flows nicely  and makes very clear what he thought  making readers more equipped to make their own decision next the read   Darwin said       I avoided this for a great number of years  Why you ask  Or probably you don t  I wouldn t  Frankly  if you told me that you had avoided it  it probably wouldn t need to know why  So this old crumbly who  oddly enough given the circumstances here   resembles God  Or at least in his latest painting  writes a book that changes understanding of all life on the planet from the year dot  Fuck me that s heavy  Well  anyway  I flew through this  Not literally you understand  I m talking metaforrik    mettaph     Whatever  I mean I didn t evolve  I didn t grow wings however much I may have wanted to  Actually I always wanted to evolve into invisibility so that I could      Ummmmm ok  Let s move on  So it s about a bloke on a boat with his notebook who eventually met Kurt Vonnegut  So it goes  Ok seriously now  A wonderfully written and inspirational leap into the void  That I felt intimidated before embarking on the Beagle  says more about me than it does about him  Small  h   Read it  This is the book that started it all  and after reading Evolution by Carl Zimmer  I finally felt ready to tackle it  I had read much by Zimmer and others such as Dawkins  Prothero  and Gould  I don t much care for the stilted writing style of some nineteenth century authors  I find it confusing or boring  and this was no exception  Much of it was dry and clinical  He writes that he omitted long catalogs of facts  and for that I am grateful Someone said you could give this book to a creationist  Maybe  but I would tell them to skip several chapters  There are many long discussions of problems that have been outmoded by the modern synthesis or that are uninteresting to anyone but a biologist  botanist  or breeder  Scattered throughout are interesting and clear discussions of natural selection and the struggle for existence  but there is much that is less than sparkling It s good to get to the root of this theory that has held up so well  It is interesting to see what he got wrong with the incomplete knowledge of the time  but it is also important to not be arrogant or to think something we  know  now should have been obvious to Darwin  Rather we should wonder what we are getting wrong today that people will snicker at in fifty or a hundred years  For instance  Darwin was pretty certain that the domestic dog breeds came from several different wild species  That hypothesis continued to be accepted until very recently  when studies in molecular biology finally demonstrated they all are descended from one animal  which until this year was thought to be the modern gray wolf  The question  however  is still being investigated as more advanced technologies reveal new findings  Just this year a paper was published in PLOS suggesting the domestic dog did not descend from the gray wolf  but that it and the modern gray wolf share a common ancestor that is extinct  which is actually more in accord with Darwin s theory   Don t you just love science  Darwin was a product of his time  The casual racism that he expresses as he wonders why the barbaric savages didn t domesticate the plentiful plants and animals available to them is exactly what Jared Diamond argues against in Guns  Germs  and Steel This book should be read by everyone  especially atheists and skeptics  to dispel the many myths that have grown up around it  One such myth is that it attempts to explain the origins of life    it doesn t  Another is that Darwin ever said  survival of the fittest   That term was coined by Herbert Spencer  Darwin s contemporary  who perverted the concept of natural selection into social Darwinism and whose principles were embodied in the racism of Ernst Haeckel  Haeckel s ideas were employed by the Germans under Hitler  The term Darwin used was  The Struggle for Existence   But just mention Darwin  and  survival of the fittest  is what pops into everyone s mind  It is true    a lie can travel halfway around the world while the truth is putting on its shoes Would giving this book to a creationist do any good  I don t think so  All of their questions were anticipated  asked  and competently answered by Darwin in this book  The fact that they appropriated his questions and continue to ask them today  while still ignoring his answers  indicates they have never read this book   Hell  most of them don t even read their own Book  Darwin was humble  careful  and cautious  In today s casual speech  he would say  I could be wrong  but      or  some of this is guesswork but     or  here s what would blow my theory out of the water  if anyone could find it  but I have not been able to   All of his conclusions were tentative  He invited criticism and correction  because that s what scientists do  I d like to see self styled  creation scientists   such as Dembsky and Behe  show the same rigor and humility Creationism was big in Darwin s day  He repeatedly stated how his discoveries argued against  independent creation   The bible was probably the main  scientific  reference book of the time  It informed all scientific inquiry    cosmology  geology  biology    with little or no challenge  It s not surprising that Darwin s theory was resisted at the time  But why it still is challenged so strongly 150 years later in my hyperreligious  ignorant pocket of the world  the U S   is a mystery to me  It must make us all look like yokels to the rest of you  I ve been promising myself for years that I would read Darwin s original treatise  and finally got around to it as it is now available as a free Kindle book  Finished it just in time for Darwin s upcoming birthday on Feb 12th  I did not find it an easy read because of the archaic language and the redundancies of content  but I am very glad I did read it because I now can more fully appreciate how difficult it must have been for Darwin to formulate this theory in all its complexity given the state of Biology at the time  and how brave he was it setting it all down  The book s publication created a maelstrom of anger and controversy that still hasn t settled down some 150 years later Now I want to read further to determine in what respects Darwin s various  suspicions  about how natural selection and evolution worked were proved or disproved by subsequent findings  How thrilling it would have been for him to see the emergence of Molecular Biology as a field of study and the untangling of genetic code  Richard E  Leakey es un conocido paleoantropologo con importantes descubrimientos de restos fosiles hominidos  En este libro se apoya en los consultores W  F  Bynum y J A  Barrett para recortar la obra senera de Charles Darwin El Origen de las Especies  Segun Leakey  E l proposito de esta edicion es a la vez hacer asequible la gran obra de Darwin al lector moderno y explicar de que modo la investigacion actual ha extendido nuestros conocimientos de los problemas con que se enfrento  He seleccionado el texto de la sexta edicion de The Origin of the Species publicada en 1872       El texto ha sido reducida a cerca de un tercio de su extension original mediante la eliminacion de muchas repeticiones  algunos de los ejemplos de Darwin y su tendencia a la verbosidad victoriana  En dos o tres ocasiones me he tomado la libertad de reordenar ligeramente el orden de los parrafos para hacer que el texto condensado se leyera mas facilmente  y al recortar este he tenido que interpolar con frecuencia palabras o frases  Pero estas interpolaciones no cambian en modo alguno el sentido original de Darwin  No he intentado hacer que Darwin parezca mas moderno de lo que era  puesto que se vale por si mismo  No obstante  en algunas ocasiones  cuando las investigaciones posteriores han demostrado que las argumentaciones de Darwin eran erroneas  he anadido cortas notas explicativas    El libro tambien agrega muchas ilustraciones  tanto dibujos como fotografias  que ayudan al lector moderno que no es biologo a identificar los animales y plantas a que se hace referencia y a entender graficamente algunos conceptos a que se hace referencia La introduccion escrita por Leakey es interesante y razonablemente completa dada su concision  abarcando tanto algunos elementos pertinentes de la biografia de Darwin  su relacion con Wallace y sus pares contemporaneos y predecesores mas importantes  La introduccion tambien toca dos personajes polemicos lamarckianos posteriores a Darwin  Paul Kammerer  1880 1926   defendido por el intelectual Arthur Koestler en su libro The Case of the Midwife Toad y el infame Trofim Denisovich Lysenko  1898 1976   Finalmente presenta las controversias mas destacadas en evolucion vigentes para cuando Leakey escribio su introduccion  al final de la decada de 1970     el problema de las mutaciones neutras  la universalidad de la seleccion natural como mecanismo evolutivo  la evolucion del sexo  el origen del altruismo y la  sociobiologia     I don t think this is the version of the book that I read  but it s the only one I found on goodreads that has the title somewhat correct   It s not The Origin of Species   it s actually On the Origin of Species by Natural Selection  Clearly it s a classic for people in science  especially biology and zoology  but it s also been banned  debated ad nauseam  and it s a book everyone should read  Darwin s predictive power and the science he outlines is an example of good science and experimental design  and he elucidates the difference between artificial and natural selection  His theory of natural selection is so extraordinary and ahead of its time that we still haven t been able to refute it  though there are other ideas floating around out there  but none with the scope and volume of evidence that natural selection has   A must read for anyone who considers themselves well rounded and educated   Darwin is also a pretty good writer  and you ll see he never used the term  survival of the fittest  to boot   There is no question that Darwin was a visionary genius  His well reasoned and equally well explained theory in the face of the views of his day is quite astounding  I am glad to finally have read what clearly is one of the classics of biology  That having been said  my position on the origin of OUR species has not changed  As Darwin himself said in this volume   If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed  which could not possibly have been formed by numerous  successive  slight modifications  my theory would absolutely break down  But I can find no such case   What Darwin was not aware of  due to no fault of his own  was the incredible complexity  on a molecular level  of the simplest single cell  Darwin s theory falls fall short of explaining the level of diversity of life on this planet even given the millions of years natural selection has had to work its random magic  That having been said  his work remains a wonder  This book is hard to read  It was written by a scientist 150 years ago  So for non scientists of today the format may be a bit unusual  and it feels a bit tedious and repetitive  Some parts I was reading and thinking how he could have formulated the past 3 pages in one sentence But nonetheless it is one of the most important books and I would recommend to read it  The Origin of Species broke ground on an important field of science  Of course many ideas have been changed and evolved since then  but the main idea remains  And it is interesting to read his thoughts and where they were coming from It is a historic book  I would not recommend someone to start with it when learning about evolution  Better go for a basic textbook of today giving main ideas to understand it and then read The Origin of Species just to see how it changed and what was the process of his discovery  I read this book in high school over forty years ago  My biology teacher said he couldn t require us to read it  but it would be a book that we would hear about  because people would be debating it  and we ought to know what we were talking about before we felt compelled to express our opinions on the book  The logical process that led Darwin to his conclusions is explained is a simple and straightforward manner  Although I was already familiar with the workings of natural selection  this book explained the inception of the concept in a very concise manner  And  by the way  I want to thank my biology teacher  Mr  Taylor  I ve found it s always a good idea to know what I m talking about before I begin talking  Darwin s theory of evolution is spot on  well researched  a bit of an understatement really  and extremely thorough  but his writing style is far too heavy verbose for this to be considered a relaxing read  It is  however  a fantastic place to start if one is curious about his theory  but On the Origin of Species is not for the mildly interested reader   this book is a marathon to get through  Well worth the effort if you love biology and want to know more about the in depth studies Darwin undertook on his voyage on the Beagle   It was really helpful to finally read what the man himself had to say about the theory he devoted his life to  rather than endless interpretations of his work  He reached quite different conclusions in his work than in works  and unfortunate movements that misused his work  e g  Nazis  which have expanded on his  He admitted quite a few more gaps in his theory than most  e g  The origin of the universe  of life  of consciousness  of man s appreciation of beauty  the problem of the imperfect geological record and transitional species  the Cambrian explosion etc  Granted scientific progress has been made since to attempt filling those gaps  but has not filled but maybe one or two those gaps quite as satisfactorily as many proclaim   Yet even with the admission of the gaps  Darwin did consider the evidence that he observed to be sufficient grounding to assume that what he observed regarding the evolution of living things can be blanketed back to a single progenitor  In other words  he based a sort of faith in unknown evidence upon evidence that he had observed  This allowed for a sort of evolutionist  faith  to develop upon these facts  assuming undiscovered  and as yet still undiscovered  evidence  I say this only to reassure religious readers that  as Darwin puts it   I see no reason why the views given in this volume should shock the religious feelings of anyone   and to remind evolutionists that the filling of the gaps admitted by Darwin accounts for a sort of religion in itself I m very glad to have finally read the whole work  though I ll admit that most of the important material  I e  The philosophy behind and conclusions of his studies  rather than pages upon pages of evidence  is pretty well summed up in his conclusion chapter  If you don t intend to read the whole work  I d suggest to anyone and everyone that you should read at least the last chapter  XV  which is only about 30 pages  I read this while I was reading some of Wordsworth s poetry  Darwin uses literary techniques such as imagery and metaphor  fictocritical writing  and rhetorical devices  logos and pathos  within his work which i found fascinating for a scientific writer  Darwin personifies nature like Wordsworth  Both Wordsworth and Darwin used nature as a source of creative inspiration for their works I think  But it s interesting how each drew different conclusions from nature  In Darwin s case it led to the rise of realism and reason  In Wordsworth s case  nature was a search for the sublime  and more specifically a kind of spiritual sublime  Darwin s theory and the way in which he presents his theory in On The Origin of Species in a literary sense transcends the superficial and spiritual sublime of nature suggested in Wordsworth s poems  He sees not what s beautiful in nature but its sense of destructiveness  However i do think that Darwin also encouraged congruency between superficial or spiritual appeal of nature and science  The style of his writing itself  creative and scientific  encourages this  I d like to argue that Darwin was a kind of Neo Romantic who took a lot of inspiration from Wordsworth and other Romantic poets before him and took inspiration from their styles    The Origin of Species  may be the most famous book that nobody has read  I know many people who swear by Darwin  call themselves  evolutionists   etc  who have not read this book  Now  I myself am at best a  Evolution Skeptic   I have profound misgivings about the theory of evolution  having taken a class on it in college and having read articles about it since then  However  I have never read the  Origin   Finally  just recently  I got around to it I was pleasantly surprised by this book  Darwin is an incredibly knowledgeable biologist  perhaps the best of his age  In the  Origin   Darwin draws examples from must about every type of life form  from every continent and age  It really is quite remarkable  I was also surprised at how much time Darwin spent addressing those who disagreed with the theory of evolution  He addressed every concern that I had and even a few that I hadn t thought of  It was really quite remarkable how much knowledge is contained in this book My only qualm with this book is that it doesn t make its prima facae case  Darwin spends lots of time discussing variation between species  the spread of species from one place to others  the ability of various species to breed with other species  etc  If this book was about variation among species then it would be first rate  But Darwin s stated purpose in writing this book was to show that all life originated from one or a small number of primordial species  He did that through his discussions of variation among species  etc  but all that really did was show that it s possible for species to change characteristics over time  He did not show examples of how one species could morph into another one  except as an extension of his demonstration that one variety of a species could morph into another variety  There are many very challenging objections to his theory  such as the lack of transitional species in the fossil record  the existence of specialized organs in certain species that would not be able to evolve since they are not found in other species  and the Law of Entropy  which states that in nature complicated systems tend to break down into simpler ones  precisely the opposite of what evolutionists tell us happened in the evolutionary process Overall  I think that more people shoiuld read this book  Even if you reject the theory of evolution  you can learn a lot about life on earth by reading it  And  perhaps  you can learn a bit about why so many people believe that Darwin s theory really does explain  The Origin of Species   from sparknotes  Darwin s theory is based on the notion of variation  It argues that the numerous traits and adaptations that differentiate species from each other also explain how species evolved over time and gradually diverged  Variations in organisms are apparent both within domesticated species and within species throughout the natural world  Variations in colors  structures  organs  and physical traits differentiate a multitude of species from one another  Heredity is the mechanism that perpetuates variations  Darwin argues  as traits are passed from parents to offspring  What is important about these variations to Darwin  though  is the way they allow species to adapt and survive in the natural world  He gives numerous examples of variations that illustrate the wondrous adaptations that allow species to survive in their natural environments  the beak that allows the woodpecker to gather insects  the wings that allow the bat to fly  the paddles that allow the porpoise to swim  and so on  Darwin hypothesizes that the minor variations we see within a single species  such as variations in size  shape  and color of organisms  are related to the more distinct variations seen across different species  His theory of evolution explains how variations cause the origin of species Natural selection is the key component of Darwin s theory  as it explains the relationship between variation and the eventual evolution of a species  Borrowing from Thomas Malthus s principle of exponential population growth  Darwin argues that the possibility of infinite growth of population sizes is checked by the limits of geography and natural resources  which will not allow an infinite number of beings to survive  As a result of limited food  water  shelter  and so on  species must engage in a  struggle for existence   creating competition for survival  What decides  then  which species will survive and which will become extinct  Here is where  natural selection  comes in  Darwin argues that organisms exhibiting  advantageous variations   variations that will allow them to adapt to their environment better than other organisms do  will be more likely to survive  Through heredity  these advantageous variations will be passed on to the organisms  offspring  Eventually  natural selection will allow those species best adapted to their environments to survive and prosper  while species without these advantageous adaptations will lose the struggle for existence and become extinct Natural selection is the mechanism that leads to  descent with modification   Darwin s term for the process of evolution  Organisms will continually give birth to offspring that carry variations  some of which are advantageous and some of which are not  As advantageous variations are naturally selected and become perpetuated through successive generations  organisms carrying these advantageous variations will diverge from the original species  eventually becoming a species of their own  Continual modification and divergence  then  create a branching scheme of evolution  in which new species continually branch off from old ones  The  branches  help biologists link later species back to an original parent species  identifying the point at which different species are related to one another  Darwin notes that existing classification systems developed by naturalists already show these relationships between species  Darwin s theory of descent with modification  then  simply provides an explanation for why many species seem so similar  Either they evolved from one another  or they both evolved from a common parent species After laying out the main principles of his theory in the early chapters of Origin of the Species  Darwin devotes much of the rest of the book to defending his theory against criticisms and presenting detailed examples of how natural selection occurs  The geological record is a formidable impediment to Darwin s theory  as the existing fossil record does not provide the  missing links  in the chains of descent that Darwin proposes  In response  Darwin argues that the geological record is imperfect and that many fossil remains have been destroyed by changes in the earth or have yet to be discovered Darwin also attempts to explain how variations occur in species  driving natural selection and the creation of new species  Geographical isolation is a key component of Darwin s theory  Darwin hypothesizes that because all species originated from one or a few original beings  species needed modes of transportation to migrate between geographical areas throughout the world  Barriers such as oceans and mountain ranges restrict the ability of organisms to migrate  and the few that manage to do so play a large role in shaping the evolution of species on islands and in geographically isolated areas  Geographical isolation accounts for the plethora of unique species on islands  as well as the wider distribution of species across continents Darwin s theory challenged not only the prevailing view of the independent creation of species but also larger claims of religion and science  Darwin explicitly denied the validity of natural theology  which posited that species  adaptations to their environments was proof of their  intelligent design  by a creator  It was natural selection  not independent creation  that resulted in these adaptations  Darwin argued  Moreover  Darwin s use of scientific methodology to prove his theory amounted to an explicit critique of naturalists who would attempt to ignore the scientific validity of his theory because of its controversial nature  While the text of The Origin of Species did leave room for religious theology  Darwin s overall commitment to scientific rationale rather than theological reasoning pitted him against religious doctrine  Darwin s text was controversial when it was published  and it remains controversial today  However  his theory of natural selection has stood the test of time in scientific circles  and it remains the leading scientific explanation for the origin of species  The version of Origin of Species that I read was edited by Richard E  Leakey  He cut Darwin s book down to a third of its original size  and added excellent pictures  comments  biographical sketches  and an introduction to evolutionary biology  in effect giving us a guided tour through the master s work  and an historical perspective on it I thought the result was fine  The original book was  of course  a classic  but the abridgment certainly gives the average reader the main points of Darwin s thesis and the flavor of his writing  and Leakey s comments are quite helpful It must be admitted that even though Darwin was a genius  he worked without all the advances in science since his time  and at times he is off target  or simply wrong  and it is informative to have Richard Leakey respectfully correct him The Leakey Darwin book is 35 years old  however  and one wonders if it also needs some tweaking in light of recent research  I decided to read this book after thinking that since the theory of evolution is now part of the standard science curricula it is almost completely divorced  in the way it is taught  from the way that Darwin thought about it  This made me curious about how Darwin thought about the theory before the vast preponderance of fossils proved it and the entire concepts of DNA and mutations were developed  What I found in the book was nothing short of brilliant  Indeed  it was even beautifully conveyed in a prose that would simply be impossible in today s style of writing scientific discoveries not in the language of the educated masses but in the dialect of the particular field of study  What Darwin presents us is a list of acute observations and simple experiments that anyone could replicate and which give a solid footing to the radical new notion which he was introducing  While I doubt there is a reader out there who is not at least somewhat familiar with the theory of evolution  Darwin uses this book specifically to address those aspects which seem the least intuitive like the infertility of worker ants  This  combined with the simple nature of his observations and explanations  results in a powerful tool that would help even the most scientifically illiterate person obtain a firm grasp of the concept of evolution by natural selection  As such I recommend this book even to those who have no problem with the science behind evolution since it is simply amazing to see such a beautiful theory come out of such simple observations  This book is really a triumph of 19th century scientific practices  simply to observe nature   On the Origin of Species by Charles Darwin  free at Project Gutenberg   Drawing from my own reading library  this book a little like Adam Smith s Wealth of Nations in that the author is taking personal observations and anecdotes and developing a broader hypothesis as to how things work and how we got to where we are today  Many of the anecdotal observations and hypotheses have since been proven as false or mistaken  and we now know more about what was observed than the author possibly could have at the time  but the broader implications and the core of the central hypothesis remain intact Darwin spends early part of the book discussing the difference between variations and species  Modern biological classification had not been completely developed at the time of publication  Genealogy was basically undeveloped  or is perhaps not Darwin s strong suit  His religious detractors at the time argued that species were immutable and that the geological record was perfect   everything that could be known about the history of the earth was essentially already evident  I do not know how widespread the belief was at that time  but creation scientists today acknowledge mass migration  extinction  and  macroevolution   that from one species or phylum can come many different varieties  In Chapter 5  Darwin opines on why zebras have stripes in a greater context of how unique traits evolve in offspring and how offspring sometimes revert to the characteristics of their predecessors  There was no agreed upon model of heredity back then  Scientists are still determining why zebras have stripes Chapters 6 and 7 are interesting as Darwin pivots to address possible criticims of his theory of natural selection  development of organs and the imperfections in the fossil record  He admits that it s hard to believe that something as incredibly complex as the eye developed gradually  but contends that it is not impossible  He contends that whale s lungs developed from an organ that was originally a swim bladder  Since vertebrates have lungs  we must have all evolved from organisms that had swim bladders   ie  sea dwelling creatures   The illustration of the swim bladder in fishes is a good one  because it shows us clearly the highly important fact that an organ originally constructed for one purpose  namely  flotation  may be converted into one for a widely different purpose  namely  respiration  The swim bladder has  also  been worked in as an accessory to the auditory organs of certain fishes  All physiologists admit that the swimbladder is homologous  or  ideally similar  in position and structure with the lungs of the higher vertebrate animals  hence there is no reason to doubt that the swim bladder has actually been converted into lungs  or an organ used exclusively for respiration  According to this view it may be inferred that all vertebrate animals with true lungs are descended by ordinary generation from an ancient and unknown prototype  which was furnished with a floating apparatus or swim bladder  In Chapter 7 Darwin writes that one discovery that would demolish Darwin s theory is if altruistic behavior were to be found in an organism   if one species acted simply to benefit another  This would be impossible under natural selection since each species has developed by focusing on adapting solely on its own survival in the  battle for life   Some have purported that the behavior of one type of ant which serves as a slave to another type are an example of this  Darwin maintains that the enslaved variety is smaller and weaker  and kept alive by their masters due to their usefulness  and therefore acceptance of the slavery is necessary to their survival One wonders  however  at the symbiotic relationships of many species  For example  I read an article recently about how botanists researching fungi have changed their belief in their relationship with trees   The new theory pictures a more business like relationship among multiple buyers and sellers connected in a network   Franklin said in a press release  Instead of being a cooperative trade of carbon and nitrogen between organisms  trees are forced to export large amounts of carbon in order to unlock nitrogen stores from the fungi   The fact that mating behavior   taking two to create offspring   has evolved among so many species would seem to be problematic to natural selection  Wouldn t it be more efficient for survival if one could reproduce asexually with a relatively small gestation time  Why haven t the majority of species evolved that way  It seems that there are benefits to mating beyond reproduction  There is strength in symbiotic communal behavior  as Darwin gives the example of ants and hive bees  Since this behavior is so widespread  one can deduce that it is closer to the  perfection  eventually achieved by natural selection relative to the lower order ancestors  way of producing In Chapter 9 and onward  Darwin deals with the imperfection of the fossil record  We are missing transitional forms at every level to verify his theory  In some layers or time periods  species appear which do not appear in the previous time period  This would seem to suggest creation rather than systematic evolution  Darwin s response to such a criticism is   On this doctrine of the extermination of an infinitude of connecting links  between the living and extinct inhabitants of the world  and at each successive period between the extinct and still older species  why is not every geological formation charged with such links  Why does not every collection of fossil remains afford plain evidence of the gradation and mutation of the forms of life  Although geological research has undoubtedly revealed the former existence of many links  bringing numerous forms of life much closer together  it does not yield the infinitely many fine gradations between past and present species required on the theory  and this is the most obvious of the many objections which may be urged against it  Why  again  do whole groups of allied species appear  though this appearance is often false  to have come in suddenly on the successive geological stages  Although we now know that organic beings appeared on this globe  at a period incalculably remote  long before the lowest bed of the Cambrian system was deposited  why do we not find beneath this system great piles of strata stored with the remains of the progenitors of the Cambrian fossils  For on the theory  such strata must somewhere have been deposited at these ancient and utterly unknown epochs of the world s history  I can answer these questions and objections only on the supposition that the geological record is far more imperfect than most geologists believe  Much has been undiscovered  much may lay under the oceans  and many layers may be compressed due to constantly having more sediment deposited Darwin concludes    Authors of the highest eminence seem to be fully satisfied with the view that each species has been independently created  To my mind it accords better with what we know of the laws impressed on matter by the Creator  that the production and extinction of the past and present inhabitants of the world should have been due to secondary causes  like those determining the birth and death of the individual  When I view all beings not as special creations  but as the lineal descendants of some few beings which lived long before the first bed of the Cambrian system was deposited  they seem to me to become ennobled    There is grandeur in this view of life  with its several powers  having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms or into one  and that  whilst this planet has gone circling on according to the fixed law of gravity  from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been  and are being evolved  Darwin s arguments still did not answer the question for me as to how the eye and other organs developed  How did the original cells know that that there were light and sound waves from which information could be gleaned if a complex structure were developed to capture it Darwin either does not think about or chooses not to write about the ethical implications of his work  If we are not made in the image of God  do we have inalienable rights  Why should there be consequences if one murders another  The natural order is always engaged in a  struggle for life   and the end result is that it is leading us toward evolutionary  perfection   But what aspects of our society and behavior are evolutionary artifacts that will eventually die out and which are essential for our survival I give this book 4 stars out of 5  Everyone should read it as it s a classic  definitely one of the most influential books on the 19th  20th  and 21st centuries  I plan to read Michael Behe s Darwin s Black Box before the end of the year On another note  I listened to this book on the freely available audio files on Gutenberg  The text was read by a computer  each chapter alternated between a male and a female voice  This made it hard to listen to at my usual 2X speed as the cadence was a bit   unnatural   and some of the pronunciations were butchered  But I found it definitely doable   Depois de ler  coloque Darwin acima de todo e qualquer grande genio ja existente  O livro da um show de genialidade e humildade  mostrando que nao e so porque tem uma mente brilhante e que fez grandes observacoes que pode se entitular dono da verdade e desprezar as demais opinioes  E um bom ensinamento sobre o que deveria ser o trabalho de um cientista  compartilhando resultados e questionando os  juntamente com seus companheiros de profissao  I think it s universally recognized that the works of Charles Darwin have been extremely influential in the history of science and have revolutionized our thoughts especially when reflecting upon religious beliefs  The book did in fact provide a massive amount of evidence supporting the theory of  Natural Selection   however it is a very tedious read  Darwin goes into explicit detail when referring to his observations  and does so in very verbose manner which I think to be the book s only flaw This being said  it remains a very important book that should most definitely be read by anyone supporting the abstract idea of Creation  In my opinion  it serves as a guideline to assess the extent by which one is firmly held to the blindness of his preconceived opinion  for many have gone through this book and have willingly chose to repudiate the facts presented  It is somewhat incomprehensible how one can go about to deny such evidence and believe in the miraculous act of Creation as if it were ordinary  However  those are simply my thoughts  and to those who have opposite beliefs  it is most likely due to ignorance and disposition  as Darwin states  Any one whose disposition leads him to attach more weight to unexplained difficulties than to the explanation of a certain number of facts will certainly reject my theory   Reading Darwin from a historical perspective was interesting   though I do not think I ever will need to know as much as I do now about the wingspan of certain birds and how flying squirrels glide  After reading almost a dozen books about evolution and Darwin  I thought it was probably a good idea to read his most famous work  I enjoyed it  I love how he wrote so many examples of each piece of his theory  examples that would make sense to his Victorian  uber religious audience  He talked about beetles and pigeons and songbirds and cattle and sheep and orchids and fruit trees  he explained how the variations between beetles or pigeons could happen  and why  and how each little variation  for each generation  of each variety  over time  could eventually create new species  Darwin s book created an enormous uproar both in agreement and staunch opposition  but in reading it over 150 years after it was published and many of Darwin s premises are widely accepted by both the science community and the general population  it was fascinating to me how his explanations were still so easy to understand and how his thousands of little facts combined to make these clear  elegant arguments  Brilliant  then and now  Love  So when I first picked up my copy I thought to myself  Oh right  What was that ridiculously long title again  So I flipped the book  and read   The Origin of Species   And right beneath that   Complete and Unabridged Well  I like irony  so I leaved through and sure enough after a few pages the original front can be found  which indeed reads  The origin of species by means of natural selection  or the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life Fair enough  the first four words are originally printed slightly larger  so I suppose that gives some licence However  this edition is very complete  providing the text with context and notes on how Darwins ideas have been modified in time  Which I didn t really need  but it was fun to see where all those familiar ideas originated  and suprising to see how developed Darwin s idea already was  and amazing to recognise how this work  and the stresses laid therein  still echoes through evolutionary theory nowadays On form  Darwin has a habit of unprettily stringing together long sentences  which doesn t really help nor make it any prettier  or maybe that I  as a 21st century reader  am just not used to that kind of writing as someone contemporary to this admirable man might have been See what I mean Recommended to diehard and newbie biology enthusiasts alike  A friend of mine  a generation older than me  asked me the other day  and I quote   Do you believe in evolution   I did a double take  then made some cartoon sound effects  I should have done the Flintstone s automobile and run away  Evolution is one of my favorite units to teach in Biology  Being able to say that I actually read this book is awesome  Finding out that Darwin actually included a passage on the evolution of wolves in the Catskills is just so cool  I m glad I read this  even though it was a bit dry sometimes  It s an important book in the history of science  and Darwin deftly and persuasively shows how natural selection works in a way that even a lay reader can understand   The man was brilliant  However  coming from Tennessee  I too understand the conflict of science and religion  This book was beautiful and while he overcame his religion for a majority of the book  the conflict still shows  This was generally more readable than I had feared    although at 500 dense pages it became pretty tough going by the end  It s fascinating to read both from the biological perspective as well as the historical one  Darwin was doing an intricate dance between his own supreme confidence in his argument  and his desire to sway those sure he is wrong  Sometimes I felt like I could hear him rolling his eyes under several layers of extremely polite deference to his opponents over how obviously wrong they were  It s amazing how well this book has stood up over the many decades that have passed and that modern readers can still learn the basics of evolutionary theory as we still understand it today  Really at the time I read this which was in tenth grade biology  I did not appreciate it  But I reread it in college and did  This was a ground breaking book on evolution and should be read   Great is the power of steady misrepresentation  but the history of science shows that fortunately this power does not long endure      Charles Darwin from  On the Origin of Species   6th edition Darwin truly was a genius  although he wasn t the greatest writer to ever live  If only this were required reading in school  the evolution creation debate wouldn t even exist    Awesome ideas  But considering all of them I already knew from modern sources  sources that were not written in the mid 1800s  this was a rather boring book   Remarkable  Hard read but remarkable  Not so much in the information and endless argumentation  rationalisations and justifications  but in the glimpse we get into the incredibly insightful and forward thinking man that Darwin was  while surrounded by contemporaries holding on to irrational and indefensible views about nature  evolution and the role of God  On a practical note  I would recommend reading only the final chapters and summaries to get basically all of relevant information  if this is what you are interested in  there is much repetition throughout the text  and the style of prose is also in itself very repetitive  Parts of it were great  Other parts hard to understand and dry  Overall it was great to see how he approached classification of species  This is a must read and in my opinion  nobody should miss it  It should be part of the compulsory school reading  at least in my country   It was a dense and difficult read  Darwin wrote chunky paragraphs comprising long sentences  But if you manage to labour through them you will find that it is worth the effort You can see how thorough  hard working  and perhaps intense  the author was  Charlie Munger said in one of his speeches that Charles Darwin wasn t a brilliant man  he was a person of a near average intelligence who managed to produce such a prodigious work through many years of consistent and disciplined scientific learning  Having read the Origin of Species  though  I find that hard to believe  Whichever is true  reading this book gives me a glimpse to his seemingly limitless curiosity  his diverse experiences  and his ability to synthesize the theory out of a huge collection of seemingly unrelated observations  Besides his famous HMS Beagle  he seemed to have laboured through volumes of writing about domestic and wild plants  animals  geology  population and linguistics  He bred pigeons  observed ants  learned taxidermy from a colored friend  cultivated peas  and used the bits and pieces of information about nature he obtained from these experiences to write this groundbreaking  albeit not entirely original   well organized and well argued theory I m looking forward to reading books on the follow up and improvement of his theory  I did read this when I was in school but wanted to read it again while not under the stress of exams   Till today a lot of discussions  Incredible work from Charles Darwin and his brother  A great work of science  But it needs to be rewritten or at least rephrased  oh  that its critics would take the time to read it  Darwin s theory of evolution is spot on  well researched  a bit of an understatement really  and extremely thorough  but his writing style is far too heavy verbose for this to be considered a relaxing read  It is  however  a fantastic place to start if one is curious about his theory  but On the Origin of Species is not for the mildly interested reader   this book is a marathon to get through  Well worth the effort if you love biology and want to know more about the in depth studies Darwin undertook on his voyage on the Beagle   It was really helpful to finally read what the man himself had to say about the theory he devoted his life to  rather than endless interpretations of his work  He reached quite different conclusions in his work than in works  and unfortunate movements that misused his work  e g  Nazis  which have expanded on his  He admitted quite a few more gaps in his theory than most  e g  The origin of the universe  of life  of consciousness  of man s appreciation of beauty  the problem of the imperfect geological record and transitional species  the Cambrian explosion etc  Granted scientific progress has been made since to attempt filling those gaps  but has not filled but maybe one or two those gaps quite as satisfactorily as many proclaim   Yet even with the admission of the gaps  Darwin did consider the evidence that he observed to be sufficient grounding to assume that what he observed regarding the evolution of living things can be blanketed back to a single progenitor  In other words  he based a sort of faith in unknown evidence upon evidence that he had observed  This allowed for a sort of evolutionist  faith  to develop upon these facts  assuming undiscovered  and as yet still undiscovered  evidence  I say this only to reassure religious readers that  as Darwin puts it   I see no reason why the views given in this volume should shock the religious feelings of anyone   and to remind evolutionists that the filling of the gaps admitted by Darwin accounts for a sort of religion in itself I m very glad to have finally read the whole work  though I ll admit that most of the important material  I e  The philosophy behind and conclusions of his studies  rather than pages upon pages of evidence  is pretty well summed up in his conclusion chapter  If you don t intend to read the whole work  I d suggest to anyone and everyone that you should read at least the last chapter  XV  which is only about 30 pages  I read this while I was reading some of Wordsworth s poetry  Darwin uses literary techniques such as imagery and metaphor  fictocritical writing  and rhetorical devices  logos and pathos  within his work which i found fascinating for a scientific writer  Darwin personifies nature like Wordsworth  Both Wordsworth and Darwin used nature as a source of creative inspiration for their works I think  But it s interesting how each drew different conclusions from nature  In Darwin s case it led to the rise of realism and reason  In Wordsworth s case  nature was a search for the sublime  and more specifically a kind of spiritual sublime  Darwin s theory and the way in which he presents his theory in On The Origin of Species in a literary sense transcends the superficial and spiritual sublime of nature suggested in Wordsworth s poems  He sees not what s beautiful in nature but its sense of destructiveness  However i do think that Darwin also encouraged congruency between superficial or spiritual appeal of nature and science  The style of his writing itself  creative and scientific  encourages this  I d like to argue that Darwin was a kind of Neo Romantic who took a lot of inspiration from Wordsworth and other Romantic poets before him and took inspiration from their styles    The Origin of Species  may be the most famous book that nobody has read  I know many people who swear by Darwin  call themselves  evolutionists   etc  who have not read this book  Now  I myself am at best a  Evolution Skeptic   I have profound misgivings about the theory of evolution  having taken a class on it in college and having read articles about it since then  However  I have never read the  Origin   Finally  just recently  I got around to it I was pleasantly surprised by this book  Darwin is an incredibly knowledgeable biologist  perhaps the best of his age  In the  Origin   Darwin draws examples from must about every type of life form  from every continent and age  It really is quite remarkable  I was also surprised at how much time Darwin spent addressing those who disagreed with the theory of evolution  He addressed every concern that I had and even a few that I hadn t thought of  It was really quite remarkable how much knowledge is contained in this book My only qualm with this book is that it doesn t make its prima facae case  Darwin spends lots of time discussing variation between species  the spread of species from one place to others  the ability of various species to breed with other species  etc  If this book was about variation among species then it would be first rate  But Darwin s stated purpose in writing this book was to show that all life originated from one or a small number of primordial species  He did that through his discussions of variation among species  etc  but all that really did was show that it s possible for species to change characteristics over time  He did not show examples of how one species could morph into another one  except as an extension of his demonstration that one variety of a species could morph into another variety  There are many very challenging objections to his theory  such as the lack of transitional species in the fossil record  the existence of specialized organs in certain species that would not be able to evolve since they are not found in other species  and the Law of Entropy  which states that in nature complicated systems tend to break down into simpler ones  precisely the opposite of what evolutionists tell us happened in the evolutionary process Overall  I think that more people shoiuld read this book  Even if you reject the theory of evolution  you can learn a lot about life on earth by reading it  And  perhaps  you can learn a bit about why so many people believe that Darwin s theory really does explain  The Origin of Species   from sparknotes  Darwin s theory is based on the notion of variation  It argues that the numerous traits and adaptations that differentiate species from each other also explain how species evolved over time and gradually diverged  Variations in organisms are apparent both within domesticated species and within species throughout the natural world  Variations in colors  structures  organs  and physical traits differentiate a multitude of species from one another  Heredity is the mechanism that perpetuates variations  Darwin argues  as traits are passed from parents to offspring  What is important about these variations to Darwin  though  is the way they allow species to adapt and survive in the natural world  He gives numerous examples of variations that illustrate the wondrous adaptations that allow species to survive in their natural environments  the beak that allows the woodpecker to gather insects  the wings that allow the bat to fly  the paddles that allow the porpoise to swim  and so on  Darwin hypothesizes that the minor variations we see within a single species  such as variations in size  shape  and color of organisms  are related to the more distinct variations seen across different species  His theory of evolution explains how variations cause the origin of species Natural selection is the key component of Darwin s theory  as it explains the relationship between variation and the eventual evolution of a species  Borrowing from Thomas Malthus s principle of exponential population growth  Darwin argues that the possibility of infinite growth of population sizes is checked by the limits of geography and natural resources  which will not allow an infinite number of beings to survive  As a result of limited food  water  shelter  and so on  species must engage in a  struggle for existence   creating competition for survival  What decides  then  which species will survive and which will become extinct  Here is where  natural selection  comes in  Darwin argues that organisms exhibiting  advantageous variations   variations that will allow them to adapt to their environment better than other organisms do  will be more likely to survive  Through heredity  these advantageous variations will be passed on to the organisms  offspring  Eventually  natural selection will allow those species best adapted to their environments to survive and prosper  while species without these advantageous adaptations will lose the struggle for existence and become extinct Natural selection is the mechanism that leads to  descent with modification   Darwin s term for the process of evolution  Organisms will continually give birth to offspring that carry variations  some of which are advantageous and some of which are not  As advantageous variations are naturally selected and become perpetuated through successive generations  organisms carrying these advantageous variations will diverge from the original species  eventually becoming a species of their own  Continual modification and divergence  then  create a branching scheme of evolution  in which new species continually branch off from old ones  The  branches  help biologists link later species back to an original parent species  identifying the point at which different species are related to one another  Darwin notes that existing classification systems developed by naturalists already show these relationships between species  Darwin s theory of descent with modification  then  simply provides an explanation for why many species seem so similar  Either they evolved from one another  or they both evolved from a common parent species After laying out the main principles of his theory in the early chapters of Origin of the Species  Darwin devotes much of the rest of the book to defending his theory against criticisms and presenting detailed examples of how natural selection occurs  The geological record is a formidable impediment to Darwin s theory  as the existing fossil record does not provide the  missing links  in the chains of descent that Darwin proposes  In response  Darwin argues that the geological record is imperfect and that many fossil remains have been destroyed by changes in the earth or have yet to be discovered Darwin also attempts to explain how variations occur in species  driving natural selection and the creation of new species  Geographical isolation is a key component of Darwin s theory  Darwin hypothesizes that because all species originated from one or a few original beings  species needed modes of transportation to migrate between geographical areas throughout the world  Barriers such as oceans and mountain ranges restrict the ability of organisms to migrate  and the few that manage to do so play a large role in shaping the evolution of species on islands and in geographically isolated areas  Geographical isolation accounts for the plethora of unique species on islands  as well as the wider distribution of species across continents Darwin s theory challenged not only the prevailing view of the independent creation of species but also larger claims of religion and science  Darwin explicitly denied the validity of natural theology  which posited that species  adaptations to their environments was proof of their  intelligent design  by a creator  It was natural selection  not independent creation  that resulted in these adaptations  Darwin argued  Moreover  Darwin s use of scientific methodology to prove his theory amounted to an explicit critique of naturalists who would attempt to ignore the scientific validity of his theory because of its controversial nature  While the text of The Origin of Species did leave room for religious theology  Darwin s overall commitment to scientific rationale rather than theological reasoning pitted him against religious doctrine  Darwin s text was controversial when it was published  and it remains controversial today  However  his theory of natural selection has stood the test of time in scientific circles  and it remains the leading scientific explanation for the origin of species  The version of Origin of Species that I read was edited by Richard E  Leakey  He cut Darwin s book down to a third of its original size  and added excellent pictures  comments  biographical sketches  and an introduction to evolutionary biology  in effect giving us a guided tour through the master s work  and an historical perspective on it I thought the result was fine  The original book was  of course  a classic  but the abridgment certainly gives the average reader the main points of Darwin s thesis and the flavor of his writing  and Leakey s comments are quite helpful It must be admitted that even though Darwin was a genius  he worked without all the advances in science since his time  and at times he is off target  or simply wrong  and it is informative to have Richard Leakey respectfully correct him The Leakey Darwin book is 35 years old  however  and one wonders if it also needs some tweaking in light of recent research  I decided to read this book after thinking that since the theory of evolution is now part of the standard science curricula it is almost completely divorced  in the way it is taught  from the way

by ordinary generation from an ancient and unknown prototype  which was furnished with a floating apparatus or swim bladder  In Chapter 7 Darwin writes that one discovery that would demolish Darwin s theory is if altruistic behavior were to be found in an organism   if one species acted simply to benefit another  This would be impossible under natural selection since each species has developed by focusing on adapting solely on its own survival in the  battle for life   Some have purported that the behavior of one type of ant which serves as a slave to another type are an example of this  Darwin maintains that the enslaved variety is smaller and weaker  and kept alive by their masters due to their usefulness  and therefore acceptance of the slavery is necessary to their survival One wonders  however  at the symbiotic relationships of many species  For example  I read an article recently about how botanists researching fungi have changed their belief in their relationship with trees   The new theory pictures a more business like relationship among multiple buyers and sellers connected in a network   Franklin said in a press release  Instead of being a cooperative trade of carbon and nitrogen between organisms  trees are forced to export large amounts of carbon in order to unlock nitrogen stores from the fungi   The fact that mating behavior   taking two to create offspring   has evolved among so many species would seem to be problematic to natural selection  Wouldn t it be more efficient for survival if one could reproduce asexually with a relatively small gestation time  Why haven t the majority of species evolved that way  It seems that there are benefits to mating beyond reproduction  There is strength in symbiotic communal behavior  as Darwin gives the example of ants and hive bees  Since this behavior is so widespread  one can deduce that it is closer to the  perfection  eventually achieved by natural selection relative to the lower order ancestors  way of producing In Chapter 9 and onward  Darwin deals with the imperfection of the fossil record  We are missing transitional forms at every level to verify his theory  In some layers or time periods  species appear which do not appear in the previous time period  This would seem to suggest creation rather than systematic evolution  Darwin s response to such a criticism is   On this doctrine of the extermination of an infinitude of connecting links  between the living and extinct inhabitants of the world  and at each successive period between the extinct and still older species  why is not every geological formation charged with such links  Why does not every collection of fossil remains afford plain evidence of the gradation and mutation of the forms of life  Although geological research has undoubtedly revealed the former existence of many links  bringing numerous forms of life much closer together  it does not yield the infinitely many fine gradations between past and present species required on the theory  and this is the most obvious of the many objections which may be urged against it  Why  again  do whole groups of allied species appear  though this appearance is often false  to have come in suddenly on the successive geological stages  Although we now know that organic beings appeared on this globe  at a period incalculably remote  long before the lowest bed of the Cambrian system was deposited  why do we not find beneath this system great piles of strata stored with the remains of the progenitors of the Cambrian fossils  For on the theory  such strata must somewhere have been deposited at these ancient and utterly unknown epochs of the world s history  I can answer these questions and objections only on the supposition that the geological record is far more imperfect than most geologists believe  Much has been undiscovered  much may lay under the oceans  and many layers may be compressed due to constantly having more sediment deposited Darwin concludes    Authors of the highest eminence seem to be fully satisfied with the view that each species has been independently created  To my mind it accords better with what we know of the laws impressed on matter by the Creator  that the production and extinction of the past and present inhabitants of the world should have been due to secondary causes  like those determining the birth and death of the individual  When I view all beings not as special creations  but as the lineal descendants of some few beings which lived long before the first bed of the Cambrian system was deposited  they seem to me to become ennobled    There is grandeur in this view of life  with its several powers  having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms or into one  and that  whilst this planet has gone circling on according to the fixed law of gravity  from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been  and are being evolved  Darwin s arguments still did not answer the question for me as to how the eye and other organs developed  How did the original cells know that that there were light and sound waves from which information could be gleaned if a complex structure were developed to capture it Darwin either does not think about or chooses not to write about the ethical implications of his work  If we are not made in the image of God  do we have inalienable rights  Why should there be consequences if one murders another  The natural order is always engaged in a  struggle for life   and the end result is that it is leading us toward evolutionary  perfection   But what aspects of our society and behavior are evolutionary artifacts that will eventually die out and which are essential for our survival I give this book 4 stars out of 5  Everyone should read it as it s a classic  definitely one of the most influential books on the 19th  20th  and 21st centuries  I plan to read Michael Behe s Darwin s Black Box before the end of the year On another note  I listened to this book on the freely available audio files on Gutenberg  The text was read by a computer  each chapter alternated between a male and a female voice  This made it hard to listen to at my usual 2X speed as the cadence was a bit   unnatural   and some of the pronunciations were butchered  But I found it definitely doable   Depois de ler  coloque Darwin acima de todo e qualquer grande genio ja existente  O livro da um show de genialidade e humildade  mostrando que nao e so porque tem uma mente brilhante e que fez grandes observacoes que pode se entitular dono da verdade e desprezar as demais opinioes  E um bom ensinamento sobre o que deveria ser o trabalho de um cientista  compartilhando resultados e questionando os  juntamente com seus companheiros de profissao  I think it s universally recognized that the works of Charles Darwin have been extremely influential in the history of science and have revolutionized our thoughts especially when reflecting upon religious beliefs  The book did in fact provide a massive amount of evidence supporting the theory of  Natural Selection   however it is a very tedious read  Darwin goes into explicit detail when referring to his observations  and does so in very verbose manner which I think to be the book s only flaw This being said  it remains a very important book that should most definitely be read by anyone supporting the abstract idea of Creation  In my opinion  it serves as a guideline to assess the extent by which one is firmly held to the blindness of his preconceived opinion  for many have gone through this book and have willingly chose to repudiate the facts presented  It is somewhat incomprehensible how one can go about to deny such evidence and believe in the miraculous act of Creation as if it were ordinary  However  those are simply my thoughts  and to those who have opposite beliefs  it is most likely due to ignorance and disposition  as Darwin states  Any one whose disposition leads him to attach more weight to unexplained difficulties than to the explanation of a certain number of facts will certainly reject my theory   Reading Darwin from a historical perspective was interesting   though I do not think I ever will need to know as much as I do now about the wingspan of certain birds and how flying squirrels glide  After reading almost a dozen books about evolution and Darwin  I thought it was probably a good idea to read his most famous work  I enjoyed it  I love how he wrote so many examples of each piece of his theory  examples that would make sense to his Victorian  uber religious audience  He talked about beetles and pigeons and songbirds and cattle and sheep and orchids and fruit trees  he explained how the variations between beetles or pigeons could happen  and why  and how each little variation  for each generation  of each variety  over time  could eventually create new species  Darwin s book created an enormous uproar both in agreement and staunch opposition  but in reading it over 150 years after it was published and many of Darwin s premises are widely accepted by both the science community and the general population  it was fascinating to me how his explanations were still so easy to understand and how his thousands of little facts combined to make these clear  elegant arguments  Brilliant  then and now  Love  So when I first picked up my copy I thought to myself  Oh right  What was that ridiculously long title again  So I flipped the book  and read   The Origin of Species   And right beneath that   Complete and Unabridged Well  I like irony  so I leaved through and sure enough after a few pages the original front can be found  which indeed reads  The origin of species by means of natural selection  or the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life Fair enough  the first four words are originally printed slightly larger  so I suppose that gives some licence However  this edition is very complete  providing the text with context and notes on how Darwins ideas have been modified in time  Which I didn t really need  but it was fun to see where all those familiar ideas originated  and suprising to see how developed Darwin s idea already was  and amazing to recognise how this work  and the stresses laid therein  still echoes through evolutionary theory nowadays On form  Darwin has a habit of unprettily stringing together long sentences  which doesn t really help nor make it any prettier  or maybe that I  as a 21st century reader  am just not used to that kind of writing as someone contemporary to this admirable man might have been See what I mean Recommended to diehard and newbie biology enthusiasts alike  A friend of mine  a generation older than me  asked me the other day  and I quote   Do you believe in evolution   I did a double take  then made some cartoon sound effects  I should have done the Flintstone s automobile and run away  Evolution is one of my favorite units to teach in Biology  Being able to say that I actually read this book is awesome  Finding out that Darwin actually included a passage on the evolution of wolves in the Catskills is just so cool  I m glad I read this  even though it was a bit dry sometimes  It s an important book in the history of science  and Darwin deftly and persuasively shows how natural selection works in a way that even a lay reader can understand   The man was brilliant  However  coming from Tennessee  I too understand the conflict of science and religion  This book was beautiful and while he overcame his religion for a majority of the book  the conflict still shows  This was generally more readable than I had feared    although at 500 dense pages it became pretty tough going by the end  It s fascinating to read both from the biological perspective as well as the historical one  Darwin was doing an intricate dance between his own supreme confidence in his argument  and his desire to sway those sure he is wrong  Sometimes I felt like I could hear him rolling his eyes under several layers of extremely polite deference to his opponents over how obviously wrong they were  It s amazing how well this book has stood up over the many decades that have passed and that modern readers can still learn the basics of evolutionary theory as we still understand it today  Really at the time I read this which was in tenth grade biology  I did not appreciate it  But I reread it in college and did  This was a ground breaking book on evolution and should be read   Great is the power of steady misrepresentation  but the history of science shows that fortunately this power does not long endure      Charles Darwin from  On the Origin of Species   6th edition Darwin truly was a genius  although he wasn t the greatest writer to ever live  If only this were required reading in school  the evolution creation debate wouldn t even exist    Awesome ideas  But considering all of them I already knew from modern sources  sources that were not written in the mid 1800s  this was a rather boring book   Remarkable  Hard read but remarkable  Not so much in the information and endless argumentation  rationalisations and justifications  but in the glimpse we get into the incredibly insightful and forward thinking man that Darwin was  while surrounded by contemporaries holding on to irrational and indefensible views about nature  evolution and the role of God  On a practical note  I would recommend reading only the final chapters and summaries to get basically all of relevant information  if this is what you are interested in  there is much repetition throughout the text  and the style of prose is also in itself very repetitive  Parts of it were great  Other parts hard to understand and dry  Overall it was great to see how he approached classification of species  This is a must read and in my opinion  nobody should miss it  It should be part of the compulsory school reading  at least in my country   It was a dense and difficult read  Darwin wrote chunky paragraphs comprising long sentences  But if you manage to labour through them you will find that it is worth the effort You can see how thorough  hard working  and perhaps intense  the author was  Charlie Munger said in one of his speeches that Charles Darwin wasn t a brilliant man  he was a person of a near average intelligence who managed to produce such a prodigious work through many years of consistent and disciplined scientific learning  Having read the Origin of Species  though  I find that hard to believe  Whichever is true  reading this book gives me a glimpse to his seemingly limitless curiosity  his diverse experiences  and his ability to synthesize the theory out of a huge collection of seemingly unrelated observations  Besides his famous HMS Beagle  he seemed to have laboured through volumes of writing about domestic and wild plants  animals  geology  population and linguistics  He bred pigeons  observed ants  learned taxidermy from a colored friend  cultivated peas  and used the bits and pieces of information about nature he obtained from these experiences to write this groundbreaking  albeit not entirely original   well organized and well argued theory I m looking forward to reading books on the follow up and improvement of his theory  I did read this when I was in school but wanted to read it again while not under the stress of exams   Till today a lot of discussions  Incredible work from Charles Darwin and his brother  A great work of science  But it needs to be rewritten or at least rephrased  oh  that its critics would take the time to read it
