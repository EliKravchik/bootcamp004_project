I think I'm missing something. Everyone loves this book and I liked it too, but it wasn't amazing or anything.

The Giver felt like a very sparse story to me. First, there isn't much characterization, so I didn't form an emotional connection with any of the characters -- not even with Jonas or the Giver (two central characters). Asher and Fiona (particularly Fiona) are introduced such that you assume they will play greater roles in the book than they do. I don't feel like I knew Mom or Dad or Lily at all. While the lack of an emotional bond with these lesser characters may be due to the nature of their community, Jonas and the Giver should really be more sympathetic, in my opinion.

Second, the description of the community itself is sparse. There is so much more that could've been described about this "utopian" community. I feel like Jonas' selection, his revelation about Release, and his eventual choice could've been built up and framed better. I feel like I got the quick campfire version.

Finally, while I appreciate it's overall message about the importance of individual differences, human emotion, etc., I felt like the book was a bit heavy-handed with its moral. Jonas' initial support of his community and gradual change of heart seems intended to present both viewpoints, but doesn't succeed in my opinion. The book's agenda was clear to me from the beginning. It also doesn't present alternative possibilities (such as a world without Sameness but also without war, a world without Release but also without starvation, etc.) -- the choice is either here (with Sameness and no color) or Elsewhere (with pain and suffering).

When teaching the book, I also felt it was very important for students to understand how this heavy-handed moral (that most of us would agree with somewhat) demonstrates Lowry's (and our own) privilege. That is, the reason it's easy for us to say that Jonas' community is horrible is because of our own relatively privileged lives. If we lived in Darfur, were extremely impoverished, lived in a country where women were treated as property, etc., we may make a very different choice about Jonas' life.

Despite all of this, believe it or not, I did like The Giver. It's an enjoyable read. It had a great plot, the community was interesting, and the ending was fantastic and JUST a little ambiguous -- cool!

Jonas grows up in a community where everybody and everything are the same. The people do not have choices, everything is chosen for them. It is known in the community that once a child turns twelve, they are assigned to a job which they must start training for.

Once Jonas turns twelve he is assigned the position of the Receiver of Memories, the person who the Giver, the keeper of memories, gives memories of the past. But Jonas will struggle with many of the memories that he receives such as pain, starvation, pollution and war. Jonas will learn the secrets and sacrifices that were made to create his perfect community. He like the Receivers before him must decide if he can bare the tremendous responsibilities of being the next Giver. And if he can't he feels he must find a way to escape the community.

This is not a book I would normally read, but in saying that I thought it was a good read and quite entertaining. This is a book which I'm sure many have enjoyed and will continue to enjoy.The Giver by Lois Lowry is an entertaining young adult novel that also fits into the dystopian genre. 

Telling the story of Jonas in what must be a far future community where Sameness is the norm and emotions are watered down to the point of non-existence, though family members routinely discuss their feelings and dreams. 

Imaginative and creative, this still seems to be “dystopian light”. Nonetheless, this could be a good introduction for a young reader into the genre and is extremely well written for its audience.

I was a little creeped out when I first started reading this story. In fact, I almost didn't continue. It seemed like some kind of freaky propaganda for a fundamentalist society where everyone obeys without question and acts all fake nicey-nice and pretends everything is fine when it's not. I kept reading just to find out why the book is so popular. I really liked it once I found out what was going on. It's the opposite of what I thought at first. Conformity and uniformity are traps that rob us of life's riches. Jonas shows the courage it takes to step out of society's box of expectations and reach for something finer. For those who do, it's usually a lonely path. 

I'm very glad I didn't read any of the "anal"ytical reviews here until after I'd read the book. It's a young adult book, for crying out loud! These people who pick it apart and assign it all kinds of evil intent and religious meaning really should not read fiction---especially not teen fiction. Yeah, I could have picked it apart too, but my junior high self would not have done so, and I tried to read it in that spirit.

Another book I wouldn’t have read if not for becoming a teacher. This is a dystopia based on Plato’s Republic and I’m particularly fond of such dystopias. It is much the same as the film The Matrix in its own way (same philosophical roots) except this one focuses more on the dark side of Plato’s vision – where as the Matrix focuses much more on the obligations of the Philosopher Kings (those who know) to fix things.

It really surprises me that so many people write books that so clearly refer back to Plato’s allegory of the cave from The Republic. The main ideas being that you are the only person that comes to learn ‘the truth’ by being dragged very painfully out of a cave where you have spent your life in virtual darkness watching shadows on a screen. When you are first shown ‘reality’ the light is so bright it burns your eyes to near white blindness and the shapes and colours nearly blow your mind. But eventually you get over the pain (and there is always pain in learning) and come to see the world as it is. And then it is time to go back to where you came from and tell the people around you what you have learnt. 

And do you know what? If what you have learnt is important enough they are going to think you are nuts. Thus it is with the world, thus it will always be. 

Unlike some of the books I’ve read this year for young adults this one is actually really well written and about themes that I think are important and worth thinking about. Yes, yes, it is Brave New World re-written – but that’s fine too. A quick read but with lots of substance and it is always time to look at the infinitely dark side of Plato’s vision splendid. 
I do not plan to see the film starring Jeff Bridges and Meryl Streep.


Yeah, it was between ok and I liked it.

It is not unusual for a YA novel to be simply written, but I found The Giver to be too simply written. While reading I could see great potential but it fell flat for me. I found that there was a total lack of exploration of the characters and the community they were in. Such a great idea but no substance. I had to turn off my questioning mind because The Giver would not hold up to the scrutiny.

I have read novels before where I have had to do this as well, but the writing style etc made up for it.

I had to keep reminding myself it was written for YA. But what age is the target age for YA? I think of YA as starting around 15-16years old? I would think that age could handle something a bit meatier.

Or is YA for 13year olds? This is something that I could see my former 13year old self really enjoying and loving.

It was easy and quick to read. Entertaining enough. I'm going to watch the movie as it may be one of those rare times where I actually like the movie more than the book....
