Read with Lauren – Manic, frenetic, and idiosyncratic. The book flew by. Definitely more a series of magazine dispatches than a cohesive novel, but that’s fine by me. Hunter S. Thompson’s self-created genre is flippant in its disregard for substantive objectivity, which makes Fear and Loathing almost definitionally – proudly, even – a work that cannot faithfully transcend its cultural context. Having not lived through the zeitgeist in question, I’m not certain I could ever really “get” the true weight of the prose, but I feel like there’s at least a key to all the madness hidden in an absolutely gorgeous passage about San Francisco in the 1960s that spans pages 66-68 to close out chapter eight. It’s got to be up there with the final sequence of The Great Gatsby in my pantheon of memorable literary paragraphs. 
 
Hunter S. Thompson is one of the few writers I idolized as a teenager who still matters to me in any way at all. I can't even read Bukowski anymore, very few of the Beats, certainly not most of Ellis' output, and so on. Probably the transition, the moment of literary enlightenment, for me, was reading McCarthy's Blood Meridian, and encountering what literature at its absolute finest (which Blood Meridian approaches, in my estimation) can do, and also how it can confront the absolute depths of human ugliness but not emerge with a juvenile, lonely, seething nihilism, but instead a comprehension of evil. 

The reason I can still read Hunter S. Thompson and really enjoy it is that his writing has many of the same features that attracted me to the writers and styles mentioned above, but Thompson also possessed a keen satirical mind, and an incredible ability to write the absolutely tragic and horrific in fun terms, without in any way glamorizing that kinda stuff, or lessening its importance. Thompson gets drugs, he gets counterculture, and so his commentary on those, though now perhaps of historical interest, is also still relevant to today's culture. And Thompson's exposition of the vapidity of the American dream is still effective. 

The film is probably a better film than this is a book. Gilliam is an exceptional director. Thompson is a pretty good writer, with a high quotient of beatitude and hipness. Both are worthwhile experiences. The movie is trippier than the book, and also probably more superficial, less contemplative, although honestly I think Gilliam might have been onto something there that Thompson wasn't onto. Thompson points to the book's themes repeatedly, consistently. He interrupts the narrative to do so, so you're never fully absorbed into the world of this bender. While the American dream, the flag, etc pop up in the movie, and much of the stuff I just mentioned is also spoken by Depp in the movie, at the same points, Gilliam allows those moments to occur without paying them special attention, while doing probably more interesting things with the compositions on screen. What that leads to is the absolute gut punch of the film's ending, with that spiraling zoom out of the shot of Duke on his typewriter lamenting a generation of permanent cripples, "Jumpin' Jack Flash"'s chords ringing out, and then Duke driving down the highway as he leaves Fear and Loathing, population 0. Because Thompson's narrative, for all its wildness, is conventional relative to Gilliam's handling of it, it's also not entirely as effective. 

But, again, both are worthwhile experiences.
