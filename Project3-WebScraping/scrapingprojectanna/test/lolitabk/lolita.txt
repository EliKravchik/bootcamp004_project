An old friend used to say that "Ulysses" was a good book to read but not a good book to "read". After reading "Lolita" I understand what he meant.

Nabokov was a man obsessed with word games and this book is crammed cover to cover with many brilliant examples. Language delighted the man and that certainly comes across. What makes this acheivement even more amazing was that English was his third or fourth language. It is mind blowing that he or anyone could write so fluidly in a "foreign" tongue. If this was enough to make a novel great then this would be one of my top ten.

But what if, as a reader, you demand that an author make his characters compelling and the narrative involving? I would say then that this book is not for you. Humbert and Dolores Haze (Lolita) only ever (to my mind) become three dimensional at odd moments here and there. He comes off as a mincing, foppish but ultimately unbelievable sort. I never bought into him until very near the end when for a few sentences Nabokov makes his remorse credible. But it is too late for that. I was already annoyed as hell by his rococo narration. The character of Lolita as well is shrill and one note through out. Only intermittently does she come across as worthy of compassion. 

As for the story, once the seduction takes place it loses a lot of its forward momentum. It begins to feel repetitive and only comes alive again when Humbert reaches the very end of his self control and attempts to lash out at one he believes wronged him. All in all I think this is a book that could stand to lose about fifty pages. 

There is much to love about it though. It could have been truly replusive. Nabokov knew that his concept was already off putting and that the execution need not be so. Rather than serving up spewing fluids and hungry orifices he treats us to healthy doses of wit and charm. Bravo!

"Lolita" is obviously literature with a capital "L." It is a work by a man of letters who happened to be a genius - for that reason alone it deserves reading. Just don't be surprised that once you're done you don't feel like recommending it to anyone.

This novel is bleak and disturbing. The only way I got through it is because I was listening to Jeremy Irons perform it, and he was amazing as Humbert. Yes, the book is clever and well-written, but the story is so sad I never want to read it again.

Update
I got so depressed reading this book (I was thinking about how damaged the poor girl would be, about what a monster Humbert was, and even the sadness of his acknowledgement that his attraction to the nymphets was so fleeting that he dreaded the girls getting older), and my husband shared with me an article he found on the true case that inspired Nabokov to write Lolita. Reading the article made me appreciate Nabokov more, but I still don't love the novel. 


I am so torn, I abhor this book.

Lolita is the story of a manâ€™s obsession with and ultimate sexual abuse of a twelve year old girl. Reading about this depravity from the perspective of the primary care giver of the child is extremely uncomfortable to say the least.

Still the prose is sumptuous, the story is peppered with humour and there are tasty treats for the tongue to trip over. 

Language and humour aside this was an exceedingly difficult story for me to read and even as I say that, I know it is because it is so convincing, so plausible. I had to walk away often and came back reluctantly each time, cause for me, once started on this journey with Humbert, there was no turning back that I could see. No, I had to see where Nabokov would take this. 

I think about the popularity a controversial novel such as this would enjoy, I think about voyeurs, I remember a conversation with my daughter, about continuing something one is clearly not enjoying. I remember that knowledge is power and two is less lonely than one. I struggle.

I am a wreck and I am giving it 3 stars and shelving it.
