This entertaining romp through the absurd is mildly reminiscent of the absurdity of a Monty Python sketch. There is plenty of dry and absurd humour for the British humour enthusiast. If British humour is not your cup of tea *pun alert* then you will want to skip this one. This hardly needs another lengthy review so I will avoid the temptation and will keep it short.

This silly story of Arthur Dent and his secretly alien friend, Ford, escape earth moments before it is destroy to make way for a galactic bypass. There is plenty of idiotic banter with humour arising when characters state the obvious. While the story is funny and the writing sharp, it fails to have the coherence of say a Monty Python movie (I am a bit biased in favor the MP) as it often finds humour in the creation of absurd non realities as opposed to satire.

That said, much of the ridiculous humour has an intelligent basis. Whether or not the crazy ideas in the story have a basis in scientific fact, it manages to give the impression that it could be based loosely on scientific principle. Additionally, while some humour is silly some humour is dense and requires concentration. When I notice it, it makes me feel highly evolved and inflates sense of heightened intellect. If you didn't find this funny, you were simply to dense to understand the humour :)

I understand that this was first a radio program. The pacing and tone of the story makes it suited for the audiobook format. In this case Stephan Fry does an admirable job narrating but imagine a radio production would be even better.

I liked it but did not love it. I am sure I will read the next in the series but I won't be starting it immediately.

Remarkably enough, I had never read this book. I found it a light read, went by very quickly and was quite funny in places. Marvin the Paranoid Android, the Improbability Drive, Vogon Poetry, they were all pretty funny, but they were also all pretty one-note, and after a while the satirical humor so beloved by so many fans began to wear on me. It made for a fun book but I guess it's just not my kind of humor; it wasn't laugh-out-loud funny to me, and since in the years since there's been much better humor done in popular genre fiction, I am not sure I want to read the rest of Adams's "trilogy in four parts."

The premise is typical British humor: Arthur Dent is a hapless Everyman who gets yanked into an improbable situation, in this case, narrowly escaping the Earth's destruction. Taken aboard a Vogon space cruiser along with his friend Ford Prefect, who turns out to have been a Betelgeusian stranded on Earth for the past fifteen years, he and Ford escape from the Vogons and are rescued by Zaphod Beeblebrox, former President of the Galaxy now on the run for stealing a spaceship known as the Heart of Gold. Zaphod's girlfriend happens to be another Earthling whom Arthur met and unsuccessfully tried to chat up at a cocktail party years ago.

You can see how all the absurdities just pile up, and that's only the first few chapters. Adams makes them work in a surprisingly well-plotted novel, which is what kept me from rolling my eyes and tossing the book once I got tired of all the silliness. In the end, all the little details and clues are tied together in a surprisingly successful manner, proving that Adams could actually write. So the book isn't just one long comedy sketch. It's a comedy sketch with a plot.

The characters and the ideas Adams created in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy are so memorable they have become part of the cultural firmament. Millions more people have probably heard of Yahoo!'s Babel Fish than know where the name came from. I really wish I could say I'm a fan and fell in love with this book, but the humor alone would only rate 2 stars from me. I am bumping it up to 3 stars for being a quick, entertaining read with a well-crafted story, but I liked it without loving it. Certainly worth reading to fill in that gap in your pop-culture education, but it just isn't the great book of brilliant hilarity I've heard it described as.
