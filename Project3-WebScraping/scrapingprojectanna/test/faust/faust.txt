Student Hey Professor  I could use a hand I just read a play I didn t understand Professor And what was this play  pray Student Faust  the one you assigned the other day I simply can t wrap my mind around it I read it carefully  but I am left confounded Professor I have  alas  studied philosophy Literature  history  and poetry I have some time that I can set aside So I will do my best to be your guide Student Gosh  thanks  So where should I start I suppose at the most conspicuous part The language  it was strangely various Both in style and quality  it was multifarious One moment  it is regal and poetic Other moments it is hasty and frenetic Doggerel alternates with highfalutin At times colossal  at others Lilliputian Professor Perhaps the translation was abysmal Student Actually  I read the German original Professor Ah  I see  please go on Student I hope you won t think I m a moron But I also thought the drama lacking Even though Faust does all this yackingAbout his tortured soul  his weary spirit I found his actions downright incoherent He alternately scorns the world and yearns  For what  What does he wish to learn Although supposedly full of all these riddles I found him a bit superficial In short  it s hard to care about his fate When all he does is whine and prate Professor What about Mephistopheles Student With him  I was somewhat more pleased He has at least a bit of spice His naughtiness is rather nice Professor And how did you like the plot Student That actually perplexed me a lot For one  it s not a tragedy Since the play ends happily And what was with Walpurgis Night Yes it was fun  but it didn t seem rightTo interrupt the action so severely So pointlessly and cavalierly Some critics admire that scene   it s po mo  They say  but I say  Oh  no  And what was with Valentine He sticks around for just one scene And if I am to be concise He struck me as a plot device To be honest  from what I gleaned I can t tell why this is so esteemed It was nice and all  but I find it queer That Goethe is compared with Shakespeare Professor I can understand the plight you re in It s hard to know where to begin Goethe is a slippery fellow Reading him is like juggling jello He was a touch mercurial Often brilliant  occasionally dull He was a dabbler through and throughThere wasn t anything he wouldn t do Or at least try  which is partly whyThe language goes from low to high Student Certainly he was heterogeneous But why do you think he was a genius Professor In some ways he was like Faust He studied all  and all renounced He was skeptical of all modes of thought And found faults in everything he sought His distrust of tidinessIs why the play is such a mess If reality is in disarray So shouldn t be his play Student This strikes me as just an excuse Professor Everyone is entitled to their views Yet consider Goethe s sophistication In him there is no mystification In renouncing reason  he does not turn To superstition  but instead learnsTo spread his mind in all directions At once seeking  through reflection To transcend all worldly views While remaining coarse and worldly  too His wisdom soars above  and crawls below It is both cheap and tawdry  and it glowsAnd grows  expanding ever and anon  Here one moment  in another  gone He was  in short  a universal man Easy to admire  hard to understand Student So was he Faust or Mephisto Professor He was both  he was both  view spoiler  I highly recommend Kaufmann s edition  It has the original German  and his fine translation  which I frequently had to turn to for help  on the facing pages  Plus  he includes a finely written  if a bit fawning  introduction   hide spoiler    lry   fy fwst Gwth hy hdhh llG  l Sy   l  lwSfhdh lsHr lnb  mn flsfthwhdhh ltSwyr lbr   lty Hyrt  qwl  jyl

a private library cubicle  evenings working as a bartender at the college s pub  nights writing at my desk or reading abed  The primary bedtime books that year were the Kepler  in Latin and English   The Jerusalem Bible and Goethe s Faust  Faust was read aloud  partly because the translation was beautiful  partly because Part Two was so boring that reading it this way was necessary in order to stay awake  This method kept me immersed in Faust for months  That  the contemporaneous immersion in the bible  and the extensive study of German philosophy during the day encouraged a certain earnest purposiveness  I felt like Faust I had two girlfriends that senior year  The first  a resident of our off campus project house  Susan  left school for NYC before the second semester  The second  Janny  stayed with me through the move to New York after graduation  Susan was a Gretchen like figure who would sleep beside me as I read into the wee hours  Janny was even more Faustian than I  Rather than being libidinously distracted from work  the presence of these two women  each in different ways  encouraged it  Except for the months between the first semester and meeting Janny towards the end of the second  I was not yearning for love or thinking about romantic relationships except in a sublimated  religio philosophical vein  Indeed  even during those intervening months  the one erotic interest that arose was treated as something more world historical than personal  the object of my interest  Mindy  never knowing of it  That was intentional  I thought myself beyond such quotidian concerns and intended the sublimation  thinking of it in the terms of medieval alchemical spiritualism  This self inflation led  ultimately  to a protacted experience of the demonic  to concrete hallucinations which terrified me  popped the bubble and circumvented any possible deals with the devil In retrospect  the whole year was one of the best of my life and that was because of sedulous work and the grace of two women  fwst hw l lm l wwb  f   Sr l ntql ldh  wthb b wrwb lwthbh l khyrh mn trykhh mn l Swr lwsT  l  l Sr lHdythf  Hyn tnwl lkthyr mn lktb l njlyz wl lmn sTwr  ldktwr fwst

stjd b D mnk byn lsTwr  O Fausto de Goethe apenas conserva algumas caracteristicas exteriores da famosa personagem renascentista  Em compensacao  a sua personagem assume novas caracteristicas  tais como a insatisfacao e a inquietacao tipica do homem moderno  perturbado por uma crise de desconfianca face a ciencia e a razao  De nada serviram a Fausto os longos anos de estudo  nem os seus profundos conhecimentos de filosofia  de jurisprudencia  de medicina e ate mesmo de teologia  Tao pouco a experiencia de dez anos de esforcado ensino lhe lancou uma restia de luz sobre o misterio da vida  E este o dramatico sentimento que atormenta o espirito do estudioso por toda a obra   uma desilusao intensa e insuportavel  que nao se extingue na humana resignacao de nao ter conseguido achar uma explicacao valida para o misterio da vida Mas o homem que Fausto e nao pode declarar se vencido  Agarra se desesperadamente a unica saida que vislumbra e que nunca quis utilizar  a da arte magica  na esperanca de conhecer  quanto mais nao seja daquela forma    os segredos que o mundo sustentam no seu amago mais fundo    Mesmo depois de pactuar com o Diabo  vendendo lhe a alma  Fausto tem consciencia do seu proprio destino  da sua propria dimensao e trata o tentador como um superior trata um inferior  quase com desprezo  exigindo lhe apenas as vantagens materiais que o outro lhe pode proporcionarA ideia que fica e a de que Fausto e uma especie de Prometeu moderno  heroi de uma humanidade que se revolta e reivindica o direito de se auto determinar  Nele reconhecemos um dos grandes precursores do homem moderno  que consagra a sua vida ao trabalho  a accao  ao servico dos outros  My immediate impression upon first reading Faust was   Wow  this is Scandinavian death metal without the deafening noise   In other words  Faust is the coolest thing ever  As I continued reading  I was struck by the liveliness of the poetry  Faust isn t words sitting static on a page  but a living thing  thanks to Goethe s ability to vary his rhythms and rhyme schemes to convey different moods  characters and atmospheres  The language is dynamic  artful and often brilliant Oddly  Faust reminds me of the sitcom Community s tendency to use pop culture references  Faust s second part in particular makes reference to the pop culture icons of Goethe s time  Liberal references to Greek mythology  Shakespeare  Lord Byron  the Bible and others are sprinkled throughout  One passage even reminded me of the theme song from Laverne and Shirley  I rated Faust four stars because the second part in particular is filled with long digressions that are hard to follow  laced as they are with references that are no longer common  or at least unfamiliar to me  Certainly  I could acknowledge my own ignorance and give Goethe his full due  but I m a man and that means I have a frail ego to protect  Hence my taking of one star from what is otherwise an enjoyable and masterful creation    Gewohnlich glaubt der Mensch  wenn er nur Worte hort Es musse sich dabei doch auch was denken lassen  Gilt dies auch fur den zweiten Teil der Faust Tragodie  so liesse sich mit ein wenig Bosheit fragen  doch da ich den Alten von Zeit zu Zeit gern lese  was aber auch fur Karl May gilt  und da er mir  im Deutschunterricht meiner Jugend oftmals des trocknen Tons satt  die Augen fur die Majestat unserer Sprache geoffnet hat   was man von Karl May nicht gerade sagen kann   und mir mit der Kuhnheit seiner Gedanken nicht selten den Atem benahm   so habe ich freiwillig   Prometheus     Der untreue Knabe  und   Totentanz   letzteres auch in der Version von Iron Maiden  auswendig gelernt   bin ich geneigt anzunehmen  dass ich einfach noch nicht so weit bin  dem Zweiten Teil wirklich zu verstehen  Oder  um aus   Seinfeld  zu zitieren  Goethe   it s not you   it s me  Deshalb werde ich mich hier denn allein auf den ersten Teil der Tragodie konzentrieren  in dem Goethe den volkstumlichen Faust Stoff aufgriff und dem Protagonisten  noch deutlicher als Christopher Marlowe dies tut  auch positive Zuge angedeihen lasst und die in der Sage mitschwingende moralisierende Mahnung zu einem gottesfurchtigen  kirchenkonformen Leben abschwacht  Was ist es eigentlich  das Faust vom Leben verlangt  Zunachst gewinnt man den Eindruck  er sei auf der Suche nach dem Wissen hinter den Dingen  unzufrieden mit den Antworten  die die verschiendenen Wissenschaftsdisziplinen fur den nach Erkenntnis Strebenden bereithalten  unzufrieden auch mit den Grenzen menschlicher Erkenntnis   wer denkt da nicht an Faustens spottische Worte uber den   Geist der Zeiten  zu einer Zeit  in der Ranke der Geschichtswissenschaft die Aufgabe zumass  herauszufinden    wie es eigentlich gewesen ist    und darum bemuht  das zu verstehen    was die Welt im Innersten zusammenhalt   Einerseits stellt dieser Faust die Traditionen und Erkenntnismodelle der verschiedenen Wissenschaften auf diese Weise in Frage  doch andererseits ist er mit seiner Annahme  es musse doch eine letzte Erkenntnis vom ureigenen Wesen der Welt moglich sein  auch unendlich naiv  Diese Naivitat  gepaart mit einem geruttelt Mass an Arroganz   man denke nur an Faustens Versuch  mit dem Erdgeist von Du auf Du zu plaudern    macht diesen strebenden Menschen zu einem gefundenen Fressen fur den Teufel  der in ihm auch den Wunsch wachruft  das Leben aus der Erfahrung und dem Erleben heraus kennenzulernen  Faust ist eben doch nur ein Romantiker  und auch Mephistopheles ist letzten Endes nur ein Werkzeug des gottlichen Plans  wie der Prolog im Himmel gleich anfangs verdeutlicht  Und ganz gewiss ist Goethes Faust kein Caveat vor der Wissenschaft  denn schliesslich sagt Mephistopheles selbst  Verachte nur Vernunft und Wissenschaft Des Menschen allerhochste Kraft Lass nur in Blend  und ZauberwerkenDich von dem Lugengeist bestarken So hab ich dich schon unbedingt   Ihm hat das Schicksal einen Geist gegeben Der ungebandigt immer vorwartsdringtUnd dessen ubereiltes StrebenDer Erde Freuden uberspringt  Solange der Mensch strebt   nach Wissen  nach Vernunft und auch nach massvoll genossener Erfahrung    braucht er  so will es scheinen  die ewige Verdammnis nicht zu befurchten  Hiermit gibt Goethe dem Stoff eine viel fortschrittlichere  aufgeklartere und optimistischere Lesart  als die traditionelle Faust Legenden Adaptation dies tat  Uberhaupt spricht Goethes Mephistopheles viel haufiger Wahrheiten aus  als man dies dem Fursten der Luge wohl zutrauen mochte   und dies ist nur folgerichtig  denn jemand  dessen Ruf so ruiniert ist wie der des Mephistopheles  braucht eben kein Blatt mehr vor den Mund zu nehmen Allerdings lenkt Mephistopheles den Erlebnishunger Faustens dann weidlich in zerstorerische Bahnen  wovon die tragische Geschichte Margaretens kundet  deren gesamte Familie dem Egoismus unseres Helden   wenn er denn einer ist   zum Opfer fallt  Und hiermit waren wir denn auch schon bei der faszinierenden Frage  die den gesamten ersten  und wahrscheinlich auch den zweiten  Teil des Werkes durchzieht  namlich der  ob der Mensch fur die fast grenzenlose Freiheit  die sein Geist gebiert  gemacht sei  haben es doch gemeinhin Bauch und Gemacht schwer  den oft hehren Vorstellungen des Geistes zu folgen  sondern zwingen ihn vielmehr fur gewohnlich  fur den ihnen eigenen Appetit und die Massnahmen  die notig sind  ihn zu befriedigen  moglichst wohlklingende Entschuldigungen zu finden  Goethes Antwort auf diese Frage ist von Optimismus gepragt Abgesehen von der gedanklichen Kuhnheit des Goethe schen Faust Stoffes ist der Text auch sprachlich uberwaltigend  und viele Passagen haben als Zitate ihr Eigenleben entwickelt  womit Goethes Faust auf einer Stufe mit der Bibel  dem Werk Shakespeares und dem Film The Big Lebowski steht Einzig als dramatischer Text ist Faust eine herbe Enttauschung  denn wenn Goethe auch ein genialer Dichter war  so taugte er als Dramatiker doch ungleich weniger  wie man an der nicht enden wollenden Exposition  der mangelhaften Entwicklung des Konflikts  mehreren dramatisch uberflussigen Szenen   ich denke nur an das Geplankel in Auerbachs Keller   und dem uberhasteten Ende sieht  Den Faust sollte man eher als ein episches Gedicht denn als ein Drama lesen  und vielleicht sollte man sich dabei auch bedauernd fragen  was ein Shakespeare aus diesem Stoff gemacht hatte  Eine Frage  die sich Goethe ganz sicher auch gestellt hat  gehort doch seine Shakespeare Verehrung zu des Meisters sympathischeren Charakterzugen  Goethe was introduced to me as the Shakespeare of Germany  and that seems an apt comparison to me  based on this one singular experience I have had with him  As with Shakespeare  Goethe sculpts a familiar story into an original  humorous and modern feeling   modern  in this case referring to 19th Century Germany  play  It is a crowd pleaser with live poodles  actors in monkey costumes  blasphemous humor  illicit sex and one suave Mephistopheles  but it is also treasure trove of social commentary  much of which derives from the same sources as the pleasure and intrigue  The poodle embodies evil  which from afar masquerades as fluffy companionship  the men in monkey suits  lackeys to witches and the devil  could be stand ins for men  clergy   who stupidly follow evil leaders  popes    the blasphemous humor  most of which is attributed to Mephistopheles  highlights the contraditions and shortcomings of religious practice  the illicit sex  which Faust has with Gretchen  reveals society s double standard for men versus women who commit romantic transgressions  and Mephistopheles  well      It s easy to say you ll thumb your nose at the Devil  but when he stands on your doorstep  looking not so scary and evil after all  when he promises you exactly what you ve always wanted    An important and required read for anyone who thinks they know European literature  Hyna tqr  fwst l tstTy   n tkuf  n lt

doubt he was done when he died  Part II was published posthumously in 1832  it had his  uh  prehumous approval  but that doesn t mean he wouldn t have been happy to spend another ten years tweaking it  To call it an exploration of the Faust myth seems almost like an insult  it s more the distillation of everything he knew and believed  framed loosely by Faust   And I do mean loosely  That s undoubtedly part of why it s so complicated  It abruptly switches scenes  themes  tone and meter  sometimes I was halfway through a scene before I even figured out what was going on  It s one of the few works where  at the halfway mark  I was already imagining what it would be like when I read it again  That s a way of saying I didn t get it  and I didn t get it  at least not fully  Hell  it s the entire life of one of our greatest thinkers  I m not ashamed to admit it  It s also a way of saying that I m not sure I picked the right translation  I have nothing to compare it to  but Atkins  felt matter of fact   plodding   unpoetic  As well  the endnotes and introduction were cursory   fwHzny  n lys lljsm km llrwH  jnH  yHlq bh fy jw lsm    l   n fy Tb  lmr TmwH dy mydf h l  l ly w l  l

fault of any poems or lyrical prose that I read  I did find that even though I had the same problem this time  I still enjoyed Faust  This translation was especially good  I found that even though it is a tragedy  there were quite a few comedic parts  Mephisto can be quite funny when he is tricking characters in the play  I especially enjoyed his conversation with the student who wanted to find a teacher  Mephisto suggested he go into medicine  Overall  it was enjoyable to read even though I had to stop myself from reading it without enough care  A note  This is only part 1  There is a second part  which was not included in this version  However  this is the portion which is most often used in theater  I have also read a little on the side about the work and this version does differ slightly from the very original version of the work  This was enthusiastically approved by Goethe s fans  Which makes me think that public opinion was important even in the late 18th and early 19th centuries   km mn l lm qd SHbny fy tlk lqS   lmsrHy blt kyd nHn nHsb l ml l dby bmqdr m wjdn mn jmlyt w Swran khlb  wfkr  llkn lHqyq  l ml lHqyqy hw m nt thr bh f lyann hdh lqS  tdf k lltfkyr fy kl

attention I was able to give it during the term  I know there was a lot of substance that I missed  and I would enjoy an opportunity to actually study it I didn t have much background prior to starting  other than the vague understanding of the Faust legend one can t help but acquiring in Western culture  I was therefore somewhat surprised by Part I  which read more like a comedy than a tragedy in style and structure  While it was rather amusing  it seemed to lack some of the literary  weight  I was expecting Part II  on the other hand  had more literary weight than you could shake a stick at  Overall  I preferred Part II  I think that may be due to its being written largely in the style of Greek tragedy and Shakespeare  and therefore feeling more familiar Partly due to the very piecemeal way in which I read it  I found the most memorable aspect to be the language itself  which at times is nothing short of exquisite  I also have an incredible appreciation for the translation  Not having read the original German  I have to take it on faith that the sense was preserved  But it was apparent that the rhyme and meter matched the original  which seems to be an amazing feat As a footnote  I had some of the same issues with the Norton Critical Edition as I have had with their editions of Shakespeare  There is a great abundance of footnotes and endnotes  some of which are useful and insightful  many more of which I just wasn t particularly interested in   Having just read Part I in a dual translation  I thought I d take on both parts in German while it was still fresh  Got through Part I fairly quickly  Then hit Part II  Apparently it s famously dense and complicated  even for native German speakers  Oof  I was helped somewhat by a good familiarity with classical myth  A lot of Part II is built on Greek mythology  including the Trojan War and the Odyssey  Faust meets Helen and falls in love  and this is ultimately what saves him from damnation  At first that seemed like sort of a cheap trick  because after all he s only in love with her for the superficial reason that she s the most beautiful woman in the world  but Goethe is smart enough to demonstrate that Faust learns compassion from her and acts from decent motives towards others  I won t claim that I understood it all  but I managed to follow and I must agree that it s a classic of world literature  I ll probably return to it again  if I ever have time to improve my German  Faust Part One is not a particularly difficult read  something contributed to by it s brevity  simplicity of language  and small world setting  In fact the poetic epic is a pure delight to read  and a lesson in the dangers of selfishness  thoughtlessness  and consequence as well as showing us that for all the Devil s pomp and parley none is better at damning the soul of man than man himself Faust Part Two is quite a contrast to it s prequel  being both longer and considerably more obtuse  In Part Two Faust enters into the worlds of politics  mythology  war  and nature  To fully understand and enjoy Part Two you will definately need a good knowledge of Greek mythology  as well as probably some determination to plough through the more verbose sections   Un libro muy interesante  Si bien es un referente del Romanticismo y trata sobre un anciano intelectual que hace un pacto con el diablo  la historia que cuenta no me inspiro angustia ni miedo  ya que hay en ella ribetes de humor    Okey  el demonio no es para nada antipatico  De hecho  Fausto  el protagonista  es el mas inquietante de ambos  para que se formen una idea de que tan simpatico es Mefistofeles  el ser diabolico   Punteo la obra con tres estrellas solo porque al principio es inteligible y luego se torna confusa  al menos  para mi   Ademas  porque me hizo recordar al Infierno  de Dante Alighieri  y este libro no me gusto tanto  chndmyn br khwndn fwst z ldht hy wn khh khm nmykhnh hych bshdt bh mwDw ty khh pysh z yn gng

for now too  It was a thought provoking book  The author threw in just about everything but the kitchen sink into these two plays that start off with the story of the medieval academic who strikes a bargain with the devil  and then take off from there in a wild variety of moods and meters  The author  remembering a puppet play that he saw as a child  sketched out a prose drama based on the legend in 1776  But did not publish it  instead he reworked it into 12 110 lines of verse over the next sixty years  Part I was first performed in 1829 to celebrate his eightieth birthday  Part II was published posthumously in 1832  He borrows material  verse forms  and even characters from German ballads  plays by Aristophanes  Euripides  and Shakespeare  Mozart s operas  Herodotus s History  Ovid s Metamorphoses Italian renaissance painting and sculpture  economic ideas about paper money  and early 19th century theories of mountain creation  to name but a few of his sources It was hard for me to imagine this work on stage with its sudden shifts of scene  material  and mood  and long sections of plays within the plays as anything but lumpy gravy  i e   an often tedious experience for the theater goer  However  he left a feast for scholars and interpreters  I read the Norton Critical edition  second edition  over half of which was interpretive notes  charts  illustrations  and literary criticism  Whew  It often felt more like a mountain climb than reading a play  Great poetry  but I m giving it one star off for obscurity  Faust by Johann Wolfgang GoetheDas Ewig WeiblicheMy whole life may have been encircled by two important references  at least in one important area of relationships One would be at the end of Faust   The eternal feminine  the power of women to inspire and spiritualize mankind The other comes from Shakespeare s Hamlet   Frailty thy name is woman But Aristotle said that truth is in the middle and the conclusion would be that women  like men are neither frail nor eternal and sublime  But they can be  At times The myth of the scholar who makes a deal with Mephistopheles is not only well known  but used by a number of writers  like Turgenev for instance Goethe is not just the best known  but his Faust has entered the most precious vault  with the best books ever written The Guardian has published a list of the best 100 works of literature ever published  compiled by scholars and critics and Faust is included The contract sounds very good  and as an agnostic I would have no qualms about signing it  since I do not practice any religion  go to no church and obey no commandments  I am going to hell anyway What would be the difference between genie in Aladdin s lamp and Beelzebub They both do whatever is asked of them  once the contract is signed The only  dangerous  provision is that once Faust asks for the moment to stay he belongs to the devil There are interesting things that one can do with supernatural  if evil powers  Faust can fly  in an age when flying was impossible I would say that even in the present  flying with  own means  would be very pleasant  I dream that I just lift from the ground and fly away and it is extraordinary even in my sleep  in  reality   it would be tremendous I enjoyed even the humor that is not everywhere in the play  but at the moment when a witch does not recognize Beelzebub I smiled  The devil says    I am your master  you do not know me  Well   some things are absent  There are no crowns  or ghosts  but they are not in fashion anymore    Words not that effect  for this is not a quote It is a paradox that I used so much the final quote from Faust  since I did not really like the play  But I have always loved women and found the final message fabulous  Das Ewig Weibliche  It is elating to read about the eternal feminine that will make us grow wings  However  when I mentioned this to the first nice German girl that I met  she was puzzled and did not know what to make of it We then entered a discussion from where I gathered that either she was right in saying that they have different dialects  the literary language is not what they generally speak  But there is a possibility that she did not read Faust  and I was the one to explain about how it ends  what a great ode the finale is to all women  including her   The effect was Instant enrapture It was great to talk about a German masterpiece and kind of explain  at least part of it  the most important in the context  to a German  It should have been the other way around Thank you Goethe for the conquest made possible by your work   Oh    I forgot about the literary pleasure In isolated episodes  the poetry of Goethe s Faust is often splendid  but the scenes are not very well integrated into a coherent whole  The author reworked this long poem throughout most of his life  during which time he changed his perspective many times  and the result  in my opinion  is a lack of spontaneity  Critics who wish to explain the work seem to be constantly driven to the extremes of minute exegesis of details and broad platitudes about things like  wholeness  and  humanity   The work is also flawed by self consciousness  since it was obviously written to be a  masterpiece   The author seems to have been thinking too much about his place in the literary canon and not enough about what he actually wanted to say  The apotheosis at the end  especially  seems to be sort of  tacked on   and rather resembles a baroque ceiling by an artist such as Tiepolo  with its eclectic collection of mythological and religious characters  Nevertheless  I have rated the work a four  in recognition of its numerous passages of fine poetry and its cultural significance   Very interesting and very weird at times  You are plunged in an esoteric world where witches materialize from fumes and red mouses come out of beautiful women s mouths  Oh and let s not forget the devil and death being everywhere  Although  I had troubled getting into it at first  Once you hit the second part  also known as  Margaret s tragedy   it is quite the page turner and makes for a good read A play like no other  I have no idea how people managed to present this play on the stage    mjhwd ry   bdhl mn lmtrjm fy lnskh  dy tHdyd lnql lm ny blshkl ldqyq dh lly  zl tqryb Hjz llG  fy lktb  The famous story of Faust is known to many   let s make a deal  with the devil  There are many interesting subplots in Faust s famous story  References to alchemy and science  literature  the Bible  and mythology   all are perhaps symbolic of Goethe s personal philosophical struggles  Romanticism  Classicism  Christian philosophies   There seems to be almost Dante like descent into depravity within the plot  Starting with a Job like pact between the devil and God  the deception begins  There are many Biblical references in both parts  however this is not considered to be a Christian novel  Rather Goethe seems to take pride in ridiculing the doctrines of the church  especially religious leaders  Rather the redemption of Faust seems to have more to do with atonement through man s striving   All that is transitory is only a symbol  what seems unachievable here is seen done  what s indescribable here becomes fact  Woman  eternally  shows us the way   lnsn wlshyTn  hl hm Sdyqn  m  dwn   Hlyfn  m Grymn

un stageable scenes and to many endless monologues for it to work as a stage play  Of course  I am talking out of pure ignorance  as I have done no research on work so it is entirely possible Goethe wrote it with performance as its primary purpose  However  it seems more likely that in the same way way that The Sorrows of Young Werther is an epistlatory novel  Faust is a dramatic novel  The tone of the work is all over the map  It has lengthy philosophical discourses followed by frankly very sexual romps  It is a book that really should be read as it seems to carry hints of so many ideas and concepts that are still in formation  Furthermore  it is just enjoyable  This is not just a case of an important book  not a good book   it s both  I like this translation and I love the fact that it printed the German alongside  My limited German felt the translator respected the originally while avoiding merely translating word for word the text  He stuck rather slavishly to the rhyme scheme which I was of two minds about  The rhyming kept the book flowing as I am sure it does in German but it did at times lead to some ridiculous sentences and words  I really don t think there is such thing as a perfect translation  especially of a piece that it is verse  but I think this one does a fine job  ykfyn   n   rf  n fwst knt  Hd  hm qrt l Zym frnz kfk w nh knt  ndh mn   Zm l  ml l dby  w

a stew of various metaphysical themes and concerns wrapped around an old German Myth  His take on the devil as an at times oddly lax  cosmopolitan wheeler and dealer is very original  I don t think I really dug it the way I ve enjoyed a lot of the German literature which Goethe served as the foundation for  but its still an enjoyable  deeply weird read   wl qr  l jwth    mbdy yan trjm  l sh r

thmh lmkhtlf      El  Fausto  de Goethe es de lejos mejor que otras versiones  Si creo lamentablemente que hay una diferencia grande entre la primera y segunda parte que fueron escritas en tiempos diferentes  y que ademas ambas versiones sufrieron muchas transformaciones del propio Goethe La primera parte de lejos es la mejor  los monologos de Fausto son muy sinceros y profundos  el ha estudiado muchas ramas de la ciencia pero aun asi no logra apagar el fuego de sus ansias irrefrenables de un conocimiento mayor  Mefistofeles se le aparece y comienza su larga duracion de corrompimiento   complicidad  Esta version no suele ser tan apocaliptica ni fatalista como la de MArlowe  Fausto parece congeniar incluso con Mefistofeles  y creo que este a pesar de todo es hecho de un caracter un poco divertido y renegon  lo que hace observar o creer una relacion mas real y humana  Fausto en efecto  sobre todo en la primera parte se emociona por cada prodigio y es la pieza mas interesante en ese aspecto  del efecto que tiene en Fausto el contemplar nuevas maravillas y amores antes imposibles para el Aqui aparece Margarita quien no solo simboliza el amor  sino tambien la ternura  la inocencia  el castigo y la tragedia  Creo que ella hace de la pieza mas humana y trastorna el dolor de Fausto en algo mas que solo el temor al infierno o a lo impio sino tambien a la gran culpa de haber manchado un alma tan pura La segunda parte en cambio se hace mucho mas lenta y nos presenta a un Fausto ya no sorprendido con sus proezas sino mas bien un poco aburrido y las intervenciones que tiene incluso con Helena pierden su encanto y brillo  Ademas Goethe introduce muchos personajes  muchos de los cuales parecen perderse ante el hilo de la historia a diferencia de la primera parte Si tendria que ser justo la primera merece 5 estrellas  pero la segunda 3 o 4 Es en conjunto una obra muy excelente por la calidad de los dialogos y monologos  por la profundidad de sus parlamentos y por lo comun de los deseos y pecados humanos que se relatan  es una obra que abarca mucho mas que una simple tradicion alemana  convirtiendose en algo universal    This translation does not include Act Two  Three  or Four of the second part  Goethe s version of the story of the Faust figure  in my opinion  is pretty fantastic  I didn t like the translation  otherwise  I probably would have given this 5 stars   its constant rhymes simplified the story even though it was meant to reflect the funny nature of Goethe s writing  The conflicts and themes in the book were clear yet complex  Faust  a highly learned scholar is unsatisfied with the worthlessness of his knowledge  He therefore calls the devil to expose him to the natural world beyond just what texts can offer  Faust wants to experience pleasure but also pain because both happen in the world  The contrast between Mephistopheles and Faust reflects how Faust has a redeeming capacity for love  of Gretchen but also presumably of God at the end   for Mephistopheles never understands the difference between love and lust  Goethe gives good reason for Faust s redemption  man should strive and is bound to err sometimes  Faust certainly erred by conjuring Mephistopheles the devil  but he does not die in hell because he spends the last parts of his life serving others rather than himself Another fantastic aspect was the repetition of certain words characters say at the end that they had said earlier in the play  The meaning has changed and not only does it point to the concept prevalent then but it also shows how greatly the characters have changed  For example   rebirth  is used to reflect Faust when he conjures the devil but also when he dies and is saved Also  the characters are pretty great  Gretchen s struggle through the book was constantly interesting  how she changed so dramatically because of Faust and thus falls so drastically to certain actions she never would otherwise have done  I seem to love devil characters because their characteristics are so markedly wicked and opposite of everyone else s and it s interesting watching the sly process they take influencing others  I loved Milton s Satan in Paradise Lost and Comus in A Mask Presented at Ludlow Castle  1634  Mephistopheles in Faust had such corrupt morals and sneakily corrupted Faust  ah fwst lshy ystHq  n tfqd rwHk

pesadisimo de leer Claro esta que eso no da para demeritar  Siendo sucintos  Fausto es una parabola de las vicisitudes de la pasion humana  los limites del conocimiento y la lucha por el poder politico  Lo que me parecio mas rescatable  llegando a escandalizarme  es cierto choque ideologico que me  nos  produjo la lectura  Al final  Goethe te explica sin ambages por que es una virtud lo que el maneja como tal y a uno que es latinoamericano y catolico le resulta muy complicado digerirlo  Pude ver y entender esta virtud pero es dificil aceptarla  si yo fuera el Dios que aparece en este libro las cosas hubieran terminado diferente  Que este sea el libro emblematico del pueblo aleman da mucho que pensar respecto a nuestras diferencias ideologicas o de nuestras psicologias colectivas o como quiera uno nombrarlo  Tal vez sea en Fausto donde mejor he apreciado lo que se entiende como  etica protestante  y al menos para mi este es el elemento que ha transformado al mundo para devenir en la modernidad  Kisaltilmis bir versiyonu okudugumu kitaba basladiktan sonra fark ettim  Birakmadim  Tam metni okumayi da isterim  O zamana kadar puanim 4  Shakespeare den daha anlasilir buldugumu da belirtmeden edemeyecegim  For an older work that is usually considered  classic  literature  this is a very readable work  It took me a couple of pages to come to grips with the writing style  but once you re in  you re in  It s a very engaging work  although clearly fragmented  as it was written over a huge period of time  My favorite part was the visit to the witch s festival  which shared so many similarities with any other carnival I couldn t help but laugh  Be glad it wasn t a grey mouse  indeed  I know there is an alternate ending to the Faust tale  where he is condemned to hell  and I think I would have preferred that ending  I understand the point Goethe was trying to make  I just don t agree with it   I knew the basic premise of  Faust  and I have seen Gounod s opera performed  so I knew the general plot  Faust  a scholar filled with ennui and frustrated by unanswered questions and desirous of more knowledge  promises his soul to Mephistopheles if Mephistopheles can give him a moment of true happiness  I was impressed by how  modern  parts of Goethe s work felt  there is even a discussion of our double standards when it comes to sex  Margaret is punished for having premarital sex while Faust receives less censure   Some of the scenes were very surreal and almost Salvador Dali esque   the Walpurgis night scene especially   The poetry is very beautiful  and the final scene between Faust and Margaret is quite affecting  The story of sin and redemption is an old one  but  Faust  does it well  Some of us know all too well the protagonist s boredom with education and can relate to a desire for something more    something deeper  When we have come to the end of the bottle of education  passion  entertainment  or substance we are still left with a void  And it is in this moment that we are pulled towards the Faustian bargain  Will we give up our souls in order to fill the void  But the very moment that we move in this direction  Faust begins to see that he actually loses the ability to get what he wants  Even though he obtains elements of what he desires along the way  he misses out on the best that life really had to offer  Ultimately  although others appear to be imprisoned without the power of Mephistopheles at their side  the one who makes the bargain is the truly imprisoned one This is a wonderful yet chilling novel which serves as a powerful reminder that there is something greater than the temporal  and yet there are great dangers in pursuing the eternal and spiritual things in the same way in which we pursue the temporal    for our own self interest  seneye gorusmeyiz umarim mefisto  cok seksisin ama askimizi her donem irdelemek yoruyor beni   Luati din plin viul uman  Toti il traiesc  putini il stiu    Yes well reading Goethe in original german in not the problem  but it was one big mega poem  Doing business with Mephistopheles is not everyone s thing I suppose and eventually everyone died  some went up and one went down  Faust   It was 200 pages  but Faust only met Gretchen on page 110 I think  so what was he doing otherwise  Just having converstions with the devil  Sorry Goethe  you are a great writer  but I am still thinking about it  Should perhaps read it again  I decided to read it because it was there and is of course one of the big classics   Goethe nin   bir bilim insani olan Faust ile seytanin

reading  There are a ton of references to old mythology  and to me unknown history  but if you don t mind not knowing every character and its backstory  you re set with a great read I had the Bayard Taylor translation for part I and it was tough  and the A  S  KLINE translation for part II which was somewhat easier It s Alice in Wonderland meets The Cat in the Hat All in all  it s a farce  The story is completely devoid of structure and frame  and new ideas and historical events are continually thrown at you  But it s a nice farce  and it s an enjoyable chaos to take part of Some quotes of

version of the massive play  This was abridged  cut  and translated into English for a BBC radio adaption in the 1940s  The play itself is meant to be a closet drama   ie  its meant to be read and not exactly played and acted out on a stage in front of an audience It is a tremendous play and a massive and tremendous piece of work literature  I have trouble though deciding on      or    1 2  but I ll give it the benefit of the doubt and go with       It s a bit deep with the satire  going into Greek mythologies  esp  in Part II  and it draws from a number of sources  some German  some classical Greek Roman  some Shakespearean  and English  It s a hard play to wra your head around as the verse isn t aptly descriptive of the events and a large amount of  reading between the lines  needs to be done  Overall it is a highly recommended work that should be read for no other reason than to at least acknowledge how Goethe is a great writer and to feel some sort of semblance of culture emanating from the work  FAUST  You are by just a single soul possessed Oh may you never know the other Two souls alas  are dwelling in my breast And either would be severed from its brother The one holds fast with joyous earthy lustOnto the world of man with organs clinging the other soars impassioned from the dust To realms of lofty forebears winging  Faust is one of those works that is very much a quintessential piece of literature to have under the belt of experience  as well as being complicated and difficult  it also presents an archetype that has become a constant element in all kinds of media  the Faustian deal agreement  Therefore  I knew I would need to give it a shot someday  The outcome  I would say that it was a good experience  but the two parts gave me two different feelings  Part 1 is the more traditional part of the Faust legend  in which Faust  a disenchanted scholar  strikes up a deal with Mephistopheles the devil in order to gain pleasure and knowledge of the world  After this  Faust is able to use his new powers given to him to seduce the beautiful Gretchen  she is ultimately killed  but she gains salvation and goes to Heaven  In the end  Faust is saved due to her pleads with God  Goethe s rendition of this tale is more positive in that the original tale resulted in the damnation of both Gretchen and Faust  Part 2 is very odd and difficult to really make out  if there s one thing I m sure of  it s that I am glad that I read up on my Greeks  I knew I d need the skills someday  and this is one of those cases  In this part  Faust embarks on five separate adventures that are completely unrelated to Part 1  most of them involving Helen of Troy  therefore  the work is full of classical allusions that can be found in the works of Euripides  Sophocles  and Aeschylus  In the end  Faust is able to go to Heaven because only half of the bet Mephistopheles made with God is fulfilled upon Faust s death  All in all  I liked this work a lot  but I m not sure what exactly was up with Part 2  The end of the play is very important  but most of the other actions in the work are  to be frank  confusing  I m not sure what Goethe was really going for  and I tried to understand as much as possible  but I have to say that I didn t really follow  Besides this  I had a very good time reading this play  Part 1 is ingenious because the legend it was based upon is very exciting and insightful  I especially enjoyed the character of Mephistopheles  mainly because he is a truly tempting individual  He is a humorous  witty type of character that could come off as charming to someone  just as I think he s supposed to be  Therefore  I think that his character is the best out of all of the characters present in this great work  The devilry in the story of Faust  the archetypal man who sells his soul to a devil  has never been solely about satisfying Faust s needs as much as coercion and illusion  And even when Mephistopheles can be powerful  he would much rather be sneaky about it  In this way  he draws out of Faust what he wants  And Faust a lot of time is given his  own rope to hang himself with   However  it shows us a way of looking at Faust as an exploration of our own  humanity in the larger sense  inability to be satisfied with what we have Goethe s Faust is a long book  It won t be easy to read  however  it is important  Although one should perhaps investigate the Faust myth before tackling this epic poem  For a first time reader there are lots of things to overcome  the meter of the poem  the structure of the book itself  which splits the story into two parts with the first part mostly taking place on earth and ending with Faust being dragged to hell and beginning the second part waking up in a faerie ring  various frames that Goethe puts the story within  in the process mixing poetry of many different types  drama and prose within a dense structure that at times brings to mind Dante  Shakespeare and Euripides  Also  it helps if you can handle reading rhyming poetry  Note though that at times the poetry will feel like reading nursery rhymes Goethe s Faust is divided into two parts  Faust is an ancient myth of the man selling his soul to the devil  or in this case Mephistophiles  a lesser demon  One of the hallmarks of the story is that Faust  in early myths is viewed merely in the wrong  and early versions play out as thinly veiled propaganda against the Church  However  Faust never fell too far from the purpose of selling his soul  power and knowledge to help mankind and satisfy that longing for knowledge  Goethe identified this in Faust  but goes further than any writer  certainly before and maybe even still to this day  in exploring the questions raised by a human being  and indeed humanity in general  unable to satisfy its desire for knowledge and power  Pay attention also to the role of Mephistopholes  Whereas in early versions he is merely a slippery little devil  Here his relationship with Faust is much more complex  He almost seems as if he too is stuck in his role and seems almost to pity Faust in his inability to sate his need for knowledge and power  as if M s little wager with God brought out more than he expected  Also  It will be helpful to remind yourself  perhaps with a read through  of The book of Job The power of the verse of the poem takes on transcendence at times that will leave the reader with strong impressions  Milton and Dante will come to mind Also  Helen becomes an important character in Goethe s Faust  and it serves the reader to look at how images and their power are used in Faust  Also with noting is that although Part 2 is longer and more complex  Goethe intended it to be a chamber drama  Many features gives the second part a strange psychological aspect  particularly the emphasis on knowledge and ancient past  Note how we are witness to more fantastic elements but its also highly symbolic  also note that the ancient world Goethe explores is as much internal because he is obsessed with looking backwards  and in particular  with the power the past has a hold on us  And in this poem theatre hybrid the past becomes illusory and phantasmagoric  and as we enter the Helena we are transported to The ancient world  This passage backwards will become a huge thematic thrust in German Romanticism and the Romanticism movement in general  Goethe and his Faust will go on to influence many other Faust stories but as well his ideas will influence minds like Rilke  Nietschze  and Jung and perhaps even Mary Shelley with her own Modern Prometheus  or even Tolkien with his own Faust myth  or Philip K Dick  who s Galactic Pot Healer  is a meditation on Faustian themes  and William Gaddis  The Recognitions  a novel about art forgery that is also a version of the Faust myth   and perhaps delves deeper then most books into the church history behind the Faust myth then most  This past thing  this looking back which can consume you makes the Faust story refreshingly psychological for me  And as we dive further into the ancient world  are we not also going further into an internal world  An illusory world implies one we create for ourselves  and remember this as Faust searches for his Helen  In this framework Mephistopholes is almost as much an aspect of Faust  and this can be supported by the wager which seems to me to just be putting a price tag on something humanity does anyways Here s my final thought  This is as much an undertaking as reading Le Rechere  or The Divine Comedy  or Infinite Jest  but you will be highly rewarded if you give this devil it s due Also do invest the time in exploring this Norton Critical Edition  lots of wonderful background on Faust  Goethe  and criticism both contemporary of Goethe s time and more modern  Highly recommended for the footnote loving academic  I can t say I understand everything that goes on in this epic drama  but I can appreciate some of the richness and depth of Goethe s magnum opus  It is the story of a man s struggle with his own desire as he stumbles through an eventful life filled with colorful characters  chief among them the devil Mephistopheles  Part II will ramble sometimes and there will be many seemingly inscrutable scenes  but the payoff comes in Act V when Faust faces his greatest foe  hint  it isn t Mephistopheles   Many believe the ending is a bit of a cop out  and although I for one find it a bit offensive to my worldview  it actually makes a lot of sense given the context of the rest of the work  Goethe s Faust was never intended to be a morality play in the style of Christopher Marlowe  It is supposed to be a story of how a man finds meaning in his life  making terrible mistakes along the way  finally overcoming despair itself  the beauty of his victory outshining his greatest sins  No wonder Nietzsche drew much inspiration from this work  Rich in verse  emotion  and content  Definitely worth the read or seeing one of the many other versions in opera or musical  I must say I had to go over many a verse to understand the intent and did not succeed in every case  This is a classic tragedy set in late 18th Century Germany of the struggle between good and evil  Now  I finally understand the contrasting complexity and simplicity of Faust  Mephistopheles  and Margaret  Gretchen  of whom I have read and heard much in other literature   La primera parte de Fausto se rige por el viejo tema del sabio que vende su alma al Maligno con tal de experimentar el conocimiento infinito y algo que se parezca a la alegria de vivir  Margarita  la victima propiciatoria  pese a su previsible muerte  consigue hacer dudar a Fausto acerca de su decision al precipitarse inexorablemente a la ignominia En la segunda parte  mucho mas cerca de la alegoria que de una continuacion de la primera parte  Fausto viajara por el tiempo y el espacio para presenciar con sus propios ojos una fiesta llena de criaturas mitologicas del mundo griego clasico y conocer a la sin par Helena  con quien tendra un hijo que morira emulando los pasos de Icaro  Helena lo abandona para acompanar al hijo de ambos al Hades y un decepcionado Fausto ayudara al emperador de Alemania en las guerras de unificacion imperial  con lo que le otorgara tierras en las que Fausto querra finalmente vivir en paz  activando asi una de las clausulas del contrato del Maligno  En ese momento Fausto morira redimido  gracias al amor de Margarita que se habia mostrado en la primera parte Fausto es una obra sumamente compleja  erudita  en particular la segunda parte  ya que es necesario un conocimiento amplio del mundo helenico para entender las alusiones y guinos de Goethe  Sin embargo  habia escuchado tanto de la obra que al final no cumplio con las expectativas que tenia  Supongo que la releere en algun momento del futuro  Faust is a brilliant play  The language  while translated in formal English  nonetheless has a very modern air to it as Mephistopheles  aka Satan  is criticizing elements of mankind as  disgusting  or in some of the sexual entendre  The devil here appears to walk an interesting line between being a comical critic of humanity and his darker moments One important thing to note is the huge difference between part 1 and part 2 of the play  Part 1 was written much earlier in Goethe s life and has the feel of a complete and contiguous play  unfolding from beginning to end  Part 2 is not nearly as knitted together  and feels almost like a series of skits or scenes  It was reported that Goethe knew by this point that the play would not be feasible to put onto a stage and so let his imagination go  plotting out scenes involving ancient Greece  fantasy locations  and all kind of interesting creatures  If you aren t prepared for the big different between these two parts  then you ll feel like you got dropped off a cliff at the beginning of Part 2 Overall  Faust is an imaginative  engaging  amusing  and well written story  even if at heart its plot is the well worn tale of ambition  temptation and salvation  Simplesmente magnifico  Se a literatura e uma forma de arte  esta criacao de Goethe  e sem duvida uma belissima obra de arte Fiquei estupefecta  Nunca havia lido nada assim  Tem de tudo  E tao simples quanto e complexo  tao futil quanto profundo  tao original quanto lugar comum   e esta  promiscuidade  resulta  E em grande Que imaginacao teve Goethe e que poder criativo e literario para produzir algo assim  Nao sei se tera sido a  obra da vida  deste autor  mas tenho quase a certeza disso  Mas se estou enganada e ele escreveu melhor ainda  quero ler    Soberbo  Contudo  deveria talvez ter me preparado melhor para esta leitura  ou te la realizado de forma mais apoiada  Mas estava tao interessada em continuar  que interpretava  a minha maneira  e seguia em frente  Tornou se assim uma experiencia melhor de leitura  mas provavelmente  algumas coisas terao sido por mim compreendidas erradamente Nao consigo tambem imaginar esta peca em palco  Tenho serias dificuldades  Ao contrario do meu post anterior  em que falei do livro Peter Pan dizendo que seria em palco que a historia atingiria a sua plenitude  neste caso  a minha opiniao e exactamente oposta  Julgo que esta obra  apesar de ter sido escrita como peca teatral  e enquanto literatura que atingira o seu expoente maximo Seja como for  no teatro ou num livro  recomendo  sem qualquer duvida   mfystwfls bh fwst  shyTn h w shbH mrdh h qnwny drnd khh byd z hmn jyy khh bh drwn

apprezzato molto lo stile di scrittura  anche se in alcune parti si vede proprio che e un mero esercizio di stile quello che sta compiendo l autore Lettura consigliata se si e patiti di teatro  ma non direi che e uno di quei libri di cui si puo dire  sento di voler leggere qualcosa    toh  proviamo questo  Non so se parlarne in un video dedicato  comunque rientrera nei libri di maggio  parte 1 Listening to this audio program shattered my preconceptions about this book  I had always thought it quite a bit more sinister than this  and while it does involve a deal with a devil  it has the character of an inverted Job story  It is well suited to the audio format  being rather close to a play in composition  The play does a pretty good job of matching the Renaissance view of occultism quite well  and it is interesting to see the other side of the manners of the time  as well  It was rather interesting  The poetry of this work even in the translation was very impressive  At times though I was completely lost in the strange dialogues of the witches  dancing around in one the latter scenes  I completely missed the fate of Margaret till the final scene  Considering that the devil was supposed to grant him all the pleasures of the world  I couldn t detect any more than he played an unlikely matchmaker  using ludicrous methods to assist Faust in the seduction of Margaret  would Margaret an unworldly person really be tempted by expensive jewellery and the like  I didn t much of great reward for Faust before his fatal downfall befell him  So I found that was a failing in the play  though perhaps I have missed pointers to the opposite in the flowery language  The psychological look at the mind of evil was probably the best feature of this classical tale play  and though one knew all along what fate would await Faust  still there was something seductive about Mephistopheles   Chef d oeuvre que j ai lu trop jeune la premiere fois et que je n ai vraiment apprecie que lors de cette relecture tardive  Les longs monologues des personnages principaux  comme ceux de Faust ou de Mephistopheles  contrastent avec les repliques courtes et vives des passants ou des sorcieres du Sabbat  tout comme la narration en prose avec certains chants en vers dans cette traduction de Nerval  Cela cree une oeuvre riche et polymorphe ou chacun peut y trouver son compte  L ensemble de la piece etant donc diversifie  que ce soit au niveau de la forme ou des themes abordes  cela aide au maintien de l attention du lecteur  J ai personnellement prefere les passages avec Marguerite  personnage particulierement emouvant avec lequel se cloture la piece  Elle est autant en proie aux dilemmes et aux dechirements que Faust  sinon plus par sa position sociale particuliere en tant que femme a qui l adultere et l amour hors mariage est refuse  contrairement a un homme   mdm d  stl   n hdhh lqS  tDTrk l  n tfkr f  kl sh   wl  n tfkr f  mr khr fwq kl sh   Sdq Th Hsyn Hynm

fan of Louis MacNeice  so I was pleased to find this edition  second hand  in  The Winding Stair   a Dublin bookshop  Just getting into it  but so far so good      and so bad  One problem I have with Goethe s version is its moral simplicity  They layers are complex  yes and there are surprising twists  but if you strip away the irksome melodrama of Romanticism  you end up with a simplistic assumption of a world divided neatly into good and evil  which holds few surprises on a moral level  Another problem for me is the form  The piece is neither exactly a stage play or a poem   instead it tries to be both  This makes it frustratingly difficult to follow and has no apparant function other than that  I imagine that MacNeice was attracted to the formal poetic structure  and he does have some fun going all T S  Eliot on the thing  but it s not enough in the end  In pure terms of the combinations of words used in this story  Faust is beautifully written  But we also should account for the ability of the words to convey meaning and feeling when they are read  By those measures  this book is not beautifully written  Worth a read  and a re read  and maybe even a third  but I am not convinced that whatever significant artistic properties this once had  if ever it did  are translatable to across time and language  Very enjoyable book  Mephistopheles is a very interest character and represents the devil very well  The lies are weaved wonderfully  As he enacts the deception on Faust  The flow in a poetic style make the book very fascinating and added to the flavor of Mephistopheles  of course it s a masterpiece i recall my only problem with this was that it was a bit difficult for me to read  on an educated level  other than that  who doesn t think the story of Faust is fantastic  Maybe it was just the translation I read  but this classic doesn t feel as archaic as others and in fact feels rather modern  Very readable and contains valuable thoughts on religion vs science  as well as love and mortality  This is really quite good although the second half isn t as good as first  Its a lot funnier than i expected  maybe its not supposed to be but i couldn t help laughing at how bad a demon Mephistopheles is  His power is incredibly limited  almost everything he does is through secondary means  he hires a witch  a water spirit or some super soldiers  he also can t access Greek hell or  The Mothers   The Mothers is probably the best part of Faust being very Lovecraftian  The other best bit is near the start when Faust wants to meet the most beautiful woman in the world  i m not going to say what happens other than demons are really sneaky     Overall theres a lot to like although it goes off the boil towards the end  Nachalo i

poslednei chasti  An excellent story weighed down with politics and scripted ideological discussions  I suppose that is the problem with books though  Still  a good read if you enjoy doing voices for characters and are willing to create dozens for one or two lines  It was written as a closet drama   Much is unarguably lost in translation  but the translator attempts to rhyme and keep the original meter  so it isn t too terribly obfuscated  It contains the most critical preface I have ever seen written by translator Bayard Taylor and to my surprise  the words with rhythm he did are entirely beyond my expectation  I admire his brilliant talent in English and German   Never knew it was a poem  Very nicely translated  80 years and one pretty girl doesn t seem like enough of a second life to live to trade for eternal damnation   Procura que la imaginacion obre con todo su conjunto de razon  ingenio  sentimiento y pasion  sin esforzarse por olvidar la locura   My reading was prejudiced by my ignorance in Greek Mithology  but I believe I ll give it the deserved 5 stars in 20 years  Picked this up in the Stanford Bookstore once upon a time and enjoyed it for the three days or so it s length provided It was fun to finally read this book  It s a classic  for sure  and worth reading  though I think its power has worn off a bit through the years  I absolutely loved the first part of this  Mephistopheles is brilliantly written  witty and sarcastic  my kind of character  I really enjoyed Gretchen and the dynamics of her character  The second part however  was just not for me  I vaguely knew the story beforehand  having read Marlowe s Faustus  however  I don t think Goethe is incredibly convoluted  especially in the first part  so I would recommend anyone to give it a read  though this is a translation  it seems very true to the feel of Goethe s work  but obviously certain changes may not make it to everyone s likeness   Sad as fuck  Part 1 left me wanting to know what the hell happens to Faust   Moments of brilliance  moments of confusion  Worth the time  An interesting novel  Fortunately read several Greek tragedies before Faust so it was easy to fall into the rhythm of this poem Faust is about god and the devil gambling with a mortal soul  Found many of the sections humorous and appreciated the  tip of the hat  to Shakespeare  The ending surprised me  Won t say why because it would just be a spoiler  or maybe not  depending on your religious beliefs  Faust also raised some spiritual  philosophical  questions  But I think those are best explored with friends over coffee  Definitely worth a reread  I need to read this  All I know about it is it s about a guy who makes a deal with the devil  something about magic  or living in a moment of happiness for all eternity   and I ve seen the porn version with Ron Jeremy which was probably a pretty good representation   but I m starting on the Norton Critical Edition which I ve had lying around to see

blending  like to some ancient half expiring lay  Sorrow revives her wail of anguish sending  Back over life s devious labrynithine way  And the names of dear ones  them whom Fate bereaving  Of life s

Classic novel about man who makes deal with the devil  Devil is Mephistopheles and man is Faust  a learned doctor of 17 century Germany  Faust finds nothing in life to excite him and the devil bets that he can take Faust s soul  Faust eventually falls in love and the woman for whom he falls is put in prison and  just before death begs a pardon from God  Faust laments the trouble he has caused and is in hell  Good and scary  written as play  Influenced by Shakespeare  Me encanto  Fausto y Mefistofeles me cayeron muy bien  La unica queja que tengo es que se me fueron las cabras durante los saltos de partes  Lo volvere a leer en el futuro pues quiero captar bien que rayos paso durante cada una de las partes que componen el libro  y asi comprender mejor el final  Part I of Faust is a powerful story  and in Stuart Atkins s verse translation amazingly readable  It has a tremendous sense of place lacking in Part II  It is also a very human and  in spite of the fantastic element  very believable story The majority Part II depends for its effect on classical allusion  it probably worked very well for Goethe s 19th century audience  but I found it far less gripping than Part I  this is not going to be the right book for everyone to read but I definitely enjoyed reading it and really had me sometimes reading the same word over and over trying to figure out what Goethe was saying Maybe I will write my whole experience with Faust in another day I need time for all this to sink in jwth wfwst ldhy dkhl kl mn wkhbth lshyTn w trjm  mHmd  wD wmqdm  Th Hsyn wlsqTt ldyny  wlsysy

years during the course of my other reading and thought it would be a fine idea to actually read the work myself  I m very glad I did  The language was beautiful and the action always involving  Some of the scenes are absurdly whimsical and dark One of my new life goals  bucket list  will be to watch a stage production of Faust  The book is definitely worthwhile  and I particularly find the character Mephistopheles to be very well written  even likeable Some things that need to be noted are the references to greek mythology  some of which may not be widely known and  at times  can affect the reading experience Otherwise  the book has been exquisitely translated  the poetry is beautiful and the ideas are interesting  This is not going to be the right book for everyone  but I definitely enjoyed reading it  enough to write a term paper on it and still own a copy   It is a very difficult read and at times had me literally banging my head on my desk trying to figure out what Goethe was saying  Overall  though  I thoroughly enjoyed the entire book and like the meaning I got out of it  Amazing that such a short book could make such an incredible impact  Hard to not think that Goethe himself had crossed paths with the devil  What makes this all the more entertaining is the fact that it is one long rhyming  lyrical piece  Worth the read and fun to try and think forward and see the many other great works that were clearly influenced by this novel   V zakvashennuiu nebylitsu Podbros te istiny krupitsu   I budet deshev i serditNapitok vash i vsekh prel stit       Odnoznachno

layered meanings and deep imagery of von Goethe  but also the rhythm and rhyme  Suddenly  after reading this book I have the urge to find some good poetry  Great story  superbly told  I ll read it again  Klasika This is a nice translation  but somehow I just did not get the point  Goethe is considered the greatest of German writers  my heritage is mostly German so I thought maybe I d click with this  but I failed to find anything great about it  Homer  Virgil  Dante all    to me   rate as greats  Goethe seems to not be in that league   Why is this work so famous  Because it treats man s situation torn between religion and scientific realization between love and betrayal and many other timeless questions that influence everybody s life to its roots in an ingenious manner  Many expressions have become part of common German language  des Pudes Kern      Really enjoyed this and was quick to read  although talking to my fellow bookworms I wonder how much of this was due to the great translation I had  The only unsatisfying thing was that the story seemed to pass by so quickly  without time for development of characters  but perhaps this is inevitable in a play  I liked the first part very much     the second part is more cerebral and then the notes and criticism  That was the best part reading Goethe s notes the history and analysis made me realize how much can be missed     I recommend anyone reading this Norton version to read the notes and criticism first  I wish I had  WOOOT  I won t say I fully comprehended it nor that I didn t at all  but I did appreciate the writing and many parts of it  I think I needed to read it and I think I ll have to read it again someday so I m not giving it 5 stars because I didn t love it but I do think it s special somehow so 4 stars are ok  Solo necesite de 100 hojas de notas y estudio previo y otras tantas de un reader s companion para comenzar a entender la dimension de su ejecucion  This is not an easy or  run of the mill  book  it is very powerful and at times disturbing  I am still attempting to fully grasp the plots to this play that reads more like a poem and I love every minute so far  If you are familar with Joseph Campbell s work  this will probably be right up your alley  A must read for classic literature buffs and fans of Bulgakov s The Master and Margarita like myself  Fantastic poetry and portrayal of Mephistopheles  I copied down many quotes from this translation  including the final two lines   Thus the Eternal Feminine Lures into perfection   Hilarious  I realize nonstop  boffo laughs is not the first thing you d think of when it comes to nineteenth century German morality plays  and perhaps I m just not  getting  it and there are much serious factors at work  but seriously this one of the funniest things I ve ever read  I had to cram most of this book into a one week period  which was rather Faustian of me  har har  I recommend taking more time to think it through  I m kinda glad to be done with it though  The commentary by Edinger is very helpful  if you are interested in how Faust influenced Jung   Not the most coherent epic poem I ve ever read  I must say  The format is certainly interesting    this is a  closet drama   a play meant to be read rather than performed  I found the first act more engaging than the mystical second  but I certainly don t regret having read this   This is a book that I just don t feel smart enough to read  Loved part one  but I need to brush up on my mythology and buy an annotated text before I can love part two  Obviously Goethe is a genius and hopefully one day I ll be able to understand this text fully  I had a ten week class on Faust  I love it  and after spending so much time on it it kind of means a lot to me I listed it under surreal bizarre entirely because of Part II   which I ended up enjoying  but what the hell  What the hell  If I d have read this in German  and if I would ve been able to understand German   I think I would have given this a five  English didn t seem forceful enough a language for this particular story  which on its own is brilliant  I feel like my rating should be 4 stars since this is considered one of literature s greatest achievements  Truth be told  I didn t really understand it at the time  I would like to read it again  slowly and carefully  I loved the first part  it s a great read  Don t be frightened off by verse   but the second one is far too allegorical to be enjoyable if you don t want to spent a lot of extra time pondering what you ve just read  fwst tjsyd

language  the original Faust  Part One  is a must read  I absorbed it with the help of a German dictionary in 1991  a fitting preparation for my 8 month journey to Deutschland   honestly the better translation  Props for both the English and German  Can t read a lick of German  but it makes the case for keeping the rhyming structure rather than choosing the most exact lines  Cerita tentang faust

mortals  feelings  Jag gillade Faust betydligt mer an vad jag trodde att jag skulle gora  Handlingen och karaktarerna var jatteintressanta och boken i sin helhet ar bra och valskriven  Ah  this story   You can have every single thing in the world but you can t trick the devil himself  It is truly fascinating piece of literature  Made way more sense than when I read it in college  Still a bit of a slog though even with so much more reading and life experience now behind me   I enjoyed the idea much more than the presentation  Might have just been an awful translation  Might be that I struggle with dramatic poetry   Wether in the original German or english translation it is a excellent story about good evil  intent  and the price of getting what you want  Very interesting book  I like Goethe s interpretation of the Faust story  I can see why this has become the definitive version of the story   This is a classic and is referenced in a lot of philosophy  I simply wanted an understanding of what the references were  I really enjoyed this book  Part 1 is mind glowingly good  Part 2 not so much  60  of it feels like an epic poem entitled  This is what my castle looks like     This was a tough one  If I didn t read the reviews and commentaries I never would have known what it was about  Part 1 was really good  but I couldn t make much headway with Part 2  The criticism at the back was helpful Glanzpunkt deutscher Literatur  auch wenn ich die Walpurgisnacht und die Hexenkuche abstossend obszon finde Dark  confusing at times  But very interesting  BAckground essential for this story to really shine     muss man einfach gelesen haben    irre Nur 4 Sterne  da ich Faust2 etwas zu abgehoben fand  The translation I read was a little challenging to get through but the story was fantastic
