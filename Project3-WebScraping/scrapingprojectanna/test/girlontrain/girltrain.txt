This was the last book read that I needed to complete my yearly challenge and it was fantastically suspenseful. More so when you consider that it is the authors first thriller. 

Rachel is a hot mess, a shadow of her former shelf. Her husband has left her for another woman and they now have a child, a child Rachel wanted more than anything. Turning to drink, she has become an ugly drunk, lost her job, gained weight and doesn't remember what she has done, often blacking out.

She takes the same train, at the same time that she too when she has a job, not wanting anyone to know she has been fired. She has a good reason to look out the windows of the train and this is how she becomes embroiled in a turn of events that will have a huge impact on her life.

I felt a reluctant sympathy for Rachel, she is so totally flawed, seemingly unable to help herself. The suspense and the characters were amazingly portrayed. Often I had no idea what was going to happen next, things kept changing, going in a different direction. Reminded me somewhat of Alfred Hitchcock with his unique camera pans, only this author does the same thing but with words. I have train tracks about 50 yards behind my house but thank goodness it is only for freight, if it was passenger train I think I would be extremely self conscious about what I was doing in my yard.

Highly recommend for psychological and suspense thriller, readers.


Another fast-paced psychological thriller that kept me glued to its pages!

If you're a fan of Gillian Flynn’s twisted, artful, and suspenseful storytelling, I’d recommend checking out The Girl on the Train.

Have you ever gazed through the window on a train and wondered what the people living in those houses you pass are doing with their lives? Perhaps you’ve conjured up your own theories, mentally orchestrating their daily occurrences all while longing to obtain the security you've imagined they possess?

Rachel’s life has become entirely engulfed by these sorts of daydreams, zeroing in on one couple in particular — a couple she spots daily out on their terrace during her train ride into work. Rachel sees them as beautiful and happy; peaceful and together. All that she is not. 

As Rachel’s once happy life devolves into a nightmare of alcoholism and loneliness, she finds solace in these quiet minutes on the train. But when her path crosses with the “perfect” people of her daydreams, Rachel gets a chilling dose of reality…

All is not always as it seems, and everyone is harboring a secret.

While this book offers a mysterious, edgy chain of events sure to keep you guessing, you’re not likely to build a bond with its characters. Each of them are flawed and contribute to a largely heavyhearted plot. But it doesn’t seem we’re meant to fall in love with this cast, and I don’t believe this will hinder your connection to the story. 

This author’s writing is polished, her ideas are well-constructed, and she displays powerful themes that do not need the aid of repetition to be recognized or appreciated. The story is told in first person, and alternates between the candid and often morbid perspectives of three women whose lives eventually interlink. 

I had a hard time putting this book down. A must-read for all you psychological thriller lovers!

One for sorrow, two for joy, three for a girl, four for a boy, five for silver, six for gold, seven for a secret never to be told. 
I’ve got a few of those…
