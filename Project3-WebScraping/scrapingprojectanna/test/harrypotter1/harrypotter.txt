How can more than half of my Goodreads friends be wrong with this I have to get this right  As of this writing  I have 98 Goodreads friends  61  62   of them have read J  K  Rowling s Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone  Out of those who read this  39  64   rated this with 5 stars  11 of them with 4 stars  All the others gave 3 or 2  Only 2 rated this with 1 star  One of them admitted not being able to finish it  She should not have rated it really since she did not read its entirety   But she is my friend and it is her right  so why question  When the book came out in 1998  I was not yet a bookworm so I brushed this aside  I read only those books that my brother told me to read  He was the bookworm but he would not be caught reading any book being pushed by media hype  However  when Warner Bros  released the film adaptation in 2001  my daughter was 6 years old and I thought that  since there was too much hype  the movie must be good and we would have a memorable time with our first ever father daughter movie date  I was wrong  She not only got scared because of the darkness inside the movie house but she trembled with fear during the life size human chess game  in that scene when Ron was sacrificed  We left the movie in that scene with my daughter crying and me cursing it   I will never read Harry Potter  My daughter is now 15 going 16  She is not fond of movies and she still does not show interest on reading Harry Potter  However  I am now a bookworm and the other week  I was with my 4 Goodreads friends and 3 of them raved  two of them  again  about Harry Potter books  Oh well  first time fathers can make mistakes about first movie date with their daughters  Book 1 is included in 500 Must Read Books and the book must be a quick read  So the following day  I bought my copy After 13 years of the book s existence and me ignoring it  did I finally make a good decision of reading it  Are all of those 39 friends of mine in Goodreads wrong in giving this 5 stars  Most of them did not bother writing a review  Maybe those would be too long or maybe they read this when they were not in Goodreads yet  But I am in Goodreads already so I can make this review long These are what some of them say  it was a great book i enjoyed reading it  For an eloquent reviewer  she must have been too happy to express herself   Such a great story and creative way of writing  I love Harry Potter    Yes  I agree about the story being great and J  K  Rowling being creative   I was secretly wishing I was studying in Hogwarts too  It was silly  but I was simply enraptured by Harry Potter  Honestly  I still am    It was a great book  I enjoyed reading it  Coming from one of my favorite reviewers in Goodreads  I do not share her wanting to be a sorcerer though   Honestly  I don t know anybody who d refuse to even entertain the thought of attending a school for wizards   Another one of my favorite reviewers  That seems to have nailed this  Young people wanting to be in Hogwarts and study sorcery  That should be it  The world seems to be a dreadful place that we would all like to have powers to turn our enemies into frogs  pigs  ride on a broomstick and get the Snitch and earn points  money  for our family Oh well  the Bible says that sorcery is Satan s work  The book even used the word Transfiguration as a subject in the sorcery school  Blasphemy Just kidding  This is a work of fiction and I am not too old to appreciate it  I was just kidding  To be frank  I tried hard not to like this  I thought that giving this a 1 or 2 will freak out my friends and somehow get votes from those who are  up to now  ignoring this book  I told you so  Why waste your time    However  unless you are a grumpy old man woman  there is nothing not to like about this book  I maybe too old for it but hey  talent is talent and J  K  Rowling has it My 39 friends are indeed right     He couldn t know that at this very moment  people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices   To Harry Potter   the boy who lived     What can I really say about the Harry Potter series that hasn t already been said before When I was younger  I ve always wanted to read the Harry Potter books  But as a child  I was intimidated by how thick the books were  including the first installment which also happens to be one of the more shorter books in the series  It s a funny thought now considering how I read books even more than double the size of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone  But last year  I made a resolution to read all the Harry Potter books starting in January and finishing no later than April because Universal Studios is finally opening  The Wizarding World of Harry Potter  theme park in California  And what better way to reward myself for finishing the series than taking a journey through the magical world of Harry Potter  Chocolate Frogs  Bertie Bott s  Butter Beer  Hogwarts HERE I COME With that being said  I really enjoyed this book as much as I thought I would  I loved seeing all the   bonus scenes   and dialogue that were excluded from the film and how different everything seemed as opposed to watching the films  However  I think I did enjoy the movie a bit more than the book  Maybe it s because I grew up watching the Harry Potter movies  and still do several times every year   rather than growing up and reading the books  So if anything  it s actually kind of backwards for me I ve noticed that the movie took on a more  darker  atmosphere compared to the lighter  more kid friendly mood that the book possessed  A good example of this for me would be the Sorting Hat scene  In the movie  the Hat actually frightened and freaked me out and to be honest  it still does  But in the book  everyone s all happy and singing  and just WAY different from how I would ve pictured it if I would have read the book first  then watched the movie   PI m really glad that the movie did such a fantastic job at depicting this book and  in some ways   made it even better   I thought I already knew the Wizarding World like the back of my hand but after reading Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone  it opened my eyes to a whole new perception that the movies could never have given me  Although being a fan isn t determined by whether or not you ve read all the books or watched all the movies  I m really proud of myself for finally tackling this once childhood fear of mine to read the Harry Potter series  And for me  it feels as if I m kicking it up a notch as a Harry Potter fanatic who s seen the movies  and is finally one step closer to finishing the books     I primarily wanted to reread this book in honor of the Banned Books Week  this series is  1 on the Top 100 Banned Challenged Books  2000 2009 list   It also happened that I was on vacation in Orlando and  surely enough  a Universal Studios Hogwarts visit was a must  Oh  the nostalgia  A lot has been said already about the series  so I won t repeat  I just feel very  very sad for the kids whose parents choose to ban these books from their houses and their lives  To take something so wondrous  imaginative  so magical from children is pretty much a crime in my eyes  These books have given me a lot pleasure over the years  but I have to praise them especially for their ability to turn the old me and my equally old husband into children who can still sigh in delight at seeing Hogwarts  the Sorting Hat  the Olivander s  almost  come to life and smile from ear to ear just because we were drinking butterbeer at Three Broomsticks  it s very tasty  BTW   I ve been there and  flown  on a broomstick with Harry Potter   To be honest I just got this for the illustrations  which I loved  But I did feel like there was A LOT of empty space that could have been more illustrations but other than that this was really fun   Ok  so this was my first time reading this book  don t judge me   While I wasn t quite as enamored with it as the thousands of adoring fans  the ones who have read them over and over and over  have been  this wasn t a bad read  I did have to keep reminding myself that this was a children s book  and I m WAY past the target age  My son and daughter in law  along with the RMFAO group  have been after me to read these books  I m actually looking forward to reading the rest of the books  just to see how the books  and the characters  grow up  I haven t seen the movies  but I don t live under a rock either  and I know that each book progressively ages with the characters  turning from children s books with child like problems  to books with adult issues and adult responses from the characters  I m really hoping that things in the next books aren t so easy for Harry  Ron  and Hermione to solve  That s probably my biggest complaint  and why it  only  got four stars from me  everything was too easy  that the mysteries were laid out too simply and were easily solved  They were clever  and again  I had to keep reminding myself that it wasn t written with me in mind This first book was entertaining  as I ve said  but it wasn t a five star read  I m going to be in trouble for that statement  I think    It reminded me of a mash up between the old Hardy Boys Nancy Drew books  kids solving crimes with skills well beyond their age or abilities  and Scooby Doo  Yes  Scooby Doo  Especially at the end when the real bad guy was revealed  it wasn t who they thought it was   and the bad guy s reaction was   Darn you  meddling kids    or something very similar    DOn to the next book  Because everyone on the planet excluding me and maybe some of the Kardashians have read this series  I ll skip the plot summary and go for a less formal review  I can see why so many people adore Harry Potter  While Rowling does not introduce anything particularly groundbreaking in terms of fantasy or plot or characterization  she does abide by the hero s quest with great precision  Harry is the underdog from the start and you can t help but cheer him on as he overcomes obstacles with the help of his friends and his mentor  Each of the characters has a distinct personality  and Rowling s simple writing style leaves room for brevity and enough imagery to pull you into the setting  Story wise  she includes all of the necessary elements  foreshadowing  conflicts that escalate to the climax  a pretty satisfying plot twist  etc I ll probably read one other book in between each installment of this series  I m looking forward to seeing the characters mature and the plot become darker as many others have said it will  With the Harry Potter series  J K  Rowling is the God of the most important rule of story telling  be interesting  She might not be the best writer in the world  although she is very good  But damn can she tell an interesting story From the first sentence  she lets you know you re in store for something fun  There s just that magical touch to it that only she seems to have  And she keeps it going through the whole book  and the six others in the series  without missing a beat The Sorcerer s Stone is packed with mystery  It starts early and picks up speed  and the reveal is quite the surprise  unlike in most kids books where things go down Scooby Doo style But the thing that really makes this book stand out is the characters  Harry Potter  I ended up hating him  But in this book  he s fine  But even the minor characters here have more personality than the protagonist of most books These books might not be the best  but there s nothing like them  They re just magical  Plain and simple  4 4 5 starsThis is my second time reading Sorcerer s Stone  but it will be my first time reading the rest of the series  I will no longer be an HP virgin  Of course  I ve seen all the movies  but I m ready to live the magic of the actual books  I felt like a kid again reading this  Ron and Hermione are already winning  Harry and that mirror had me tearing up  and I love Dumbledore with his mixture of quiet  powerful wisdom and surprising kookiness      Onto Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets  Since pretty much everyone I know has read these books  I figure reviewing them is pretty pointless  But with the new book coming out in a couple of weeks  I have to go through them beginning to end  To make the reviews more entertaining  I will be doing them in a variety of unexpected formats  For this review  I will be writing as someone incapable of suspending his disbelief This book was terrible  I mean  this author is obviously on drugs or insane or something like that  and why she has been allowed to publish such patent nonsense is beyond me  What is even more horrifying is that so many people  adults and children  are supporting this madwoman  I mean  even some of my friends and family  people I respect have come under her spell Her spell  Ha  As though such things as spells and magic really exist  I know she and her hoard of followers believe so  but we  the right thinking  rational people of the world know better  don t we The beginning was okay  and I had high hopes for it  I thought it might be an interesting story about this family  the Dursleys  who seem to be people after my own heart  Sensible  no nonsense folk  these  who know what s real and what isn t  But within ten pages  I knew something wasn t right  Think about this   some crazy old man in robes shows up with a tiny device that can put out streetlights from a distance  A cat changes into a woman  Outrageous  And then the flying motorcycle  and nonsensical ravings about magicians and dark lords and curses  and that s where it all started to go downhill I forced myself to slog through this mess of nonsense  though by the time I got to chapter five  I had pretty much given up  Nothing this book describes could possibly take place in the real world  and it is almost criminal that she should get this kind of fame and attention  She is a font of nonsense and mayhem  poisoning the minds of everyone her work touches  If you haven t read these books  I recommend that you stay away from them  If you have  then I beg you to come to your senses and embrace the real world  Give up this madness and join us over here in the world where truth is truth and Harry Potter is meaningless vapor  Having just read this for the first time  I definitely missed the boat  My taste in books now skews a little darker  At the same time  I m glad I finally read it and though I don t think it was the best book of all time or anything  I can definitely understand the hype  I m sure I ll eventually read all the books  in which case I ll understand the fandom and probably be a super fan myself  Ten

this book has gotten out of hand and yet  I can never get tired of reading Harry Potter Although I believe I should mark this as my first time reading the books in English  all the previous times has been the translated version  It s like a whole other world  Almost as if I m reading the book a for the first time  This is Harry Potter  And this is his story J K  Rowling wrote a fantastic book  And this is not only a childrens book  This is an ALL Age book  She wrote about a world which is magical and beauiful at the same time  She wrote about creatures and spells which people use today  I am still impressed by this author and her creativity  There is no book I could compare to Harry Potter Without Harry Potter we wouldn t have Harry Potter Especially the movies have a special place in my heart  It wasn t called this at all   but for some reason the title changed in the US and there is no original title versions of this on this site  which is also strange  How terribly odd  Anyway  I read this to the kids   in fact  the first four books to them   just before the tidal wave of popularity  We had just finished reading all the books of Dahl and were looking for something else to be getting on with   and there was this article in the paper saying that the Fundamentalist Christians wanted this book banned Well  let s face it  there is no higher recommendation for a book and I remain grateful to the Christian community for pointing me in the right direction with this one After the forth book my youngest daughter started reading them to me   there are few joys in life that are surpassed by books or daughters  mixing them together was always going to be a highlight  and how could it not be These books got better as they went on   the last one was particularly good   It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live  3 5 starsI m sure this thick book became even more legendary than the author ever dreamed it would Rowling uses cookie cutter characters to create a fascinating world of magic  wizardry  and the great divide between good and evil which has always captivated all age groups and which always will  The world building is one reason the novels   and then movies   became so famous  Getting that invite to Hogwarts must be such fun   I m sure many normals in this world fantasize it happening to them at that age Harry Potter is likeable  but simple  His friends are the same  The villain promises to be a fascinating one but he s not really uncovered yet save for whispers of legends and foreshadowing  The book was especially enjoyable at the beginning  where Harry is unfortunate in his demented average family  There s humor that works  sometimes  pushing the story along  The real excitement starts when Harry steps foot onto Hogwarts ground  meeting the bizarre blend of professors  other students  potions  classes  and challenges I know the movie was rated poorly by some in comparison to the book  To me it s almost word for word  including dialogue  Some of it  such as emotion  worked better in page form  I do have to prefer some of the movie though  especially when playing Quidditch  because the effects made it more interesting  I think Rowling drug it out too long in book form  and because of this dragging on I grew a little bored at times Overall a cute and quirky  simple novel that opens a door to a world that skyrocketed  I m hoping I enjoy the later novels more  just like I did with the movies  2015 Reading Challenge   15 Primer libro autor popular Nunca es demasiado tarde para empezar esta saga    lo disfrute un monton  Reread 2015   4 never too old for this stars 4 25 5Ya se  no hay ninguna excusa para el hecho de que no habia leido Harry Potter hasta ahora  aunque en mi defensa cuando se publico estaba en el vientre de mi madre  pero bueno mejor tarde que nunca   No No crei que me fuera a apegar con los personajes y la historia desde el principio aunque a lo mejor influyo el hecho de que ya habia visto las peliculas anteriormente  lo bueno es que no recuerdo nada de las peliculas asi que puedo leerlo con nuevos ojos  El mundo en este primer libro esta muy bien construido al igual que los personajes para tener tan pocas paginas  Obviamente mis personajes favoritos fueron Harry  Ron y Hermonie  pero los gemelos Weasley sin duda tambien estan entre mis favoritos  Rowling tiene una imaginacion que va mas alla de mi comprension y una pluma fluida que te atrapa sin dejarte respirar  en el buen sentido  No se que mas puedo decir que ya no se haya dicho acerca de este maravilloso libro  asi que hasta aqui mi resena  Si no lo han leido no sigan mi ejemplo y leanlo lo mas rapido posible   Oh go to hell  These things are like crack So I just finished the 7th one and I have no intention of re reading them  though I do have fond memories of them  My most recent encounter with Harry Potter was on an airplane a couple of days ago  This humongous 16 year old kid from North Dakota was sitting next to me reading the 5th book  He smelled like cereal and farts and was audibly mouth breathing for the whole flight  I tried to engage him in conversation periodically to get his little whistle to quiet down for a few minutes at a time  We chatted about the little bastards at Hogrwarts and it kind of got me misty   not for the books  but for how terrible high school was even though I didn t realize it at the time  And this kid clearly didn t either  He just wanted to read his book and make it home  I wanted to tell him that in 10 years he wouldn t even remember what his goddamn school looked like  Instead I tried to convince him that what he heard about Dumbledore dying in the 6th one wasn t true  Stay strong  brother   Anyone heard of this  It s not bad  It s about a kid who goes to school   no really  it s more interesting than it sounds  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone is a book about  view spoiler     seriously  What rock did you just crawl out from under   hide spoiler   INTERNATIONAL GIVEAWAY OF THE NEW HARRY POTTER PAPERBACK BOX SET ON MY BLOG         I m the only person in the world with mixed feelings about the Harry Potter books  Most readers love them  There are non readers who are indifferent to them as they are to all other books  others who go solely by the fact that they re  children s  books and therefore believe it s ridiculous for adults to read and enjoy them  and of course a legion of similarly anti literacy folk who have decided the Harry Potter books are immoral  These people  who read and enjoy Tolkien  C S  Lewis  and stories about Merlin and King Arthur  have concluded that the Potter universe is an evil place because it has magic and witches  All righty  then  I suppose there are readers who genuinely dislike the Harry Potter books  I haven t come across them  but they must be out there somewhere  And of course there must be readers who say they dislike them when what they mean is  they re wildly jealous that they didn t write them I don t belong in any of those categories  I admire the fine writing  characterization  dialogue  and world building Rowling has done  And exactly because her writing is so good  the one flaw I ve found pains me to the point that I can t read these with the pure pleasure they give so many others The only person I ve talked to about this who s been willing to listen long enough to understand what I m saying is the one person I know who hasn t read the books and has no plans to  He thinks I make a valid point  Everyone else I ve attempted to engage on this topic has responded   You re saying something bad about Harry Potter  You must be bad  I hate you  Please leave my home   Or words to that effect  I ll grant you that accepting flaws in things we love is a little taught skill in this world  It s almost as rare as seeing good qualities in those we hate  This is as true with books as it is with people  and it s tragic  I have yet to meet someone who can acknowledge the admirable qualities of books they can t stand  I don t mean genuinely bad books  the kind that will be pulped a year after they were printed  if they last that long  or that will never make it to paper in the first place not because technology is awesome but because  nobody  wants to waste the paper on these works  No  I mean books that have stood the test of time but who have as many haters as lovers Perfect example  Little Women  People adore this book  or they despise it Listen up   Little Women  is corny  mawkish  and sentimental  It s also wise  funny  and strong  Whether you like the book or you hate it  if you can t admit that all of this is true and this can all be true at the same time about the same book  you have a serious ego problem  You can t admit that the book you love could have anything wrong with it    Krinkle  krinkle   ittle  tar   Really  That s not cringe inducing  Calling a grown woman  Marmee  isn t cringe inducing  Having the one black child at Jo s school for boys be the best singer isn t seriously cringe inducing    Or else you refuse to entertain the idea that anything you hate could have anything right about it   Marmee s advice to Meg about the difference between the flashing tempers of the March girls and the temperament of the man Meg married stands the test of time very well  as do plenty of the other observations of humanity    when Jo laughingly admits that she s well enough to go on a carriage ride with Laurie  but not well enough to do disagreeable chores  and then karma kicks her in the arse  Which it tends to do a lot in this book  Put your ego aside when thinking about and discussing literature  Good books are not saints  They should be admired  enjoyed  learned from  and reread  but they should also be critically examined  And if I ve done all that with the Harry Potter books and I ve found something I think is a serious flaw  it would be nice to be able to discuss that  rather than be glared and yelled at  yes  both have happened  and yes  I m still angry  because I have the unmitigated gall to find something wrong with Saint Jo For anyone who s still reading  I m very uncomfortable with one aspect of the world Rowling has created  Specifically  I don t think her justification for hiding the existence of magic from the world of ordinary humans stands up well in a court of ethics This is a review of the first book  so I ll only go into what she says here  When Harry Potter first learns who is parents really are  Hagrid is furious at the Dursleys for not having told him anything about what he calls Harry s world   Our world  I mean  Your world  My world  Yer parents  world   It s terribly wrong not to have told Harry who and what he is  and who and what his parents were  Agreed  How  then  is it all right to hide what is  after all  the real world from the majority of its inhabitants  How is it all right to scorn them for not having magic while at the same time doing everything to keep them from knowing magic exists Don t say there s no scorn   Muggle  is hardly a term of endearment   Yes  I m jumping ahead of myself and I promised I wouldn t  but  mud blood  is nothing but an extension of the condescension contained in  Muggle    And as for the attitude towards the mundane world  look at Hagrid    one of the good guys  certainly  and a very appealing character  Although Hagrid seemed to know where he was going  he was obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary way  He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the Underground and complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow  I don t know how the Muggles manage without magic   he said  as they climbed a broken down escalator  We manage because you won t let us do otherwise  And then you sneer at the job we do Let me ask you something  Do you really believe that  separate but equal  can be both  That s not how it works in the real world  and it s not how it works in Potter s world  The magical beings there are an elite minority  and they like it that way  They have the power  They re hanging on to it by force  more about that in later books   even when that puts the inhabitants of the mundane world at risk  WAY more about that in later books  Let me ask you something else  If you read and enjoy Austen s novels in the way that many people do    taking pleasure in imagining yourself a member of that world    you imagine yourself as one of the genteel  right  Not one of the servants  We see very little of them  and they have miserable lives  The power situation in Austen s time was horribly imbalanced and unfair  Austen wasn t in much of a position to do anything about it  but at least she didn t have her characters brag all the time about how awesome it was to be of the land owning class  and how pathetic those stupid servants are In fact  the one character I can think of who does complain about servants is Aunt Norris  and she s an out and out villain  Her observations on the serving class are meant to reinforce just what a nasty piece of work she is One person I know claimed that in the Potter universe  the magic users keep their existence and powers a secret in order to protect themselves  That s contradicted later    I think in book  3  in which Harry reads a textbook about how much real witches enjoy being burned at the stake because it tickles and doesn t do them any harm    but for now I ll just point out what Hagrid says when Harry asks why the Ministry of Magic  keeps it from the Muggles that there s still witches an  wizards up an  down the country   Blimey  Harry  everyone d be wantin  magic solutions to their problems  Nah  we re best left alone  If Rowling wanted to make a universe in which a failed attempt had been made in the past to live on equal terms with the non magic world  and that attempt had led to great suffering and many lives lost on both sides  that would be perfectly tenable   And fascinating  Somebody  write that book  Okay  I will   If she wanted to claim that magic users would be persecuted by the ordinary humans  and the magicians might have the magic but the mundane world had the sheer numbers and a lot of nasty technology on their side  that would certainly work  And then I could read these books without a qualm Instead  she s created a world in which a ruling class cheerfully admits that they like having all the really cool stuff and they re jolly well not going to share with those foolish mortals who are so stupid  they have to struggle up broken escalators What troubles me even more than her making this decision  which  as I ve pointed out  is not the only way to go if you want to have a world of hidden magic  is how enthusiastically her readers have embraced it  There are  No Muggles Allowed  posters and Facebook pages  Created and enjoyed by people who don t seem to realize that  just as they d more likely be a servant than gentility in Austen s world  odds are good they d be Muggles in Rowling s  People who have felt odd and left out all their lives naturally embrace the idea that secretly  they re special and strong    magical  even  I only question the idea that having wonderful abilities has to go hand in hand with lording it over those who don t  How is the Potter universe s attitude toward non magic users any different from Malfoy s gloating over his entirely inherited monetary wealth  and sneering at Ron s poverty I m very uncomfortable with the Potter universe because I don t have the ego to believe I d be one of the special ones  I m rereading these with my son because he doesn t remember them very well and his grandmother kindly lent us an entire hardcover library of the British editions  This journey has its pleasures  but it s the last I ll take to the Potter world  It s no place for Muggles UPDATE  I m now about a hundred pages into the British edition of the last Harry Potter book  and I m already seriously considering rereading the whole series just to have the entire  incredibly complex plot fresh in my head for once  Yes  the things that bug me philosophically about this series still bother me  but the writing is just too good for even cranky old me to resist   Is there any point in saying anything about Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone anymore  Not really  Not as far as critiques go  If I were to delve into some interesting critical analysis of an issue raised in The Philosopher s Stone  or take a critical look at Rowling s authorship  then maybe   but most everything that can be said about liking or disliking the book  about its excellence or its shabbiness has been said And while I feel I may eventually take a stand for those who appreciate JK Rowling s world of witches and wizards  who think that these books occasionally achieve real excellence  who connect emotionally to any one of the impressive characters she has drawn  I officially concede my inability to do so here But I will make this observation  those who equate the Twilight series to the Harry Potter series for entertainment value  quality of storytelling  cultural influence  influence on literacy  or the writing chops of their authors are people you do NOT want to be taking book advice from There is more than something in the Harry Potter series worth reading  I couldn t find anything worth reading in the works of Stephenie Meyer  except that it had been published   This was so much better than I remember it being  this time around I read the whole thing in one sitting  I love Neville  I now want to re read the entire series Not perfect  but pretty bloody awesome The end  4 i m worth twelve of you draco Stars Dva Khari Pot ra v edno  http   knigolandia info book review h    Chovek i dobre da

Stone and I thought  Wow  someday I d love to create worlds and characters so imaginative as these I think Harry Potter will become classics of literature and in my opinion these books is a great book for any child in the world to discover the passion of reading Spanish version  Que decir de los libros de Harry Potter que no se haya dicho ya  Creo que la mega famosa saga del mago de Hogwarts ha tenido millones de criticas durante su exito mundial  Pero dejadme contaros algo personal sobre estos libros    Para mi Harry Potter me abrio las puertas a la escritura  a la imaginacion y a la creatividad  Recuerdo con 12 anos leyendo Harry Potter y la Piedra Filosofal y pensar  wow  algun dia me encantaria crear mundos y personajes asi de imaginativos  Creo que estos libros se acabaran convirtiendo en grandes clasicos de la literatura y es una forma estupenda para que cualquier nino del mundo que se este iniciando en la devoradora aficion de la lectura deberia leer algun dia         Esa gente nunca comprendera a Harry   Sera famoso    una leyenda    no me sorprenderia que hoy sea conocido como en el futuro como el dia de Harry Potter    escribiran libros sobre Harry Potter    cada nino en el mundo conocera su nombre  Ay pero que chistosa Rowling   no Admitamoslo  este es el libro mas choto de la saga  Ridiculo en partes  abusa del deus ex machina  repite expresiones    pero  c mon   es Harry Potter  Y lo amo  si  Lo termine con una sonrisa  Porque lo que significa esta saga para mi no significa ningun otro libro   No hay mal ni bien  solo poder  y aquellos demasiado debiles para buscarlo          Despues de todo  para una mente bien preparada  la muerte no es mas que la siguiente aventura  Nada mas para decir    Primera vez leido desde el 25 de May  hasta el 1 de Jun  del 2014  Segunda vez leido Releido desde el 18 de Ene  hasta el 20 de Ene  del 2015   Oh  podras pensar que no soy bonito pero no juzques por lo que ves Me comere a mi mismo si puedes

mediopara lograr sus fines Asi que pruebame   No tengas miedo  Y no recibiras una bofetada Estas en buenas manos  aunque yo no las tenga  Porque soy el Sombrero Pensante   Es hora de confesarme   Harry Potter no es mi libro de la infancia como todo el mundo  no me burlo ni nada  a decir verdad  ni tengo libro de infancia  Tambien   Saben cuando supe que las peliculas de HP eran adaptadas en los libros  En la ultima pelicula  y no me averguenzo de decirlo  hasta me alegro de leerlo mucho anos despues de que se han publicado los libros y las peliculas igual  La primera vez que lei Harry Potter fue el ano pasado en ePub ingles  ademas fue mi primer libro en ingles que lei  Gracias Carmen  y fue bastante facil y sencillo leerlo  pero ahora que lo releo  me prometi que lo iba a releer iniciando el ano  lo ame  Solamente para aclarar  lo he releido en espanol fisico Ame demasiado este libro  Aunque ha sido el primero de esta saga  y espero que en los demas mejore   no me pudo gustar menos   Por fin pude entender todas las dudas que tenia mientras veia las peliculas  Todas las aventuras que tiene Harry son increibles  el trama solamente me hizo continuar hasta acabar el libro ademas de que tenia sus partes comicas y conoci mas a fondo todos los detalles  los personajes  Howgarts  el trama  el misterio  todo  Gracias J K  por haber creado este mundo  Lo digo muy tarde pero da igual  he amado demasiado este libro No espero para continuar con Harry Potter y la camara secreta Gracias Yas  y Cande por leerlo conmigo  Son las mejores  So I finally bit the bullet and dove into J K  Rowling s culturally phenomenal Harry Potter series and I have to say I came away impressed I m not going to talk about the plot because  well  if you don t have some inkling of that then what can I tell you other than to poke your head out from under the rock every once in a while  So let me just say that what we have here is an exemplary specimen of characterization  world building  and plotting Rowling has got a knack for detail  And not just the ones on the page  but the ones that aren t  She s got a talent for giving the reader just enough to know what s going  but not so much that the narrative gets stuck in a quagmire of description  For example    Get the mail  Dudley   said Uncle Vernon from behind his paper   Make Harry get it    Get the mail  Harry    Make Dudley get it    Poke him with your smelting stick  Dudley   Harry dodged the smelting stick and went to get the mail It s as clean a passage you re likely to find  with just enough there and no more  The exchange is easy enough to track w out dialog tags  the lack of which makes the passage an eminently quicker read  Further  note how she skips the action of Dudley poking Harry and gets right to Harry s REACTION Even our first glimpse of Hogwarts is a simple and general presentation   Perched atop a high mountain on the other side  its windows sparkling in the starry sky  was a vast castle with many turrets and towers  This economy has two effects  both of which are critical for a successful YA book  First  it makes for a quick  easy read  The second is that it leaves a lot of room for the reader to insert themselves  to imagine the Hogwarts of THEIR fantasies That Rowling is able to paint so well with such broad strokes is a testament to both her intuitive understanding of her readers and her trust in them  She seems to have an innate sense of where the line between threadbare vagueness and indulgent description lays and treads it like a wirewalker I m also impressed with how seamlessly she s able to integrate various Western mythologies into one tapestry  pulling tropes effortlessly into the story  Greek  medieval European  Nordic  Pagan  Christian But what I m most impressed with is how solid the personalities of her three central protagonists are  How deeply she must have thought about them  how their personalities both conflict and harmonize with one another  Hermione  who wears achievment like a security blanket  the voice of reason  The way Harry can show Ron how to appreciate what s under his nose  Harry  the rash hero who relates to the outsider and the underdog because he d been one all his life  And all of them with backstories that succinctly explain their motivations and insecurities  If you think this is easy  try it sometime Yes  the book has it s flaws  Rowling does tend to wrap things up a bit too snappily  breezily on occasion  And while  like all great children s literature  from fairie tales to Roald Dahl   Rowling touches on very dark subject matter  death  loss  the nature of evil   I m never fully convinced that our heroes are in true danger  Though I ll admit it s hard for me to discern if that s only because I know there are 6 more books to come  Harry Potter is the most miserable  lonely boy you can imagine  He s shunned by his relatives  the Dursley s  that have raised him since he was an infant  He s forced to live in the cupboard under the stairs  forced to wear his cousin Dudley s hand me down clothes  and forced to go to his neighbour s house when the rest of the family is doing something fun  Yes  he s just about as miserable as you can get  Harry s world gets turned upside down on his 11th birthday  however  A giant  Hagrid  informs Harry that he s really a wizard  and will soon be attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry  Harry also learns that  in the wizarding world  he s a hero  When he was an infant  the evil Lord Voldemort killed his parents and then tried to kill Harry too  What s so amazing to everyone is that Harry survived  and allegedly destroyed Voldemort in the process  When Harry hears all this  he doesn t know what to think  However  everything Hagrid tells him turns out to be true  and with a joyful heart Harry starts wizarding school in September  He quickly becomes best friends with a boy named Ron Weasley  and before they even make it to Christmas  they break tons of school rules when they attack a troll and prevent it from killing fellow student Hermione Granger  After the troll incident  the three become inseparable  and Harry is amazed to have found such great friends  He is constantly busy trying to stay on top of the mounds of homework  as well as participating in weekly Quidditch practices  Quidditch is a popular sport among wizards and Harry is the youngest Quidditch player in over a century  It s also a game Harry loves more than anything else at school  As the year progresses  the three friends set out to solve the mystery of the gigantic three headed dog that is guarding something in a deserted corridor in the school  They figure out that a very valuable object  the Sorcerer s Stone  is being hidden in the school  although they don t know why  When one of the professor s starts acting as if he s trying to steal it  they quickly take action to circumvent the theft  Things come to a head when they sneak past the vicious  three headed dog and go down into the bowels of the school  determined to save the stone  Ron and Hermione help Harry get through the challenges set forth to stop the thief  but Harry must go on alone to battle the professor  When he finally gets to the last room  however  he s astonished to find someone else entirely  Harry is forced to do battle with the wizard that tried to kill him so many years before  Lord Voldemort  He s able to save the Sorcerer s Stone  although he s almost killed in process  The school headmaster  Dumbledore  arrives just in time to save Harry  The school year ends spectacularly  Harry  Ron  and Hermione are honored for their service to the school  and Harry leaves to go back to the Dursley s for the summer feeling as if he s finally found a place where he really belongs  How can more than half of my Goodreads friends be wrong with this I have to get this right  As of this writing  I have 98 Goodreads friends  61  62   of them have read J  K  Rowling s Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone  Out of those who read this  39  64   rated this with 5 stars  11 of them with 4 stars  All the others gave 3 or 2  Only 2 rated this with 1 star  One of them admitted not being able to finish it  She should not have rated it really since she did not read its entirety   But she is my friend and it is her right  so why question  When the book came out in 1998  I was not yet a bookworm so I brushed this aside  I read only those books that my brother told me to read  He was the bookworm but he would not be caught reading any book being pushed by media hype  However  when Warner Bros  released the film adaptation in 2001  my daughter was 6 years old and I thought that  since there was too much hype  the movie must be good and we would have a memorable time with our first ever father daughter movie date  I was wrong  She not only got scared because of the darkness inside the movie house but she trembled with fear during the life size human chess game  in that scene when Ron was sacrificed  We left the movie in that scene with my daughter crying and me cursing it   I will never read Harry Potter  My daughter is now 15 going 16  She is not fond of movies and she still does not show interest on reading Harry Potter  However  I am now a bookworm and the other week  I was with my 4 Goodreads friends and 3 of them raved  two of them  again  about Harry Potter books  Oh well  first time fathers can make mistakes about first movie date with their daughters  Book 1 is included in 500 Must Read Books and the book must be a quick read  So the following day  I bought my copy After 13 years of the book s existence and me ignoring it  did I finally make a good decision of reading it  Are all of those 39 friends of mine in Goodreads wrong in giving this 5 stars  Most of them did not bother writing a review  Maybe those would be too long or maybe they read this when they were not in Goodreads yet  But I am in Goodreads already so I can make this review long These are what some of them say  it was a great book i enjoyed reading it  For an eloquent reviewer  she must have been too happy to express herself   Such a great story and creative way of writing  I love Harry Potter    Yes  I agree about the story being great and J  K  Rowling being creative   I was secretly wishing I was studying in Hogwarts too  It was silly  but I was simply enraptured by Harry Potter  Honestly  I still am    It was a great book  I enjoyed reading it  Coming from one of my favorite reviewers in Goodreads  I do not share her wanting to be a sorcerer though   Honestly  I don t know anybody who d refuse to even entertain the thought of attending a school for wizards   Another one of my favorite reviewers  That seems to have nailed this  Young people wanting to be in Hogwarts and study sorcery  That should be it  The world seems to be a dreadful place that we would all like to have powers to turn our enemies into frogs  pigs  ride on a broomstick and get the Snitch and earn points  money  for our family Oh well  the Bible says that sorcery is Satan s work  The book even used the word Transfiguration as a subject in the sorcery school  Blasphemy Just kidding  This is a work of fiction and I am not too old to appreciate it  I was just kidding  To be frank  I tried hard not to like this  I thought that giving this a 1 or 2 will freak out my friends and somehow get votes from those who are  up to now  ignoring this book  I told you so  Why waste your time    However  unless you are a grumpy old man woman  there is nothing not to like about this book  I maybe too old for it but hey  talent is talent and J  K  Rowling has it My 39 friends are indeed right     He couldn t know that at this very moment  people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices   To Harry Potter   the boy who lived     What can I really say about the Harry Potter series that hasn t already been said before When I was younger  I ve always wanted to read the Harry Potter books  But as a child  I was intimidated by how thick the books were  including the first installment which also happens to be one of the more shorter books in the series  It s a funny thought now considering how I read books even more than double the size of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone  But last year  I made a resolution to read all the Harry Potter books starting in January and finishing no later than April because Universal Studios is finally opening  The Wizarding World of Harry Potter  theme park in California  And what better way to reward myself for finishing the series than taking a journey through the magical world of Harry Potter  Chocolate Frogs  Bertie Bott s  Butter Beer  Hogwarts HERE I COME With that being said  I really enjoyed this book as much as I thought I would  I loved seeing all the   bonus scenes   and dialogue that were excluded from the film and how different everything seemed as opposed to watching the films  However  I think I did enjoy the movie a bit more than the book  Maybe it s because I grew up watching the Harry Potter movies  and still do several times every year   rather than growing up and reading the books  So if anything  it s actually kind of backwards for me I ve noticed that the movie took on a more  darker  atmosphere compared to the lighter  more kid friendly mood that the book possessed  A good example of this for me would be the Sorting Hat scene  In the movie  the Hat actually frightened and freaked me out and to be honest  it still does  But in the book  everyone s all happy and singing  and just WAY different from how I would ve pictured it if I would have read the book first  then watched the movie   PI m really glad that the movie did such a fantastic job at depicting this book and  in some ways   made it even better   I thought I already knew the Wizarding World like the back of my hand but after reading Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone  it opened my eyes to a whole new perception that the movies could never have given me  Although being a fan isn t determined by whether or not you ve read all the books or watched all the movies  I m really proud of myself for finally tackling this once childhood fear of mine to read the Harry Potter series  And for me  it feels as if I m kicking it up a notch as a Harry Potter fanatic who s seen the movies  and is finally one step closer to finishing the books     I primarily wanted to reread this book in honor of the Banned Books Week  this series is  1 on the Top 100 Banned Challenged Books  2000 2009 list   It also happened that I was on vacation in Orlando and  surely enough  a Universal Studios Hogwarts visit was a must  Oh  the nostalgia  A lot has been said already about the series  so I won t repeat  I just feel very  very sad for the kids whose parents choose to ban these books from their houses and their lives  To take something so wondrous  imaginative  so magical from children is pretty much a crime in my eyes  These books have given me a lot pleasure over the years  but I have to praise them especially for their ability to turn the old me and my equally old husband into children who can still sigh in delight at seeing Hogwarts  the Sorting Hat  the Olivander s  almost  come to life and smile from ear to ear just because we were drinking butterbeer at Three Broomsticks  it s very tasty  BTW   I ve been there and  flown  on a broomstick with Harry Potter   To be honest I just got this for the illustrations  which I loved  But I did feel like there was A LOT of empty space that could have been more illustrations but other than that this was really fun   Ok  so this was my first time reading this book  don t judge me   While I wasn t quite as enamored with it as the thousands of adoring fans  the ones who have read them over and over and over  have been  this wasn t a bad read  I did have to keep reminding myself that this was a children s book  and I m WAY past the target age  My son and daughter in law  along with the RMFAO group  have been after me to read these books  I m actually looking forward to reading the rest of the books  just to see how the books  and the characters  grow up  I haven t seen the movies  but I don t live under a rock either  and I know that each book progressively ages with the characters  turning from children s books with child like problems  to books with adult issues and adult responses from the characters  I m really hoping that things in the next books aren t so easy for Harry  Ron  and Hermione to solve  That s probably my biggest complaint  and why it  only  got four stars from me  everything was too easy  that the mysteries were laid out too simply and were easily solved  They were clever  and again  I had to keep reminding myself that it wasn t written with me in mind This first book was entertaining  as I ve said  but it wasn t a five star read  I m going to be in trouble for that statement  I think    It reminded me of a mash up between the old Hardy Boys Nancy Drew books  kids solving crimes with skills well beyond their age or abilities  and Scooby Doo  Yes  Scooby Doo  Especially at the end when the real bad guy was revealed  it wasn t who they thought it was   and the bad guy s reaction was   Darn you  meddling kids    or something very similar    DOn to the next book  Because everyone on the planet excluding me and maybe some of the Kardashians have read this series  I ll skip the plot summary and go for a less formal review  I can see why so many people adore Harry Potter  While Rowling does not introduce anything particularly groundbreaking in terms of fantasy or plot or characterization  she does abide by the hero s quest with great precision  Harry is the underdog from the start and you can t help but cheer him on as he overcomes obstacles with the help of his friends and his mentor  Each of the characters has a distinct personality  and Rowling s simple writing style leaves room for brevity and enough imagery to pull you into the setting  Story wise  she includes all of the necessary elements  foreshadowing  conflicts that escalate to the climax  a pretty satisfying plot twist  etc I ll probably read one other book in between each installment of this series  I m looking forward to seeing the characters mature and the plot become darker as many others have said it will  With the Harry Potter series  J K  Rowling is the God of the most important rule of story telling  be interesting  She might not be the best writer in the world  although she is very good  But damn can she tell an interesting story From the first sentence  she lets you know you re in store for something fun  There s just that magical touch to it that only she seems to have  And she keeps it going through the whole book  and the six others in the series  without missing a beat The Sorcerer s Stone is packed with mystery  It starts early and picks up speed  and the reveal is quite the surprise  unlike in most kids books where things go down Scooby Doo style But the thing that really makes this book stand out is the characters  Harry Potter  I ended up hating him  But in this book  he s fine  But even the minor characters here have more personality than the protagonist of most books These books might not be the best  but there s nothing like them  They re just magical  Plain and simple  4 4 5 starsThis is my second time reading Sorcerer s Stone  but it will be my first time reading the rest of the series  I will no longer be an HP virgin  Of course  I ve seen all the movies  but I m ready to live the magic of the actual books  I felt like a kid again reading this  Ron and Hermione are already winning  Harry and that mirror had me tearing up  and I love Dumbledore with his mixture of quiet  powerful wisdom and surprising kookiness      Onto Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets  Since pretty much everyone I know has read these books  I figure reviewing them is pretty pointless  But with the new book coming out in a couple of weeks  I have to go through them beginning to end  To make the reviews more entertaining  I will be doing them in a variety of unexpected formats  For this review  I will be writing as someone incapable of suspending his disbelief This book was terrible  I mean  this author is obviously on drugs or insane or something like that  and why she has been allowed to publish such patent nonsense is beyond me  What is even more horrifying is that so many people  adults and children  are supporting this madwoman  I mean  even some of my friends and family  people I respect have come under her spell Her spell  Ha  As though such things as spells and magic really exist  I know she and her hoard of followers believe so  but we  the right thinking  rational people of the world know better  don t we The beginning was okay  and I had high hopes for it  I thought it might be an interesting story about this family  the Dursleys  who seem to be people after my own heart  Sensible  no nonsense folk  these  who know what s real and what isn t  But within ten pages  I knew something wasn t right  Think about this   some crazy old man in robes shows up with a tiny device that can put out streetlights from a distance  A cat changes into a woman  Outrageous  And then the flying motorcycle  and nonsensical ravings about magicians and dark lords and curses  and that s where it all started to go downhill I forced myself to slog through this mess of nonsense  though by the time I got to chapter five  I had pretty much given up  Nothing this book describes could possibly take place in the real world  and it is almost criminal that she should get this kind of fame and attention  She is a font of nonsense and mayhem  poisoning the minds of everyone her work touches  If you haven t read these books  I recommend that you stay away from them  If you have  then I beg you to come to your senses and embrace the real world  Give up this madness and join us over here in the world where truth is truth and Harry Potter is meaningless vapor  Having just read this for the first time  I definitely missed the boat  My taste in books now skews a little darker  At the same time  I m glad I finally read it and though I don t think it was the best book of all time or anything  I can definitely understand the hype  I m sure I ll eventually read all the books  in which case I ll understand the fandom and probably be a super fan myself  Ten prote phora pou gelasa eis barous tes sugkekrimenes seiras etan sto South Park se ena epeisodio phoro times sto Lord Of the Rings pou e parea sunantaei kati

khamogelo  The number of times I ve read this book has gotten out of hand and yet  I can never get tired of reading Harry Potter Although I believe I should mark this as my first time reading the books in English  all the previous times has been the translated version  It s like a whole other world  Almost as if I m reading the book a for the first time  This is Harry Potter  And this is his story J K  Rowling wrote a fantastic book  And this is not only a childrens book  This is an ALL Age book  She wrote about a world which is magical and beauiful at the same time  She wrote about creatures and spells which people use today  I am still impressed by this author and her creativity  There is no book I could compare to Harry Potter Without Harry Potter we wouldn t have Harry Potter Especially the movies have a special place in my heart  It wasn t called this at all   but for some reason the title changed in the US and there is no original title versions of this on this site  which is also strange  How terribly odd  Anyway  I read this to the kids   in fact  the first four books to them   just before the tidal wave of popularity  We had just finished reading all the books of Dahl and were looking for something else to be getting on with   and there was this article in the paper saying that the Fundamentalist Christians wanted this book banned Well  let s face it  there is no higher recommendation for a book and I remain grateful to the Christian community for pointing me in the right direction with this one After the forth book my youngest daughter started reading them to me   there are few joys in life that are surpassed by books or daughters  mixing them together was always going to be a highlight  and how could it not be These books got better as they went on   the last one was particularly good   It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live  3 5 starsI m sure this thick book became even more legendary than the author ever dreamed it would Rowling uses cookie cutter characters to create a fascinating world of magic  wizardry  and the great divide between good and evil which has always captivated all age groups and which always will  The world building is one reason the novels   and then movies   became so famous  Getting that invite to Hogwarts must be such fun   I m sure many normals in this world fantasize it happening to them at that age Harry Potter is likeable  but simple  His friends are the same  The villain promises to be a fascinating one but he s not really uncovered yet save for whispers of legends and foreshadowing  The book was especially enjoyable at the beginning  where Harry is unfortunate in his demented average family  There s humor that works  sometimes  pushing the story along  The real excitement starts when Harry steps foot onto Hogwarts ground  meeting the bizarre blend of professors  other students  potions  classes  and challenges I know the movie was rated poorly by some in comparison to the book  To me it s almost word for word  including dialogue  Some of it  such as emotion  worked better in page form  I do have to prefer some of the movie though  especially when playing Quidditch  because the effects made it more interesting  I think Rowling drug it out too long in book form  and because of this dragging on I grew a little bored at times Overall a cute and quirky  simple novel that opens a door to a world that skyrocketed  I m hoping I enjoy the later novels more  just like I did with the movies  2015 Reading Challenge   15 Primer libro autor popular Nunca es demasiado tarde para empezar esta saga    lo disfrute un monton  Reread 2015   4 never too old for this stars 4 25 5Ya se  no hay ninguna excusa para el hecho de que no habia leido Harry Potter hasta ahora  aunque en mi defensa cuando se publico estaba en el vientre de mi madre  pero bueno mejor tarde que nunca   No No crei que me fuera a apegar con los personajes y la historia desde el principio aunque a lo mejor influyo el hecho de que ya habia visto las peliculas anteriormente  lo bueno es que no recuerdo nada de las peliculas asi que puedo leerlo con nuevos ojos  El mundo en este primer libro esta muy bien construido al igual que los personajes para tener tan pocas paginas  Obviamente mis personajes favoritos fueron Harry  Ron y Hermonie  pero los gemelos Weasley sin duda tambien estan entre mis favoritos  Rowling tiene una imaginacion que va mas alla de mi comprension y una pluma fluida que te atrapa sin dejarte respirar  en el buen sentido  No se que mas puedo decir que ya no se haya dicho acerca de este maravilloso libro  asi que hasta aqui mi resena  Si no lo han leido no sigan mi ejemplo y leanlo lo mas rapido posible   Oh go to hell  These things are like crack So I just finished the 7th one and I have no intention of re reading them  though I do have fond memories of them  My most recent encounter with Harry Potter was on an airplane a couple of days ago  This humongous 16 year old kid from North Dakota was sitting next to me reading the 5th book  He smelled like cereal and farts and was audibly mouth breathing for the whole flight  I tried to engage him in conversation periodically to get his little whistle to quiet down for a few minutes at a time  We chatted about the little bastards at Hogrwarts and it kind of got me misty   not for the books  but for how terrible high school was even though I didn t realize it at the time  And this kid clearly didn t either  He just wanted to read his book and make it home  I wanted to tell him that in 10 years he wouldn t even remember what his goddamn school looked like  Instead I tried to convince him that what he heard about Dumbledore dying in the 6th one wasn t true  Stay strong  brother   Anyone heard of this  It s not bad  It s about a kid who goes to school   no really  it s more interesting than it sounds  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone is a book about  view spoiler     seriously  What rock did you just crawl out from under   hide spoiler   INTERNATIONAL GIVEAWAY OF THE NEW HARRY POTTER PAPERBACK BOX SET ON MY BLOG         I m the only person in the world with mixed feelings about the Harry Potter books  Most readers love them  There are non readers who are indifferent to them as they are to all other books  others who go solely by the fact that they re  children s  books and therefore believe it s ridiculous for adults to read and enjoy them  and of course a legion of similarly anti literacy folk who have decided the Harry Potter books are immoral  These people  who read and enjoy Tolkien  C S  Lewis  and stories about Merlin and King Arthur  have concluded that the Potter universe is an evil place because it has magic and witches  All righty  then  I suppose there are readers who genuinely dislike the Harry Potter books  I haven t come across them  but they must be out there somewhere  And of course there must be readers who say they dislike them when what they mean is  they re wildly jealous that they didn t write them I don t belong in any of those categories  I admire the fine writing  characterization  dialogue  and world building Rowling has done  And exactly because her writing is so good  the one flaw I ve found pains me to the point that I can t read these with the pure pleasure they give so many others The only person I ve talked to about this who s been willing to listen long enough to understand what I m saying is the one person I know who hasn t read the books and has no plans to  He thinks I make a valid point  Everyone else I ve attempted to engage on this topic has responded   You re saying something bad about Harry Potter  You must be bad  I hate you  Please leave my home   Or words to that effect  I ll grant you that accepting flaws in things we love is a little taught skill in this world  It s almost as rare as seeing good qualities in those we hate  This is as true with books as it is with people  and it s tragic  I have yet to meet someone who can acknowledge the admirable qualities of books they can t stand  I don t mean genuinely bad books  the kind that will be pulped a year after they were printed  if they last that long  or that will never make it to paper in the first place not because technology is awesome but because  nobody  wants to waste the paper on these works  No  I mean books that have stood the test of time but who have as many haters as lovers Perfect example  Little Women  People adore this book  or they despise it Listen up   Little Women  is corny  mawkish  and sentimental  It s also wise  funny  and strong  Whether you like the book or you hate it  if you can t admit that all of this is true and this can all be true at the same time about the same book  you have a serious ego problem  You can t admit that the book you love could have anything wrong with it    Krinkle  krinkle   ittle  tar   Really  That s not cringe inducing  Calling a grown woman  Marmee  isn t cringe inducing  Having the one black child at Jo s school for boys be the best singer isn t seriously cringe inducing    Or else you refuse to entertain the idea that anything you hate could have anything right about it   Marmee s advice to Meg about the difference between the flashing tempers of the March girls and the temperament of the man Meg married stands the test of time very well  as do plenty of the other observations of humanity    when Jo laughingly admits that she s well enough to go on a carriage ride with Laurie  but not well enough to do disagreeable chores  and then karma kicks her in the arse  Which it tends to do a lot in this book  Put your ego aside when thinking about and discussing literature  Good books are not saints  They should be admired  enjoyed  learned from  and reread  but they should also be critically examined  And if I ve done all that with the Harry Potter books and I ve found something I think is a serious flaw  it would be nice to be able to discuss that  rather than be glared and yelled at  yes  both have happened  and yes  I m still angry  because I have the unmitigated gall to find something wrong with Saint Jo For anyone who s still reading  I m very uncomfortable with one aspect of the world Rowling has created  Specifically  I don t think her justification for hiding the existence of magic from the world of ordinary humans stands up well in a court of ethics This is a review of the first book  so I ll only go into what she says here  When Harry Potter first learns who is parents really are  Hagrid is furious at the Dursleys for not having told him anything about what he calls Harry s world   Our world  I mean  Your world  My world  Yer parents  world   It s terribly wrong not to have told Harry who and what he is  and who and what his parents were  Agreed  How  then  is it all right to hide what is  after all  the real world from the majority of its inhabitants  How is it all right to scorn them for not having magic while at the same time doing everything to keep them from knowing magic exists Don t say there s no scorn   Muggle  is hardly a term of endearment   Yes  I m jumping ahead of myself and I promised I wouldn t  but  mud blood  is nothing but an extension of the condescension contained in  Muggle    And as for the attitude towards the mundane world  look at Hagrid    one of the good guys  certainly  and a very appealing character  Although Hagrid seemed to know where he was going  he was obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary way  He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the Underground and complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow  I don t know how the Muggles manage without magic   he said  as they climbed a broken down escalator  We manage because you won t let us do otherwise  And then you sneer at the job we do Let me ask you something  Do you really believe that  separate but equal  can be both  That s not how it works in the real world  and it s not how it works in Potter s world  The magical beings there are an elite minority  and they like it that way  They have the power  They re hanging on to it by force  more about that in later books   even when that puts the inhabitants of the mundane world at risk  WAY more about that in later books  Let me ask you something else  If you read and enjoy Austen s novels in the way that many people do    taking pleasure in imagining yourself a member of that world    you imagine yourself as one of the genteel  right  Not one of the servants  We see very little of them  and they have miserable lives  The power situation in Austen s time was horribly imbalanced and unfair  Austen wasn t in much of a position to do anything about it  but at least she didn t have her characters brag all the time about how awesome it was to be of the land owning class  and how pathetic those stupid servants are In fact  the one character I can think of who does complain about servants is Aunt Norris  and she s an out and out villain  Her observations on the serving class are meant to reinforce just what a nasty piece of work she is One person I know claimed that in the Potter universe  the magic users keep their existence and powers a secret in order to protect themselves  That s contradicted later    I think in book  3  in which Harry reads a textbook about how much real witches enjoy being burned at the stake because it tickles and doesn t do them any harm    but for now I ll just point out what Hagrid says when Harry asks why the Ministry of Magic  keeps it from the Muggles that there s still witches an  wizards up an  down the country   Blimey  Harry  everyone d be wantin  magic solutions to their problems  Nah  we re best left alone  If Rowling wanted to make a universe in which a failed attempt had been made in the past to live on equal terms with the non magic world  and that attempt had led to great suffering and many lives lost on both sides  that would be perfectly tenable   And fascinating  Somebody  write that book  Okay  I will   If she wanted to claim that magic users would be persecuted by the ordinary humans  and the magicians might have the magic but the mundane world had the sheer numbers and a lot of nasty technology on their side  that would certainly work  And then I could read these books without a qualm Instead  she s created a world in which a ruling class cheerfully admits that they like having all the really cool stuff and they re jolly well not going to share with those foolish mortals who are so stupid  they have to struggle up broken escalators What troubles me even more than her making this decision  which  as I ve pointed out  is not the only way to go if you want to have a world of hidden magic  is how enthusiastically her readers have embraced it  There are  No Muggles Allowed  posters and Facebook pages  Created and enjoyed by people who don t seem to realize that  just as they d more likely be a servant than gentility in Austen s world  odds are good they d be Muggles in Rowling s  People who have felt odd and left out all their lives naturally embrace the idea that secretly  they re special and strong    magical  even  I only question the idea that having wonderful abilities has to go hand in hand with lording it over those who don t  How is the Potter universe s attitude toward non magic users any different from Malfoy s gloating over his entirely inherited monetary wealth  and sneering at Ron s poverty I m very uncomfortable with the Potter universe because I don t have the ego to believe I d be one of the special ones  I m rereading these with my son because he doesn t remember them very well and his grandmother kindly lent us an entire hardcover library of the British editions  This journey has its pleasures  but it s the last I ll take to the Potter world  It s no place for Muggles UPDATE  I m now about a hundred pages into the British edition of the last Harry Potter book  and I m already seriously considering rereading the whole series just to have the entire  incredibly complex plot fresh in my head for once  Yes  the things that bug me philosophically about this series still bother me  but the writing is just too good for even cranky old me to resist   Is there any point in saying anything about Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone anymore  Not really  Not as far as critiques go  If I were to delve into some interesting critical analysis of an issue raised in The Philosopher s Stone  or take a critical look at Rowling s authorship  then maybe   but most everything that can be said about liking or disliking the book  about its excellence or its shabbiness has been said And while I feel I may eventually take a stand for those who appreciate JK Rowling s world of witches and wizards  who think that these books occasionally achieve real excellence  who connect emotionally to any one of the impressive characters she has drawn  I officially concede my inability to do so here But I will make this observation  those who equate the Twilight series to the Harry Potter series for entertainment value  quality of storytelling  cultural influence  influence on literacy  or the writing chops of their authors are people you do NOT want to be taking book advice from There is more than something in the Harry Potter series worth reading  I couldn t find anything worth reading in the works of Stephenie Meyer  except that it had been published   This was so much better than I remember it being  this time around I read the whole thing in one sitting  I love Neville  I now want to re read the entire series Not perfect  but pretty bloody awesome The end  4 i m worth twelve of you draco Stars Dva Khari Pot ra v edno  http   knigolandia info

 let me tell you something personal about these books    For me  Harry Potter opened me the doors to writing  imagination and creativity  I still remember when I was 12 years and I started to read Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone and I thought  Wow  someday I d love to create worlds and characters so imaginative as these I think Harry Potter will become classics of literature and in my opinion these books is a great book for any child in the world to discover the passion of reading Spanish version  Que decir de los libros de Harry Potter que no se haya dicho ya  Creo que la mega famosa saga del mago de Hogwarts ha tenido millones de criticas durante su exito mundial  Pero dejadme contaros algo personal sobre estos libros    Para mi Harry Potter me abrio las puertas a la escritura  a la imaginacion y a la creatividad  Recuerdo con 12 anos leyendo Harry Potter y la Piedra Filosofal y pensar  wow  algun dia me encantaria crear mundos y personajes asi de imaginativos  Creo que estos libros se acabaran convirtiendo en grandes clasicos de la literatura y es una forma estupenda para que cualquier nino del mundo que se este iniciando en la devoradora aficion de la lectura deberia leer algun dia         Esa gente nunca comprendera a Harry   Sera famoso    una leyenda    no me sorprenderia que hoy sea conocido como en el futuro como el dia de Harry Potter    escribiran libros sobre Harry Potter    cada nino en el mundo conocera su nombre  Ay pero que chistosa Rowling   no Admitamoslo  este es el libro mas choto de la saga  Ridiculo en partes  abusa del deus ex machina  repite expresiones    pero  c mon   es Harry Potter  Y lo amo  si  Lo termine con una sonrisa  Porque lo que significa esta saga para mi no significa ningun otro libro   No hay mal ni bien  solo poder  y aquellos demasiado debiles para buscarlo          Despues de todo  para una mente bien preparada  la muerte no es mas que la siguiente aventura  Nada mas para decir    Primera vez leido desde el 25 de May  hasta el 1 de Jun  del 2014  Segunda vez leido Releido desde el 18 de Ene  hasta el 20 de Ene  del 2015   Oh  podras pensar que no soy bonito pero no juzques por lo que ves Me comere a mi mismo si puedes encontrarun sombrero mas inteligente que yo Puedes tener bombines negros sombreros altos y elegantes Pero yo soy el Sombrero Seleccionador de Hogwartsy puedo superar a todos No hay nada escondido en tu cabezaque el Sombrero Seleccionador no pueda ver Asi que pruebate y te diredonde debes estar Puedes pertenecer a Gryffindor donde habitan los valientes Su osadia  temple y caballerosidadponen aparte a los de Gryffindor Puedes pertenecer a Hufflepuff donde son justos y leales Esos perseverantes Hufflepuffde verdad no temen el trabajo pesado O tal vez a la antigua sabiduria de Ravenclaw Si tienes una mente dispuesta porque los de inteligencia y erudicionsiempre encontraran alli a sus semejantes O tal vez en Slytherinharas tus verdaderos amigos Esa gente astuta utiliza cualquier mediopara lograr sus fines Asi que pruebame   No tengas miedo  Y no recibiras una bofetada Estas en buenas manos  aunque yo no las tenga  Porque soy el Sombrero Pensante   Es hora de confesarme   Harry Potter no es mi libro de la infancia como todo el mundo  no me burlo ni nada  a decir verdad  ni tengo libro de infancia  Tambien   Saben cuando supe que las peliculas de HP eran adaptadas en los libros  En la ultima pelicula  y no me averguenzo de decirlo  hasta me alegro de leerlo mucho anos despues de que se han publicado los libros y las peliculas igual  La primera vez que lei Harry Potter fue el ano pasado en ePub ingles  ademas fue mi primer libro en ingles que lei  Gracias Carmen  y fue bastante facil y sencillo leerlo  pero ahora que lo releo  me prometi que lo iba a releer iniciando el ano  lo ame  Solamente para aclarar  lo he releido en espanol fisico Ame demasiado este libro  Aunque ha sido el primero de esta saga  y espero que en los demas mejore   no me pudo gustar menos   Por fin pude entender todas las dudas que tenia mientras veia las peliculas  Todas las aventuras que tiene Harry son increibles  el trama solamente me hizo continuar hasta acabar el libro ademas de que tenia sus partes comicas y conoci mas a fondo todos los detalles  los personajes  Howgarts  el trama  el misterio  todo  Gracias J K  por haber creado este mundo  Lo digo muy tarde pero da igual  he amado demasiado este libro No espero para continuar con Harry Potter y la camara secreta Gracias Yas  y Cande por leerlo conmigo  Son las mejores  So I finally bit the bullet and dove into J K  Rowling s culturally phenomenal Harry Potter series and I have to say I came away impressed I m not going to talk about the plot because  well  if you don t have some inkling of that then what can I tell you other than to poke your head out from under the rock every once in a while  So let me just say that what we have here is an exemplary specimen of characterization  world building  and plotting Rowling has got a knack for detail  And not just the ones on the page  but the ones that aren t  She s got a talent for giving the reader just enough to know what s going  but not so much that the narrative gets stuck in a quagmire of description  For example    Get the mail  Dudley   said Uncle Vernon from behind his paper   Make Harry get it    Get the mail  Harry    Make Dudley get it    Poke him with your smelting stick  Dudley   Harry dodged the smelting stick and went to get the mail It s as clean a passage you re likely to find  with just enough there and no more  The exchange is easy enough to track w out dialog tags  the lack of which makes the passage an eminently quicker read  Further  note how she skips the action of Dudley poking Harry and gets right to Harry s REACTION Even our first glimpse of Hogwarts is a simple and general presentation   Perched atop a high mountain on the other side  its windows sparkling in the starry sky  was a vast castle with many turrets and towers  This economy has two effects  both of which are critical for a successful YA book  First  it makes for a quick  easy read  The second is that it leaves a lot of room for the reader to insert themselves  to imagine the Hogwarts of THEIR fantasies That Rowling is able to paint so well with such broad strokes is a testament to both her intuitive understanding of her readers and her trust in them  She seems to have an innate sense of where the line between threadbare vagueness and indulgent description lays and treads it like a wirewalker I m also impressed with how seamlessly she s able to integrate various Western mythologies into one tapestry  pulling tropes effortlessly into the story  Greek  medieval European  Nordic  Pagan  Christian But what I m most impressed with is how solid the personalities of her three central protagonists are  How deeply she must have thought about them  how their personalities both conflict and harmonize with one another  Hermione  who wears achievment like a security blanket  the voice of reason  The way Harry can show Ron how to appreciate what s under his nose  Harry  the rash hero who relates to the outsider and the underdog because he d been one all his life  And all of them with backstories that succinctly explain their motivations and insecurities  If you think this is easy  try it sometime Yes  the book has it s flaws  Rowling does tend to wrap things up a bit too snappily  breezily on occasion  And while  like all great children s literature  from fairie tales to Roald Dahl   Rowling touches on very dark subject matter  death  loss  the nature of evil   I m never fully convinced that our heroes are in true danger  Though I ll admit it s hard for me to discern if that s only because I know there are 6 more books to come  Harry Potter is the most miserable  lonely boy you can imagine  He s shunned by his relatives  the Dursley s  that have raised him since he was an infant  He s forced to live in the cupboard under the stairs  forced to wear his cousin Dudley s hand me down clothes  and forced to go to his neighbour s house when the rest of the family is doing something fun  Yes  he s just about as miserable as you can get  Harry s world gets turned upside down on his 11th birthday  however  A giant  Hagrid  informs Harry that he s really a wizard  and will soon be attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry  Harry also learns that  in the wizarding world  he s a hero  When he was an infant  the evil Lord Voldemort killed his parents and then tried to kill Harry too  What s so amazing to everyone is that Harry survived  and allegedly destroyed Voldemort in the process  When Harry hears all this  he doesn t know what to think  However  everything Hagrid tells him turns out to be true  and with a joyful heart Harry starts wizarding school in September  He quickly becomes best friends with a boy named Ron Weasley  and before they even make it to Christmas  they break tons of school rules when they attack a troll and prevent it from killing fellow student Hermione Granger  After the troll incident  the three become inseparable  and Harry is amazed to have found such great friends  He is constantly busy trying to stay on top of the mounds of homework  as well as participating in weekly Quidditch practices  Quidditch is a popular sport among wizards and Harry is the youngest Quidditch player in over a century  It s also a game Harry loves more than anything else at school  As the year progresses  the three friends set out to solve the mystery of the gigantic three headed dog that is guarding something in a deserted corridor in the school  They figure out that a very valuable object  the Sorcerer s Stone  is being hidden in the school  although they don t know why  When one of the professor s starts acting as if he s trying to steal it  they quickly take action to circumvent the theft  Things come to a head when they sneak past the vicious  three headed dog and go down into the bowels of the school  determined to save the stone  Ron and Hermione help Harry get through the challenges set forth to stop the thief  but Harry must go on alone to battle the professor  When he finally gets to the last room  however  he s astonished to find someone else entirely  Harry is forced to do battle with the wizard that tried to kill him so many years before  Lord Voldemort  He s able to save the Sorcerer s Stone  although he s almost killed in process  The school headmaster  Dumbledore  arrives just in time to save Harry  The school year ends spectacularly  Harry  Ron  and Hermione are honored for their service to the school  and Harry leaves to go back to the Dursley s for the summer feeling as if he s finally found a place where he really belongs  I read this book for two reasons 1  The movie was coming out  and I love sci fi fantasy movies  and I always like to read the source material before seeing the film 2  I was sick and stuck on my couch for a few days and my cousin Rose was nice enough to lend me the first four books  which was all that was out then  Anyway  I am glad I wound up reading it  because it is one of my favorite series  and I am anxiously awaiting the last book Update  I revisited this book on audio with Stephen Fry narrating it  and it was excellent  Highly recommended  Time for a BUDDY READ with Steph Let s start with my original copy  which I m not reading  it ll fall apart  and the newer copy I was given a couple years ago which I will be reading Full review to come  I liked this book more the second time around  I wish I d read it without having seen the movies a million times before so the story is just very familiar to me  It s not surprising or shocking or astounding  So I simply cannot give it 5 stars even though I really liked it  While this book  of course  is not my in my normal reading genre  I love it for what it is  A charming  clever  well written tale that got a mountain of kids to love books   I actually didn t like Hermione as much as I thought I would  but the Weasley twins really made up for it    There are some things you can t share without ending up liking each other  and knocking out a twelve foot mountain troll is one of them I love reminiscing and reading these books  They truly are my childhood  and they will always be my favourite series  First  I d just like to remind everyone how clever this woman is  There are things in here that she mentions that don t make sense until the final few chapters of the series  That s how perfectly she s planned out every little detail  Everything has some relevance at some point  the blue flames that Hermione uses when they re sitting outside are later really important during the challenges to get the Stone  The Charms class where we learn how to make things fly is important when fighting the troll  Nothing is there just for the sake of it  or just to add a few more pages  Everything is important  even if it doesn t make sense just yet My favourite part of this book is seeing the friendship between the trio grow  Which  of course  is why I had to add that quote to my review  To start with  Hermione is incredibly annoying  I want to punch her almost constantly  But then  she realises that actually  grades aren t everything  You can see her grow so much in under 300 pages  She becomes the girl we all know and love  With Ron  the friendship is a lot more instant  Harry meets the Weasleys on the platform  and from there he s practically one of them  I adore them all  but it s Ron we really get to see in this book  He s completely loyal to Harry  no matter what the risks  Movie watchers forget that  but it s so important  Ron and Hermione really were the best friends Harry could have ever wished for  In my millionth time reading this  I actually found a flaw  Everything is explained in so much detail  apart from the big exciting scene where he s trying to find the Stone  I felt that that bit was rushed  I wanted to know exactly what they were thinking  I wanted long fight scenes  I wanted all of it  but we didn t get nearly enough  Don t get me wrong  it was still genius  I just wish we were given a little bit more  But  I can t fault this book too much  Like I said  it will forever be my favourite series Update  I read this book without stopping this time  I still think this is four stars  I notice some of the things I saw last time I read  The second half of the book was my favorite part and I thought the first part was a long and had the big chunk of world building in it  This made it seem like it was dragging out for me  The major thing that hit me is the plot  I didn t notice the plot this time either  I wish that was really clear for me then this book would hit five stars for me  Harry was easier to connect to this time around  I honestly love the last few chapters of the book they were filled with action and suspense  It past my expectations for the book  I heard so many things about this series but never read it  I didn t really like the movies at all  So I was like the books are awful too I m not going to read them ever in my life  Well I was wrong this book was really good it was amazing like other books but really good  For me as I started to read and got about half way through the book and stopped reading it for a week then finished up  Well that last half was really slow for me I don t know if it was because I stopped or if it just seemed to dragged out  Either way that made me weary about the giving it 5 stars  This book really had a lot of world building plus the chapters were long and seemed to drag out a lot  So that was the only thing that I found wrong with it other that than I liked it For me the plot was a difficult for me to decide what the plot actually was  In the beginning Harry Potter was a normal boy who survived the attack on his parents by Lord Voldemort  He seems quite famous is the Wizard world  Anyways like most main characters they have a tragic back ground  An awful childhood he had  When he turned 11 he kept getting this letters everyday  Wow I thought this was a level of an extreme case of stalking  I mean you don t send letters that much everyday  His uncle decides to rip them up and they kept getting these letters  Hagrid finds Harry they take Harry shopping for school and such  Then there is someone trying to kill him but they think its Snape  I did to as well then there is this huge plot twists then we are at the end of his first year  For me its kinda hard to put everything that happens in a year but she does which means there is a lot of gaps in between everything  Which makes you wonder what happens in between that time and if it was really necessary to drag it out The characters there a ton of them  There is Harry Potter is the main character he is ah he s hard for me to describe because I didn t really feel like I knew him a much as I could  I understood he had a tragic past  I couldn t really connect to all the characters as much as I wanted  Each of them seem distant  Overall all it was an really good book    Me encanto El libro es muy magico  literal y metaforicamente  es  supongo  apenas una probada de todas las aventuras que enfrentara Harry y de todo lo que aprendera en Hogwarts  Me gusto lo sencillo  pero a la misma vez atrapante de la narracion y estoy segura de que habra muchas mas sorpresas en los siguientes libros Los personajes me agradaron mucho  no todos  claro  y me hicieron reir bastante  Las bromas y el sarcasmo de Ron  las ocurrencias de Lee Jordan siendo locutor de los partidos de Quidditch  los siempre oportunos conocimientos de Hermione y como no  la inocencia de Neville  la peculiar amistad de Hagrid y por ultimo pero no menos importante  la valentia de Harry La autora tiene una imaginacion increible y es facil engancharse con la historia  Me ha logrado enganar en una parte asi que supongo y creo que estare en lo cierto que de J K no te debes fiar  no se puede esperar algo porque seguro no es asi   Fue encantador  Harry Potter se merece todo el carino que le tienen los lectores Cita del libro   y vaya que es acertada  El problema es que los humanos tienen el don de elegirprecisamente las cosas que son peores para ellos  Tengo una pregunta  por favor  no me ignoren   si veo  cada vez que termine un libro  su pelicula correspondiente  me dara algun spoiler la pelicula con respecto al siguiente libro  Have you ever waited too long to do something A few times a year  it would come out that I hadn t read Harry Potter  It would intrude on my normal life  this fact  See  I choose my reading through a very witchy  desert peyote  divining rod style of intuition  The river flows  I flow with the river  you know  man  I m overstating but the point is  I can t tell you a lot about what I want to read in the near future  It changes  I gotta go with the vibes  Don t put labels on me  man And don t tell me to just read it already  because it won t work for sixteen goddamn years Okay  I ve seen those movies  I ve seen the internet  which is at least 25  Harry Potter fueled at conservative estimates  So I knew what I was getting  right  But actually I couldn t be sure  A book has got to work on its own  People love these  but how did I know they didn t just love them for all the    stuff  that there is to enjoy  Charming as it is  the frothy lather of hysterical glee completely obfuscates the reading experience of this book  Nothing I am ever likely to see or read could possibly be more highly hyped   And I am also the person who didn t see Star Wars until I was in college      I m an idiot  okay   I think that perhaps when this first was published I was just being a contrary teenager  And then other reasons probably clouded things up  And then  you know  Desert peyote  Divining rod Anyway  What can be said  It s a great book  You know  It s so fun to read  It places every little thing just right  zip  zip  we are having fun and we ve got tons of stuff to care about  Backstory for ages  my favorite  We ve got a castle to sneak around in secret  and I think literally nothing is better than that  You can t beat that  it is a trump card of stories  And of course  I particularly enjoy how fully present the adult characters are  almost to the point of preferring them to the kids  I like them and trust them so much  is this what my heart may come to know as  squee  So  for instance  when I got to the ending  and the kids are the ones who get up in the middle of the evil business at the pivotal time  I started to think   How silly  Probably some of the people who aren t eleven can handle this  Go to bed   Despite it being children s literature where that is required to happen  it s the only part that doesn t really work  since  happily   it s not like the kids are surrounded by fools  I m glad that they re not portrayed as smarter or braver than the Hogwarts teachers  It s just that we need Harry  and his special little forehead  and you know who I m saving the fifth star  Onward   My pre read  Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhmmmmm  HI EVERYBODY  I AM READING THIS FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME     OKAY  BYE        runs away     You know there are some books that are rare  meaningful  and amazing more than any treasure you ever glimpse or possess in the palm of your hand  It s one of those very rare occasions that you can actually find it  Those kinds of books are like gold  diamond  or any valuable treasures  that is hard to find in the ground because it s so valuable  Well  Harry Potter books are certainly those kinds of book that are rare meaningful books and will always hold a special place in my collection  I haven t read this in my earlier childhood years and I wish to now because these books are simply amazing in every way  I guess the reason I waited so long to read it because of the hype and how juvenile and how ridiculous the book might be  but it was much more than that  I don t like reading over hyped books because some of them tend to be disappointing to me  Everyone was saying how good it was and I  being crazy  ignored the hype and didn t read it  I don t know what made me pick up this book  Perhaps  morbid curiosity  I guess so  After reading the first book  I have awakened my love for this spectacular series  I didn t expect myself to love it like so many others have  But now after reading this  I   just love it  I love the world building  characters  and mystery and clues that the characters try to uncover  Now I can finally see why so many readers love this series  The humor  plot  and the characters were developed well in this book  I find myself lost in this book  madly flipping the pages to know more and more of this imaginative world  mystery  and the characters  I was just hooked  I grow to love Hermione  Ron  and Harry  They re such endearing  brave  and very smart characters  I mean who would not love them  All of them are very different from each other  but found a way to connect to one another  I love their friendship and adventures they faced together  They know what it s right and will always have their backs for each other  I also grow to love the mystery in this one  There were surprises twists and turns that I would have never anticipated  but there it was  Harry Potter books are unlike any other books I ve read before  Every book from the series I ve read always has something unique and different from other books I ve read  It has so much to offer  wizards  witches  magic  and humor  Who can t love this  I can easily say this is my favorite series  Anyone can fall in love with this series whether they re old or young  It s an amazing experience to read this series and if any you haven t already  I strongly encourage reading it  I promise you  you will not regret it  Harry Potter books are definitely one of those rare books  but will always and I say always will make a lasting impression Now  I m on to reading Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets and continue until the end _______________________________________If you want to read my reviews of 2nd 7th books of Harry Potter  just click the link below  Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets s review Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban s review Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire s review  Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix s review Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince s review Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows s review Executive Summary  I ve now read this book  not sure how many times   and listened to both versions of the audio  It s more like a 4 5 than 4  but I don t get 5 lightly  It s the book that started the Harry Potter series and I don t imagine I need to tell anyone how good those books are Jim Dale Audio Book  This go round I did the audio book version  which was nice for driving to from work and doing things around the house  I had the Jim Dale version  He s a very good reader  He does descent voices for the various characters Stephen Fry Audio Book  I wanted to see the difference between the Jim Dale and Stephen Fry versions  but if I m perfectly honest that s going to be hard as it s been 2 years since I did the Dale versions  I feel like Dale did a better variety of voices  but the Fry version is certainly quite good  I particularly like his voice for Hagrid  but his voice for Snape sounds wrong  That s probably Alan Rickman s fault though and not Stephen Fry Jury is still out but after 1 book I have to give it to Dale  Full Summary I m not going to bother with a very long review  as this book is very well known at this point  It s been a few years since I last read it  likely as a re read before book 7   It s a great book for re reading  The characters are all well developed and the story pulls you and holds on as you adventure along with Harry as he battles bullies at home  at school  on the quidditch pitch before confronting the ultimate bully in Lord Voldemort  This book introduces the reader to the world of magic and muggles  Of Hogwarts and broomsticks  It s not as good as several of the later books  but it s an excellent kick off and signs of what is to come are quite apparent  I first read this when my daughter was in third grade  I think  She has dyslexia   a learning recall issue  I d heard it was good   picked it up a the school s book fair  After reading it  I was thrilled   got her to read it  She was in special ed for reading at the time   the teacher told me I was over facing her  It did take her a long time to read it  but she really liked the story   stuck with it  By the time she was in 4th grade  she d read through the 3d or 4th one   was hooked on reading  By 5th grade  she no longer needed any special ed for reading   she was reading everything in sight  I credit Rowling s wonderful story for her success at reading  She captured my daughter s imagination  The story is quite good  Fairly unique  imaginative   full of interesting bits  I didn t enjoy the later books as much as I did the first ones  although I think her writing improved as the series wore on  May have just been me burning out on the world  I give it 5 stars because I think it will go down as a classic   Well  what can I say about this book that hasn t been said before  and much better  than me For all 12 of you who don t know the Harry Potter follows the adventures of the titular Harry Potter  a boy who discovers he is in fact a wizard on his 11th birthday  The first book is his  and our  introduction into the secret magical world that operates alongside our own I haven t read the early books in near a decade  so I enjoyed the nostalgic rush of brushing off these old tomes  and by tomes I mean the ebook copy I have on my Android   Rowling starts off with a very Dahl ian style of writing  Her prose is very accessible and easy to read  She really shines using Harry to help readers understand her world of witches and wizards  We re not necessarily always told out right what s going on  left to figure it out with Harry  Never once do I feel the rotten  stinking hand of over exposition on me Many people have noted how the tone matures over time of the story  I certainly agree  This is by far the most kid friendly of the books  I think that really is a strong point  don t get me wrong  I was able to grow up with the books  starting the series right as the first movies came out I m honestly not sure what else to say  This books lots of fun  Read it if you haven t or if your little tyke needs a new book  consider giving them this  Relido  2011  para a Leitura Conjunta Harry Potter Ja perdi a conta ao numero de vezes que li este livro  Deve ser um dos livros que reli mais vezes e sendo o primeiro de uma das minhas serie preferidas tem um lugar muito especial na minha prateleira  Ainda me lembro bem de quando o meu pai nos apresentou  a mim e a minha irma  um dia os quatro primeiro livros da serie dizendo que estava a fazer furor em Portugal pelo que tinha decidido compra los para experimentar  Como naquela altura ja gostava imenso de ler  atirei me logo de cabeca e num instante fiquei envolvida no mundo e aventuras de Harry Potter  um rapaz que e muito mais do que parece a primeira vista Quando me foi proposta uma nova leitura da serie devo confessar que fiquei de pe atras  Fiquei com algum receio de reler os livros  especialmente os primeiros que sao mais infantis  Fiquei com medo de nao os apreciar tanto agora como os apreciei das primeiras vezes que os li uma vez que actualmente sou uma leitora diferente  Mas nao precisava de me ter preocupado   Harry Potter e a Pedra Filosofal  conseguiu novamente a proeza de me cativar  Quando dei por mim tinha ja acabado a leitura Certamente que notei o quao infantil este primeiro livro e  especialmente quando comparado com os mais recentes mas isso nao tirou charme nenhum a leitura  pelo contrario  Achei que a autora fez um trabalho maravilhoso ao conseguir capturar quase na perfeicao a mente e o comportamento de um jovem de 11 anos  Isso nao e tao facil como parece  algo que descobri ao ler outros livros infanto juvenis em que as personagens se comportavam de forma muito adulta para a idade que tinham Rowling consegue criar um mundo magico  mesmo neste primeiro livro que e claramente introdutorio  Sao nos apresentadas as personagens principais   Harry  Ron e Hermione   e todo um elenco de secundarias que terao mais ou menos importancia no decorrer da serie  A maneira como descobrimos Hogwarts  a Diagon Al e todo o mundo escondido dos feiticeiros continua a ser genial  E claro que a caracterizacao das personagens e a construcao do mundo sao bastante simplistas  mas isso nao constitui uma falha grave se pensarmos na serie como um todo  e sera isso que farei em cada opiniao  uma vez que ja li todos os livros   estes aspectos melhoram muito ao longo dos livros tornando se as personagens mais complexas a medida que crescem e o mundo mais intrincado a medida que a Harry vai fazendo mais descobertas acerca dele e tambem a medida que a sua percepcao muda   Harry Potter e a Pedra Filosofal  e um primeiro livro extraordinario que nos transporta para um mundo encantado tao interessante que queremos imediatamente saber mais  As personagens sao carismaticas e penso que este e  no geral  um optimo livro de introducao  Uma obra que encantou milhoes e que aguenta bastante bem o teste do tempo  penso eu  Um livro a manter na biblioteca  definitivamente    Delightfully surprised with this book  It was beautifully written  I really appreciate several aspects of the morality presented  Rowling knows how to meet and decidedly affect her readers personally  Bookish Bingo Challenge  Book 7  Re read a book from your childhood IT IS 3 50AM  I AM VERY TIRED  THIS WAS BETTER THAN I REMEMBERED  No but seriously I know this is short but like  I just finished this in about 4 hours  I m super happy with myself   On my first re read of this series  I have to say how much I love this book  This one is probably tough for some to get through as it is very YA  a bit sweet and silly sometimes  but a great start to this wonderful series   I FINALLY READ A HARRY POTTER BOOKI m pretty sure this calls for a celebration I am not a typical Harry Potter fan  I didn t read the books or watch the movies when they first came out  even though my friends ranted and raved about the books and saw all the movies at midnight when they premiered  I never jumped on the bandwagon because of well  let s just say I wasn t allowed to know who Harry Potter was   It s a long  boring story that has nothing to do with how I feel about Harry Potter now as an adult   Fast forward several years later when The Deathly Hallows Part 2 was about to be released in theaters  I sat down and watched the first movie    and then watched all seven of them in one weekend  Then I proceeded to get tickets for the midnight premiere of the very last movie  That s the weekend I fell in love with Harry Potter and subsequently realized my childhood had been robbed Now  some people may not call me a  true  fan because I haven t read all the books  So four years later  I m finally going to read them all  The Sorcerer s Stone is where it all starts  We meet Harry who lives with his muggle Aunt Petunia  Uncle Vernon  and their horrible son Dudley  I hated them the moment they were introduced and instantly felt sympathy for Harry  This poor boy does not deserve this mistreatment  Well  little did he know what wonderful and terrifying things were about to happen   It does not do well to dwell on dreams and forget to live  remember that  I felt a connection to Harry instantly because he grew up without knowing anything about magic or Hogwarts  Everything was new  exciting  and I learned all about this wonderful magical world right along with him  I loved meeting all the characters through his eyes and having a deeper understanding of their role in his life  It was amazing to see Harry blossom and flourish in this new environment  the one in which he should have known his entire life  It s scary to think that the world almost never knew about Harry Potter  He exists simply because J K  Rowling refused to give up and therein lies his most greatest attribute  resilience  With the help of his new friends Ron and Hermione  they were able to solve a daunting mystery that no other witches or wizards would dare to attempt   It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies  but just as much to stand up to our friends  This book is a wonderful set up for everything else to come and I m really excited to get to know these beloved characters more  Even though these are  children s books   they are a great tool for adults as well  In the Sorcerer s Stone  we see that friendship  bravery  and listening to our gut instincts are so important  It s easy to see why this series is so beloved all over the world  They spark magic in our hearts and rejuvenate our creativity   Olen todennakoisesti maailman ainoa lastenkirjastoihminen  joka ei ole lukenut Harry Potter  sarjaa kokonaisuudessaan  Vuoden 2000 kieppeilla luin silloisen tyttoystavani kehotuksesta sarjan nelja ensimmaista kirjaa ja saatoin varata viela viidennenkin  mutta siihen se sitten jai  En edelleenkaan tieda  miten saaga tulee paattymaan Nyt paatin sitten ottaa tavoitteekseni tarttua harkaa uudelleen sarvista ja niinpa nappasin hyppysiini sarjan ensimmaisen osan  Harry Potter ja viisasten kivi   Tammi  2001   11  painos   Ja niin siina vaan kavi  etta kirja tuli ahmaistua melkeinpa yhdelta istumalta   Harry Potter ja viisasten kivi  on erinomainen lastenkirja  jossa tarinan perusainekset tai teemat eivat ole sinansa mitenkaan maailmaa mullistavan tuoreita  mutta kaytetyistakin aineksista voi koota kasaan niin maukkaan sopan  etta sen parissa viihtyy vanhempikin lukija  Ei kirja virheeton ole  ja huomasin itse ihmettelevani muutamaa juonenkaannetta  hei siis miksi lahettaa metsaan jalki istuntoon jaaneita kakaroita  jos kaikki tietavat sen olevan hengenvaarallista  ja hymyilevani parille turhan ilmiselvalle kliseelle  mutta siita huolimatta olen varma  etta mikali olisin saanut kirjan kasiini lapsena niin olisin rakastanut sita rajusti ja ehdoitta  4 5 stars for the book How can I review this  I just can t    its Harry Potter It feels like judging my mother Well I can say this  the writing is very splendid in so many ways it may seem unimaginable  I mean it felt like someone was story telling me before sleep Yet again I m proven the certainty of my theory that watching the movie before reading the book is in fact the best thing on earth  One thing I might object upon is in the last chapter when Harry started touching Quirell s face and it burnt and all that    it didn t make sense  It just didn t  You can t convince me   and then Dumbledore was all like  you have been touched by something so profound it    bla bla bla   NO seriously I m not convinced Rowling   taken in consideration that my opinion doesn t really matter  but still Other than that  it was perfect and it came in particularly perfect timing  I needed a break  got one  and ended it with the ending of the book My favorite part  It would be the Erised mirror    That whole chapter was so perfect and held my favorite quote in it Favorite quotes  5   It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies  but just as much to stand up to our friends   4   Ah  music   he said  wiping his eyes   A magic beyond all we do here   3   There is no good and evil  there is only power and those too weak to seek it   2   Oh  HONESTLY  don t you two read   Most favorite quote 1   It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live   Cause technically that s all I do during these circumstances  I re visited this book this year because one of my book clubs  the one I m admittedly not as participatory in as I should be  is doing a HP series re read  and I thought it d be fun  But immediately after it started  i got behind schedule  I m pretty good like that  But even though I m way behind schedule and likely won t be able to catch up  I figured I would still re listen to all the books  And yes  that s re listen  I could fly through the books and catch up by reading them in print  But I wanted the chance to re visit them in a little more intimate way   but more on that in a few sentences The Harry Potter books are like a warm blanket for me  I started reading them as I finished up undergrad  having been introduced to them by a caver who I don t think I could call a friend but was definitely someone who enjoyed caving as much as I did  Anyway  she introduced me to the books and I became hooked  The first book that I could get  first edition  was Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire  I was still in college when it came out  a poor college student  so my mom ordered it from Amazon  back when they were a much smaller thing   I read it first  though  since I could read quickly  The love of the story continued through graduate school and my first job out of college  I ended up going to midnight book release parties and midnight showings of most of the movies  I often listed to the US audiobooks  narrated by Jim Dale  when I m having problems sleeping  His voice is so grandfatherly   it s like being read a bedtime story  So   the books and stories are nothing new to me This time around  I m listening to the UK editions read by Stephen Fry  Fry is a narrator I ve thoroughly enjoyed in other books  but wasn t sure how he d compare to Jim Dale  I m happy to report that I think I like him better  certainly for some voices  at least  I definitely prefer his Hagrid to Dale s  And  at least in this first book  Fry seems to use a less whiny voice for Harry  which I far prefer So  aside from new voices  there isn t much here that I didn t know from before  I mean  I have read the series probably more than 10 times in all  So I thought I d note some things I always found funny  But on the off chance you haven t read this book  why the heck not     I ll put it in a spoiler tag   view spoiler  I liked the UK isms this time around  Like Dudley saying  shan t  instead of  won t  in the first chapter  Or football   soccer  Or studying for exams being  revision   It was something new to me and fun The news caster reporting on the owls in the first chapter is named  Ted   Both audiobook editions make it sound like Ted is chuckling at the news of the owls  like he knows more than the others  Tonks  father was a muggle named Ted    maybe I ve always wondered why  if injuries can be healed magically  would someone have a nose that was  obviously  broken before  Of course  I m referring to Dumbledore  I think that this is great foreshadowing  now that I know it  to the burden he carries with him about the fight with his brother How do people have clothes on them when they transfigure from animal to human  In the book AND the movies  we see that when they transfigure from a human to an animal  they shed their clothes    He turned on his heel     gives us the first glance of apparation  I like the name of Dudley s school  Smeltings  Do they melt kids down and rebuild them I wondered how Lily could come home and do magic like  turning teacups into rats  as Aunt Petunia complains  What about the restriction for underage wizardry  Is that something that didn t always exist Hagrid mentions the families that Voldemort killed  including those in the Bones family  We then see another Bones in Harry s class Hagrid saying that there wasn t much human left in Voldemort and that he wasn t dead was good foreshadowing Hagrid says that there are dragons at Gringotts  Something we don t pay much attention to until much later in the series   The first time I went to King s Cross station in England  I won t lie  I was a little disappointed  Interesting that Quirrell didn t have Voldemort  with him  when he saw Harry the first time in the Leaky Cauldron  It only came about after he failed to steal things out of Vault 713  How did he do that  anyway  We know from this book and later in the series that it s ridiculously difficult   he doesn t seem strong enough to do it to me What s up with Rowling describing everybody with long noses or fingers or feet Why is Ron allowed to have a rat  The letter says owl  cat  or toad Why is there so much focus on Neville s toad LOVE the names for the class books  There is a lot of world building of Hogwarts in this book  Not all of it comes back into play in later books  I wonder if originally more was intended to be used in later books   Dean s club is West Ham  Wonder if that s Rowling s club  I m an Arsenal girl  myself   At some point in this book  the point system went from piddly points  less than 10 points here or there  awarded and taken away  but toward the end  McGonogall takes away 50 points per student  And Dumbledore awards lots of points  Why did it start so   slow Why on earth would Snape go to Filch for help with his injuries from Fluffy  Potter for President  banners at the quidditch game  Why  Is that a thing in the UK to do  They don t have a president   LOVE Lee Jordan s commentary on the quidditch matches in this book and others What does it imply that Ron is great at chess while Percy and Hermione are awful and Harry s middling  I mean  sure  it s a vehicle for later in the book  but is there deeper meaning    Why is Peeves so afraid of the Bloody Baron  Do we ever find out Love the scene with the devil s snare when Hermione temporarily forgets she s a witch      hide spoiler     To the well organized mind  death is but the next great adventure    Incredible  magical and totally hilarious  Spell awestruck  M E  I can t believe I ve put off reading this book for years  Well  now at least I know what the fuss is all about  I really wished I ve read this sooner  The plot It was unique and exceptionally good  I can t help but loved Hogwarts and wished it to be a real school  The classes are so cool  I mean  we all wished somehow to learn how to fly sometime in our lives  right  The world building is fascinating  I was truly delighted while exploring Harry s world  learning about those complicated things like Quidditch  the houses  the sorting hat  At first  I was having a hard time dealing with them but then again that s common when starting books The characters Harry Potter  I admire Harry for even though he grew up in a family that treated him like dirt  he still managed to have a brave and kind heart  He has serious self worth issues at first but he managed to somehow overcome them  Don t play   said Hermione at once  Say you re ill   said Ron  Pretend to break your leg   Hermione suggested  Really break your leg   said Ron  The friendship between Harry  Ron and Hermione is amazing  The bonds between them was formed by really extraordinary circumstances  Hermione Granger is such a headstrong girl  Obviously  she s a good company and influence to have  A little bit of a perfectionist at the beginning but she started to loosen up by the end of the book  Ron Weasley is a great friend and sidekick  He s fiercely loyal and I m happy Harry and Ron stick together since the beginning  It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up toour enemies  but just as much to stand up toour friends   The other characters were introduced and portrayed perfectly  The Dursley Family annoyed me so much  I mean  Harry slept in the cupboards   O Draco Malfoy sucks and I just know that he s going to be some kind of a villain in the next books  Everyone added something to fuel my interest more  as if it needed fueling  I can t wait to hear about Harry and his gang s next adventure The ending It was so awesome  I was really shocked at the turn of some events and I did not expect that one guy to be the villain at all  Okay  I didn t need to say anything more  Definitely looking forward to continuing this series     Edit  JUST RE READ THIS  What can I say  after reading the most amazing book on the face of the planet Deathly Hallows  I just had to read this again  Nostalgia got to me  xDReview  Loved this book    It was a little boring at first  especially since I d seen the movie before reading the book   but it got better halfway through  I adored Harry  Hermione  and Ron  loved their constant banter  their epic rule breaking adventures  Their friendship is one of the most unique aspects of the Harry Potter books  and I loved that  I loved Neville too  He was funny  Hell  I even loved Voldemort  I hope he shows up more in the other books   I can see you glaring at me  AND DON T EVEN GET ME STARTED ON RUMBLEROAR  I MEAN DUMBLEDORE  And Draco Malfoy On the other hand  I still don t know what all the rave is about  That s why I ll be reading the other books in the series  Hopefully I ll share your enthusiasm and it ll become a mind blowing  jaw dropping  heart wrenching  earth shattering ride to me too  haha   DSo  yeah  I have nothing else to say Edit  Well  what d ya know  It was a mind blowing  jaw dropping  heart wrenching  earth shattering ride  Siapakah tokoh fiksi terbaik dalam sastra Inggris yang pernah diciptakan  Bukankah sudah jelas  Pencipta kami  William Shakespeare  telah menciptakan banyak sekali karakter fiksi sepanjang hidupnya  namun tidak ada yang seterkenal kami  Kisah cinta kami yang tragis tidak ada bandingannya   sesumbar Romeo  sambil menggandeng Juliet yang tersenyum mendukung di sampingnya  Ya  benar  kisah cinta yang terinspirasi dari sumber lain   sergah seorang pria berpenampilan bangsawan yang kelihatan angkuh   Jika kau menanyakan kepada kaum perempuan sampai abad ini  siapa karakter fiksi yang ingin mereka nikahi  mereka akan memberikan namaku sebagai jawabannya  Dan jika kau mencari sebuah kisah cinta yang hidup sepanjang masa  masa kisah cintaku dan istrikulah jawabannya   Tapi siapakah anda  Tuan   tanya Romeo  Aku Fitzwilliam Darcy   jawab si lelaki sambil membusungkan dada   Dan itu istriku yang cantik  Elizabeth Bennet  Jane Austen lah yang menciptakan kami   Kisah cinta  Bah   Yang mengucapkan ini adalah seorang pria yang berada agak jauh dari mereka  tersembunyi di balik asap yang membumbung dari pipa yang sedang diisapnya  Ia mendekat  lalu melanjutkan   Siapa butuh kisah cinta ketika kau punya kemampuan untuk memecahkan segala kasus  bahkan yang paling misterius dan mustahil sekalipun  Tak diragukan lagi  pasti aku  Sherlock Holmes  adalah karakter fiksi terhebat yang pernah diciptakan  Sejak penciptaku  Sir Arthur Conan Doyle  memutuskan untuk membunuhku di Reichenbach Fall dan kemudian membangkitkanku kembali  sejak saat itu aku tak pernah mati  Saat keempat tokoh fiksi lainnya sedang terpana dengan khotbah singkat Sherlock Holmes mengenai kehebatannya  seorang bocah lelaki  kira kira berumur sebelas tahun  diam diam berjalan mendekati mereka  Posturnya agak pendek  kurus  dengan rambut hitam pekat dan sepasang mata hijau  Dan mereka juga menyadari  ada bekas luka berbentuk sambaran kilat di keningnya  Siapa kau  bocah   tanya Sherlock  Namaku Harry Potter   Dan sedang apa kau disini   tanya Mr  Darcy  Bergabung dengan kalian   jawab Harry Potter muda  Ia mungkin masih bocah  tapi ada aura keberanian dan keyakinan yang kuat dalam tatapan mata dan suaranya yang membuat kelima orang itu ingin menyimak apa yang akan dikatakannya selanjutnya  Kalian kan tokoh fiksi terbaik yang pernah diciptakan dalam sastra Inggris  Aku salah satunya  Para wanita kelihatan kaget  dan para pria mengeluarkan gerutuan tak jelas  Tapi  kami tetap tidak tahu siapa kau   Elizabeth Bennet akhirnya berbicara  Aku seorang penyihir  yang lahir dan dibesarkan dalam dunia Muggle  Muggle adalah manusia yang tidak memiliki kekuatan sihir   jelasnya  Wah  mereka selalu membakar penyihir di jaman kami   seru Elizabeth  agak ketakutan  Tidak di masaku   jawab Harry   Lagipula  ada penyihir jahat dan penyihir baik  dan aku salah satu yang termasuk penyihir baik      lihat note  Ada tujuh buah buku yang memuat kisahku  Di buku pertama  aku baru saja mengetahui bahwa aku ini penyihir ketika aku berulang tahun yang kesebelas  Hagrid  pemegang kunci Sekolah Sihir Hogwarts yang memberitahuku  Hagrid lalu membantuku menyiapkan segala keperluanku sebelum masuk Hogwarts  Untuk pertama kalinya sepanjang hidupku  aku bebas dari keluarga Dursley  keluarga Muggle yang membesarkanku dengan sangat buruk  Aku juga akhirnya mengetahui bahwa aku ini terkenal  Itu karena aku lolos dari mantra maut yang dilancarkan kepadaku saat aku masih bayi oleh seorang penyihir hitam yang sangat jahat  Penyihir itu  namanya Lord Voldemort  namun kami para penyihir pada umumnya pantang menyebutkan namanya  membunuh ayah dan ibuku  namun ketika ia berusaha membunuhku  ia gagal dan mantra itu berbalik ke dirinya sendiri dan nyaris membinasakannya  Itu kenangan yang buruk dan menyakitkan untuk diingat  namun aku jadi terkenal gara gara itu   A ayah dan ibumu dibunuh oleh penyihir jahat itu   gagap Juliet   Oh Harry  aku ikut berduka  Keempat tokoh lainnya pun mengungkapkan belasungkawa kepada Harry  Terima kasih  semuanya   jawab Harry pelan   namun ceritaku tidak berhenti sampai disitu  Di sekolahku  di Hogwarts  aku bertemu dua sahabat sejatiku  Yang pertama adalah anak lelaki berambut merah dengan wajah berbintik bintik  Ron Weasley  Dan Hermione Granger  gadis kelahiran Muggle yang otaknya lebih brilian daripada penyihir manapun seusianya  Kami mengalami berbagai petualangan  termasuk yang menyangkut Batu Bertuah yang disembunyikan di Hogwarts  Itu adalah Batu yang bisa membuatmu hidup abadi  Ternyata Voldemort yang setengah hidup mengincar Batu itu supaya ia bisa hidup dan berkuasa kembali  dan ada mata mata yang ia tempatkan di dalam Hogwarts  Kami bolak balik bertatap muka dengan bahaya  aku bertemu langsung dengan wujud setengah hidup Lord Voldemort  nyaris kehilangan nyawaku  namun kami semua berhasil lolos dari maut  Hal ini juga karena kepala sekolahku  penyihir tua yang bijak Albus Dumbledore  Kami belajar banyak kebijaksanaan dari beliau  Ini barulah cerita dalam buku pertama dari ketujuh buku yang menuliskan kisahku  Kelima tokoh lainnya terpesona dengan cerita yang dituturkan seorang Harry Potter  Keheningan lalu dipecahkan oleh Sherlock Holmes  yang berkata dengan pongah   Bah  hanya tujuh buku  Penciptaku menuliskan lebih banyak buku dan cerita pendek tentangku daripada hanya tujuh buku   Ah  diamlah  Mr  Holmes   sambar Elizabeth  satu satunya yang menjaga kepala dingin di antara mereka semua   Kisahmu memang menarik  namun kisah Harry tampaknya tak kalah menariknya  Aku bisa melihat bahwa di dalamnya ada banyak petualangan  misteri  nilai nilai persahabatan dan kebijaksanaan  Bahkan mungkin cinta  di buku buku selanjutnya  saat dia sudah lebih besar   Terima kasih  Madam   jawab Harry   Aku yakin apa yang kau ucapkan benar  Semua hal besar punya awal  dan yang baru kusampaikan hanyalah rangkuman dari kisahku dalam buku pertama  Kisahku dalam buku buku selanjutnya akan semakin kompleks  semakin menarik  sekaligus makin misterius dan menantang  Dan terus menjadi lebih baik dengan setiap buku yang ada  Dan kalian perlu tahu juga  penciptaku  Madam J K  Rowling  menjadi bilyuner karena menulis kisahku  Walau setelah itu  ia kehilangan status bilyunernya karena menyumbangkan sebagian besar kekayaannya untuk amal  Romeo  Juliet  dan Elizabeth tak mampu menyembunyikan kekaguman mereka  Sedangkan Mr  Darcy dan Sherlock tetap memasang tampang angkuh dan pongah  namun di dalam hati mereka diam diam mengakui bahwa bocah ini  kisahnya berpotensi untuk tetap hidup melampaui abad  sama seperti kisah mereka sendiri Note   Ini saya tulis hanya untuk mendukung keseluruhan cerita Harry Potter dan keperluan untuk menulis post ini  Saya pribadi berkeyakinan bahwa ilmu sihir  apapun warnanya  adalah jahat  But the main theme of Harry Potter isn t  literally  magic  don t you agree    Ditulis dengan rasa hormat kepada William Shakespeare  Jane Austen  Sir Arthur Conan Doyle  dan tentu saja J K  Rowling  melmarianhttp   surgabukuku wordpress com 2013    Huh  I was expecting to come on here and write this for my review   I was going to write a review of this book  but then decided against it since there were already so many good reviews out there     But then I went to look at all those outstanding reviews  Out of my 33 goodreads friends who ve read the book ONE PERSON reviewed it Out of the 11 that I follow  1  GOODREADERS  HOW CAN YOU LET THIS HAPPEN    Is it because everybody has already read it and  most  everybody already loves it  Is it because readers already have their mind made up about it that we don t have to write reviews for it  Is it because we re afraid of being seen as vote wh  ing pathetics who prowl the teen and YA aisles looking for latest and best loved books to read  just to review  Maybe it s because you read this before you became a noted goodread reviewer   top twenty 7 weeks in a row       that last parenthetical aside wasn t meant for me by the way     sigh  Whatever the reason  I find it unacceptable  And now I ve read the book with an uncritical eye hoping to stand on the reviews of the goodread giants who wrote before me  Da      I could have been that giant  Now the giant is going to have to climb on the shoulders of a dwarf  Is this what goodreads has come to So  here comes my crappy review of a decent YA kids book The kid from A Child Called It finds out he s a wizard  goes off to a wizard school and does a bunch of wizarding stuff  You deserve so much more reread 11 28 10  first read dec  2005  Ah  the movies  You know I actually did try to read this when it first came out  however many decades ago  I gave up about halfway through like Eh  who cares  boring  It s a little hard to review objectively because I know how important this series is to my friends  I know NOW that the series is totally worth my investment  Actually reading the books seems almost academic So the book  Is fine  I liked it  It drags in parts  The whole section with Hagrid s dragon felt like a long way around  structurally  to get the characters where they needed to be at that point  And all the Quidditch  ugh  That a sport for magical wizards should be just as boring as sports in real life  I have prejudicial reservations about Chosen One characters like Harry  and I don t understand what this Voldemort dude is supposed to BE  a semi dead amorphous blob that somehow attached itself to Quirrell and needed Unicorn s Blood to stay  what   alive           although really this just points to how mind blowingly difficult it is to write an objective evil   I also don t like all the adverbs  he said paternally  But OK if I m sounding nitpicky But for every little part of the book that I didn t like  there was a part where I got totally choked up with emotion  Like  ALL through the book  And the ending  between Hagrid giving Harry the photo album  and Neville getting the winning points  FORGET  ABOUT  IT  I could barely read   I m reading this aloud to my 7 year old son  so there re emotions flying every which way  What I wonder is whether my emotions  my investment in these characters is really earned by this book  I kind of suspect it isn t  I come to it with my feeeeelings about the characters pre heated  The interesting thing  to me  is that those feeeeelings don t really come from the book OR the movies  I haven t seen all the movies  and honestly have a difficult time telling one from the next  or which one comes before which  The book and movies are just OK to me  but I LOVE the fandom  and I love the love that exists for the characters  So that s my way in to the series  for better or worse So  3 stars    1 extra star for me occasionally being unable to read this through my sobbing  On to the next one  Mejor tarde que nunca   no Si  llegue algo tarde a este tren    pero me encanto este primer libro y quiero leerme todos  si pudiera ya mismo  bueno durante el mes  Soy consciente que no voy a vivir la magia de primera mano  como muchos de sus fans  que crecieron junto a estos libros   y ahora envidio sanamente   pero puedo decir que mi deuda literaria se esta saldando  Me gusto mucho mucho  D Although this is the first volume in the Harry Potter series  it was not the first title I happened to read  That honor belonged to Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire  which was lucky as it led me to start the series from the beginning  Perhaps it s because the book is not altogether too big  and the characters involved me  but I certainly enjoyed the read  The premise was fun  the introduction to Hogwarts was fun  the Sorting Hat was fun   easy to like whether adult or child  Good stuff Book Season   Autumn  start of school  I cannot lie and must put my hand up that I am Potter mad  I have read  In both print and digital  the series so many times that I lost count a long time ago  I have seen the films so many times that I could prompt the actors lines if needed so it s not as if I don t know the stories and know what is gonna happen  but guess what      Yep  I am going through them again but to complete the whole experience I am now listening to them on audio Stephen Fry does a fabulous job of narrating this story  he has the sort of voice that is easy to listen to and his voices and portrayal of the characters are wonderful     Now onto Chamber of Secrets   Pour connaitre mon avis sur la version illustree d Harry Potter  rdv ici   http   jenesaispointlire fr harry pot     Source  I own a copy of this book  This is the second time I have read this book  I thought it was okay before  but as I stumbled upon  Pottermore  last week I thought I would read along while exploring the story on Pottermore I have to say that I enjoyed the book much more this time  whether this was in part due to Pottermore  or whether I could just imagine in the film in my head as I was reading it this time I don t know Anyway  I ll definitely be re reading the other boks  and playing along

liked a few of them  But I only liked one out of the last four and figured now that I knew the story  I wouldn t be impressed by the twists and the turns of the books I changed my mind on this for a couple of reasons  One  I ve read all of Rowling s other works  namely her detective series and  The Casual Vacancy   I was very impressed by her writing ability  particularly her ability to develop characters and tell a good story  Two  several years have gone by since I have seen any of the Potter films and I m sure to have forgotten many of the details  And three  I recently spent some time with one of my cousins who s an absolute Potter fanatic  Seeing her excitement for the material awoke my inner nerd Well I can definitely say I m glad I picked up  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone   or  Ello  Arry  as it s known in England   I assume   This book was top shelf story telling and included several story element left out of the book  It was interesting to see what the filmmakers cut  I mostly agree with their edits for the movie but was glad to read them in the book  Things that still don t make sense to me   Quidditch  This game is insanely dangerous and the rules don t really make sense  Why wouldn t everybody just be going for the Snitch  I feel like Rowling could have fleshed this out a bit more but I get it  it needed to be dangerous from a narrative perspective   Ok  so Harry grew up in the Muggle world and I get that a lot of the kids at Hogwarts came from magic families but where do these magic families live  Don t they secretly live in the Muggle world  Are there secret towns of just magic people  Some of the kids didn t know what British money looked like or what soccer was  That boggles the mind   At this point  it s been more tell than show in terms of Harry s uniqueness  The only thing he seems to be naturally good at is riding a broom and catching Snitches  I get that he survived as a baby but come on All in all  very good stuff and I absolutely plan on reading the entire series  E  sempre difficile provare a recensire un libro che  come in questo caso l intera saga di Harry Potter  ci ha cambiato la vita  accompagnandoci dall infanzia fino all eta adulta  Ammetto che da bambina odiavo leggere  ho ancora un libro del Battello a vapore  una collana per bambini e ragazzi  che non ho mai letto  Ma Harry Potter ha aperto per me un mondo nuovo  e non mi riferisco solo all universo di Hogwarts  ma all insieme di infinite realta che la lettura rende possibile conoscere  Forse sara stato grazie alla sua scrittura semplice e scorrevole  o forse alla sua trama avvincente e magica  che lessi questo libro in soli 5 giorni  un grande passo in avanti per una ragazzina che odiava leggere   Continua  http   mywingsofpaper blogspot it 201    I thought the characters were introduced in a memorable way  considering how many characters are in this series  I also liked being introduced into the wizarding world as Harry is introduced  it helped to identify with him  I haven t had the chance to review this in time and now every thought slipped away but what I can say is  it was exactly what I expected and no disapointment at all and also  I m saving my 5 stars for lasts books  Harry is a pretty brave and kool kat   This is the first book in the Harry Potter series  This book follows Harry s adventures as he learns that he is a wizard  and a famous one at that  He is well known through the Wizarding world for surviving the Dark Lord Voldemort when he was an infant  which was how he got the lightening scar on his forehead  Harry attends his first year at Hogwarts  and learns how to use magic  the history of magic and how to play Quidditch  He also comes to make many friends and enemies  I as many people do  love the story of Harry Potter  I have seen all the movies but this is my first time reading the books  The first book was very impressive  I think what draws me most to this story is how well thought out and creative it is  So much goes on in this 223 book  J K Rowling writes very to the point  and due to this has so much time to weave in little details that come to mean so much in the grand scheme of things  I also love the world building  There is just so much detail that this world actually feels like an actual world  and plus it s really fun to read about  There is a government system  a banking system  a major sport  a chess game  a house points system in the school  a culture  such as how people view drinking unicorn blood   The list goes on  I can t wait to learn more about this world  J K Rowling has completely mastered story telling What I also really love about this book is the amount of character involvement  I feel like so much is going on plot wise  and yet  there are so many characters involved  I love a book that can still have a lot of plot but somehow manage to introduce lots of characters that don t just disappear  I ve read books that are fantasy and yet are filled with dialogue and have nowhere as many characters that are in this book  How J K Rowling does it  I haven t figured out   I m trying   Every character is so distinct from the other  What I think J K Rowling does really well with Dumbledore and Voldemort  is get so many characters to say praise or fear about them  that we as readers feel a sense of importance about them  I always felt timid when one of the two came into the story  because I knew how important they were from how much characters reacted to them  She told us these characters were important  but she also showed us I found Harry s character to be really well done  He comes from not the nicest childhood  and yet he does not pity himself at all and has a lot of self respect for himself  This made me also have respect for him  His bravery is evident right from the start and I can see there is a lot of room for this bravery to grow  He is also really kind to those he considers his friends and see s the best in them   You re worth twelve of Malfoy   Harry said   The Sorting Hat chose you for Gryffindor  didn t it  And where s Malfoy  In stinking Slytherin   Ron is my favorite character from the films  and I still really liked his character in this book  I like his simple and snarky personality  I d like to have a friend like him  He speaks his mind and whilst he really has aspirations for himself  he does not get envious or try to outshine Harry  He is the best friend Harry could have to be honest  One who supports him but can keep up with him  Hermione  also  does this  I m not the biggest fan of young Hermione but since I know how she develops as a character  I know I am going to come to love her soon  By the end of the book she was already winning my heart  and let s face it  Harry and Ron wouldn t really get anywhere far without her  The ending scenes prove that each has their distinct talents from each other that mean they work perfectly as a group Other characters were great  such as Neville  I loved how much time he was given  just thank you J K Rowling for loving the side characters and giving them importance in the story  and Hagrid  who I loved more in the book than the film  He is seriously adorable  I liked what Draco s character brought to the story  annoying villains are always needed to create good diversity in characters  I actually do not like Snape a lot in the films but somehow liked him a little more in this book  because more time was given in explaining him as a person   Another reason why books are almost always better than the film  they have more time   I also liked that the villains had reasons for why they did what they did  That s always important yet often not done   There is no good and evil  there is only power  and those too weak to seek it  I must say that I am not a huge fan of J K Rowling s writing personally  which is why I did not give this book 5 stars  It just wasn t a 5 star book for me personally  but it was AMAZING   Also  I am certain I will enjoy the books more as they go so I need room for my love to get bigger from here   I just like a book that takes a moment to explain scenery and how a place feels through different senses  such as smell and touch  Because J K Rowling s writing is very to the point  I didn t get much of that  Sometimes I had trouble picturing what was going on because I just didn t feel like there was enough descriptions  I know this is a children s book so she has done the right thing  But as an adult I just crave for that detail  but I would never want that changed because obviously she has done it the way she has for a reason  Also  if she wasn t such a fast passed writer  not as much would have been able to happen  and how much happens is what I really love about these books  So overall  I thought this was a great book  I think it has great messages for children  being loyal to your friends and being brave  as well as the importance of love and the damaging effects of greed   It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live  remember that   I guess they did sneak around a bit and break rules which I know some adults dislike about these books  But personally as a kid these films taught me a lot of good things and I would have learnt a lot more if I had read the books   Books  And cleverness  There are more important things   friendship and bravery   I ve wanted to read this for years but never did until now  I started it last night and finished it this afternoon  It was definitely not a disappointment  I was a little worried that it would be because I d been waiting so long to read it so I thought it might not meet my expectations  But it totally did It was a really good start to the series and even though I ve read a lot about them and already know a lot I felt like it was my first time ever hearing any of it  It all seemed new and exciting  I loved the writing and just wanted to keep reading  I love it when books do that  The story can be the best you ve ever heard but if it isn t written well you won t want to keep reading it I really loved most of the characters  The only one I didn t really like was Dumbledore  I even liked the Dursley s just because they were so funny to me  Dumbledore just came across as a total airhead to me  I m hoping I ll like him more in later books  So far my favorite s are Harry  Hermione  and the twins I guess I don t really have much more to say about this one but I m certainly going to read the next one Negatives There really wasn t anything that bothered me in this one  There was some pretty mild language and some of the story might be frightening or disturbing for younger readers   This was an audio we listened to on a long trip over school vacation  Upon returning home  we had an hour left to the story and neither of my kids were interested in hearing the ending  I have held onto this for weeks but their position hasn t changed  Here is mine  I typically do not enjoy series and I have never wanted to read this  My husband owns most  if not all of these books  we stood in line on Block Island at midnight over 10 years ago to get the newest edition and I thought he was nuts   did I mention he does not read fiction   ever  and they just look long  I have a feeling the audio was too much to take in in one sitting  especially for the kids  Perhaps they will be more interested when they are older  There is certainly enough for an inquiring mind to dissect here   symbolism  themes  etc  I have heard that this series is beyond brilliant and that the more books you read the more you see the tremendous  detailed foreshadowing  There is no doubt Rowling is a master storyteller with an explosive imagination  The problem is me  I guess  I enjoyed it but I don t feel compelled to keep going  I suspect maybe in the future I will read this to the kids but maybe they will read it on their own  or not  and if so  it s not likely I will continue reading these  With that said  the story was fun  the narrator was fantastic and for the names of the characters alone  I would dole out 10 stars  Well done  Olha  esse livro e claramente sobre BRUXARIAS  Porque nada mais explica de eu lembrar de tanta coisa de uma leitura que fiz 13 anos atras  Gente  eu nao consigo lembrar dos plots de livros que eu li ano passado  mas lembrava EM DETALHES das descricoes da J  K  Rowling  estou eternamente em choque 10 pontos pra Grifinoria por J  K  conseguir escrever algo que fixa tanto na nossa memoria  POREM   5 pontos porque  pelo menos nesse primeiro livro  Harry Potter nao e aquele tipo de leitura que toda vez que voce refaz voce   aprende algo novo   ou percebe alguma coisa que tinha deixado passar batido  mas que faz completo sentido com a informacao que voce tem do 7 livro da serie A narrativa da J  K  e bem sem gracinha  e direta ao ponto que voce nao consegue sentir muito o suspense ou sofrer com o Harry  Eu sinto muita falta da parte emocional dos personagens sabe Outra coisa que me incomoda muito e o jeito que a autora faz as distincoes das casas  eu sei que nem todo mundo da Sonserina e malvadao e as pessoas da Lufa lufa nao sao todas sem graca  mas do jeito que a J  K  escreve parece que sim e e TAO FRUSTRANTE  E essa situacao poderia ter sido facilmente resolvida se o Harry  o Ron e a Hermione fossem de casas diferentes Acho que o maior merito desse livro  e e realmente um merito gigante  e que e impossivel de se ler Harry Potter sem morrer de vontade de estudar em Hogwarts  receber uma carta por uma coruja  ir no Olivares comprar suas varinha  sentar debaixo do chapeu seletor  etc  etc  etc  O world building da Rowling e MARAVILHOSO  Chega da uma tristeza parar de ler so pra de deparar com a certeza que nos nunca vamos ver um campeonato de quadribol Vou segui relendo a serie  mas intercalando outras leituras no meio P S   Neville MELHOR PESSOA  Queria que esses livros fosse sobre ele  Eh non  ceci n etait pas une relecture mais bien une premiere fois   Il aura fallu que j attende mon trentieme printemps pour pouvoir enfin dire  J ai lu Harry Potter   Je suis bien entendu fan de la saga   cinematographique   et maintenant qu elle est close  mon seul moyen de retrouver les personnages et cet univers que j adore tant etait de les redecouvrir dans leur version initiale Je revois l une de mes profs de fac dire a la classe  Lire Harry Potter  d accord  mais en anglais    et j aurais vraiment du l ecouter car c est un roman effectivement tres  tres jeunesse  flagrant en VF  Mon excuse   J ai craque pour le coffret et les couvertures de Folio  ca vaut ce que ca vaut   Bon alors  exactement comme pour  Le Trone de Fer   je risque de m attirer les foudres des puristes mais j ai prefere la version cine de ce premier opus  peut etre que parce que je l ai vue en premier  peut etre a cause de la narration simpliste  des descriptions moindres  Evidemment  impossible de ne pas visualiser les acteurs mais ca ne m a pas derangee  J ai meme pu constater que le film est plutot fidele au livre malgre quelques differences  mineures parfois comme certaines couleurs de cheveux qui ne correspondent pas ou un personnage qui a disparu pendant le transfert  d autres un peu plus importantes en impliquant davantage un personnage dans une situation alors qu il avait un role moindre dans le livre  Aussi  j ai remarque que l amitie entre Harry  Ron et Hermione se fortifiait plus vite au cinema    En bref  moi qui aurais voulu en apprendre un peu plus sur les persos  je n ai pas ete tres gatee avec ce premier tome mais il m en reste six autres a lire et j ai tout de meme pris grand plaisir a retrouver Harry et ses amis     It was about time I finally read the book  I never was a real  Potterhead   I always enjoyed the movies  although I still haven t seen the last 2  I think     oh well  I ll definitely watch them soon now   but never even thought about reading the books  To be honest  now that I finished book 1  I don t even know why  I absolutely loved it  Yes  at times it was a bit  hard  to read   and by that I only mean Hagrid and his weird way of talking in the book   but it s hilarious  thrilling  exciting  magical and just really  really cool Hogwarts and the rest of the scenery are fantastic  It s amazing how detailed J K  Rowling described everything and how well you could imagine it in your head  Yes  the movies are a great help but even without them I think I would have awesome pictures in my head  The different houses  Quidditch  the sorting hat  the mirror of Erised  the invisibility cloak and and and     such great ideas and honestly  you can only love them and be intrigued    It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies  but just as much to stand up to our friends    The characters are also extraordinary  They have beautiful character traits and strenghts and each person is unique  The friendship between Hermione  Ron and Harry is wonderful  When they were first introduced they were completely different but troughout the book and towards the end you could clearly see how much everyone changed and influenced the others  Hermione Granger as the little perfectionist and overachiever that you can count on when you need her the most  Ron Weasley as a loyal  funny and fierce  best  friend that is always by your side and goes through the same stuff as yourself and Harry Potter as the intelligent and brave young boy who fights to protect his friends and Hogwarts  no matter what it costs  They re an amazing trio I loved Hagrid and how protective and kind he was to Harry  Professor Dumbledore is the one you look up to and admire because he s so clever and wise  Then there s Malfor and Snape and Voldemort     everyone s just super cool and interesting to read about    The truth   Dumbledore sighed   It is a beautiful and terrible thing  and should therefore be treated with great caution    Because I already saw the movie I knew what was going to happen but I didn t remember everything and especially the end surprised me a lot  I just completely forgot about it  so that was very thrilling and exciting  I m really looking forward to continue the series as soon as possible and I even think I ll like the other books even more  I m glad I finally gave in and read it   D www aworldbetweenfoldedpages blogspot com Edit  Dec  2015   I often get the urge to re read this series which often keeps me from reading other things  One thing I noticed this time around is how alive the characters seem  People often say that when you write  the characters develop a life of their own and the story almost writes itself  I felt this way  as a reader  about the characters in Harry Potter  It must be the way Rowling writes but picturing all their actions  reactions and interactions always seems so real and convincing  For other books  depending on the detail of their description  I may need to put in some effort to get an image of the characters in mind  But the Harry Potter cast just seems to sweep you off and away into the world of magic without you realizing that you re actually still reading Harry Potter was the first actual novel that I ve ever owned and read Although I read the first two volumes when they were released I only continued with the last five several years later   in fact I only continued when all volumes were out  When I finally got past reading beyond the first two volumes it got the bolder rolling  I ended up reading the series in a loop      preventing me from continuing other books I had planned on reading  and counting it as one of my most favourite stories ever There are so many lovable characters   it makes it so hard to pick a favourite  Then  of course  I love school themed stories and even more  magic  I only gave the first volume four stars despite liking the series so much  I enjoy the first volume as much as the others and it ll always have something special as it was the first I ve ever had and the first in the series  Still  I decided to give it four stars instead of five mainly in comparison to the following books of the series   In theory  I should hate this book It has a Chosen One and a Dark Lord  for goodness  sake  which is a trope that s been so driven into the ground you can barely see the top of it  The worldbuilding is whimsical and absurd  Half the moments of progress for the protagonist involve luck or coincidence  The heroes are 11 years old and excessively competent  It starts with a prologue  not labelled as such  but it is  all about the dull and ordinary lives of some unpleasant people who aren t even the protagonists So why do so many people love it  Why do I love it  Why do we even seek out badly written fanfiction of it in order to get more Here s what I think  On the flip side of the whimsy is a powerful sense of wonder  Harry s dull suburban life at the start is replaced by the wizarding world  which is full of life and colour and fun   and risk and adventure  too  It s exactly that prologue of mundanity that sets us up for the world to open out like a tropical flower as Harry and Hagrid enter Diagon Alley  and later Hogwarts  The wizarding world is intense  it s a place where things matter and great issues are at stake  like high school only much more so  I used to think of J K  Rowling s great strength as being plotting  because she weaves plots and subplots together so competently  Every book has them  Who will win the House Cup  Who will win at Quidditch  How will the latest Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher be nobbled  Will Harry get caught sneaking round and punished  Will he find out about the mysterious thing  What new method of transport will be used  What will Malfoy plot  and how will he be foiled  and will his father hear about this  Later on  who will snog whom  and will it last  and who else will be jealous  Who will be killed  Will Neville do something courageous and or stupid Now  I look at it in a slightly different way  What Rowling is so very good at is raising questions  like the ones I ve just posed  and giving us reasons to care about the answers  Then she staggers questions and answers so that we keep on having a reason to read on Very often  the reason we care is that the characters care  and we identify with the characters  Her most important characters are outsiders  Harry  raised by abusive foster parents without knowledge of his heritage  Hermione  too smart to be popular  Ron  from a family without much money or status  Neville  raised by his grandmother and a bit of a nebbish  Luna  eccentric as a brush  even Snape  greasy  bullied  unlucky in love  We see how they re underdogs  and we cheer for the underdogs as they strive and struggle and triumph  and sometimes fail  and pay the cost  and keep fighting anyway   Her characters have distinct voices  Hagrid s is the most distinctive on the page  but every one of them sounds different  from sarcastic Harry to hoity toity Hermione to rough hewn Ron to dreamy Luna  Having seen the films  of course  helps  but even in text  the voices are clear and distinct  A few of the background characters might be interchangeable  but even then  you d never confuse Seamus with Dean  for example  And the characters matter to each other  Their relationships  good or bad  have power  They answer the questions together  and those relationships help and hinder and change and develop as they do so  Not everything about the series  or the writing  is as good as it could be  There are parts you don t want to think too hard about  and sentences that don t bear close inspection  Overall  though  we see relatable characters with important connections to one another  solving multiple overlapping problems that they care about in a world that s vigorous  fresh and alive  and that s what made the author richer than the Queen  From a piece on the 25th anniversary of Star Trek  Generations  found here  http   www grantland com story _ id 8        T hink about the Harry Potter series  One of the reasons J K  Rowling s books exerted such an appeal over every sentient creature on earth is that they resolved  indeed fused  a cultural contradiction  She took the aesthetic of old fashioned English boarding school life and placed it at the center of a narrative about political inclusiveness  You get to keep the scarves  the medieval dining hall  the verdant lawns  the sense of privilege  you re a wizard  Harry   while not only losing the snobbery and racism but actually casting them as the villains of the series  It s the Slytherins and Death Eaters who have it in for mudbloods  not Harry and his friends  Hogwarts  true heirs  The result of this  I would argue  is an absolutely bonkers subliminal reconfiguration of basically the entire cultural heritage of England  It s as if Rowling reboots a 1 000 year old national tradition into something that s  a  totally unearned but  b  also way better than the original  Of course it electrified people   The phenomenal success of Harry Potter makes it almost superfluous to review the books  Nothing a detractor could say will deter fans  Nothing a fan could say will make the books any more enjoyable  However  I would like to try to comment on this first book  simply to try and understand the appeal  As everyone who has not been living on a deserted island or in a deep pit already knows  Harry Potter is the story of a boy who learns that he is a wizard  Recently  the final book of the series came out and the epic battle between the good wizards and the hellish Death Eaters has drawn to a close  However  this first book shows few signs of the saga to come  It opens with a Roald Dahl esque story about a unique child in an exaggeratedly bad  yet humorous  situation  not unlike Matilda   As the story progresses it becomes more whimsical  but retains the dark humor and colorful  sometimes even grotesque  characters that testify to the Dahlian influence  Even by the end  when Harry faces off  for the first time  with the evil Dark Lord  the story is no darker than the climax of The Witches  There is no hint in this work of the dangers to come  But  everyone knows the plot of Harry Potter  Or else  they really should  Anyone who wants to be up to date in the world of literature and modern culture must read the most popular book series of all time  Not everyone will enjoy it  but it must be read  The real question is  are the books of any merit There are really two dominant groups when it comes to a book as popular as HP  the detractors who give it but one star  and the fans who heap on as many as allowed  The detractors  however  are also made of two groups  those who honestly do not like the books  and those who are jealous and biased against them  one reviewer was obviously against fantasy   The latter  who believe that reading one of the books enables them to judge the scope of the series  who brush aside the fans with cheep name calling  are not to be taken seriously  After all  with a series so universally loved  there must be some element of universality that should be honestly examined  Are all of the millions of fans idiots  Or is there an element to the story that touches on a universal aspect of mankind  I would argue that it is the latter  as to stereotype a huge number of people is not only difficult but probably impossible and smells of elitism  The universality of the story  in my opinion  lies within J K  Rowling s characters  One could go on and on about certain weaknesses in her prose  though I notice many of these detractors tend to dislike children s books in general and cannot come to grasp the idea that the writing in a book for children should be less dense than the writing of Dante   One could complain about various discrepancies  But  one cannot condemn her characters  And it is in these characters that her genius lies  Any one of them could be someone you know  I found myself so often looking at this or that character and thinking   Why he she is just like so and so   What is more  Rowling s insights into the hearts of children are penetrating  Who cannot recall the feelings that she gives her characters  And each one perfectly fits the situations given in the book  The characters are not the sole strength of the books  either  A list of her strengths would be as follows 1  A world that is believable and transcends the story  The wizarding world and culture is not only interesting to imagine  colorful  and enjoyable to escape into  but it has a life outside of the realm of the book  Many fantasy writers do not seem to know their worlds  and the readers are left lost and unsure of the culture they are supposed to immerse themselves in  The wizarding world is well developed and structured  and as fully realized as Middle Earth  2  Rowling s use of mythology is charming  She brings to life both classic creatures  giants  centaurs  unicorns  as well as less familiar ones  hippogriffs  boggarts   She also puts her own twist on otherwise familiar characters  and manages to conform each of the creatures to her own mythology  Say what you may about the books  this takes some skill 3  The witty wordplay in the books found me smiling  4  The books are filled with plot points  Hardly an event happens that does not either move the plot forwards or reveal new layers of character  Again  this is difficult to do and takes some skill and literary vision 5  Rowling works into the stories universal themes that have moved civilizations since antiquity  good vs  evil  the weak outshining the strong  the value of courage  love and friendship  self sacrifice  Naturally  such universal themes would help account for the books  universality  And Rowling s take on the themes is both as fresh as it is timeless   Take Harry s final battle  for example  6  Lastly  Rowling manages to reach into the depths of her readers  hearts and bring us back to our childhood fantasies  How many of us did not imagine ourselves on great adventures in mythical worlds  The stories bring to mind nothing so much as the stories of my early childhood  The magical feel is both familiar and exhilarating  sending the readers on a journey as nostalgic as it is adventuresome  Frankly  I believe that to write off these books is foolish  One may find fault with them  but certainly something with such universal appeal is worth more than one star  And I believe that in the years to come  these books will find their place alongside Narnia  The Lord of the Rings  Alice in Wonderland  The Wizard of Oz  and the collected works of Roald Dahl   I originally read this book years ago when the whole Harry Potter phenomena was just starting  Back then only a few of the books were out so when I finished one I was eagerly anticipating the next one along with everyone else  Book 7 came out and since it had been so long since I had read book 6 I wanted to do a re read of the series  Of course life got in the way along with other books on my mountain TBR so I never came up with time to do a proper re read  Since discovering audio books  thanks to GR  I decided to get the audio book and relive the experience this way  What a great option  Jim Dale is the narrator and just does an excellent job bringing the story to life  The moment the audio started I was transported back into the wizarding world along with Harry  In the years since reading this story I forgot about the genius that is J K  Rowling  What looks like a deceptively simple children s story is actually an epic tale about good versus evil  There are so many little details included that you can t help but feel part of Harry s world  When I originally read this book I gave it a four  It was okay for me but now that the whole series has been out and I ve read up to book 6 I see how each piece fits in  I m going to stick to my original impression of the book which was 4 stars  but I will give the audio five stars for Jim Dale s work and also because I m able to appreciate it more now that I know what is to happen   Edit 07 28 15  Still so very  very good  Always feels like coming home Istyria book blog   B s world of enchanted books Re reading and reviewing this awesome series for my seven week event  Harry Potter Tuesdays  on my blog  This review will  of course  have some spoilers  If you have lived under a rock for the past ten years or so  please join the living again  You should have read these books a long time ago Everyone knows Harry Potter  Well  there may be some who don t  Those who live under rocks or something  but most people have at least heard of it  Whether they ve seen the movies or read the books or both  In this first book  we meet him for the first time  He s a young boy that lives with his uncle and aunt  Needless to say he s not very happy there  When he finds out he s a wizard  a very famous one at that  his life changes completely  He goes to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry were he makes friends and enemies  But there s something dark lurking in the shadows Every time I read these books I need to remind myself that it was meant for kids and it s written that way  So some things are a bit more simple than the books I m used to reading  But after a few pages  I don t care anymore  I get sucked into that world again and the fact that I ll never get bored of them  that s saying something  This is the first book in the series and every time I read the entire series  I notice that the writing gets better every book  Everything gets better  But it s so great to start that journey again and I think I love the books more every time I read them Here s a little fun fact  This book is actually the last one I read in the series  Pretty weird  but it s true  And I get confused about the title every time  In some countries it s the Philosopher s Stone and in others it s the Sorcerer s Stone  On my copy  it s the first  But still  Confusing I don t have to tell you how much I love these characters  I feel an instant connection to Harry Potter and I did the first time I met him  He is like a dear friend to me by now  That cute eleven year old boy  And his friends Ron and Hermione  I just love them so much  But knowing how it all ends  gives you a sad feeling too when you read about Dumbledore and the Weasley twins  And I got to hate Malfoy and Dudley all over again because they were spoiled brats and nothing more  Oh and I can t forget about Neville  It s so awesome to start this journey once again So if you have not read this series yet because you ve lived under a rock or something  I suggest you start soon  You re missing out on something great and in the end you belong to that awesome community called the Potterheads and you ll wait for a letter that has yet to arrive even though your twelfth birthday is so far in the past  or not    Seriously  I m still waiting for mine     This book will keep the four stars that I first gave it  though I am looking at it with a new respect When I first read the book I remember it being slow and interesting  This time around however it seemed to breeze through situation after situation  While not necessarily a bad thing  it really didn t give me time to breathe in between the chain of events  At least not until the chapter breaks  Everything was fairly simple and straight forward  though Rowling did a hell of a job world building in this first book  while keeping the focus on the plot  She does well to give the characters believable personalities  and sticking to them  Other than that there really isn t much wrong  except for the breezing through events  Again not a bad thing  but it didn t really leave time to let everything sink in  Still an addicting read  and a great way to start off the series  A few years ago  when I was way younger  I got this book for Christmas  I really liked it and I continued to read the series  until I got to Goblet Of Fire  When I was nine  I didn t really feel like reading a book that is 700 pages long  I didn t like long books at the time  so I stopped reading the series  and it was a long time before I read anything else I really  really want to finish this series now  so I m rereading the first three books  I know I m kind of late  really  REALLY late  but I really like these books  and I like long books now  so now is the time   PSo I might be a little late  but I m excited This was a great read  I loved the characters  the places  the writing   and it was such a fun and fast read  Can t wait to finish the whole series     Rereading Harry Potter is like a beautiful return to the magical world of childhood with an adult twist  It has been years since I first read the  Sorcerer s Stone  and which I find pretty intriguing   I like it even more now than I liked it years ago  It is funny  very British  with many  wink winks  to adult reader  but most of all   it s pure magic  This time I read the new edition with Jim Kay s illustrations   they re divine  Subtle  nostalgic  simply beautiful  A rare piece of art Harry will be perfect for younger and older readers and there s nothing left to write than   J K  Rowling created something different  something new and even after almost twenty  TWENTY   years it is still remarkable  This is the third time I read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone  but the first time I read it in english  Fantastic experience as usual  The urge to jump right into the second book is incredibly strong  and I think I ll give in very soon The actual rating is 4 5 4 75 stars  but I settled for 4 just because there are books in the series which I liked more  But it is still flawless  just like all the other HP books   I m feeling quite nostalgic these days  don t know why  I haven t read this series in years and it feels so good to re read the magic that was Harry Potter  No  really  this book is magic  The story is exciting and the main characters are captivating  The humor is also quite good  even though it mostly comes from Ron  There is never a dull moment in this book and that s what I love about it  Harry  Ron and Hermoine are probably one of my most favorite characters from all the books I ve ever read  Sooo starting the next one soon   Tolles Buch    Bin schon sehr gespannt auf die nachsten Teile  Leider kenne ich schon alle Filme  was mir den Lesespass  zumindest im ersten Band  genommen hat  da ich die Handlung kenne und die Spannung nicht mehr so gross ist   Ok  Ive finally read it  You all happy     I did enjoy the book  I love the characters  Though it did get a little annoying when our little trio here kept breaking the rules without getting in trouble  Uncle Vernon actually reminds me a lot of my dad to be honest  If I got a letter inviting me to hogwarts  He d probably have a very similar reaction  I can t wait to dive into the next book and see what adventures await  2015 Reading Challenge  39  Un libro con magia 4 5No  esto no es una relectura  Si  es primera vez que leo Harry Potter  Una pena   verdad  pero bueno  nunca es tarde  Solo habia visto las peliculas de Harry Potter y hasta ahora no me habia dignado a leer los libros  que tontera  Solo puedo decir que me maravilla la genialidad de Rowling para crear un mundo como este  La sensacion que te deja terminar de leer este libro  y supongo que el resto de las entregas  es indudablemente mucho mas magica que cualquier hechizo del mundo de mi querido Harry Potter   Loved the audiobook  Stephen Fry is great actually  But I listened to its American version on youtube  it sounded better than Fry   I cannot lie and must put my hand up that I am Potter mad  I have read  In both print and digital  the series so many times that I lost count a long time ago  I have seen the films so many times that I could prompt the actors lines if needed so it s not as if I don t know the stories and know what is gonna happen  but guess what      Yep  I am going through them again but to complete the whole experience I am now listening to them on audio Stephen Fry does a fabulous job of narrating this story  he has the sort of voice that is easy to listen to and his voices and portrayal of the characters are wonderful     Now onto Chamber of Secrets   Pour connaitre mon avis sur la version illustree d Harry Potter  rdv ici   http   jenesaispointlire fr harry pot     Source  I own a copy of this book  This is the second time I have read this book  I thought it was okay before  but as I stumbled upon  Pottermore  last week I thought I would read along while exploring the story on Pottermore I have to say that I enjoyed the book much more this time  whether this was in part due to Pottermore  or whether I could just imagine in the film in my head as I was reading it this time I don t know Anyway  I ll definitely be re reading the other boks  and playing along on Pottermore 8 out of 10  hdh lktb hw mn  shhr lktb w kthrh mby an  lqS  km hy m rwfh lljmy  ttHdth  n hry bwtr lm rwf bqdrth lsHry  lktb

read any of the Harry Potter books  I d seen the movies and liked a few of them  But I only liked one out of the last four and figured now that I knew the story  I wouldn t be impressed by the twists and the turns of the books I changed my mind on this for a couple of reasons  One  I ve read all of Rowling s other works  namely her detective series and  The Casual Vacancy   I was very impressed by her writing ability  particularly her ability to develop characters and tell a good story  Two  several years have gone by since I have seen any of the Potter films and I m sure to have forgotten many of the details  And three  I recently spent some time with one of my cousins who s an absolute Potter fanatic  Seeing her excitement for the material awoke my inner nerd Well I can definitely say I m glad I picked up  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone   or  Ello  Arry  as it s known in England   I assume   This book was top shelf story telling and included several story element left out of the book  It was interesting to see what the filmmakers cut  I mostly agree with their edits for the movie but was glad to read them in the book  Things that still don t make sense to me   Quidditch  This game is insanely dangerous and the rules don t really make sense  Why wouldn t everybody just be going for the Snitch  I feel like Rowling could have fleshed this out a bit more but I get it  it needed to be dangerous from a narrative perspective   Ok  so Harry grew up in the Muggle world and I get that a lot of the kids at Hogwarts came from magic families but where do these magic families live  Don t they secretly live in the Muggle world  Are there secret towns of just magic people  Some of the kids didn t know what British money looked like or what soccer was  That boggles the mind   At this point  it s been more tell than show in terms of Harry s uniqueness  The only thing he seems to be naturally good at is riding a broom and catching Snitches  I get that he survived as a baby but come on All in all  very good stuff and I absolutely plan on reading the entire series  E  sempre difficile provare a recensire un libro che  come in questo caso l intera saga di Harry Potter  ci ha cambiato la vita  accompagnandoci dall infanzia fino all eta adulta  Ammetto che da bambina odiavo leggere  ho ancora un libro del Battello a vapore  una collana per bambini e ragazzi  che non ho mai letto  Ma Harry Potter ha aperto per me un mondo nuovo  e non mi riferisco solo all universo di Hogwarts  ma all insieme di infinite realta che la lettura rende possibile conoscere  Forse sara stato grazie alla sua scrittura semplice e scorrevole  o forse alla sua trama avvincente e magica  che lessi questo libro in soli 5 giorni  un grande passo in avanti per una ragazzina che odiava leggere   Continua  http   mywingsofpaper blogspot it 201    I thought the characters were introduced in a memorable way  considering how many characters are in this series  I also liked being introduced into the wizarding world as Harry is introduced  it helped to identify with him  I haven t had the chance to review this in time and now every thought slipped away but what I can say is  it was exactly what I expected and no disapointment at all and also  I m saving my 5 stars for lasts books  Harry is a pretty brave and kool kat   This is the first book in the Harry Potter series  This book follows Harry s adventures as he learns that he is a wizard  and a famous one at that  He is well known through the Wizarding world for surviving the Dark Lord Voldemort when he was an infant  which was how he got the lightening scar on his forehead  Harry attends his first year at Hogwarts  and learns how to use magic  the history of magic and how to play Quidditch  He also comes to make many friends and enemies  I as many people do  love the story of Harry Potter  I have seen all the movies but this is my first time reading the books  The first book was very impressive  I think what draws me most to this story is how well thought out and creative it is  So much goes on in this 223 book  J K Rowling writes very to the point  and due to this has so much time to weave in little details that come to mean so much in the grand scheme of things  I also love the world building  There is just so much detail that this world actually feels like an actual world  and plus it s really fun to read about  There is a government system  a banking system  a major sport  a chess game  a house points system in the school  a culture  such as how people view drinking unicorn blood   The list goes on  I can t wait to learn more about this world  J K Rowling has completely mastered story telling What I also really love about this book is the amount of character involvement  I feel like so much is going on plot wise  and yet  there are so many characters involved  I love a book that can still have a lot of plot but somehow manage to introduce lots of characters that don t just disappear  I ve read books that are fantasy and yet are filled with dialogue and have nowhere as many characters that are in this book  How J K Rowling does it  I haven t figured out   I m trying   Every character is so distinct from the other  What I think J K Rowling does really well with Dumbledore and Voldemort  is get so many characters to say praise or fear about them  that we as readers feel a sense of importance about them  I always felt timid when one of the two came into the story  because I knew how important they were from how much characters reacted to them  She told us these characters were important  but she also showed us I found Harry s character to be really well done  He comes from not the nicest childhood  and yet he does not pity himself at all and has a lot of self respect for himself  This made me also have respect for him  His bravery is evident right from the start and I can see there is a lot of room for this bravery to grow  He is also really kind to those he considers his friends and see s the best in them   You re worth twelve of Malfoy   Harry said   The Sorting Hat chose you for Gryffindor  didn t it  And where s Malfoy  In stinking Slytherin   Ron is my favorite character from the films  and I still really liked his character in this book  I like his simple and snarky personality  I d like to have a friend like him  He speaks his mind and whilst he really has aspirations for himself  he does not get envious or try to outshine Harry  He is the best friend Harry could have to be honest  One who supports him but can keep up with him  Hermione  also  does this  I m not the biggest fan of young Hermione but since I know how she develops as a character  I know I am going to come to love her soon  By the end of the book she was already winning my heart  and let s face it  Harry and Ron wouldn t really get anywhere far without her  The ending scenes prove that each has their distinct talents from each other that mean they work perfectly as a group Other characters were great  such as Neville  I loved how much time he was given  just thank you J K Rowling for loving the side characters and giving them importance in the story  and Hagrid  who I loved more in the book than the film  He is seriously adorable  I liked what Draco s character brought to the story  annoying villains are always needed to create good diversity in characters  I actually do not like Snape a lot in the films but somehow liked him a little more in this book  because more time was given in explaining him as a person   Another reason why books are almost always better than the film  they have more time   I also liked that the villains had reasons for why they did what they did  That s always important yet often not done   There is no good and evil  there is only power  and those too weak to seek it  I must say that I am not a huge fan of J K Rowling s writing personally  which is why I did not give this book 5 stars  It just wasn t a 5 star book for me personally  but it was AMAZING   Also  I am certain I will enjoy the books more as they go so I need room for my love to get bigger from here   I just like a book that takes a moment to explain scenery and how a place feels through different senses  such as smell and touch  Because J K Rowling s writing is very to the point  I didn t get much of that  Sometimes I had trouble picturing what was going on because I just didn t feel like there was enough descriptions  I know this is a children s book so she has done the right thing  But as an adult I just crave for that detail  but I would never want that changed because obviously she has done it the way she has for a reason  Also  if she wasn t such a fast passed writer  not as much would have been able to happen  and how much happens is what I really love about these books  So overall  I thought this was a great book  I think it has great messages for children  being loyal to your friends and being brave  as well as the importance of love and the damaging effects of greed   It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live  remember that   I guess they did sneak around a bit and break rules which I know some adults dislike about these books  But personally as a kid these films taught me a lot of good things and I would have learnt a lot more if I had read the books   Books  And cleverness  There are more important things   friendship and bravery   I ve wanted to read this for years but never did until now  I started it last night and finished it this afternoon  It was definitely not a disappointment  I was a little worried that it would be because I d been waiting so long to read it so I thought it might not meet my expectations  But it totally did It was a really good start to the series and even though I ve read a lot about them and already know a lot I felt like it was my first time ever hearing any of it  It all seemed new and exciting  I loved the writing and just wanted to keep reading  I love it when books do that  The story can be the best you ve ever heard but if it isn t written well you won t want to keep reading it I really loved most of the characters  The only one I didn t really like was Dumbledore  I even liked the Dursley s just because they were so funny to me  Dumbledore just came across as a total airhead to me  I m hoping I ll like him more in later books  So far my favorite s are Harry  Hermione  and the twins I guess I don t really have much more to say about this one but I m certainly going to read the next one Negatives There really wasn t anything that bothered me in this one  There was some pretty mild language and some of the story might be frightening or disturbing for younger readers   This was an audio we listened to on a long trip over school vacation  Upon returning home  we had an hour left to the story and neither of my kids were interested in hearing the ending  I have held onto this for weeks but their position hasn t changed  Here is mine  I typically do not enjoy series and I have never wanted to read this  My husband owns most  if not all of these books  we stood in line on Block Island at midnight over 10 years ago to get the newest edition and I thought he was nuts   did I mention he does not read fiction   ever  and they just look long  I have a feeling the audio was too much to take in in one sitting  especially for the kids  Perhaps they will be more interested when they are older  There is certainly enough for an inquiring mind to dissect here   symbolism  themes  etc  I have heard that this series is beyond brilliant and that the more books you read the more you see the tremendous  detailed foreshadowing  There is no doubt Rowling is a master storyteller with an explosive imagination  The problem is me  I guess  I enjoyed it but I don t feel compelled to keep going  I suspect maybe in the future I will read this to the kids but maybe they will read it on their own  or not  and if so  it s not likely I will continue reading these  With that said  the story was fun  the narrator was fantastic and for the names of the characters alone  I would dole out 10 stars  Well done  Olha  esse livro e claramente sobre BRUXARIAS  Porque nada mais explica de eu lembrar de tanta coisa de uma leitura que fiz 13 anos atras  Gente  eu nao consigo lembrar dos plots de livros que eu li ano passado  mas lembrava EM DETALHES das descricoes da J  K  Rowling  estou eternamente em choque 10 pontos pra Grifinoria por J  K  conseguir escrever algo que fixa tanto na nossa memoria  POREM   5 pontos porque  pelo menos nesse primeiro livro  Harry Potter nao e aquele tipo de leitura que toda vez que voce refaz voce   aprende algo novo   ou percebe alguma coisa que tinha deixado passar batido  mas que faz completo sentido com a informacao que voce tem do 7 livro da serie A narrativa da J  K  e bem sem gracinha  e direta ao ponto que voce nao consegue sentir muito o suspense ou sofrer com o Harry  Eu sinto muita falta da parte emocional dos personagens sabe Outra coisa que me incomoda muito e o jeito que a autora faz as distincoes das casas  eu sei que nem todo mundo da Sonserina e malvadao e as pessoas da Lufa lufa nao sao todas sem graca  mas do jeito que a J  K  escreve parece que sim e e TAO FRUSTRANTE  E essa situacao poderia ter sido facilmente resolvida se o Harry  o Ron e a Hermione fossem de casas diferentes Acho que o maior merito desse livro  e e realmente um merito gigante  e que e impossivel de se ler Harry Potter sem morrer de vontade de estudar em Hogwarts  receber uma carta por uma coruja  ir no Olivares comprar suas varinha  sentar debaixo do chapeu seletor  etc  etc  etc  O world building da Rowling e MARAVILHOSO  Chega da uma tristeza parar de ler so pra de deparar com a certeza que nos nunca vamos ver um campeonato de quadribol Vou segui relendo a serie  mas intercalando outras leituras no meio P S   Neville MELHOR PESSOA  Queria que esses livros fosse sobre ele  Eh non  ceci n etait pas une relecture mais bien une premiere fois   Il aura fallu que j attende mon trentieme printemps pour pouvoir enfin dire  J ai lu Harry Potter   Je suis bien entendu fan de la saga   cinematographique   et maintenant qu elle est close  mon seul moyen de retrouver les personnages et cet univers que j adore tant etait de les redecouvrir dans leur version initiale Je revois l une de mes profs de fac dire a la classe  Lire Harry Potter  d accord  mais en anglais    et j aurais vraiment du l ecouter car c est un roman effectivement tres  tres jeunesse  flagrant en VF  Mon excuse   J ai craque pour le coffret et les couvertures de Folio  ca vaut ce que ca vaut   Bon alors  exactement comme pour  Le Trone de Fer   je risque de m attirer les foudres des puristes mais j ai prefere la version cine de ce premier opus  peut etre que parce que je l ai vue en premier  peut etre a cause de la narration simpliste  des descriptions moindres  Evidemment  impossible de ne pas visualiser les acteurs mais ca ne m a pas derangee  J ai meme pu constater que le film est plutot fidele au livre malgre quelques differences  mineures parfois comme certaines couleurs de cheveux qui ne correspondent pas ou un personnage qui a disparu pendant le transfert  d autres un peu plus importantes en impliquant davantage un personnage dans une situation alors qu il avait un role moindre dans le livre  Aussi  j ai remarque que l amitie entre Harry  Ron et Hermione se fortifiait plus vite au cinema    En bref  moi qui aurais voulu en apprendre un peu plus sur les persos  je n ai pas ete tres gatee avec ce premier tome mais il m en reste six autres a lire et j ai tout de meme pris grand plaisir a retrouver Harry et ses amis     It was about time I finally read the book  I never was a real  Potterhead   I always enjoyed the movies  although I still haven t seen the last 2  I think     oh well  I ll definitely watch them soon now   but never even thought about reading the books  To be honest  now that I finished book 1  I don t even know why  I absolutely loved it  Yes  at times it was a bit  hard  to read   and by that I only mean Hagrid and his weird way of talking in the book   but it s hilarious  thrilling  exciting  magical and just really  really cool Hogwarts and the rest of the scenery are fantastic  It s amazing how detailed J K  Rowling described everything and how well you could imagine it in your head  Yes  the movies are a great help but even without them I think I would have awesome pictures in my head  The different houses  Quidditch  the sorting hat  the mirror of Erised  the invisibility cloak and and and     such great ideas and honestly  you can only love them and be intrigued    It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies  but just as much to stand up to our friends    The characters are also extraordinary  They have beautiful character traits and strenghts and each person is unique  The friendship between Hermione  Ron and Harry is wonderful  When they were first introduced they were completely different but troughout the book and towards the end you could clearly see how much everyone changed and influenced the others  Hermione Granger as the little perfectionist and overachiever that you can count on when you need her the most  Ron Weasley as a loyal  funny and fierce  best  friend that is always by your side and goes through the same stuff as yourself and Harry Potter as the intelligent and brave young boy who fights to protect his friends and Hogwarts  no matter what it costs  They re an amazing trio I loved Hagrid and how protective and kind he was to Harry  Professor Dumbledore is the one you look up to and admire because he s so clever and wise  Then there s Malfor and Snape and Voldemort     everyone s just super cool and interesting to read about    The truth   Dumbledore sighed   It is a beautiful and terrible thing  and should therefore be treated with great caution    Because I already saw the movie I knew what was going to happen but I didn t remember everything and especially the end surprised me a lot  I just completely forgot about it  so that was very thrilling and exciting  I m really looking forward to continue the series as soon as possible and I even think I ll like the other books even more  I m glad I finally gave in and read it   D www aworldbetweenfoldedpages blogspot com Edit  Dec  2015   I often get the urge to re read this series which often keeps me from reading other things  One thing I noticed this time around is how alive the characters seem  People often say that when you write  the characters develop a life of their own and the story almost writes itself  I felt this way  as a reader  about the characters in Harry Potter  It must be the way Rowling writes but picturing all their actions  reactions and interactions always seems so real and convincing  For other books  depending on the detail of their description  I may need to put in some effort to get an image of the characters in mind  But the Harry Potter cast just seems to sweep you off and away into the world of magic without you realizing that you re actually still reading Harry Potter was the first actual novel that I ve ever owned and read Although I read the first two volumes when they were released I only continued with the last five several years later   in fact I only continued when all volumes were out  When I finally got past reading beyond the first two volumes it got the bolder rolling  I ended up reading the series in a loop      preventing me from continuing other books I had planned on reading  and counting it as one of my most favourite stories ever There are so many lovable characters   it makes it so hard to pick a favourite  Then  of course  I love school themed stories and even more  magic  I only gave the first volume four stars despite liking the series so much  I enjoy the first volume as much as the others and it ll always have something special as it was the first I ve ever had and the first in the series  Still  I decided to give it four stars instead of five mainly in comparison to the following books of the series   In theory  I should hate this book It has a Chosen One and a Dark Lord  for goodness  sake  which is a trope that s been so driven into the ground you can barely see the top of it  The worldbuilding is whimsical and absurd  Half the moments of progress for the protagonist involve luck or coincidence  The heroes are 11 years old and excessively competent  It starts with a prologue  not labelled as such  but it is  all about the dull and ordinary lives of some unpleasant people who aren t even the protagonists So why do so many people love it  Why do I love it  Why do we even seek out badly written fanfiction of it in order to get more Here s what I think  On the flip side of the whimsy is a powerful sense of wonder  Harry s dull suburban life at the start is replaced by the wizarding world  which is full of life and colour and fun   and risk and adventure  too  It s exactly that prologue of mundanity that sets us up for the world to open out like a tropical flower as Harry and Hagrid enter Diagon Alley  and later Hogwarts  The wizarding world is intense  it s a place where things matter and great issues are at stake  like high school only much more so  I used to think of J K  Rowling s great strength as being plotting  because she weaves plots and subplots together so competently  Every book has them  Who will win the House Cup  Who will win at Quidditch  How will the latest Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher be nobbled  Will Harry get caught sneaking round and punished  Will he find out about the mysterious thing  What new method of transport will be used  What will Malfoy plot  and how will he be foiled  and will his father hear about this  Later on  who will snog whom  and will it last  and who else will be jealous  Who will be killed  Will Neville do something courageous and or stupid Now  I look at it in a slightly different way  What Rowling is so very good at is raising questions  like the ones I ve just posed  and giving us reasons to care about the answers  Then she staggers questions and answers so that we keep on having a reason to read on Very often  the reason we care is that the characters care  and we identify with the characters  Her most important characters are outsiders  Harry  raised by abusive foster parents without knowledge of his heritage  Hermione  too smart to be popular  Ron  from a family without much money or status  Neville  raised by his grandmother and a bit of a nebbish  Luna  eccentric as a brush  even Snape  greasy  bullied  unlucky in love  We see how they re underdogs  and we cheer for the underdogs as they strive and struggle and triumph  and sometimes fail  and pay the cost  and keep fighting anyway   Her characters have distinct voices  Hagrid s is the most distinctive on the page  but every one of them sounds different  from sarcastic Harry to hoity toity Hermione to rough hewn Ron to dreamy Luna  Having seen the films  of course  helps  but even in text  the voices are clear and distinct  A few of the background characters might be interchangeable  but even then  you d never confuse Seamus with Dean  for example  And the characters matter to each other  Their relationships  good or bad  have power  They answer the questions together  and those relationships help and hinder and change and develop as they do so  Not everything about the series  or the writing  is as good as it could be  There are parts you don t want to think too hard about  and sentences that don t bear close inspection  Overall  though  we see relatable characters with important connections to one another  solving multiple overlapping problems that they care about in a world that s vigorous  fresh and alive  and that s what made the author richer than the Queen  From a piece on the 25th anniversary of Star Trek  Generations  found here  http   www grantland com story _ id 8        T hink about the Harry Potter series  One of the reasons J K  Rowling s books exerted such an appeal over every sentient creature on earth is that they resolved  indeed fused  a cultural contradiction  She took the aesthetic of old fashioned English boarding school life and placed it at the center of a narrative about political inclusiveness  You get to keep the scarves  the medieval dining hall  the verdant lawns  the sense of privilege  you re a wizard  Harry   while not only losing the snobbery and racism but actually casting them as the villains of the series  It s the Slytherins and Death Eaters who have it in for mudbloods  not Harry and his friends  Hogwarts  true heirs  The result of this  I would argue  is an absolutely bonkers subliminal reconfiguration of basically the entire cultural heritage of England  It s as if Rowling reboots a 1 000 year old national tradition into something that s  a  totally unearned but  b  also way better than the original  Of course it electrified people   The phenomenal success of Harry Potter makes it almost superfluous to review the books  Nothing a detractor could say will deter fans  Nothing a fan could say will make the books any more enjoyable  However  I would like to try to comment on this first book  simply to try and understand the appeal  As everyone who has not been living on a deserted island or in a deep pit already knows  Harry Potter is the story of a boy who learns that he is a wizard  Recently  the final book of the series came out and the epic battle between the good wizards and the hellish Death Eaters has drawn to a close  However  this first book shows few signs of the saga to come  It opens with a Roald Dahl esque story about a unique child in an exaggeratedly bad  yet humorous  situation  not unlike Matilda   As the story progresses it becomes more whimsical  but retains the dark humor and colorful  sometimes even grotesque  characters that testify to the Dahlian influence  Even by the end  when Harry faces off  for the first time  with the evil Dark Lord  the story is no darker than the climax of The Witches  There is no hint in this work of the dangers to come  But  everyone knows the plot of Harry Potter  Or else  they really should  Anyone who wants to be up to date in the world of literature and modern culture must read the most popular book series of all time  Not everyone will enjoy it  but it must be read  The real question is  are the books of any merit There are really two dominant groups when it comes to a book as popular as HP  the detractors who give it but one star  and the fans who heap on as many as allowed  The detractors  however  are also made of two groups  those who honestly do not like the books  and those who are jealous and biased against them  one reviewer was obviously against fantasy   The latter  who believe that reading one of the books enables them to judge the scope of the series  who brush aside the fans with cheep name calling  are not to be taken seriously  After all  with a series so universally loved  there must be some element of universality that should be honestly examined  Are all of the millions of fans idiots  Or is there an element to the story that touches on a universal aspect of mankind  I would argue that it is the latter  as to stereotype a huge number of people is not only difficult but probably impossible and smells of elitism  The universality of the story  in my opinion  lies within J K  Rowling s characters  One could go on and on about certain weaknesses in her prose  though I notice many of these detractors tend to dislike children s books in general and cannot come to grasp the idea that the writing in a book for children should be less dense than the writing of Dante   One could complain about various discrepancies  But  one cannot condemn her characters  And it is in these characters that her genius lies  Any one of them could be someone you know  I found myself so often looking at this or that character and thinking   Why he she is just like so and so   What is more  Rowling s insights into the hearts of children are penetrating  Who cannot recall the feelings that she gives her characters  And each one perfectly fits the situations given in the book  The characters are not the sole strength of the books  either  A list of her strengths would be as follows 1  A world that is believable and transcends the story  The wizarding world and culture is not only interesting to imagine  colorful  and enjoyable to escape into  but it has a life outside of the realm of the book  Many fantasy writers do not seem to know their worlds  and the readers are left lost and unsure of the culture they are supposed to immerse themselves in  The wizarding world is well developed and structured  and as fully realized as Middle Earth  2  Rowling s use of mythology is charming  She brings to life both classic creatures  giants  centaurs  unicorns  as well as less familiar ones  hippogriffs  boggarts   She also puts her own twist on otherwise familiar characters  and manages to conform each of the creatures to her own mythology  Say what you may about the books  this takes some skill 3  The witty wordplay in the books found me smiling  4  The books are filled with plot points  Hardly an event happens that does not either move the plot forwards or reveal new layers of character  Again  this is difficult to do and takes some skill and literary vision 5  Rowling works into the stories universal themes that have moved civilizations since antiquity  good vs  evil  the weak outshining the strong  the value of courage  love and friendship  self sacrifice  Naturally  such universal themes would help account for the books  universality  And Rowling s take on the themes is both as fresh as it is timeless   Take Harry s final battle  for example  6  Lastly  Rowling manages to reach into the depths of her readers  hearts and bring us back to our childhood fantasies  How many of us did not imagine ourselves on great adventures in mythical worlds  The stories bring to mind nothing so much as the stories of my early childhood  The magical feel is both familiar and exhilarating  sending the readers on a journey as nostalgic as it is adventuresome  Frankly  I believe that to write off these books is foolish  One may find fault with them  but certainly something with such universal appeal is worth more than one star  And I believe that in the years to come  these books will find their place alongside Narnia  The Lord of the Rings  Alice in Wonderland  The Wizard of Oz  and the collected works of Roald Dahl   I originally read this book years ago when the whole Harry Potter phenomena was just starting  Back then only a few of the books were out so when I finished one I was eagerly anticipating the next one along with everyone else  Book 7 came out and since it had been so long since I had read book 6 I wanted to do a re read of the series  Of course life got in the way along with other books on my mountain TBR so I never came up with time to do a proper re read  Since discovering audio books  thanks to GR  I decided to get the audio book and relive the experience this way  What a great option  Jim Dale is the narrator and just does an excellent job bringing the story to life  The moment the audio started I was transported back into the wizarding world along with Harry  In the years since reading this story I forgot about the genius that is J K  Rowling  What looks like a deceptively simple children s story is actually an epic tale about good versus evil  There are so many little details included that you can t help but feel part of Harry s world  When I originally read this book I gave it a four  It was okay for me but now that the whole series has been out and I ve read up to book 6 I see how each piece fits in  I m going to stick to my original impression of the book which was 4 stars  but I will give the audio five stars for Jim Dale s work and also because I m able to appreciate it more now that I know what is to happen   Edit 07 28 15  Still so very  very good  Always feels like coming home Istyria book blog   B s world of enchanted books Re reading and reviewing this awesome series for my seven week event  Harry Potter Tuesdays  on my blog  This review will  of course  have some spoilers  If you have lived under a rock for the past ten years or so  please join the living again  You should have read these books a long time ago Everyone knows Harry Potter  Well  there may be some who don t  Those who live under rocks or something  but most people have at least heard of it  Whether they ve seen the movies or read the books or both  In this first book  we meet him for the first time  He s a young boy that lives with his uncle and aunt  Needless to say he s not very happy there  When he finds out he s a wizard  a very famous one at that  his life changes completely  He goes to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry were he makes friends and enemies  But there s something dark lurking in the shadows Every time I read these books I need to remind myself that it was meant for kids and it s written that way  So some things are a bit more simple than the books I m used to reading  But after a few pages  I don t care anymore  I get sucked into that world again and the fact that I ll never get bored of them  that s saying something  This is the first book in the series and every time I read the entire series  I notice that the writing gets better every book  Everything gets better  But it s so great to start that journey again and I think I love the books more every time I read them Here s a little fun fact  This book is actually the last one I read in the series  Pretty weird  but it s true  And I get confused about the title every time  In some countries it s the Philosopher s Stone and in others it s the Sorcerer s Stone  On my copy  it s the first  But still  Confusing I don t have to tell you how much I love these characters  I feel an instant connection to Harry Potter and I did the first time I met him  He is like a dear friend to me by now  That cute eleven year old boy  And his friends Ron and Hermione  I just love them so much  But knowing how it all ends  gives you a sad feeling too when you read about Dumbledore and the Weasley twins  And I got to hate Malfoy and Dudley all over again because they were spoiled brats and nothing more  Oh and I can t forget about Neville  It s so awesome to start this journey once again So if you have not read this series yet because you ve lived under a rock or something  I suggest you start soon  You re missing out on something great and in the end you belong to that awesome community called the Potterheads and you ll wait for a letter that has yet to arrive even though your twelfth birthday is so far in the past  or not    Seriously  I m still waiting for mine     This book will keep the four stars that I first gave it  though I am looking at it with a new respect When I first read the book I remember it being slow and interesting  This time around however it seemed to breeze through situation after situation  While not necessarily a bad thing  it really didn t give me time to breathe in between the chain of events  At least not until the chapter breaks  Everything was fairly simple and straight forward  though Rowling did a hell of a job world building in this first book  while keeping the focus on the plot  She does well to give the characters believable personalities  and sticking to them  Other than that there really isn t much wrong  except for the breezing through events  Again not a bad thing  but it didn t really leave time to let everything sink in  Still an addicting read  and a great way to start off the series  A few years ago  when I was way younger  I got this book for Christmas  I really liked it and I continued to read the series  until I got to Goblet Of Fire  When I was nine  I didn t really feel like reading a book that is 700 pages long  I didn t like long books at the time  so I stopped reading the series  and it was a long time before I read anything else I really  really want to finish this series now  so I m rereading the first three books  I know I m kind of late  really  REALLY late  but I really like these books  and I like long books now  so now is the time   PSo I might be a little late  but I m excited This was a great read  I loved the characters  the places  the writing   and it was such a fun and fast read  Can t wait to finish the whole series     Rereading Harry Potter is like a beautiful return to the magical world of childhood with an adult twist  It has been years since I first read the  Sorcerer s Stone  and which I find pretty intriguing   I like it even more now than I liked it years ago  It is funny  very British  with many  wink winks  to adult reader  but most of all   it s pure magic  This time I read the new edition with Jim Kay s illustrations   they re divine  Subtle  nostalgic  simply beautiful  A rare piece of art Harry will be perfect for younger and older readers and there s nothing left to write than   J K  Rowling created something different  something new and even after almost twenty  TWENTY   years it is still remarkable  This is the third time I read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone  but the first time I read it in english  Fantastic experience as usual  The urge to jump right into the second book is incredibly strong  and I think I ll give in very soon The actual rating is 4 5 4 75 stars  but I settled for 4 just because there are books in the series which I liked more  But it is still flawless  just like all the other HP books   I m feeling quite nostalgic these days  don t know why  I haven t read this series in years and it feels so good to re read the magic that was Harry Potter  No  really  this book is magic  The story is exciting and the main characters are captivating  The humor is also quite good  even though it mostly comes from Ron  There is never a dull moment in this book and that s what I love about it  Harry  Ron and Hermoine are probably one of my most favorite characters from all the books I ve ever read  Sooo starting the next one soon   Tolles Buch    Bin schon sehr gespannt auf die nachsten Teile  Leider kenne ich schon alle Filme  was mir den Lesespass  zumindest im ersten Band  genommen hat  da ich die Handlung kenne und die Spannung nicht mehr so gross ist   Ok  Ive finally read it  You all happy     I did enjoy the book  I love the characters  Though it did get a little annoying when our little trio here kept breaking the rules without getting in trouble  Uncle Vernon actually reminds me a lot of my dad to be honest  If I got a letter inviting me to hogwarts  He d probably have a very similar reaction  I can t wait to dive into the next book and see what adventures await  2015 Reading Challenge  39  Un libro con magia 4 5No  esto no es una relectura  Si  es primera vez que leo Harry Potter  Una pena   verdad  pero bueno  nunca es tarde  Solo habia visto las peliculas de Harry Potter y hasta ahora no me habia dignado a leer los libros  que tontera  Solo puedo decir que me maravilla la genialidad de Rowling para crear un mundo como este  La sensacion que te deja terminar de leer este libro  y supongo que el resto de las entregas  es indudablemente mucho mas magica que cualquier hechizo del mundo de mi querido Harry Potter   Loved the audiobook  Stephen Fry is great actually  But I listened to its American version on youtube  it sounded better than Fry
