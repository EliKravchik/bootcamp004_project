At my college graduation  the speaker was a gruff professor  He was one of those older men whom people somewhat patronizingly describe as a teddy bear to convey the idea that while he looks like Santa Claus  they wouldn t be surprised to see him arraigned on assault charges at the local courthouse  I liked this professor in general  and his graduation speech was a grand  warm congratulations on a crisp early summer day  He decided to inform us  however  that anyone who had not read The Iliad and The Odyssey should not be graduating from college  I was one of those lucky  lucky   folks  like an illiterate kid graduating from high school  I decided to rectify the situation as soon as possible  and I spent an indefinite number of hours in the next few  sunny weeks laying in a hammock on my porch  the boy I loved commiserating with me about this wonderful book  It is a warm  sharp memory  That was mumble mumble years ago  and this summer  I thought that since I just graduated again  I would read it again  It was a good choice  Warm  summer days in the hammock with limb chopping  flashing helms  and mountain goats rushing down the hillside I can t find this quote I m thinking of  but I m pretty sure it s from Beowulf  and it goes something like   Brave men should seek fame in foreign lands   Google does not think that quote exists  so maybe I dreamed it  which is really neither here nor there  but kind of weird  Something about that quote  about this book  and about the way this book reminds me of that quote  makes my blood beat close to my skin  I get this feeling that my heart grows too big for my ribs  and my eyeballs get tight  as though I m going to cry  But  my heart doesn t pound  and no tears come That is how this book feels to me This story is about what Homer doesn t describe as much as what he does  and reading it evokes some kind of mirroring response from my body  The Iliad is the almost death of Achilles  the almost destruction of Troy  and reading it is an almost panic attack  an almost sob  It is the absent top step in a flight of stairs  But  oh man  that flight of stairs  How do you even make that  It s not possible to spoil this story because Homer is always one step ahead  tripping you up about what story he s telling  So  just because I think it s fun  and  also because it seems kind of absurd to write a  review  of The Iliad  so I m wandering in the dark here   I m going to give a brief summary This story is about a bunch of guys fighting over some women fleshlights and jewelry  Mostly the women fleshlights  Everyone s been at this war for nine years  sidebar  weirdly  when I read that it was nine years  I thought   NINE YEARS  WHO WOULD FIGHT A WAR FOR THAT LONG  Oh  wait            As you probably know  the war initially started because Paris  a Trojan  stole Helen  who was the iPhone 5 of fleshlights  from Menelaus  an Argive  The Argives are at their ships  the Trojans are in Ilium  behind the city walls  There s lots of blood and guts and pillaging throughout  This story  Homer clearly tells us  is about Paris and Helen s betrayal of Menelaus  and it is about the death of Achilles  The story opens with Agamemnon  the king of the Argives  having stolen a fancy new fleshlight from Achilles  who is a child of a water nymph  Achilles refuses to continue fighting if Agamemnon is going to take his fleshlight  Then  Achilles has this beautiful  beautiful moment where he questions the very nature of fighting over fleshlights  We are all pawns in the petty squabbles of the gods The gods are easily my favorite parts of this story  though it is not really about them in a certain way  It is not really about them in the way that any discussion of a god is not really about the god  On the one hand  it is about how our lives are just pawns in this squabbling  incestuous  eternal Thanksgiving dinner in the sky  On the other hand  it is still about the pawns  The gods are compelling on their own  but my heart tries to escape my chest not because of their story  but because  yes  humans do live and die by some kind of petty lottery run by a rapist married to his sister  Yes  And maybe there is someone bold and wonderful in the sky  like the grey eyed Athena  but we still live and die by the thunder of a maniacal drunk uncle  Yes  that seems true So  in the midst of the chopping of limbs  the shatteringly beautiful similes  death after death  and the machinations of the dysfunctional immortal family  this story is about the betrayal of Menelaus and the death of Achilles  The thing that is absolutely  hands down the most insane about this story to me is that those two events are deeply vivid in my mind in connection to this book  but neither of them actually happens here  How is that possible   How do you plant enough seeds about an event in a reader s mind that when she closes a book  those seeds grow into whole  robust images about the event  My blood does that thing where it tries to get out of my skin just from thinking about that  I can picture Achilles s death so vividly  picture lying in that hammock and reading it after I graduated from college  but that never happened  Homer just planted the seeds of his death in my brain  and they grew from my constant pondering over them  Helen and Paris sailing away grew in my mind through Helen s beautiful regrets This is a story that I could think about for days  Helen s mourning  like the women I ve seen apologize for causing their husbands  abuse  no  you didn t cause this   war  and the futility of killing each other  as though we are controlled by the Kardashians of the sky  What causes violence  We say women cause violence because they push our buttons  so we re driven to maim and kill because of the betrayals and button pushing  We say that something eternal  God or the gods  cause violence because they control our fate  they appear to us as birds and as wisdom and lead us on our night blind path of life  but they lead us erratically  drunk  hysterical drivers and us with no seat belt  so we grasp for mere survival  Homer describes those motivations for violence so beautifully But  ultimately I think that is all bullshit  and I think the bullshitness of it is there in this story  too  It is there in Achilles challenging Agamemnon  It is there in Achilles mourning Patroclus  Oh  Patroclus  about whom I haven t even freaked in this review  What a shame  Anyway  though  people are not violent because we were betrayed or because of supernatural trickery  Our violence is ours  it is our choice and our responsibility  Life is barbarous and cruel around us  but that is its nature  and we can only shape ourselves through and around it  When we expect life to be gentle and obedient  we are usually doing nothing more than justifying our own cruelty  I don t think there is an answer to any of this in The Iliad  but it is beautifully told in both the positive and negative space  It is blood poundingly  eye achingly told  As my professor said  everyone should read this  and if you can read it in the sun  lying in a hammock after your graduation  all the better   TROY VI  THE INVENTION OF ACHILLES  The Classics  it is the Classics   William Blake is said to have exclaimed  with pointed reference to Homer   that Desolate Europe with Wars  Blake s exclamation might not be as atrocious as it sounds at first  There might be some truth to this  a universal truth Significantly however  this is not how the ancients understood it  They understood war as the catastrophe that it is Strabo  the Roman geographer  talking about the Trojan wars  puts it thus   For it came about that  on account of the length of the campaign  the Greeks of that time  and the barbarians as well  lost both what they had at home and what they had acquired by the campaign  and so  after the destruction of Troy  not only did the victors turn to piracy because of their poverty  the still more the vanquished who survived the war  It is in this spirit that I chose The Iliad as my first read for The World War I centenary read However  over the war hungry centuries throughout the middle ages and right till the World Wars  this sense of the Epic was twisted by manipulating the images of Achilles   Hector   Hector became the great defender of his country and Achilles became the insubordinate soldier officer   the worst  type   more a cause for the war than even Helen herself  Of course  Achilles  romance was never fully stripped but Hector gained in prominence throughout as the quintessential Patriot Precisely because of this the Blake exclamation might have been more valid than it had a right to be  This is why there is a need to revisit the original tragic purpose of the Epic   most commentators would say that  as above  this original purpose was against ALL wars  But there is much significance to the fact that the epic celebrates the doomed fight of two extinct peoples The Iliad starts on the eve of war and ends on the eve of war  Of a ten year epic war  the poem focuses its attention only on a couple or so of crucial  and in the end inconclusive  weeks  for it does not end with any side victorious but with Hector s death  In fact  it opens with both both Hector   Achilles reluctant and extremely ambivalent towards war  And closes with both Hector   Achilles dead   by mutually assured destruction In that clash of the Titans  the epic defines itself and creates a lasting prophecy However  before we explore that we need to understand Hector   Achilles better and also the Iliad itself In Medias ResThe Iliad opens in medias res  as it were  as if the epic recitation was already on its way and we  the audience  have just joined  It is part of Homer s genius that he creates a world already in process  The art of Iliad is then the art of the entrance  the players enter from an ongoing world which is fully alive in the myths that surround the epic and the audience The poem describes neither the origins nor the end of the war  The epic cuts out only a small sliver of insignificant time of the great battle   and thus focuses the spotlight almost exclusively on Hector   Achilles  narrowing the scope of the poem from a larger conflict between warring peoples to a smaller one between these two individuals  and yet maintaining its cosmic aspirations  So the important question is who are Hector   Achilles and why do these two heroes demand nothing less than the greatest western epic to define and contrast them  The Long Wait For Achilles In Iliad  how single mindedly we are made to focus on Hector  but all the while  the Epic bursts with an absence   that of Achilles After the initial skirmish with Agamemnon and the withdrawal that forms the curtain raiser  Achilles plays no part in the events described in Books 2 through 8  he sits by his ships on the shore  playing his harp  having his fun  waiting for the promised end  The man   says Aristotle in the Politics   who is incapable of working in common  or who in his self sufficiency has no need of others  is no part of the community  like a beast  or a god  Hector is the most human among the heroes of The Iliad  he is the one we can relate with the most east  The scene where Hector meets Andromache and his infant son is one of the most poignant scenes of the epic and heightened by Homer for maximum dramatic tension On the other hand  Achilles is almost non human  close to a god  But still human  though only through an aspiration that the audience might feel   in identifying with the quest for kleos  translated broadly as  honor   Zeus like Achilles  is the usage sometimes employed by Homer   and this is apt in more ways than the straight forward fact that he is indeed first among the mortals just as Zeus is first among the gods Zeus and the Gods know the future  they know how things are going to unfold Among the mortals fighting it out in the plains of Ilium  only Achilles shares this knowledge  and this fore knowledge is what allows him  in the guise of rage  to stay away from battle  even at the cost of eternal honor  Fore knowledge is what makes Achilles  who is the most impetuous man alive  wiser than everyone else Hector on the other hand takes heed of no omens  or signs  nor consults any astrologer  For him  famously  the only sign required is that his city needed saving    and that is omen enough for me   as he declares  He is the rational man  He is the ordinary man  Roused to defense But everything Hector believes is false just as everything Achilles knows is true   for all his prowess  Hector is as ordinary a soldier as anyone else  except Achilles   privy to no prophecies  blind to his own fate  Elated  drunk with triumph  Hector allows himself to entertain one impossible dream notion after other  even to the extent that perhaps Achilles too will fall to him  That he can save Troy all by himself Hector   Achilles  The MetamorphosisLike other ancient epic poems  the Iliad presents its subject clearly from the outset  Indeed  Homer names his focus in its opening word  menin  or  rage   Specifically  the Iliad concerns itself with the rage of Achilles  how it begins  how it cripples the Achaean army  and how it finally becomes redirected toward the Trojans  But  it also charts the metamorphosis of Achilles from a man who abhors a war that holds no meaning for him to a man who fights for its own sake On the other side  it also charts how the civilized Hector  the loving family man and dutiful patriot Hector becomes a savage  driven by the madness of war Before that  an interlude The Other Life Of AchillesOne of the defining scenes of the Epic is the  Embassy Scene  where a defeated Agamemnon sends Odysseus   co to entreat Achilles to return to the battle  That is when Achilles delivers his famous anti war speech  This speech of Achilles can be seen as a repudiation of the heroic ideal itself  of kleos   a realization that the life and death dedicated to glory is a game not worth the candle The reply is a long  passionate outburst  he pours out all the resentment stored up so long in his heart  He rejects out of hand this embassy and any other that may be sent  he wants to hear no more speeches  Not for Agamemnon nor for the Achaeans either will he fight again  He is going home  with all his men and ships  As for Agamemnon s gifts   I loathe his gifts  This is a crucial point in the epic  Achilles is a killer  the personification of martial violence  but he eulogizes not war but life    If I voyage back to the fatherland I love  my pride  my glory dies       true  but the life that s left me will be long           9 502 4  Hector   Achilles  The Battle Royale Notwithstanding Achilles  reluctance and bold affirmations of life  slowly  inevitably  Homer builds the tension and guides us towards the epic clash everybody is waiting for  But though it might seem as preordained  it is useful to question it closely  The confrontation is crucial and deserves very close scrutiny  We must ask ourselves   What brings on this confrontation On first glance  it was fate  but if looked at again  we can see that Homer leaves plenty of room for free will and human agency   Hector had a choice  But not Achilles   instead  Achilles  choice was exercised by Patroclus This calls for a significant re look at the central conflict of the epic  it might not be Hector Vs Achilles Patroclus and Hector instead are the real centerpiece of the epic   Achilles being the irresistible force  that is once unleashed unstoppable  It is a no contest  Hence  the real contest happens before This is because  that unleashing depended entirely on Hector and Patroclus   the two heroes who only went into battle when their side was in dire straits   to defend  Both then got caught up in the rage of battle  and despite the best of advice from their closest advisors  got swept up by it and tried to convert defense into annihilation of enemy   pursuing kleos It is worth noting the significant parallels between Hector and Patroclus  while between Hector and Achilles it is the contrasts that stand forth Hector  instead of just defending his city  surges forth and decides to burn the Achaean ships  Now  the Achaean ships symbolize the future of the Greek race  They constitute the army s only means of conveying itself home  whether in triumph or defeat  Even if the Achaean army were to lose the war  the ships could bring back survivors  the ships  destruction  however  would mean the annihilation  or automatic exile  of every last soldier  Homer implies that the mass death of these leaders and role models would have meant the decimation of a civilization Which means that the Achaeans cant escape   in effect  Hector  by trying to burn the ships is in effect calling for a fight to the death This decision was taken in the face of very strong omens and very good advice In the battle at the trench and rampart in Book Twelve  The Trojans Storm the Rampart  Polydamas sees an eagle flying with a snake  which it drops because the snake keeps attacking it  Polydamas decides this is an omen that the Trojans will lose  He tells Hector they must stop  but Hector lashes out that Zeus told him to charge  he accuses Polydamas of being a coward and warns him against trying to convince others to turn back or holding back himself Hector is driven on by his success to overstep the bounds clearly marked out for him by Zeus  He hears Polydamas  threefold warning  yes  there were two other instances too  not addressed here   yet plots the path to his own death and the ruin of those whom he loves Thus  sadly  Hector pays no heed and surges forth  Which is the cue for the other patriot to enter the fray   for Patroclus And thus Hector s own madness  going beyond success in defense  in the face of sound advice brought on a crises for Achaeans to which their prime defender and patriot  Patroclus responded   and then paralleling Hector s own folly  he too succeeded and then went beyond that to his own death  Thus Patroclus too shows that knows no restraint in victory  his friends too warned him in vain  and he paid for it with his life  By this time Hector had no choice  his fate was already sealed  Achilles was about to be unleashed The most important moment in Iliad to me was this  prior moment    when Hector lost it   when he lost himself to war fury  Hector s first act of true savagery   towards Patroclus and his dead body   lost in folly  Athena had swept away their senses    is how Homer describes Hector and his troops at this point of their triumph Achilles  Unchained Yet  Homer gives Hector one more chance to spurn honor and save himself and diffuse stall the mighty spirit of Achilles that had been unleashed on the battlegrounds  In his soliloquy before the Scacan gate  when he expects to die by Achilles  hand  he also has his first moment of insight  he sees that he has been wrong  and significantly enough Polydamas and his warnings come back to his mind  But he decides to hold his ground for fear of ridicule  of all things So even as all the other Trojans ran inside the impregnable city walls to shelter  Hector waited outside torn between life and honor  contrast this with Achilles who had chosen life over honor  the lyre over the spear  so effortlessly earlier   Hector instead waits until unnerved  until too late  And then the inevitable death comes Thus the Rage was unleashed by two men who tried to do more than defend themselves   they tried to win eternal honor or kleos   the result is the unleashing of the fire called Achilles  his rage  which burns itself and everything around it to the ground  What better invocation of what war means I ask again  what better book to read for the centenary year for The World War I The Last BookThe last words of The Iliad are    And so the Trojans buried Hector  breaker of horses  Thus  fittingly  Homer starts with the Rage of Achilles and ends with the Death of Hector  This is very poetic and poignant  but it is time for more questions Again  why start and end on the eve of battle  Because that is the only space for reflection that war allows  Before the madness of the fury of war or of disaster descends like a miasmic cloud  To use Homer s own phrase   war gives little breathing room  Thus  we end the Epic just as we began it   in stalemate  with one crucial difference   both sides  best men are dead  The two men who could have effected a reconciliation   who had a vision beyond war  are dead  Homer s Prophecies It is made very clear in The Iliad that Achilles will die under Trojan roofs and that Hector will find his doom under the shadow of the Achaean ships   or  both are to die in enemy territory Though Iliad leaves us with full focus on Hector s death and funeral  there is another death that was always presaged but left off from the story   That of Achilles  own  Why Achilles  death is left to the audience to imagine  over and over again  in every context as required  The saga of Hector   Achilles  of the doomed to die heroes  leaves one death to the imagination and thus effects a very neat prophetic function Once Hector committed his folly  once Patroclus rushed to his death  and once Achilles is unleashed  the rest is fixed fate  there is no stopping it  So Homer begins and ends in truce  but with destruction round the corner   as if the cycle was meant to be repeated again and again  stretching backwards and forwards in time   Troy I  Troy II      to Troy VI  Troy VII      where does it end Homer knows that the threshold is crossed  the end is nigh   even Troy s destruction is not required to be part of the epic   with Hector s death  the death of Ilium is nigh too and so is Achilles  own death and past the myths  the death of the Greek civilization  and maybe of all civilization The epic leaves us with the real doomsday just over the horizon  horribly presaged by it  in true prophetic fashion  The Pity of War The pity of war is The Iliad s dominant theme  but it uses themes such as love  ego  honor  fear and friendship to illuminate the motive forces behind war  In another ancient epic  Gilgamesh  the death of a friend prompts a quest which ends in wisdom and an affirmation of life  in The Iliad  the death of the fabled friend leads to a renunciation of wisdom and a quest for death itself  In Gilgamesh  the hero learns the follies of life and rebuilds civilization  in The Iliad  Achilles comes into the epic already armed with this knowledge and moves towards seeking death  choosing to be the destroyer instead of the creator The Iliad is  an epic of unlearning   It mocks optimistic pretensions  In The Iliad  the participants learn nothing from their ordeal  all the learning is left to the audience  Pablo Picasso spent his entire life trying desperately to do something new  something unique  He moved from style to style  mastering and then abandoning both modern and classical methods  even trying to teach his trained artist s hand to paint like a child In 1940  four French teens and a dog stumbled upon a cave that had lain hidden for 16 000 years  Inside  they found the walls covered in beautiful drawings of men and animals  When the Lascaux caves were opened to the public  Pablo Picasso visited them  and as he stared at the prehistoric hunting scenes  was heard to remark in a despondent tone   We have invented nothing  The Iliad is equally as humbling to a writer  as complex  beautiful  and honest as any other work  The war scenes play out like a modern film  gory and fast paced  the ever present shock of death  Though some have been annoyed at how each man is named  or even given a past  before his death  this gives weight to the action  Each death is has consequence  and as each man steps onto the stage to meet glory or death  Homer gives us a moment to recognize him  to see him amidst the whirling action  and to witness the fate Zeus metes The psychological complexity and humanism of this work often shocked me  Homer s depiction of human beings as fundamentally flawed and unable to direct their own lives predicts existentialism  The even hand he gives both the Trojans and the Argives places his work above the later moralizing allegories of Turold  Tasso  or even Milton Of course  Homer s is a different world than theirs  one where the sword has not yet become a symbol for righteousness  In Homer  good men die unavenged  and bad men make their way up in the world  Noble empires fall to ravenous fire and the corpses of fresh limbed young men are desecrated Fate does not favor the kind  the weak  the moral  or even the strong  Fate favors some men now  others later  and in the end  none escapes the emptiness of death  Though Homer paints some men as great  as noble and kind and brave  these men do not uphold these ideals for some promised paradise  but simply because they are such men There is something refreshing in the purity of the philosophy of living life for yourself and yet expecting no entitlement for your deeds  A philosophy which accepts the uncontrollable winds of fate  that when the dark mist comes across our eyes  no man knows whence he goes Later traditions make other claims  that the righteous will be rewarded  that the lives of good men will be good and the bad will be punished  In thousands of years of thinking  of writing  of acting  have we gained nothing but comforting  untenable ideals  Then Picasso was wrong  we have invented something  but it is only a machine which perpetuates itself by peddling self satisfaction  I read and enjoyed the Fagles translation  which may not be the most faithful  but strikes that oft discussed balance between joy of reading and fidelity  He makes no attempt to translate the meter into English  which is a blessing to us  The English language does a few meters well  and Homer s is not one of them  The footnotes were competent and interesting  though I could have stood a few more of them  perhaps I am in the minority  I also thoroughly enjoyed Knox s introductory essay  I would normally have had to research the scholarly history of the book myself  and so Knox s catch me up was much appreciated  I m often kept up at night brooding on my troubles  wishing I could find some solace that would help me sleep  But now I know that the best way to keep insomnia at bay is to get out of bed  hitch up my chariot  tie the corpse of my mortal enemy to the back  and drive around for a few hours  dragging him  until I cheer up and can go back to sleep  The Iliad is unmatched  in my reading  for works that describe the bloody  ridiculous  selfish lengths people will go in order to feel better  The sticks and stones fly  and gouge out eyes  smash skulls  slash livers and veins until the blood sprays this poem is definitely not for the squeamish   but the real weapons of the Trojan War are name calling  cheating at games  and stealing your best buddy s girlfriend or mixing bowl or ox  Most of the action occurs when somebody gets his feelings hurt  the baddie won t apologize  and the sensitive one throws a fit  which can involve letting all of his friends die while he gets an olive oil massage  or else razing a city  raping the women  and joyriding over other men s bones  The Iliad suggests that even at its most glorious  war can be advocated only by people with the emotional lives of spoiled four year olds    For more thoughts  see my post http   alisonkinney com 2015 07 23 ho     The true hero  the true subject  the center of the Iliad  is force  Force as man s instrument  force as man s master  force before which human flesh shrinks back  The human soul  in this poem  is shown always in its relation to force  swept away  blinded by the force it thinks it can direct  bent under the pressure of the force to which it is subjected  Those who had dreamed that force  thanks to progress  now belonged to the past  have seen the poem as a historic document  those who can see that force  today as in the past  is at the center of all human history  find in the Iliad its most beautiful  its purest mirror     Simone WeilWarThe Iliad is  first and foremost  a war poem  It sings of the ten year siege between the Achaeans and the Trojans  a war of which we see only the last hour  I particularly liked the above quote by Simone Weil in her  L Iliade ou le Poeme de la Force   because one of the main strengths of this Homeric epic is its ability to describe the horrors and the futility of war  despite the clear difference in morals and tactics between the Trojan War and modern conflicts I was surprised by how graphic the text was  2500 years old and still capable of being so vividly gruesome  despite the fact we see similar things in the media all the time Unlike modern literature  where one of the goals of the text is to make the reader care for characters  fates  otherwise why read on    The Iliad introduces characters simply to have them killed by a main character in the same page  not caring for their deaths makes the battle scenes slightly more bland However  it is not the violence of the warriors  acts that makes them so captivating  it is the realism of war that  despite having changed  I personally haven t met anyone speared through the guts recently  remains a cruel reminder of the thin line between living or dying Of Gods and MenThe other thing I loved about this text is the question on the free will of men  Do the heroes of the Iliad truly deserve recognition  or are they simply puppets controlled by the gods for their own petty squabbles This is a world where gods fight amongst men in the battlefield  This is a world where every man at arms has some lineage or another they can call to  and throw on the face of the adversary as a ten minute speech instead of fighting  In fact  recent Trojan statistics revealed 90  of Trojan men are sons of King Priam  the Thirsty The whole of the Trojan War  this pit where thousands upon thousands came to die  was caused  ruled over and ended by the Olympian gods  They deflect spears from off their protegees  they guide their heroes  weapons to their mark  they breathe hope to their loved ones and they cast doubt and bring despair to their foes  In a world where a man s every action is scrutinised  judged and possibly altered by the gods of the Olympus  should we treat them as soldiers with a personality and a purpose  Or should we see them as pieces in a chess game the gods refuse to play because they are too busy throwing fistfuls of those pieces at each other  God of the earthquake  you d think me hardly sane if I fought with you for the sake of wretched mortals   like leaves  no sooner flourishing  full of the sun s fire  feeding on earth s gifts  than they waste away and die    Apollo to Poseidon  Book XXIDid Diomedes  a mere human  truly spear Ares  God of War  through the guts  Athena was the one guiding his spear  Athena the one who gave him the strength and breathed courage into him  Did Hector kill Patroclus  Apollo was the one who first attacked him  Apollo was the one who drove Hector to Patroclus Does Agamemnon s pathetic excuse for his childish behaviour towards Achilles hold  Did the gods and the Furies really make him rage against Peleus  son  or is he simply denying responsibility for his actions  because he truly believes he has no free will of his own It is a tricky question  one that I thought was very well explored  and with a great tension relief in the gods  foolishly fighting each other in Book XXII  There is something about Aphrodite being punched in the breasts by Athena and Hera boxing Artemis straight in the face with her own bow that makes these immortal gods less of  glorious masterminds  and more as  jealous prickly idiots  But still the question remains  did the Archaeans  Menelaus and Odysseus  Agamemnon and Diomedes  win the Trojan War over Priam and his sons  Or did Hera  Athena and Poseidon win a petty no matter little war over Apollo  Aphrodite and Ares AchillesAchilles is one of the main characters of the Iliad  well known to this day for his place in this epic and his tendon issues  Son of the lesser goddess Thetis and Peleus  King of Phthia  he is one of the leaders of the Achaean army The book deals with his falling out with the marshall of the army  Agamemnon King of Mycenae  over a slave girl that is taken by the leader of the army from Achilles Much like the falling outs of the gods and war generals in the history to follow  a personal feud escalates with disastrous consequences for the common soldier when Achilles begs his mother to make Zeus support the opposing army so that the Achaeans will have to come begging on their knees for mighty Achilles  pardon and support Achilles is an interesting character in that he has an intrinsic duality to him in everything he does  He has a mortal side and an otherworldly side  being a goddess  issue  As such  cheated of immortality by his father s mortality  he is no more than a man  and in truth a subject to Agamemnon  But as the progeny of a king and a goddess he has a glorified sense of self  holding his honour above all others Achilles situation is so interesting because he is forced to choose between his two sides when his mother tells him  two fates bear me on to the day of death  If I hold out here and I lay siege to Troy  my journey home is gone  but my glory never dies If I voyage back to the fatherland I love  my pride  my glory dies       true  but the life that s left me will be long  the stroke of death will not come on me quickly     Achilles  Book IXAchilles chooses his honour over his life  like many a man in the text would  For Peleus  son at the beginning of the epic  honour is all that s left to him  his death being inevitable  Agamemnon strips him of that same honour by stealing his  prize   and Achilles can never forgive it Curiously  when  losing his honour   he does not recede to his  long life in fatherland  option  He stays  because he still wants to die in glory  except he needs to die waddling in more glory now  So like a spoilt child  in his own self absorbed wailing  he gets thousands of his countrymen killed  simply because it shames his bully and because it will enlarge his own eventual victory  This is Achilles for most of the book  A horrid  spoilt child  who time after time refuses to try to reverse the massacre he created or even to help those going through it  In his egocentrism  he truly has become equal to the gods By the time he does something  thousands have perished by Zeus  promise to Thetis and her son  Achilles finally sends to the war his best friend  Patroclus  it seemed a bromance to me more than a love relationship  but I know there s some controversy over whether they were lovers or not  Patroclus is the only human relationship Achilles seems to hold dear  having not even heeded the pleas of his tutor Phoenix  Their friendship seems to be  as is proven later  the only thing Achilles values above himself and his honour  Patroclus dies fighting Hector and Apollo  and there goes Achilles  awful rage against Agamemnon  Hector is now the target  Agamemnon suddenly forgiven  and the duel promised since the beginning of the book is staged under the battlements of Troy  Hector breaker of Horses  Prince of Troy  versus brilliant Achilles  grief ridden friend I love that Achilles  redemption arc is not driven by the death of Hector  He doesn t feel guilty for killing Hector  war is war  He savages his corpse  which the gods protect  Achilles does not kill Hector for glory  as he so many times wishes he had  he does it because Hector took away his friend  the reflection of his own humanity  And yet it is not in murder  in avenging his friend  that Achilles finds his peace with his imminent doom  It is in empathy  the most basic of human emotions  the one that the gods could not have given to men for the simple fact that they have none It is in seeing Priam  King of Troy  a supplicant before his knees  begging for his son s corpse  that he sees himself as he cried over Patroclus It is in Priam he sees Peleus  his father  when the news reach him of his son s death  It is in this old  kind man that he sees so many others who  like him  loved and lost someone It is in the empathy he feels  and in his generosity towards Priam  that he truly embraces his fate and realises there are more important things than dying in glory  more important things than being the greatest of the Achaeans  and living forever  if only in name  The true strength of man is not in their arms but in their unwillingness to become monsters in the face of the atrocities the world throws at them  Their true strength is in embracing their humanity  As Apollo puts it  The Fates have given mortals hearts that can endure So ends The Iliad  with Hector s funeral in Troy  both sides knowing that after the hero s celebrations they ll both return to the fighting   Achilles waiting patiently for the death he knows will soon follow Hector s  Paris  arrow that Apollo will guide to his heel This Achilles is not the one in Book I  Book XXIV Achilles will not be remembered as the whiny brat that had his brethren killed  he will be remembered as a hero  a man who found immortality in glory  Because in embracing his humanity  he has finally become worthy of being truly immortal  living forever in Homer s great words  Estuve mentalmente metida en la guerra entre aqueos y troyanos de agosto a diciembre  Al menos  no duro tanto como la verdadera  diez anos en total    Iliada  es un poema epico extenso y arduo  repleto de descripciones de armas y combates  pero que compensa cada queja con unos pasajes sublimes y una naturalizacion de personajes que sorprende Breve reposicion de argumento   Iliada  se concentra en la interminable ira de Aquiles  el mejor guerrero de los aqueos  a causa del robo de su botin  que incluia a Briseida  Por supuesto  en la batalla se va a sentir su falta  a pesar de que entre los griegos hay otros buenos guerreros  Mientras tanto  los dioses luchan en el Olimpo porque algunos protegen a los aqueos  Hera  Atenea  Poseidon  y otros a los troyanos  Apolo  Ares  Afrodita   Zeus inclina la balanza de la victoria porque tiene un plan que  obviamente  no voy a revelar  Podria decir que los veinticuatro cantos son tematicos y los mortales y los inmortales se reparten el protagonismo Por su composicion oral  hay versos que se repiten muchas veces porque funcionan a modo de  repaso   asi que no tengo ningun motivo para quitar estrellas por eso  Tambien se advierten incoherencias  pequenas  pero incoherencias al fin  entre una accion A y una accion B  algo que seria imperdonable en un texto escrito  Sin embargo  las fallas no lo hacen menos perfecto  A mi me encanto igual  Hay historias muy ricas que se cuentan en mitad de una pelea  los oponentes hablaban mucho entre si antes de matarse      recuperaciones de mitos conocidos y no tanto  heroismo  crueldad  desesperanza  Lo unico que obstaculiza un poco la lectura del libro son las descripciones de las armas  las naves  los ejercitos y algunos combates cuerpo a cuerpo que aportan material para situarse espacialmente  por ejemplo  Y es muy bueno detenerse en ellas porque senalan aspectos culturales  historicos y sociales  El problema es que causan sensacion de  stand by   como si no fueran a terminar nunca  Afortunadamente  lo hacen  Una vez que se reinicia la accion  hay poco para molestarse y mucho para marcar  Los cantos del final son geniales  fueron una especie de premio a mi paciencia de lectora  A partir del XIX aparecen  y reaparecen  elementos que vuelven todo mas dinamico  Los personajes no estan desarrollados psicologicamente  No hay una evolucion paulatina de ellos  sino que actuan de forma radical  Aquiles  que rumia su colera lejos del combate  puede ser tan barbaro como piadoso  asi como tambien Zeus parece tan omnipotente como amigable  Tal vez los matices no abunden  pero se me hizo imposible no ponerme del lado de alguno de los personajes para esperar que su destino  desde temprano  ellos mismos se van a encargar de avisar como y cuando van a morir  no se cumpla  Por alguna razon  uno ya siente que los conoce y se vuelven naturales  de carne y hueso  Y aprendi que Zeus es implacable hasta cuando Hera lo distrae  Comentario femenino que no quiero omitir y que puede llegar a servir  en esa epoca las mujeres no eran mas que objetos que en el  mejor  de los casos se utilizaban como premios y aseguraban descendencia y  en el peor  eran molestas  necesitaban un par de gritos e impulsaban rinas pateticas  Ese momento ya no se puede cambiar  pero si se puede tener en cuenta antes de decidir revolear el libro por la ventana  Y ademas esta Atenea como equilibrio  cuyas intervenciones son fascinantes y muy importantes  Las inmortales llevan una ligera ventaja en todo este asunto  Iliada  requiere tiempo y atencion  dos cosas necesarias para no abandonarla y que actualmente los libros se olvidan de pedirle al lector  Se aprende mucho mas en sus paginas que en la busqueda disgregada de algunos mitos y las repeticiones de Homero permiten descansar en algunos puntos para concentrarse en otros  La Historia  la filosofia  la forma de ver el mundo que poseian los griegos es material para un relectura  si es que no lo piden en la universidad  como es mi caso   pero la primera puede hacerse tranquilamente  Lo realmente  malo  de este libro es que lleva a leer mas textos antiguos para completar el panorama y mi lista de  to read  lo esta sufriendo  Y ya estoy en proceso de recuperacion para seguir con la  Odisea   When I first read The Iliad  I was way too young to fully appreciate it  I understood  of course  the backstory   a spiteful goddess is left off a wedding invitation list  she retaliates by giving the Trojan prince Paris a golden apple to reward to the best looking goddess  because that can t go wrong   he picks Aphrodite because she promises him the incomparably beautiful  and already married  Helen  angering the other goddesses in the process  Paris selfishly steals Helen  and a lot of treasure  from her husband Menelaus  proud blowhard Agamemnon makes the Greeks attack Troy  they spend ten long years in a siege  and then      The Iliad begins  Some of the more memorable moments from the Trojan War  like Odysseus s Trojan horse and Achilles  death by an arrow to his famous heel  aren t even in the book  What we do get is mostly Achilles in a snit over being insulted  how many ships everyone brought  and endless lists of who got killed  And a lot of sacrificing and roasting meat  It seemed to me like the more interesting parts of the story came before and after The Iliad  not during it  I think  though  that if I had read this translation instead of the tedious one I read as a child  I might have felt differently  Here Robert Graves chooses to render most of the work in prose  reserving verse for certain  dramatic and lyrical occasions  which seem to call for it  The poetry is  poetic  in English  with rhyme and meter  giving a sense of what the original might have felt like to the listeners in ancient Greece as they heard the dactylic hexameter  The overall result is a readable  entertaining narrative that is still faithful to the original  One thing that struck me about the story is how violent it is  to the point of absurdity  with every imaginable death by spear described with gruesome relish  and a large helping of irony   There are eyeballs popping out  heads rolled like bowling balls  and characters still able to make impressive speeches while holding on to parts of their livers  I got the feeling that Homer  whoever he was  if indeed he was one person at all  was having fun grossing out his listeners  There is comic relief also  such as in the character of the elderly Nestor  who recalls his glory days repeatedly and at length  describing his heroic feats with a certain amount of what we might generously call  embellishment   The gods and goddesses are  of course  characters themselves  integral to the story  with their own rivalries and histories coming into play  They toy with the lives of the hapless mortals  or is it that  Apollo bumped my elbow  was a good excuse for a misfired spear    but even Zeus himself can t control Fate While I imagine this translation may offend some purists  it brings the story back to what it was originally   entertainment  I would recommend this version for anyone who has ever slogged through The Iliad thinking it wasn t much fun  It is worth revisiting this dusty classic  Even after almost 3 000 years  it is still a good story  I read the Odyssey at Uni and really loved it  A romp off to parts unknown with a man who is good company from a distance  As with much of fiction  the people I am delighted to spend lots of time with on the page are not necessarily those I would want to spend anytime with otherwise I ve always meant to get around to reading this  I mean  this Homer guy only wrote two books and I had enjoyed the other one  so     so  a mere twenty years later  how time flies  I got around to reading this one The problem was that I knew exactly what this one was about  You know  this is about Helen getting taken to Troy after Paris wins her after he judges which of the goddesses is the most beautiful which pisses off the Greeks and then there s the siege and sacking of Troy after that rather clever trick with the wooden horse  Not much point reading this one if you already know the whole damn story Now  you might be thinking   this guy should have put a spoiler alert at the start of this  You might also be thinking   this guy probably thinks it s okay not to put a spoiler alert on this because everyone already knows this story  Umm  I haven t put a spoiler alert on this because I haven t told you anything that is actually in this story yet  Look  I know  I m as surprised as you are   Bugger me with a brick   as a friend of mine would say  The idea Homer could be allowed to get away with writing a book about something everyone knows it is about and not actually writing about any of these things is  to say the least  rather frustrating  I m sure that in some countries there is probably even a law against this sort of thing It might just be me  but I would have thought that if you are going to write the FIRST epic in the Western Literary Tradition it does seem somewhat presumptuous to assume people know the back story  I know I can be naive at times  but if first is to mean anything  surely it doesn t really allow the writer to assume everyone already knows the back story  Instead  this book starts a mere 9 years after the war had began  There is precious little by way of explaining how we got here  And it ends the day before the final battle for Troy and before anyone seems to have come up with the idea of a wooden horse with a hollow middle  Spoilers start more or less now   if you are worried A lot of this is boys  own adventure stuff  Also a bit like the Godfather films in which they seem to have decided not to kill any two major characters in exactly the same way  Bronze swords knocking out teeth before plunging through skull with attendant buckets of blood and spraying brain matter plays  be well assured  a large part in this book  If I have any criticism at all it is that the war bits were over long and after a while became all a bit same same  In fact  by close to the end I was thinking I had had more than enough and was looking forward to the whole thing being over And then that totally unexpected end  Jesus  what a way to finish a book  I was blown away  Achilles does not really come out of this book looking too good  I know he is meant to be a bit of a hero  the only things I knew about him before this being he had been dipped in a river as a child to protect him from harm and held by the ankles  so therefore these were his only venerable parts   and of course  none of this is actually mentioned here  though I suspect you are meant to already know   The whole book revolves around Achilles being annoyed at having his girlfriend taken from him and him spending most of the time in a petulant rage about to go home  stuck in one of his ships while all hell is breaking lose around him  Hector certainly seems the  better man  in all this   even though he is a Trojan  This was something else I hadn t expected The thing I really like about the Greek Gods   and the reason Plato said that the poets shouldn t be allowed to write stories about them   is that they are just this huge dysfunctional family  Nothing they like better than getting involved in human affairs and causing infinitely more trouble than they are worth  I also like that even when they know the outcome of something   Troy will fall  for example   that doesn t stop them remaining loyal and supporting their favourite side all the same  It is as if the West Moorabbin Under Twelves are being put up against Manchester United all stars team and the dads of the under twelves are turning up to support their kids  Everyone knows the outcome  but all the same     Go Johnny  A lot of this is of more than just passing interest in the sense that it gives a fascinating  and tragically realistic  account of the horrors of warfare in the ancient world   and these horrors are many and graphic  Both sides foresee what is to happen to the women of Troy once the battle is over  for example  and this is none too pretty  All the same  after book after book of this I was well over these endless descriptions  But then book 24  Hector has been killed  Achilles killed him to revenge the death of his friend Patroclus  who Hector had killed and tried to quarter and feed to the dogs  Achilles is overpowered by grief for his friend and as a mark of respect slaughters 12 boys of Troy as an offering at the funeral of Patroclus  hard to express my disgust at this   not the act of a  hero    He also spends days dragging Hector s body about  ironically enough  attached to his chariot by the ankles  around the funeral site of his friend in some sort of bizarre ritual that is neither improved in report nor in deed  I think the line ran   I had never really thought about the significance of bodies after they have died in war   but psychologically  knowing  or worse  as in this case  not knowing  but assuming  what the enemy are doing to the dead body of your child  is  without question  unspeakably horrible To regain his son s body and to give it a proper funeral  Priam goes to Achilles and is helped there by the gods  He kisses the hand of his son s murderer and begs for his body so as to be able to give him a proper funeral  Like I said  a remarkably moving end to the poem  I used to think that a good definition of a classic would be  a book that is rarely about what you think it is about before you read it   As always  I was much too timid in my definition  It seems that a classic is NEVER about what you think it will be about before you read it  If they are particularly good classics  they are also not about what you think they were about while you were reading them either  This is an excellent case in point  How could one so humble as I and so disfavored by the gods as to have the poetic ability of a blind cosmetics testing monkey rate a work so great as The Iliad  a poetic masterpiece that has astounded and inspired for over 3 000 years  anything less than five stars  The answer to that question  which you seek with the zealous lust of tigress in heat  is  of course  that I could not  I dare not  lest I risk the wrath of Olympus  As a cow stands lowing over her first calf  so will I jealously guard and defend my five star rating against all enemies  foreign and domestic As the wave breaks upon the shore  flowing across the sand and spraying up the cliffside  so has the story set forth in The Iliad flowed across my soul and sent spray up my nose  As the wind whispers through the bows of the willow tree  causing every leaf to sway and wriggle  so have the words of The Iliad whispered through my mind  causing every neuron to fire in delight and every synapse to glow with joy Now are you glimpsing the inner workings of my mind whilst reading The Iliad  Just as the Manchurian Candidate was brainwashed and obliged to think thoughts not his own  so did the prose and rhythm of The Iliad insinuate itself in my mind to affect my thinking thusly  Ere long I found myself thinking in such prose in all my endeavors  and against my own will Unfortunately  Apollo did not endow me with sufficient courage to take on a translation that attempts to maintain Homer s poetic cadence  Rather  being a literary coward  I read Mr  Samuel Butler s translation into prose  And a wonderful blessing was the prose for a mere literary mortal like myself  for just as A Confederacy of Dunces was by many orders of magnitude more readable than The Road  so was Samuel Butler s prose more readable than Homer s poetry  Still  the trustworthy prose of Samuel Butler  son of his father and grandson of his grandfather  was not a facile thing to comprehend  In the manner that a mule is the bastard offspring of a horse and a donkey  Butler s prose reads like a combination of the Bible and Shakespeare Still  all strength and weaknesses of Mr  Samuel Butler s prose laid to the side  the fact remains  with Jove as my witness  that like a worm through the soft topsoil of the earth so did Butler s prose become a way of thinking in my mind  Even today did I find myself sitting at my computer at work  preparing to write a letter to an obstinate tax representative  and desirous of writing something like   as a lion devours its bloodied prey in full view of the more fleet footed antelope  thus will I passionately devour your inferior legal arguments in full view of the appeals board and your peers   However  as such a letter would be sure to arouse the anger of the heroes residing within the ranks of management at work  I did offer hecatombs and prayed for a calmness of spirit so that I could write to said obstinate tax representative   after due consideration of all evidence and arguments on file  I conclude that the transaction in question lacked economic substance and had no valid  nontax business purpose and  moreover  I am prepared to defend my department s position on appeal  Later to my home did I arrive  after encountering traffic like too many chariots crowding through a small gate  and see that my children  the lovely fruit of my loins  have not cleaned their rooms  Thereupon did I lose my aforesaid calmness of spirit and said unto my children   as your mother s wrath burns me like kindling when I fail to mow the lawn  so shall my anger consume you in flame when you fail to clean your rooms   Upon hearing me speak thusly  the children burst into tears  running to mommy and crying   Oh Great and Beautiful Mother  Oh Goddess whose womb gave us the gift of life  Your husband  evil ere he be and ever unkind to us  the lovely fruit of your union  hast threatened us with the flame of his unrighteous anger  We beseech the  Oh Mother  to smite that man with whom you have lain  and thereby favor your kind children over that terrible beast   My wife then smote me with arrows tipped in bronze and lit ablaze  and ere long I was the one crying on my pillow of soft feathers  while my children did gorge themselves with ice cream and laugh at the simplicity with which their scheming did produce my misfortune THE END  Sprung out of bitterness  the philosophy of the Iliad excludes resentment   Thus Rachel Bespaloff  stating the seemingly impossible  Years ago I read the Iliad in Fitzgerald s fine translation  but every page had the heavy cadence of a  classic   Now I m reading Fagles  and Lombardo s translations back to back  and am surprised how much I m enjoying the poem  I don t dispute those who judge Fagles the superior translator  but for me the Lombardo version is far more stirring Consider the opening lines  Fagles translates Rage  Goddess  sing the rage of Peleus  son Achilles murderous  doomed  that cost the Achaeans countless losses hurling down to the House of Death so many sturdy souls great fighters  souls  but made their bodies carrion feasts for the dogs and birds and the will of Zeus was moving toward its end Lombardo captures the rage and waste in way Fagles does not Rage Sing  Goddess  Achilles  rage Black and murderous  that cost the GreeksIncalculable pain  pitched countless soulsOf heroes into Hades  dark And left their bodies to rot as feastsFor dogs and birds  as Zeus  will was done This is bitterness on the edge of blasphemy  It sounds like the war we re reading about every morning  where soldiers  bodies are blown to shreds and the bloody will of God is invoked by each side  Lombardo also brings an unexpected poetry to the brutality of the poem  reminding me of the best of Logue s ongoing masterpiece  For example  in Book 6  Hector returns to Troy for a rushed moment and is met by the wives of men dying on the plain He told them all Each woman in turn  to pray to the gods Sorrow clung to their heads like mist Again  more bitterness    the gods regard the heroes as little more than chess pieces to be sacrificed in the course of their game  The final line evokes not only grief but the blind futility of faith   Fagles translates the line  inertly  as  Hard sorrows were hanging over many   Whether this is your first go at the Iliad or if you re ready to re read it  I recommend Lombardo s performance version  with its  heroes more godlike than the gods  and more human than men    Bespaloff again    from her essay  On the Iliad   NYRB recently republished it  along with Simone Weil s magnificent  The Iliad  or the Poem of Force  under the title  War and the Iliad   a slim volume which page for page beats any commentary on the Iliad I ve ever read   It must be said that Fagles  translation is truly a thing of beauty  measured in full to the epic course of this poem that begat all poems within the Western canon  expressively and aptly capturing the jarring  bone splintering  sanguinary shock of men slaughtering men with bronzemongery at close quarters  the descent of the dark  whilst afire with passions personal and or divinely stoked  the morphic wiles and chameleon chromatism of the Olympian gods and goddesses  the latter of which strike me as ancient instantiations of Razor Grrls running heady on poked ichor and martini glassed ambrosia whilst strewing thorns for He who Shields in Thunder  whose parlous moods and internecine favors fuel the engine of battle  and span the motive range from petty to noble  in furious operation full upon the Trojan shore  the emotive declamations from heroes and hell hounds  deities and desdemonas  champions and charges  which allow the entity entities known as Homer the display in full of his their winged mastery over the broad range of our human essence  draped and burnished in the starburst hues of the Achaean apogee  in that period of ochred transition from bronze unto iron  and of the complexity of our intra  and interpersonal relationships  whether platonic or  illicitly  ardent in quiddity  and their warp and weft at play upon the loom of our existence when such potentially exothermic vestments are heightened to the utmost by the exigencies of vengeance  and rage addled war  Many are broken upon Homer s lyrical wheel  that the poet might better evoke the futility and fatality of such embittered conflict  no matter the stunning degree of personal overcoming and arising its brutal test summons forth  with a particularly fulgent light cast upon the cruel connivance of fate with coincidence  intervention with inspiration  fortitude with fortuitous ignition  when the red runs freely  the play of the children of Cronos  the target of wronged and wounded pride  and at how  in the end  tragic loss overshadows even the most aromatic of victories  what with redolence being an inherently ephemeral thing when set against the sustaining pathos of grief and regret  Lynne wrote   I loved this book Darwin  Me too  The more Iliads the better  A sea of Iliads  A squall of Iliads  Short of being able to read Homer in his Greek  all I can do is read him from multiple translations and multiple eras and try and triangulate where the unread text  for me exists   I first met Greek gods in  Hercules  the animated cartoon series  which I loved watching as a kid  Then there was Wikipedia and then Ovid s Metamorphosis  My point being I really had high expectations when I started reading Iliad  I expected it to be a more complete account   beginning with  Apple of Discord   may be even before  then Paris  judgment that Venus was fairest of three goddesses  then oath taken at Helen s father s place and then Helen s seduction or rape  whichever version you prefer  and only then war  I was also expecting it to end with the whole Trozen horse story  What it actually turned out to be was a few macho guys fighting over some Greek blonde There are a lot of characters just there to die or kill and the fact that characters are often refered as son of this  son of that leads to confusion  Moreover  Achilles is such a cry baby    Mamma  Agamemnon stole my girl    Mamma  Agamemnon insulted me    Mamma  I won t fight    Mamma   Hector killed my friend    Mamma  I ll fight    Mamma  I drown   and so   Gods and poetry What made it work for me was the poetry in it  By making the divine interference the rule of the day  Homer Simpson makes a very clever use of gods  using their names to stand for forces they own   God of war constantly changing sides  sea calamities being wrath of Neptune  heavy rains or storms being wrath of Zeus  warriors felling prey to Apollo s arrows and so on My favorite is the conversation between Venus and Helen  Helen reproaches Venus for deceiving her by coming to her as a servant  Then is it still thy pleasure to deceive And woman s frailty always to believe   Look at the other meaning in the reproach  She is remarking on the way beauty would decieive a woman in belieiving she is there to stay  Venus reply is equally poetical  Should Venus leave thee  every charm must fly Fade from thy cheek  and languish in thy eye Cease to provoke me  lest I make thee moreThe world s aversion  than their love before Now the bright prize for which mankind engage Than  the sad victim  of the public rage    Also he is incredible in his portrayal of gods  Forget the little cat fight between goddesses  just look at how he gave Zeus that godfather like coolness of a powerful figure by talking about power of a simple nod from him  He spoke  and awful bends his sable brows  Shakes his ambrosial curls  and gives the nod  The stamp of fate and sanction of the god  High heaven with trembling the dread signal took  And all Olympus to the centre shook     Hero worship  not so much     And for the king s offence the people died     It is kind of difficult to know what Homer really thinks of war  While he is constantly talking about achievements of warriors and who killed whoms  which got boring for a while when Zeus made that no divine interference law   he seems at same time showing the stupidity of whole thing  May be  he didn t do so more directly as it might have meant reproaching ways of his own society    For I must speak what wisdom would conceal And truths  invidious to the great  reveal Bold is the task  when subjects  grown too wise Instruct a monarch where his error lies For though we deem the short lived fury past  Tis sure the mighty will revenge at last   A pacifist might not have been favorite of people even in Homer s own time  So he probably had to mask his arguments None of the heroes are without defects while heroes of opposite side   especially Hector are presented in as good light as his own if not better  which is not the kind of treatment expected from a hero worshiping bard  We have talked about Achilles  who looks like a spoiled child of god rather than anything else  both Hector and Ulysses are shown to be fleeing from battle grounds at least once  Achillies   choices to quit and return to the war are both taken under anger rather than thoughtfully  He even forgot the oath he had given to Helen s father when he decided to quit Also  Homer would remind you that physicial strength is not the only virtue that a man possess  Virtues like physical strength  ancestory etc  which bring honor to individual  are repeatedly shown to be matters of fate rather than merit When Achilles quit the war for a while  he made quite a few good arguments as why one shouldn t fight  reminds you of Arjuna at beginning of Bhagwad Gita   In fact  his choice from among destinies offered to him   a long prosperous life or glorious death of a hero  forms the key theme of book  I personally don t think he chose smartly  Also it is ended when characters are mourning for Hector  Her wife s laments are the most moving words throughout the epic    The day  that to the shades the father sends  Robs the sad orphan of his father s friends  He  wretched outcast of mankind  appears For ever sad  forever bathed in tears  Amongst the happy  unregarded  he Hangs on the robe  or trembles at the knee   While those his father s former bounty fed Nor reach the goblet  nor divide the bread  The kindest but his present wants allay  To leave him wretched the succeeding day  Frugal compassion  Heedless  they who boast Both parents still  nor feel what he has lost    May the lucky one win  Anyway one point that Homer makes clear beyond any doubt is that victory has nothing to do with such silly things like bravery  courage etc  It is all about fate and  divine  connections  The ultimate fight between Hector and Achilles  who could have already been dead   a couple of times  was it not for gods  is a mere formality  gods won t let anything to happen to Achilles  it could only end in one way   Tis man s to fight  but heaven s to give success Hector is in fact the one who comes as true hero   presented in best light  choosing to fight even when he knows that he stands no chance  despite making a number of other blunders   The third mourner over his dead body was Helen  whom his brother had kidnapped  He had reproached Paris for his stupidity in kidnapping Helen and for cowardice he showed in duel against Menelaus  but never reproached Helen for their miseries   which is very opposite to what other Trozens  except the king and Paris  did  His reputation is purely based on merit and it is so good that even gods who were teamed in killing him wouldn t let his dead body be insulted    Prayers are Jove s daughters  of celestial race Lame are their feet  and wrinkled is their face With humble mien  and with dejected eyes Constant they follow  where injustice flies Injustice swift  erect  and unconfined Sweeps the wide earth  and tramples o er mankind While Prayers  to heal her wrongs  move slow behind Who hears these daughters of almighty Jove For him they mediate to the throne aboveWhen man rejects the humble suit they make The sire revenges for the daughters  sake From Jove commission d  fierce injustice thenDescends to punish unrelenting men       Rage   Goddess  sing the rage of Peleus  son Achilles murderous  doomed  that cost the Achaeans countless losses hurling down to the House of Death so many sturdy souls    Before I start gushing praise all over this book  I can think of three things that might discourage readers from tackling The Iliad 1  It is a very long  nearly 15 700 line  poem  If you really don t have a taste for poetry at all  then this may not be the book for you 2  It is fairly violent  Lots and lots of people get speared  go down groaning into the dust  and have the darkness come swirling down across their eyes  If you don t like violence in your books  you might have trouble getting into this one 3  The goddamn Catalogue of Ships  The second half of Book II is no picnic  and I suspect that many readers have been repelled while trying to get through this like so many Grecians bouncing off the walls of Troy  I wish I could put a little  it gets better  message in your book to help you through this  Just power through Because it does get better  I have read my fair share of ancient Greek   Roman writings  and for my money The Iliad is the single greatest work of literature to come out of antiquity  Apologies to the Athenian dramatists  Aristophanes  Thucydides  Virgil  Ovid and all the rest  but everybody takes a back seat to the blind bard  And while The Odyssey is outstanding in its own right  The Iliad with its tragic overtones and truly epic feel takes top honors in my heart  The Iliad is the story of the Trojan War  But part of the poem s genius is the decision not to try and tell the whole saga of the war  Instead  the poem is set during the tenth and final year of the conflict  and only covers a few weeks  The poem centers around the character of Achilles  literature s first antihero  Achilles is the finest warrior in the Greek army  but he can also be a prideful  sullen lout  when he s not being a bloodthirsty brute   He butts heads with the leader of the Greek forces  King Agamemnon  This all plays out in classic fashion   view spoiler  Achilles refuses to fight  allowing the Trojans to briefly turn the tide and results in the death of Achilles friend lover Patroclus  The death of Patroclus proves to be the push Achilles needs to rejoin the war  and he fights like Ares incarnate to avenge the death of his companion  turning the tide once again   hide spoiler  The plot is justifiably famous  and the character of Achilles is key to the timelessness of the tale  While on one hand The Iliad tells a very big story  with a huge cast of characters  on the other hand it s really the story of one man  as Homer makes clear with the first line of the epic   Homer s Achilles is a hall of fame literary character  complex and arresting  He is capable of both childish insolence and horrible brutality   view spoiler  his refusal to fight  even at the expense of Greek lives  and his treatment of Hector s body immediately after their fatal battle   hide spoiler   But he also displays real heroism and towards the poem s close commits an act of unexpected grace   view spoiler  the return of Hector s body to the grieving King Priam   hide spoiler   In many ways  Achilles is much more sympathetic than his rival Agamemnon  While Agamemnon tends to command from the rear  Achilles fights like a man possessed even though he knows he is not destined to leave Troy alive  Achilles was not forced to go to war  unlike the reluctant Odysseus   but chose to go of his own volition  When confronted with the choice between a long life of quiet obscurity or a short one filled with glory  Achilles seized the latter  The counterpoint to Achilles is the Trojan champion  Hector  Unlike Achilles  who starves for battle and glory  Hector is a reluctant warrior  He fights because he must  because the Greeks are at his gates and because he has to support his brother Paris  even though Paris was in the wrong  Unlike Achilles  Hector has a wife and child  and the reader gets the sense that Hector would be perfectly happy leading the quiet  peaceful existence that Achilles so scorns  One of the most beautiful parts of the epic is a meeting between Hector  decked out for battle  and his infant son  In the same breath  shining Hector reached downfor his son   but the boy recoiled  cringing against his nurse s full breast screaming out at the sight of his own father terrified by the flashing bronze  the horsehair crest the great ridge of the helmet nodding  bristling terror   so it struck his eyes  And his loving father laughed  his mother laughed as well  and glorious Hector quickly lifting the helmet from his head set it down on the ground  fiery in the sunlight and raising his son he kissed him  tossed him in his arms lifting a prayer to Zeus and the other deathless gods  When Hector and Achilles finally meet in the penultimate book of the epic  Homer is more than up to the task I haven t even gotten into how powerful the language in this poem is  but this review is running long  Suffice to say that it is extremely memorable and readers who have any interest in poetry at all are in for a treat  The poem features a lot of repetition  but it s used in interesting ways and actually works in the poem s favor  by making it feel something like a long  epic song   No other classical poet was able to work the immortals into his writing as deftly as Homer  and the writing is a joy to read Some readers will be surprised by the poem s end  The Iliad does not extend to the famous scene of the Trojan Horse and the fall of Troy  Instead it ends with a funeral  and we are more or less where we started  minus some of the poem s principals  But I think the finale is fitting and part of the genius of the work  The Iliad is a war story  but ultimately it doesn t glorify war at all  The poem closes with the funeral of a good man as his family mourns  After ten years of carnage  no ground has been won despite incredible suffering  And for readers who are familiar with the Trojan Saga outside of the scope of The Iliad  the outlook is even more bleak  Achilles is doomed to die  Agamemnon s glory is to be short lived  as he will soon be brutally murdered  Priam will suffer an ignominious death  as will Ajax  Even Hector s son is destined to die violently  Despite all of the lofty language and appeals to honor  readers of Homer are left with one overwhelming conclusion  war is hell  6 stars  highest possible recommendation Note on the Translation  Much scholarly ink has been spilt arguing over which translation of The Iliad is the  best   I read the Fagles translation  which I thought was great  Some purists prefer the Lattimore version  which is apparently more literal than Fagles  interpretation  I have read much of the Lattimore translation as well  and I thought it was very strong  although Fagles  translation is probably more fun to read for pure pleasure   Ultimately I would recommend the Fagles version but you really can t go wrong whether you choose Fagles  Lattimore  or Lombardo  the story is so compelling that whichever translation you choose  you re in for a treat  The Iliad  a daunting work of fiction so genius that it has survived for thousands of years  To this day there is no modern epic which stands anywhere near it except perhaps Les Miserables or Paradise Lost  Perhaps those who are informed could add The Divine Comedy to this list  however I have not read Dante s work as of yet  Before I continue I d like to point out that the translation I read was Robert Fitzgerald s translation  Which seemed solid if nothing particularly special  I do think that the fact that I hardly noticed that it had been translated from another language  particularly Homeric Greek  is something in this version s favour  However I m currently trying a different translation for the Odyssey with Fagles  So what is the hyped up Iliad all about  We ve had the story built into our Western Literature in various forms  There have been countless versions of the mythology surrounding the battle that destroyed Troy  But what is the real Iliad story about  The Iliad as it stands is an epic poem  among the first fantasy stories  which describes a brief moment in the Trojan War which decided the fate of that period  During this time Achilles  the greatest demigod warrior of them all  and Hector  a mortal man greater than any other  fight in a series of battles   view spoiler  All of which leads to one final stand for Hector himself   hide spoiler   But the Iliad is more than just lots of warfare strung together  albeit beautifully and poetically  It is a story about the fall of men  a story about the interference of the gods  It is a colossal tragedy  a mythology based in history and one which tells us much about the duel heroic and villainous nature of human hearts Read The Iliad for its tragedy  its beauty  its elegance  Read it to be a pretentious academic who understands literary references to it  Read it because you love mythology  Read it because you care about humanity  Read it because you love poetry and incredible writing  Read it for its timeless nature  I merely encourage that you take the time to read this  book  at least once in your entire life  However if  like myself  you cannot read Homeric Greek I also encourage you to look at the various available translations and decide which sounds like it would suit your personal taste Also as a sort of balance I must add that as for the flaws of this work you may note  regardless of translation  the repetition of ideas and names  This is a common element of Homer s work apparently and one which can bother some people  Others may be bothered by the amount of carnage  the difficult rhythm of the poetry or the sheer size of such a poem  However I find that the repetition has a nice symmetry throughout the story and there is so much value within this work  It s easy to see why copies of this poem were saved through time  I ve always loved this one as a story way more than The Odyssey  although as a character Odysseus beats every other Greek ever in the history of EVER hands down   P  Priam  the King of Troy kidnaps Helen  the girl belonging to the Achaeans  Herein lies the motivation and conflict of the entire piece  The Achaeans come to get her back  They cross over on boats  The Trojans and Achaeans fight a bloody and graphic battle  The Trojans overcome through the Hero  Hector  a mighty warrior who leads the Trojans to the ships and past the man made wall the Achaeans made without the blessing of the gods  Achilles of the Achaeans  the son of a goddess  refuses to help King Agamemnon push back the Trojans and all seems lost  Achilles refuses to forgive the King for taking his plunder and prize woman in a previous conflict  The Trojans come close to the shores and ships  past the walls  entrapping the enemy in  and themselves  King Agamemnon sends many to beg Achilles to no avail  When all seems lost  in the very last moments  Achilles sends his closest comrade  Patroclus  in his own armor to deceive and drive back the Trojans  It works  for a while  until Patroclus is slain  and Achilles armor stolen by the Trojans  By his mother s request  Vulcan makes new armor for Achilles while he grieves  The climax comes when Achilles  driven by vengeance for Patroclus and broken by his loss  rises up to fight the Trojans  He fights in a terror of power and brings the battle to a glorious climax   I found the entertaining value of the story surprising  considering Homer wrote it over 2500 years ago  but then I guess something has to be good to stay around and be popular for that long  The story fills the mind with graphic movie like scenes of warfare and battle  blood and guts and broken bones  The Heroes emerge as sports stars would today  We say Walter Payton or Larry Bird  Michael Jordan or Caitlyn Jenner  and feel a sense of awe  The Greeks felt this way about their war heroes  The gods are also heavily involved in the story  They struggle with humanistic desires and also war against each other  which impacts the events of the battle  Incarnate deceivers come to the warriors  gods in form of a brother or friend  to aid the enemy and lead warriors astray  This happens to Hector  when a god comes to him as a brother and gives him horrid advice   he should fight Achilles  Hector rallies the Trojans  Achilles leads the Achaeans  Achilles fights well  nearly invincible  and invokes more terror in my heart than awe  I imagined a tall man in shining armor  sweeping away enemies all around him  I thought of that scene in The Lord of the Rings when Sauron fights in bodily form in a flashback  the moment before Elendil cuts his finger off  He stands tall and crashes multitudes of enemies in waves with his mace  I saw Achilles this way  but as a brighter and thinner being  The story shows wives and children and families crying over dead and dying loved ones  It grips the heart with tragic drama  as well as stirs the soul that would sacrifice self for a country one loves  I loved this story  found it thoroughly entertaining  I ve added Homer to my list of favorites  I need to find out where to place him in my collection  He s up there  I now have a respect for Greece  and their spiritual heritage  As a Christian  I can t help wonder if the God of the Jews saw the Greeks and their zeal and honor and love for the gods  I wonder if He adored them for their faith  and respected and honored them  Did the Christ come to a land heavily influenced by a Greek culture for a reason  Did the God of Jews and Christians say   Those Greeks  I like them  I m going to try to win them first  after the Jews  They have some great faith   The Christian New Testament writers wrote it in Greek  and Christianity first spread to Greece  Many of the New Testament books take names after ancient Greek city folk  Ephesians  Corinthians  Philippians   I m glad I read this book  I didn t expect it to be so good  I read it on a free app in my free time  and this turned into a full read of devoted attention  I highly recommend this if the reader of this review has not read through it  It s so entertaining  it s not as difficult as one would expect of a 2500 year old text   Those whom the gods would destroy  first they anger  Achilles was born as the most highly skilled warrior of the ancient world and kings want him to fight their wars for them  The Greek gods ever intervene  playing favorites and citing specifics of class and birth and past affronts to determine on whose behalf to tip the scales episodically  Zeus is ever contravened by his wife  Hera  Apollo and Poseidon  Athene and Aphrodite have all chosen sides and seek to foil each other  The god of war  Ares  runs rampant and ever predatory virtually unchecked throughout the carnage  Homer makes an epic case for the futility of war in  The Iliad  where warriors from the ancient world join forces based upon a long tradition of civilized oaths of alliance based upon a code of honor  On the broad beaches of Troy there is no end to the chaos and destruction over ten years because of a violation of rules of hospitality  The handsome and charming Paris of Troy has visited the Greek home of Menelaus  son of Greek King Agamemnon  and then absconded with the former s wife  Helen  the most beautiful woman of the ancient world  Was it a kidnapping  Was it a consensual adultery  A thousand ships may have been launched for a tragically beautiful woman and former chattel who may have wittingly left her brutal husband to escape with the most captivating man of the ancient world  So Achilles  son of the great but mortal Peleus and his immortal mother who dwelled in sea caves  Thetis is called to serve in epic battle  Here is a reluctant warrior who fulfills his sworn oath of allegiance and honor to King Agamemnon  and agrees to bring his superior skills in the art of war to conquer and avenge all of Greece upon all of Troy  The young Achilles is in love with a boyhood friend  Patroclus  who ends up at the home of Achilles  father in payment of a debt incurred by his accidentally killing a childhood bully in a fistfight  The two young men bond and both ship off to Troy together to share a tent among the Myrmidons  Ants   the most fierce troop of warriors of the Greeks at Troy  King Agamemnon ruthlessly insults brave Achilles in front of the entire Greek leadership after a foray early in the war in Troy and claims one of the spoils of war won by Achilles  a beautiful Trojan captive named Briseis  who adores him  Steamed beyond belief  Achilles pouts in his tent with Patroclus for an astonishing length of the balance of the epic poem as legions of his friends and allies die in battle  Homer detains Achilles and his Myrmidons offstage for the better part of the entire war as all hell breaks loose on Trojan beach heads  All the while the anger of Achilles steeps like a toxic tea and the Greeks lose prince after prince to plague  devastating injury  death and every torment that war inevitably brings upon two civilizations  both ancient and modern  This epic injury and destruction built upon a pretense of nobility and suffered in the name of honor cloaked in self interest is an immortal theme into the jaws of which humanity cannot escape  then or now  In a very real sense the Trojan War is a variation upon a theme of the futile clashes into which modern nations advance after having learned nothing over 5000 years to avoid it  so highly skilled in technology and well capitalized in the art of war  everyone wants America to fight their battles for them and so America does  Achilles cannot manage his anger when his beloved Patroclus is killed in battle by Hector as Achilles broods in his tent  Agamemnon agrees to restore Briseis to Achilles and the latter with his army become the tipping point which pushes the advancing Trojan army back inside the walls of their Citadel under siege  And so after ten brutal years of slings and arrows and spears outrageous Fortune leaves us 400 pages later pretty much back to where we started in  The Iliad  with a standoff minus a legion of lesser skilled warrior princes  And Zeus is well entertained on his throne upon Olympus by the agony of the mortals and their resourceful tragic combat aided and abetted by contending gods playing out by proxy past petty disputes and affronts and arguments  Homer begs cynically to ask the implied but unspoken direct question  what is the purpose of war  The most highly skilled warriors and most aggressive  self interested princes kill each other off over a decade of futility  all under the pretense and oath of honor and allegiance  But which civilization is well served by the epic carnage  The losses and suffering of human life  injury  carnage  treasure and time on both sides can hardly be measured  It would be one thing if the interested parties among a few princes destroyed each other with a few proxy warriors  Remember well that Chronos  Time  has been overtaken and imprisoned by his son  Zeus  Both civilizations are brutally diminished nearly to the point of extinction over a stunning apparent breach of the hospitality code  the enforcement of a foolish allegiance among allies  and a kidnapping and or consensual infidelity  One wonders why such advanced and civilized nations would engage willingly over a decade at so great a cost and without the resources or intellect or good will to find a peaceful solution to break the interminable cycle of violence which continues so brutally until one or both sides is diminished to the point of complete and utter devastation that they become  victorious  or ruined  Unfortunately  for those who love peace the warring parties scatter the seeds of their destruction widely among vast adjacent fields  Homer leaves it for us to resolve the futility of this war to the  The Odyssey  where the rage of Achilles  fueled by the vicious and idiotic insult of King Agamemnon to whom he is bound by an honor code  and by the death of Patroclus is consummated as predicted by the Fates after the death and desecration of Troy s Hector and murderer of Patroclus by Achilles  Tune into the next epic for the sack of Troy and the wandering return home  well off course  to Ithaca of the crafty Prince Odysseus  Homer makes no judgments outright  he builds the heroic figures and enables their tragic flaws to destroy them one by one at the hands of capricious  intervening gods  Homer s epics are immortal and withstand the tests of time for good reason  I urge you to understand them all well by reading the  Iliad  which may challenge and possibly transform your views about the true nature of war and peace  The translation by Robert Graves does a great service to this immortal tale and the novel   Song of Achilles  by Madeline Miller  even more so   The Iliad  and  Odyssey  are all but required reading of every civilized human being so that we may at least learn something from the suffering of mankind from a genius work of our past  This review of The Iliad is associated with the translation by Robert Fagles  1990    Homer makes us Hearers  and Virgil leaves us Readers   So wrote Alexander Pope  in 1715  in the preface to his translation of The Iliad I have just completed reading a magnificent translation of Homer s The Iliad  and couldn t have enjoyed the experience more  I had read bits and pieces of The Iliad over the course of my life  but I had never read the entire poem from start to finish  I recently purchased the Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition of a translation by Robert Fagles that was completed in 1990  While I am not qualified to compare or judge the work of one translator versus that of another  I can say that I truly enjoyed Fagles  lyrical translation that largely maintains the hexameter verse structure  i e   six beats per line  of the original Greek texts  For a six hundred page  16 000 line poem  it was eminently readable  and a darn good story too Simply put  The Iliad is the story of the last year of the ten year long Trojan War  long thought to have been fought between the Achaean  Greek  forces and the Trojans in the 12th or 11th century BCE  The Iliad is thought to be about 2 700 years old and is  in essence  a transcript of an epic poem in dactylic hexameter verse that was originally shared via an oral or bardic tradition  As I was reading the poem  I couldn t help but stop and imagine a traveling story teller stopping in a small village  and standing in the village square next to a bonfire at night and recounting this tale to a rapt and wide eyed audience In some respects  The Iliad could have been easily titled  The Rage of Achilles   and indeed  that is the title of Book One   The poem opens with Achilles  and it essentially concludes with Achilles  In between is recounted the tales of the battles of egos among the primary characters and among most  if not all  of the gods on Mount Olympus  For example  the Achaean leader  Agamemnon  and the Pan Achaean army s greatest warrior  Achilles  clearly don t like one another  and this initially leads to significant problems for the Achaeans as they battle Hector and his Trojan battalions  Similarly  on the Trojan side  Hector doesn t think much of his younger brother  the  magnificent  Paris  a simpering dilettante  Unfortunately  for the Greeks  because of his ongoing issues with Agamemnon  Achilles sits on the beach with his 2 500 Myrmidon soldiers for much of the poem  and doesn t enter the fray until his best friend  Patroclus  is killed in combat with Hector  Once Achilles commits to the fight though he becomes the true definition of a  berserker   and is clearly the indomitable and heroic warrior  although I have to say that Diomedes and Great Ajax are pretty darned impressive fighters too I very much enjoyed how the poem wove in the politics and actions of the gods and goddesses as they continually intervened and influenced the human protagonists during the course of the tale  Some of the gods side with the Achaeans  e g   Hera  Athena  Poseidon  Thetis  etc    and others with the Trojans  e g   Ares  Apollo  Aphrodite  etc    with Zeus paternally watching over them all  The poem also makes quite the point of describing the hubris  selfishness  deceit  and the treachery behavior exhibited by both mortals and immortals alike  While the poem assigns the blame for the Trojan War on Paris  abduction of Menelaus  wife  Helen  i e    the face that launched a thousand ships    I happen to think the poem also implies that the war was fought because of prideful stubbornness on both sides  and one has to ponder if Achilles  withdrawal from the fighting is more of a reflection on his perception of Agamemnon as a military leader  and whether fighting the Trojans was  in fact  the morally or honorable right thing to do  Also  from a historical perspective  I have to wonder if the Trojan War really wasn t the result of a Pan Achaean desire to expand its hegemony for simple economic reasons  i e   to control the trade routes through the Aegean Sea and the Bosporus Straits  Anyway  it really doesn t matter  it was simply grand to read the poem and to be completely swept up in the drama and passion of it all I must caution readers that The Iliad contains some of the most savage  intense  and vivid combat imagery that I have ever encountered in literature  This ain t your typical  So and so slew So and so  nondescript poetic characterization  Oh no  this is gory  explicit  and very descriptive writing  the Greek word for this type of description is androktasia   combat death description  that tells precisely where the great bronze spearhead struck some poor fellow  and then what it did to his body  face  or internal organs  After one reads The Iliad  one realizes that hand to hand combat and butchery with spears  swords  bows and arrows  chariots  and rocks and clubs is a very personal business  messy and very  very dangerous I suppose that one s experience with reading The Iliad is influenced by the particular translation that you pick up  and there are a great number of them out there  I chose the translation by Robert Fagles  largely based upon reading reviews and my own experience reading his translation of Aeschylus  The Oresteia  Fagles  translation of The Iliad  for me was just magical and the poem seemed alive with richness in a contemporary framework that I could readily understand  As I mentioned above  his translation is quite lyrical and loosely maintains a meter of five  and six beats per line throughout  Read it aloud  it just rolls off of the tongue  and becomes simply enchanting I wanted to provide a couple of examples of the poetic flavor of The Iliad for you to experience  The first example is from Book 4   The Truce Erupts In War  and is a description of the Achaean Army advancing across the Scamander Plain to meet the Trojan Army in combat   As a heavy surf assaults some roaring coast piling breaker on breaker whipped by the West Wind and out on the open sea a crest first rears its headand then pounds down on the shore with hoarse  rumbling thunderand in come more shouldering crests  arching up and breakingagainst some rocky spit  exploding salt foam to the skies  so wave on wave they came  Achaean battalions ceaseless surging on to war    Book 4  Lines 489 496 One can almost imagine the soldiers  shoulder to shoulder  spears pointed forward  rank upon rank  advancing across the dusty plain  screaming and bellowing at the top of their lungs as they move toward their Trojan foes  What a terrifying sight it must have been The next sample I want to provide is from the last book of The Iliad  and recounts the late night meeting between Achilles and the Trojan King  Priam  I don t want to spoil the poem for any first time readers  but suffice it to say that Priam is there for a very important reason  and after nearly ten years of war  the two adversaries sit together talking in Achilles  tent late at night  It is truly a tender  touching  and most poignant scene  especially this almost pensive reflection on the human cost of the war that Achilles shares with King Priam   Come  please  sit down on this chair here   Let us put our griefs to rest in our own hearts rake them up no more  raw as we are with mourning What good s to be won from tears that chill the spirit So the immortals spun our lives that we  we wretched menlive on to bear such torments  the gods live free of sorrows There are two great jars that stand on the floor of Zeus s hallsand hold his gifts  our miseries in one  the other blessings When Zeus who loves the lightning mixes gifts for a man now he meets with misfortune  now good times in turn When Zeus dispenses gifts from the jar of sorrows only he makes a man an outcast  brutal  ravenous hungerdrives him down the face of the shining earth stalking far and wide  cursed by gods and men   Book 24  Lines 609 622 So  so sad  and somehow one suddenly realizes that Achilles has become a very  very wise young man Almost 3 000 years ago  the Human Race was given a gift  a great gift from a largely unknown itinerant poet  The Iliad  It is a treasure for all humanity  Read it  think about it  learn from it  and most of all pass it on  tell this great story to all who will listen  It is their story too      nwn  ylyd  sh r  hwmr  mtrjm  s yd nfysy  thrn  bngh trjmh w nshr khtb  1334  dr 720 S  mwDw   dstn jng trwCharacters  Ajax  Odysseus  Helen of Troy  Menelaus  Paris  Hector  Achilles

Stanley Lombardo  a classics professor from the University of Kansas  But I d always heard about the earlier Richmond Lattimore translation  It seems that whenever you read a critical work on Homer the Lattimore is quoted rather than other editions  I ve frequently come across books quoting Lattimore  and recently I became interested in a critical study of Homer called The War That Killed Achilles by Caroline Alexander  But reading reviews of it  the reviewers commented that Alexander quoted the Lattimore translation so extensively that one might as well read it instead  So I did  I ve come to realize that no matter which translation one reads The Iliad is always magnificent  But having read Lattimore at last I think I prefer it  though it may be that he s fresher in my experience while Fagles is more than 10 years on  But his translation seems to suggest more of a sense of who those distant Greek warriors really were  primitive and superstitious  steeped in immoderation  childish anger and bravado  And it reads without judgement of that primitive nature  acknowledging that who they were and what they represented was the way of that ancient Aegean world  Another reason I prefer it may be that I think it the more challenging read in that it doesn t cater to readers  needs for direction in the form of stanza breaks and more Englished Greek names  The unbroken narrative of each book supports the momentum of the language  the verbal force of which creates an atmosphere of threatening  dark clouds under which these violent men slash and thrust  Lattimore s huge  muscular blocks of verse are better suited to contain the Babel of angry voices of men and gods at odds on the plains outside Troy  Lattimore s translation allows those people to be the mysteries they are  2  The Iliad by Homer  translated by Robert Fagleswith an introduction and notes by Bernard Knoxcomposition  arguable  but let s say  750 bceformat  689 page Kindle e bookacquired  Nov 2013  when I thought I might finish the Old Testament soonishIt s remarkably difficult for me to formulate a response to this classic  Homer s Iliad  It s a foundational text  But it s very unfoundational in feeling  A valid question is  is the Iliad great or just very old  And a typical answer will be that it has the whole essence of humanity within  But does it  And  if so  does Fagles  translation provide it  It s a bit early in my thinking process to be asking these unanswerable questions  But really my question is how to approach it  I can come at it from the angle of history and the migrations of and clashing of peoples  from heroic imagery  or if you like  hot muscular long haired blond men in shining golden ish colored bronze armor and weaponry   at the style  and it s clash with the biblical style   at it s construction  which I m reading about in Adam Nicolson s Why Homer Matters   And there is the translation issues  And eventually my response  What is my response anyway  I can think separately of all these  overwhelming  different things  but I m having a lot of trouble tying it together into something coherent  It s like the different parts of my brain not only refuse to align  which is normal  but refuse to concede  Each aspect is holding its ground  and a mental stalemate conjures up  uselessly Adam Nicolson might like me to see this way  The Asian hordes rushed to the ends of the steppes an converted their nomadic culture to one that sea raiders with a home base  The combat hardened and ruthless pirates clash into the settled ancient cultures of the eastern Mediterranean  and made a living feeding off them  But the ancient cultures and their cities  with all their wealth and allies and mercenaries  with all their procured beauty  are at heart susceptible  At some point you can t buy off unreasonable and heroic passion  The bronze barbaric hordes will come even if we like to image them quite beautiful   As ravening fire rips through big stands of timber high on a mountain ridge and the blaze flares miles away  so from the marching troops the blaze of bronze armor  splendid and superhuman  flared across the earth  flashing into the air to hit the skies   Through time  as these cultures clashed  stories evolved in song  and they later began to standardize  acquired an author and authority  and become our Homeric epics  Or maybe there was a Homer  So  what is in these stories  Their origins date to one side of the Greek dark ages  the height of bronze age Mycenae culture circa 1250 bce  But their composition is dated to the other side  well into the iron age  to the dawn of the classical Greek world  around 750 bce  They preserve within what were otherwise long lost aspects of culture and warfare  including the bronze itself  as well as associations with an assortment of other largely lost stories  They create an oddly comedic mythology of quarreling gods who can charm  strengthen and lure humans  but also be hurt by them  And they create a heroic myth that is ultimately a tragedy  but also a blood and gore soaked work of entertainment  And that is one of the oddest things about the Iliad to me  that it is ultimately entertainment  And you can build it up as much as you like  but  well  doesn t that limit it  I mean is it ultimately an amusement  a distraction I ve probably lingered on long enough  and I still haven t mentioned Achilles  Hector  the woman who launched those thousand ships  or even a single god by name  There is plenty to into read in how Achilles  in slaying Hector who wears his armor  is symbolically killing himself  and at the same time suicidally walking into his prophesied doom  Really I haven t touched on the story  Achilles rage  Agamemnon s foolish bravado  Odysseus s practical cruelty  Hector s limitations  the women in Troy who are on the verge of become subhuman possessions of the barbarian conquerors  In book one Athena seizes Achilles by the hair to  to check your rage  if only you will yield   Of course  he won t really do that  The battles must be fought and civilization must fall to reality       below is what I wrote just after finishing         I gave in and gave it five stars  What else am I going to give this  I really stumbled through  trying to wrench my mind around to this ancient Greek mindset  I had a lot of trouble doing that  Harold Bloom thinks I m having a bible Homer clash and he may be right  The Old Testament is very complex and understated  enormously understated    whereas Homer is out there and dramatic with flair  and gore   I came around a bit  Near the end Hermes clandestinely introduces himself to Priam and I found this part enormously charming  Was it really  or was I just finally coming around  Don t know  Maybe I will try to read this again sometime  In the meantime  I have read  So  one classic checked off  I might write a different review later   The Iliad ranks as one of the most important and most influential works in world literature in that it established literary standards and conventions that writers have imitated over the centuries  down to the present day  The Iliad is a brutal  dynamic  psychologically complex narrative  It has a forward motion that can lead the reader on page after page  The Iliad is certainly a piece of literature that has stood the test of time   and with good reason  War has constantly been a feature of human society and the Iliad tells of all its horrors like few other pieces of literature  This dividing line between the Archaic Greece of Homer and the Classical Greece we idolize is personified by the heroes Achilles and Odysseus  Achilles  and his rage  represent the old fashioned way of doing things  while wily Odysseus represents the cosmopolitanism of later Greece   the Greece we know  remember and revere  Homer is very descriptive and graphic in his narrative  His battle descriptions are extremely detailed such as   Straight through into the skull the spearhead crunched its way demolishing the brain   12 150 152  Homer also often analogizes the action with natural settings such as   The appeal aroused Aineias  Craving battle  he charged Idomeneus     who  steadily waited  like a mountain boar who knows his power  facing a noisy hunt in a lonely place  his backbone bristles rise  both eyes are fiery  gnashing his tusks he waits in fury to drive back the dogs and men   13 440 447  In short  Homer s talents are not just his incredible detail towards describing and explaining the human condition or the carnage of war  but also his rich analogies comparing human situations to settings in nature As you advance  take your time   in your reading  the beauty of the vocabulary  the drama of the situation  and the baseness or nobility of the various characters will slowly emerge  The grandeur of the courage and humanness of the characters builds progressively  and in the end your reading of this masterpiece will leave you exhausted yet enlightened  You will never forget it  Yes I think the Iliad just lifts you above everything else and crystallises all of the human experience  Life is conflict in the final analysis and as TE Lawrence so eloquently put it   The ignorant  the superficial  the deceived were the happy among us   Happiness is a pipe dream and a myth of modern advertising  and here on the plains of Troy we see life as it is really lived  in all its struggle  heroism and pathos  Homer got in before Joyce in celebrating the everyday triumphs of the ordinary man and woman and what they have to put up with  OK  deep breath here   I haven t read  or better to say understood  Homer as much as I ought to  I ve picked up and put down The Odyssey a few times and I just hate to admit that it s not clicking for my modern mind as much as it ought to  It s not the deep brow d blind sage  it s me  Did not read it in high school  was unfortunately lacking in my ancient Greek history and mythos  getting better  hopefully  and therefore the gods  and gods upon gods  and the drama between them all plays out so intricately that my eyes start to wobble and my head it spins  Man  do I hate admitting it  and in the sparkling company of Goodreads at that  but it s just the damn truth  I like to quietly judge people who don t dig the classics because their  boring  or  weird  or  long winded  or  old fashioned  as much as anybody  but in this case I have met the enemy and he is me Homer s one of those writers who hover over   well   everything  of course  My beloved Joyce puts him to some obvious use in the obvious place  Philosophy professors are always referencing it  Nietzsche and Bernard Williams like to use him  Keats  Pound  Milton  etc etc   it s the kind of thing that a voracious reader will sort of get an inkling of even if they ve never actually cracked the pages themselves  Isn t it strange how that happens So I am now no longer burdened by master s thesis woes  PASSED  On my birthday  no less  Whut whut   and thus am free to tackle a big dog guilt free  I just cannot call myself an educated reader without having the Homer in my brain shelf  I just can t  It really is a kind of shame that it s not as central a part of the curriculum as it used to be   I m embarrassed by how little I really know about these characters  or rather how much I thought I knew and really hadn t retained So I m going straight to the source  the battle of Troy  2700 years of accumulated rage and blood and wisdom   and luckily I found the translator who can make it happen  for me  at least   Fagles  Fagles  His  Orestia  rocked my world and now he s the go to guy for all things classical  I wish I were smart and worldly enough to get a comparison of translations under way but I m doing all I can to take on the challenge The Iliad is throwing down Glad to say that at around book 5 the confusion is a presence  but not a hinderance  It s fucking death metal  Compulsively readable  incredibly gutsy and frank and vivid  There s a humanity here which really does shine through all the blood grudges and slaughter and dick waving and general bellicosity  as a lot of other reviewers have pointed out  People start fights  rend flesh  and either cry to their mamas materializing out of the sea      or are whisked away in the nick of time by generous goddesses  Men die for their comerades  beg favor from the gods who are in the midst of a Honeymooners row the likes of which are no man s buisness  The gods feel pain  but they do not die      Finished  Stayed up  almost  all night to cap it off at last  No sense in trying to communicate the breadth and density and power of the text  so I ll just post some of my favorite quotes in due time  i e  when and if I get around to it   No hay resena que le haga justicia a esta obra de arte   Por que no la habia leido antes  Gracias a esta lectura  tengo curiosidad de leer mas sobre mitologia griega  las tragedias de Euripides y claro  La odisea  I would like to re read this again some day  Even though I loved it  I think I would like it even more the second time around  My knowledge of greek mythology wasn t as good as it is now  since then I ve read Hesiod  the greek plays and other texts that flesh out the world even more It s a pity that most of the homeric cycle has been lost  the other works continued the story and have characters that aren t in the Illiad  like Achileus  son  For some reason I read The Odyssey before this book  Well I ve finally managed to finish it  I ordered the Robert Fagles verse translation by mistake  I wanted a prose translation  But I read it anyway  It s definitely a book worth reading  There are so many characters in this book  And their names are even harder to pronounce than Russian names  But as the book goes on  more and more people are killed  So there are less people s names to remember  It s an incredibly violent book  with quite graphic descriptions of killings  The person I hated the most in this book was Hector  even though he was a badass killing machine  It s amazing that a book this old can survive all this time  I was expecting the wooden horse tale  But it never happened  A quick Google and a look on Wikipedia tells me that  that s actually in Virgil s Aeneid  I enjoyed Robert Fagles translation  And I plan to read his translations of The Odyssey  and The Aeneid  But not any time soon  As I have way too many books  And I ve imposed a book buying ban on myself  But that doesn t usually last more than a few weeks  So I might as well sum it up with a superlative  this book is awesome  Materia viva che pulsa da quasi tremila anni  segno indelebile della nascita della nostra cultura occidentale  segno indelebile della nostra rovina  Una cosa mi colpito   le lacrime   le lacrime di Achille  le lacrime di Agamennone  Il pianto degli eroi bambini che li umanizza e li rende partecipi di una umanita a volte meschina  a volte dolce  a volte crudele ma che mai   mai e poi mai   impara dai propri errori  When I first read this book for my university literature class as an undergraduate  I couldn t help being captivated by my professor s description of the book as a  problematic work   The problematic nature of the Iliad stems from its hero  Achilleus    a character who  unlike his heroic counterparts  embodies a psychological complexity that at times frustrates the standards of a classical hero  It was this description    of Achilleus as a kind of sophisticated anarchist of sorts    that helped me get into this book  In a way  this description helped to put Achilleus into other classes of problematic heroes  Holden Caulfield  Hamlet    characters who have redeeming traits and yet still have the ability to leave us frustrated  When I typed in  anti heroes  into the the Google search engine  websites gave me such names as  Sam Spade  from the Maltese Falcon   Alex  from A Clockwork Orange  and Jay Gatsby  from The Great Gatsby   Achilleus didn t appear on any of these lists  Nevertheless  I like my professor s explanation  Against the Hellenic stereotype of a great leader  Achilleus is often vain  prideful  and capricious  Achilleus s in actions    his decision to stay out of the fighting    would not be so problematic if they were not in some way presented as justified  Much in the same way we are able to relate to Hamlet s indecisions  and just as we are drawn into the self doubt and social criticisms of Holden Caulfield  in the Iliad we are drawn into Achilleus s complex reasons for staying out of the fighting  even as many Achaians die because of his decision  Achilleus s choice to stay out of the fighting is not merely presented as a fault  but rather as a complex decision encompassing aspects of human emotion  alternative rationales  and Achaian cultural values  Perhaps  also  as some have read in the Iliad  Homer is also placing the seeds  through Achilleus  for popular discontent with nobility At the Iliad s beginning  the stress is most notably on the ignoble quality of Achilleus s actions   Sing  goddess  the anger of Peleus  son Achilleus and its devastation  which put pains thousandfold upon the Achaians   59   In this opening line  Achilleus s  anger  is identified as one of the chief causes of Achaian death and suffering    in the Hellenic backdrop  a very conservative reading of the anti hero and his deeds  This structures the poem as the tragic fault of a hero  and his redemption  or semi redemption from his ignoble non action  However  his decision to remain out of the fighting early on is explained in complicated terms in book nine  Achilleus explains his motivations for staying out of the fight between the Danaans and Trojans  His critique stresses 1  the inability of Agamemnon to lead  his materialism  in respect to issues of honor   2  Agamemnon s disrespect for his own honor  Agamemnon s decision to take Briseis   3  his contempt for the  virtue  of fighting for the women of noble men  a derivative critique of noble morality   4  a general critique of the quality of  kingliness   a derivative critique of noble morality   and 5  a general questioning of the reasons for fighting for honor  greater existential question  which would also defy issues of honor  and virtue  but also form a new ontological vision of the world  The last two modern themes   3  the virtue of fighting for the women of noble men and  4  the critique of the quality of kingliness are two critiques that deal less with the nature of existence and more with the nature of political and social existence  During the speech  Achilleus questions   Are the sons of Atreus alone among the mortal men the ones who love their wives    207  Lines 340 341   In this short  concise statement  the entire reasoning behind the Trojan War comes into question  including its aristocratic  or noble  foundation  Why should the many sacrifice for the few  In the introduction of the poem  Latimore says of what makes Agamemnon an outstanding figure   But essentially a king is what he is  not the biggest Achaian  says Priam to Hellen  but the kingliest  a bull in a herd of cattle  a lord who must be busy while others rest   In the quarrel with Achilleus  he demands recognition of his kingly stature  as if afraid of losing his position if he lacks what others have  in this case a captive mistress   49   Throughout the poem  Agamemnon possesses the important quality of kingliness  But what is this  kingliness   Achilleus questions in Book One why Agamemnon should have sovereignty over him  Is Agamemnon stronger  Does Agamemnon posses better gifts of speech  Has he accomplished more  No  Agamemnon is kinglier  and  kingliness  is a logic that runs in circles without an end  The classic critiques   1  and  2   however  undercut the three modern themes mentioned above  for they seem to be critiques that are mostly pragmatic and noble in nature  which can be stated simply in the questions and statements  Why did Agamemnon not respect the honor of Achilleus  Agamemnon should have been a wiser leader  Why as a noble  did Agamemnon not respect another noble  And so forth  Although these critiques do not have the radical political implications the other more modern themes do  as they seem to work within the framework of nobility   they do have the effect of alleviating some of the blame from the  anger  of Achilleus  Achilleus is  after all  human    and all humans crave respect and honor  Thank you Professor Russo for making this such an enjoyable read   This is my review of Robert Fitzgerald s translation  1974  of Homer s The Iliad  This makes the third translation of The Iliad that I ve read over the past year or so  and I quite liked it  While Fitzgerald s translation is perhaps not as rhythmically poetic as that of Robert Fagles  1990   or perhaps as ruthlessly faithful to the Greek text as Richmond Lattimore s verse translation  1951   it really is incredibly lyrical and reads very  very well  The Iliad is one of the greatest works of literature of all time  and this translation stands up tall with the best of them  in my opinion I think what I really came to love the most about Fitzgerald s blank verse translation was that he doesn t waste any words  It is spare and remarkably hard hitting  but still maintains a rugged and distinctly powerful lyricism  You can almost feel the  tramp  of marching feet and the reverberation of bronze swords crashing against ox hide shields  or hear the  thrum  of bow strings snapping as they launch arrows into the sky  It is visceral and living poetry that Fitzgerald has assembled and presented in his translation  Of course  I can t read the original Greek text and I can t judge if his translation fully captures and incorporates the essence of those ancient words  but I can tell you that this text is compelling and enthralling from the get go One of my favorite examples of the eloquence and pathos of Fitzgerald s translation is in Book 24  near the end of the poem  when Akhilleus and Priam meet late at night  and Akhilleus says to the King   Come  then  and sit down We ll probe our wounds no more but let them rest though grief lies heavy on us  Tears heal nothing drying so stiff and cold  This is the waythe gods ordained the destiny of men to bear such burdens in our lives  while theyfeel no affliction  At the door of Zeusare those two urns of good and evil giftsthat he may choose for us  and one for whomthe lightning s joyous king dips in both urnswill have by turns bad luck and good  That small section has always very powerfully affected me  and I have come to realize that young Akhilleus is an amazingly mature and astute man  wise well beyond his years Personally  I am of the opinion that Fitzgerald s translation is a very comfortable fit for a modern reader in our modern time who is reading an epic poem of nearly 16 000 lines that was first written down nearly three millenia in the past  but may well have existed in the oral tradition a thousand years before that  I think what I m really trying to say is that Fitzgerald has crafted an interpretation of the poem that flows with regularity and dignity  and is very respectful of Homer and his legacy  In so doing  Fitzgerald has not simply made his blank verse contemporary  nor has he erred and slipped into sounding stilted  archaic or pedantic  This translation is a good one  a very good  and one that I highly and unhesitatingly recommend  Read it  savor it  speak and hear it  and most of all  just enjoy it  After some three thousand years  The Iliad has not lost its power  I had read it before  though in the excellent Richmond Lattimore translation  and was not prepared for what Robert Fagles was able to do with the Greek epic The Iliad begins in medias res  with the wrath of Achilles at being mistreated by Agamemnon  The epic is not about the Trojan War  it is not even about Achilles  What it is about is the working out of Achilles  wrath through the deaths of Patroclus and the horrible revenge against Hector  and it ends with a passage of reconciliation as Achilles returns the body of Hector to his aged father  Priam  King of Troy  who comes to the Achaian camp as a supplicant begging for his son back In the background  the gods pull all the strings  sometimes in concert  just as often knocking heads against one another until Zeus has to step in to restore order  With all the self knowledge that Hector and Achilles have about being fated to die soon in battle  the gods may ameliorate the working out of the fates  but they seem unable or unwilling to go against what is preordained  Of all the gods  it is Thetis  mother of Achilles  who is most consistent and loyal    always acting to her son s benefit and even touching Zeus with her loving concern It may be surprising to those who have not read this great work that we do not see the death of Achilles  we do not see the Trojan Horse  we see nothing of the first nine years of the Trojan War  We see only a tightly knotted plot showing how the Trojans take advantage of Achilles  absence from battle  and what happens when Achilles returns to the fray in wrath I have not talked about Homer  because I have no idea who Homer was or even if he ever was  It doesn t matter  The work stands by itself and shines across those thousands of years with a bright  undying light  Admittedly it seems a little presumptive to try and review Homer s Iliad  a tale almost 3000 years old and one of the great epics  if not the greatest epic  that the ancient world produced  Nor does the story need any introduction  the world over  people know of the legend of the Trojan War  of the young lovers Helen and Paris  and the two champions of the Greeks and the Trojans destined to die  Achilles and Hector  Such has been the impact of this timeless tale of love and war over the millennia  that most people will have heard of it through sheer cultural osmosis and readily understand references to an Achilles  heel or Helen as the face that launched a thousand ships  despite the fact that few of those will have actually read The Iliad  So  this isn t going to be my usual review format  but more a collections of thoughts and comments Like any story it has both positives and negatives  and whilst I would recommend The Iliad to anyone  it s only honest to mention all the features  Homer introduces a very wide cast of characters into the story  even outside the main characters  some of whom are mentioned once and then killed  and it can be a challenge to keep track of all the different names  though the recurring characters are strong enough to be readily memorable  Secondly  a key feature of Homer s style has always been a propensity towards asides and stories within stories  As a result  there are frequent points where he diverges from the actual main plot of The Iliad and will recount another tale in brief  usually in the form of a character retelling their former adventures and exploits  Sometimes this occurs as part of heroic etiquette  characters facing off on the battlefield decide to exchange lineages and adventures stories before one of them kills the other  This is all part of honourable form in the epic poem  but it s a tad unrealistic right in the middle of a raging battle and it does drag the pacing down somewhat since it goes from fast paced  heated battle scene to lengthy recitation of lineage and former deeds  as a reader  you re in that fired up  battle scene mindset  and suddenly you just have to reset and re adjust But  I would urge potential readers to stick with the story  and keep with it despite those two points  At its core  The Iliad is a masterful tale of love and war and the fine line between those two themes  In many ways  The Iliad is such a classic of literature because it is an allegory of ideas and concepts that are still highly relevant to us today  The characters within this tale ask the same questions as us about the nature of love  friendship  family  life  death and honour  and for me that really hit home the knowledge which as an historian I ve come to learn many times over the years but is always worth repeating  people in the past may have lived in different times and different cultures and societies to us  but they were human exactly like us  and they pondered the same questions and experienced the same joys  sorrows and angst as we do in the present day  I think a lot of people consider history to be something of a boring subject and assume that the people of the past are so wildly different from us as to be almost alien and unrecognisable  but that isn t the case at all  and reading The Iliad  a story almost 3000 years old  that fact really resonates Another key feature of Homer s style  and one of my personal favourites  is his penchant and talent for description  Homer s descriptions are always very vivid and evocative  and they really stay with you   a fact I picked up on when I first read The Odyssey aged 7 years old and the memory of which has always stuck with me  The Iliad is crafted with the same wondrous descriptions and attention to detail  some examples of which I will provide later below  Homer also doesn t shy away from describing in full detail some pretty gory death scenes  but these are few and far between  and the seriousness and horror of these scenes never crosses the line into unpalatable The Iliad really is a must for any classicist or historian  but I would recommend it to absolutely anyone A note on this translation and edition  The late E  V  Rieu s introduction discusses Homer s style and what we know historically about both Homer and any possible Trojan War  the importance of The Iliad and finally the universal themes contained therein far better than I have here  I leave you with some of my favourite quotes  There are nights when the upper air is windless and the stars in heaven stand out in their full splendour round the bright moon  when every mountain top and headland and ravine starts into sight  as the infinite depths of the sky are torn open to the very firmament  when every star is seen  and the shepherd rejoices  Such as so many were the Trojans  fires  twinkling in front of Ilium midway between the ships and the streams of Xanthus   Atreides in a loud voice gave his troops the order to prepare for battle  and himself put on his gleaming bronze  He began by tying round his legs a pair of splendid greaves which were fitted with silver clips for the ankles  Next he put on his breast the cuirass that Cinryas had once presented to him as a friendly gift  News had reached Cinryas in far off Cyprus of the great Achaean expedition that was sailing for Troy  and he had sent this cuirass as a gracious offering to the King  It was made of parallel strips  ten of dark blue enamel  twelve of gold  and twenty of tin  On either side three snakes rose up in coils towards the opening for the neck  Their iridescent enamel made them look like the rainbow that the Son of Cronos hangs on a cloud as a portent to mankind below  Next  Agamemnon slung his sword from his shoulders  Golden studs glittered on the hilt  but the sheath was of silver  with a gold baldric attached  Then he took up his manly and man covering shield  a nobly decorated piece  with its ten concentric rings of bronze  and twenty knobs of tin making a white circle round the dark enamel boss  The central figure on it was a grim Gorgon s head with awe compelling eyes  and on either side of her  Panic and Rout were depicted  It was fitted with a silver baldric  round which a writhing snake of blue enamel twisted the three heads that grew from its single neck  On his head  Agamemnon put his helmet  with its four plates  its double crest and its horsehair plume nodding defiantly above  and finally he picked up a pair of strong and sharp bronze headed spears  Beams from the bronze he wore flashed into the distant sky  and Athena and Hera thundered in answer by way of salutation to the King of Golden Mycenae   Hera went in and close the polished doors behind her  She began by removing every stain from her comely body with ambrosia  and anointing herself with the delicious and imperishable olive oil she uses  It was perfumed and had only to be stirred in the Palace of the Bronze Floor for its scent to spread through heaven and earth  With this she rubbed her lovely skin  then she combed her hair  and with her own hands plaited her shining locks and let them fall in their divine beauty from her immortal head  Next she put on a fragrant robe of delicate material that Athena with her skilful hands had made for her and lavishly embroidered  She fastened it over her breast with golden clasps and  at her waist  with a girdle from which a hundred tassels hung  In the pierced lobes of her ears she fixed two earrings  each a thing of lambent beauty with its cluster of three drops  She covered her head with a beautiful new headdress  which was as bright as the sun  and last of all  the Lady goddess bound a fine pair of sandals on her shimmering feet  10 out of 10 This Review is associated with Stanley Lombardo s translation of The Iliad  Hackett Publishing Co   1997   This was a fun translation to read  and my fourth different translation of The Iliad that I ve read  Lombardo is very interested in restoring the  oral tradition  to experiencing Homer s The Iliad and The Odyssey  His translation s  very much lend themselves to being read aloud and listened to  i e   the reader and the listener can fully experience the lyricism  rhythms  and power of the words and verses  Lombardo s rendition really does beg to be read aloud and shared with others  In other words  Lombardo wants you to treat The Iliad as an experience in performance  Trust me  it works in the same fashion for the lone and silent reader too  it is a performance on each and every page you read Another interesting facet of Lombardo s rendition is in his structuring of the poem on the page  For example  he insets and italicizes the similes in the poem  This makes it very easy for the reader to directly relate the simile to the pertinent section of the poem  Normally  for me at any rate  there is a moment of confusion as I have to determine that what I m reading is actually a simile  and then determining what it applies to  Lombardo s clever structure removes that problem and makes the juxtaposition seamless  and it certainly facilitates reading it aloud by allowing for a pause before reading the simile Lombardo believes that The Iliad is a living poem  e g   it has been translated some 150 times into English since the 1600s   and that  Living poetry means living speech   I completely agree  For new readers of The Iliad  or readers who may be hesitant to tackle Homer  this is the version for them  In my opinion  Lombardo s translation is powerful and relevant for readers today  and will continue to be so viewed in the future  See http   paircreation com projects troy    for an overview of the Trojan War and the city of Troy The Iliad permeates Greek civilization to a degree that is difficult for us to fathom  It is a monumental  transcendent work of art  There are many reasons why the Iliad occupies the topmost peak on world literature s Himalayan ridge  in this review I can only touch upon a very few Encountering the Iliad is like walking into a museum where numerous products of secondary or tertiary importance in smaller galleries lead towards a grand  central atrium that contains the Iliad  The poem is the aesthetic center of the entire collection  it commands our attention as do none of the other works    all of which exist in subordinate relation to it  This is the position of the Iliad in world literature This is the great paradox of Greek literature  it opens not with something rude  primitive  in need of development or refinement  No    what we have is a work of such astonishing perfection that it remains the standard against which everything else is measured Even as he celebrates the battlefield as a place where men achieve immortal glory by killing one another  Homer portrays with unflinching honesty the terrible cost of war  where lives are destroyed  families are torn apart and cities are doomed to destruction Take Book I  It begins with a  quarrel  between Achilles and Agamemnon  the most destructive person to person conflict in any work of literature  Homer s manner of activating this dispute reveals his unsurpassed skill as a storyteller  He wastes no time whatsoever with extraneous details  but instead initiates on page one a deadly  disastrous concatenation of events rooted both in human folly and the dictates of the heroic code that governs the conduct of his characters The poem is not at all a chronicle of the Trojan war  Homer instead focuses his attention on this one dispute  which then unfolds over 24 books  15 693 lines of hexameter verse  to a conclusion that relates back to the beginning with remarkable harmony  The structure of the poem  highly episodic though it may be  remains unified  Within the wide sweep of its action  Homer presents us with a panoramic view of humanity  This is the essence of the  epic  genre  An epic poem by definition is not a novel  this is why comparisons of the poem to what we call  novels  are not only unhelpful  they prevent readers from grasping what makes the Iliad a unique artistic achievement I have taught Iliad Book I  the Greek text  numerous times  Each time I return to it I come away with a deeper appreciation of Homer s masterful handling of character and plot  Agamemnon is arrogant  paranoid  insecure  and stupid  His decision to dismiss the aged priest Chryses at the outset of the poem causes Chryses to beseech Apollo to avenge the wrong done to him  which causes Apollo to infect the Greek camp with a lethal plague  which causes Achilles to rise 9 days later to seek the advice of a seer  which causes Calchas to rise and identify Agamemnon as the source of the problem  which causes Agamemnon  reluctantly  to give back Chryses  daughter  which causes him to take away Achilles  war prize Briseis  which causes Achilles to withdraw from battle  which causes lots more Greeks to get dead  which causes    I ll stop here  All of these events are handled with vivid  powerful  and dramatically intense dialogue    Homer s favored medium  The conflict is timeless  the incompetent superior whose authority is challenged by a fiery  intense subordinate and better warrior For many readers  this will prove to be a tough book to slog through    its many pages are filled with seemingly endless  graphic descriptions of battlefield killings  And yet    and yet    there are humorous touches  the gods laughing at Hephaestus at the end of 1  Hera s seduction of Zeus in 14  the graceful reception of Thetis by Charis  Hephaestus  wife in 18  scenes of heart rending emotion  the parting of Hector and Andromache in 6  the lamentations of Hecuba and Priam in 22  the supplication of Priam in 24  The poem is a virtual handbook on the heroic values that define ancient Greek civilization  Read it for at least two reasons   1  it is a great story   2  it is the single most valuable  Introduction to Greek civilization  that is currently in print  In fact  don t bother reading any of the commonly available books that offer an overview of Greek civilization before you have read this poem There are many translations of the Iliad  Of recent translators  Lattimore  Fitzgerald  Fagles and Lombardo are among the most well known I have read portions of all of them  for different purposes  When I am uncertain about the meaning of a particular Greek expression  I turn to Lattimore to check his translation  since he is the most faithful to the original Greek  When I am reading a translation for the enjoyment of the story in English  I usually turn to Fagles or Lombardo  Fagles takes many liberties with the Greek  It is an interesting exercise to take a passage of ten lines or so in the original Greek and to compare it with Lattimore and Fagles  You will quickly find that Lattimore comes much closer to expressing in English what Homer has said in Greek  Fagles  on the other hand  simply invents things that are nowhere to be found in Homer  Still  it is an exciting read with a rhythm  vividness  and swift pace that are worthy of the great Greek poem itself  Deze Ilias in Nederlandse vertaling van Patrick Lateur heb ik drie jaar geleden al gelezen en goed bevonden  Na de Ilias marathon die in januari 2014 werd georganiseerd en waarbij op vijf  lange  avonden het hele epos werd voorgelezen in vijf theaters door een twintigtal acteurs  ben ik gewoon laaiend enthousiast over dit boek  Ik had het natuurlijk kunnen weten  de Ilias is niet geschreven om te lezen  maar om voor te lezen  Wat een ervaring  wat een feest Het bijzondere van deze vertaling  vergeleken bij vroegere vertalingen in het Nederlands  is dat Patrick Lateur hier is afgestapt van de Griekse hexameters uit de oorspronkelijke tekst  Hij koos daarentegen voor vijfvoetige jamben die veel natuurlijker klinken in het Nederlands  Zo veranderde  Hij sprak gevleugelde woorden  in  Hij gaf zijn woorden vleugels   Dat ligt veel beter in de mond  De  snelvoetige Achilles  wordt vaak  Achilles met de snelle voeten   de  ver treffende Apollo  kennen we nu als  Apollo die van verre treft  en verder komen we ook nog  Zeus die de wolken vat  en  Hera met de koeienogen  tegen Om dat overzetten van hexameters naar jamben te verwezenlijken had Lateur wel voor elke twee Griekse verzen  drie Nederlandse verzen nodig  al veranderde dat natuurlijk niets aan de totale lengte van de tekst Naast de vele oorlogs  en strijdscenes  die voor het publiek van strijdvaardige Griekse edelen zoiets moeten geweest zijn als de actiefilms voor de moderne jeugd nu  heb ik in de Ilias tal van stille  poetische en zelfs grappige scenes ontdekt  De vele  Homerische vergelijkingen  bijvoorbeeld zijn echte juweeltjes waarin een natuurbeschrijving als voorbeeld wordt genomen voor een handeling  Zo n pareltje klinkt bijvoorbeeld zo  Zoals een wolk van spreeuwen of van kraaienin doodsangst en met schelle schreeuwen voortvliegtals zij een havik zien die op hen afkomten voor de kleine vogeltjes de dood brengt  zo vluchtten ook de jeugdige Achaiersin doodsangst schreeuwend onder druk van Hektoren van Aeneas  17e zang  verzen 753 ev Anderzijds zit deze vertaling vol schitterende vondsten  woordspelingen  alliteraties die de tekst levendig en boeiend maken  Mij trof alvast een zinsnede als   in drommen drongen de Trojanen op   Ook bijgebleven is die heerlijke 14e zang waarin Hera bij Afrodite om allerlei liefdesmiddeltjes bedelt om Zeus te verleiden tot de godin van de liefde uit haar bustehouder een band met bont borduursel tovert  een waar afrodisiacum  Hera neemt die glimlachend aan en  steekt de band weg in haar boezem    De hand in eigen boezem steken  is hier niet ver weg Kortom een boek om te koesteren  te lezen en    te herlezen  Daarom niet altijd integraal  maar af en toe proeven als een fijnproever  En blij zijn met het mooiste en oudste literair werk dat Europa ons gaf  Aahh  The Iliad   A great monster of fiction  I came to this late in life  If I had read about Troy when I was in my teens I would definitely have obsessed about it  But I m a bit older now  so it s under control  just   When I decided it was time to read about Troy I went easy on myself and read Michael Wood s history David Gemmell s trilogy Troy by Adele GerasAchilles by Elizabeth CookBlack Ships Before Troy by Rosemary Sutcliff  beautifully illustrated    and many more  Only then did I read the real thing  I m glad I did it that way  because it helped me to understand the book straight away  Having no previous knowledge of Greek  I already knew how to pronounce the names  who everybody was  and what was going on  Some of the characters felt like old friends It s hard to give a review for something like this  Yes  there is an awful lot of battlefield gore  but I like that   there is also a unique insight into the history  the politics  and the religion of the time  The idea of what makes a hero was such an important concept in Ancient Greece  and this is pushed to the fore time and again  A great  bloody  thundering epic book   Solitamente  fra i due poemi omerici  quello che riscuote maggior successo e fascinazione e l Odissea  il racconto dell uomo che  grazie al proprio ingegno  riesce a ritornare in patria superando sofferenze devastanti  Ad una seconda lettura globale dei due testi  pero  ho apprezzato nell Iliade quegli aspetti che la rendono la piu autentica e vivida espressione della letteratura e della civilta greca  le rassegne degli eroi  l inseguimento dei guerrieri nella mischia  la descrizione delle loro sanguinose lotte  ma anche la ritualita bellica  le astuzie degli dei  che intervengono con i loro desideri e capricci nel piu grande scontro di civilta mai narrato  gli intimi quadri ambientati nelle tende achee o dentro le mura di Troia  L Iliade descrive un sistema etico e cultuale ben codificato  in cui  se e forte l esaltazione della gloria dei vincitori  non c e tuttavia umiliazione dei vinti  i combattenti si onorano reciprocamente  nonostante l inimicizia  e ogni singolo gesto si riconduce ad una ritualita che conferisce al poema la grandezza e la risonanza delle grandi saghe   Richmond Lattimore s is the definitive translation into English of Homer s masterwork  It comes closest to the original in word for word meaning  and in poetic form  and in spirit  I ve re read this for almost 40 years  and it never fails to reveal new beauties and new depths  Through the prism of a civilization different from our own  Homer sees the human essence  Homer describes almost all that s admirable or despicable in people  and almost all that drives them  with clarity  feeling  and an uncompromising objectivity  It s not for nothing that the Illiad survived for millenia  and Lattimore s translation is the finest gateway to this work that we have  Other translations are more modern  accessible  and hip  some are prettier  but Lattimore gives us Homer  I feel strongly that translators should not stand between an author and his readers  claiming to be creators themselves because they spray paint a mustache on the Mona Lisa  or make great literature  relevant  to the   presumably limited   contemporary reader  Lattimore had the integrity of a scholar  he didn t pretend to speak for Homer  Even if you ve read other translations  try this one   After reading this I m very surprised and disappointed it was never part of my English curriculum in high school  This epic poem covers all manner of literary devices and elements  while also serving as an introduction to poetry  meter  etc  The book has everything you need to in order to branch out to history and philosophy as well  Basically  I think I am way too old to have just read this for the first time and I am going to shamefully blame the education system  About this edition  I can say the criticism of it being  basically stacked prose  is not valid  Though it may not be as poetic as other versions  it does adhere to meter  albeit loosely  and there are many alliterations  epitaphs  and repetitive elements that allude to the improvisational oral tradition of the poem  Looking forward to reading another translation in the future   This book has been one of the most amazing books that I have ever read Achilis is my favorite character The theme is The War Of Troy It is even movie but reading it its more interesting  I really love this book  I dont even know if there is a person who hasnt read it yet  Its a shame really  It is one of the most important work done by Greeks  I have a whole new appreciation for Homer  The thing is that I have a small nephew and I had already told him all the children s stories that I know   and I really know a lot  So  I was running out of ideas      and there comes Homer to save the day  Sure I d left most of the bloody details out   but still this is really interesting story  It is something that can easily be retold and even altered  or censored  it still has its merits  Iliad was interesting to me when I was in high school and if my hormone driven braid could have picked up on something back then   The point is   some stories are timeless   and like good wine they only get better with years  Iliad is one of them  I don t understand how Achilles became the hero  He has no solidarity  empathy or honor  There was almost a mini Trojan war going on inside the camp  with Agamemnon taking one of Achilles  girls  and Achilles punishing it by having countless of his comrades slaughtered  only to get incredibly vengeful when it s one of his close friends dying at Trojan hands  Other than that  the Iliad portrays a humanity in the horrors of war that is seldom seen today  Nobody s right  nobody wins  everyone is but a fickle toy of fate  there is only mourning in conflicts that are fought over things that aren t worth thousands of lives  and the gods will only whisper encouragement into your ears to have you confidently run into the bull s horns   Canakkaleli oldugum icin Truva Antik Kenti ne uc dort kez gitmistim   Ilyada  kitabini okumadan onceydi bu gidislerim  Az bucuk

get from rap is the closest to Homer   She later added that  both tell a war story   This chance remark had inspired me to read The Iliad  I chose the Fagles translation The Iliad surprised me  It is a truly great book and surprising in every way  It is a glimpse into a lost world  but such a vivid glimpse that I came away with an understanding of what these ancient men felt and believed  The things we take for granted in our modern age were still revered and savored  I noticed this especially in Homer s description of the sunrises  and deaths  Homer describes the goddess  Dawn  when describing the sun rising to begin a new day  And it made each day seem unique among all the others  Here is a simple yet lovely evocation   At last  when young Dawn with her rose red fingers shone once more     But the imagery varies and can be quite delicate  In this example the goddess Dawn is taken for sparkling light   At that hour the morning star comes rising up to herald a new day on earth  and riding in its wake the Dawn flings out her golden robe across the sea     One of the most beautiful qualities to the writing is the way Homer delivers clear evocations of death  and near death  experiences  He describes death the way a lesser writer might use a period or comma  to signal an ending  or just a pause  For example  in Book 5 Sarpedon has just been speared by Tlepolemus  but he survives  The veteran Pelagon  one of his closest aides pushed the shaft of ashwood out through his wound  his spirit left him  a mist poured down his eyes       but he caught his breath again  A gust of the North Wind blowing round him carried back the life breath he had gasped away in pain   Translation notes  only  since I am speechless on the Iliad itself  To be added to  This review is attached to Chapman s Iliad  which I haven t read in whole  Nevertheless I am an advocate of the Elizabethan translators of the ancients   won absolutely by statements such as this  from the introduction to my Chapman by Gary Wills What was it in Chapman s time   that great period of Shakespeare and the English bible   that made his Homeric poem catch fire      The consonance was between the semi divine heroism of the Iliad s warriors and Renaissance humanism  Elizabethan man  as the wonder of the universe  was sphered in cosmological symbols    That is the vision of heroes that flames from Chapman s Iliad    The  cosmologizing  of man in the Renaissance made the easy communication between Homer s gods and his heroes something that Chapman could take with entire seriousness That s why Chapman  Can a 20th or 21st century translator give you that  Then there s Alexander Pope  The greatest unacknowledged epic in English  as George Steiner likes to say  or the only great to stand beside Paradise Lost  Pope spent ten years on his Iliad  Each book comes with his Observations at the end  which brings my Penguin to 1200 pages   these give you Pope s changing vision of Homer and are a classic in themselves of one great poet in meditation on another  I need make no other case for Pope s Iliad than his own first lines  which are unbeaten  Achilles  wrath  to Greece the direful spring Of woes unnumber d  heav nly Goddess  sing  That wrath which hurl d to Pluto s gloomy reign The souls of mighty chiefs untimely slain  Whose limbs  unburied on the naked shore   Devouring dogs and hungry vultures tore  Since great Achilles and Atrides strove  Such was the Sov reign doom  and such the will of Jove  I used to avoid the 20th century translations  that seemed plain   I m a sceptic about my own century and probably felt they have no conviction in their Homer  like Chapman  or didn t toil for ten years like Pope  But I am just now discovering that I adore the Richmond Lattimore  I already think the world of his brother Owen Lattimore  so I m suspecting they were sired by Zeus  This is a translation renowned for its literalness and authenticity    as much a scholar as a poet    but the lines glide along for me  I m through a book before I know it  which I never said of Homer before  With an austere faith to his original  he avoids such hazards of modern tonality as making the goddesses sound too girly  making soldiers and officers interact as in our armies  making the humour in heaven too slapstick  I used to worship Christopher Logue s creative translations  but these days I find them too one sided  too 20th century in his stress on realistic depiction of warfare   and in his cynicism towards every party  which isn t Homer  of course  Shakespeare went there first in his paint it black comedy  Troilus and Cressida    So  what s your favorite part of the Iliad  The judgment of Paris  His abduction of Helen  Odysseus faking insanity to avoid war  The Trojan horse  Achilles getting shot in the heel  In fact  none of this actually happens in Homer Despite its bulk   The Iliad  covers only a few days of the Trojan War   This paragraph review is all spoilers  but I m assuming you know the story already   The Iliad  spans from Agamemnon s theft of Briseis  Achilles s war trophy  to the funeral of Hector  The six hundred pages in between are filled with Achilles sulking  lots of speeches  lots of battles  the death of Patroklos  the return of Achilles  a long and random chapter about all the sports they play at Patroklos s funeral  and the death of Hector  Due to the violent nature and recurring epithets   The Iliad  is easy reading  aside from the fact my prof made us read the entire poem in three days  Thanks   However  I was surprised not that I enjoyed it  but that I found it politically relevant in the modern day  Properly read   The Iliad  is one of the greatest anti war works ever written  1  There is no clear bad guy   The Iliad  is not told exclusively from the Greek point of view  in fact  since this predates the nation state  the word  Greek  never appears   Frequently  the poet leaps across the walls to study the grief and fear of the Trojans  When two warriors meet in battle  it s difficult to choose one over the other  Achilles  in theory the hero of the piece  sulks and mistreats the bodies of his enemies  while Hector is the most valiant and honorable of the bunch  Elsewhere  we see Odysseus break sacred oaths not to kill his prisoners  Although the poet spends more time among the Greeks  it is impossible to hate the Trojans  When the reader sympathizes with both sides of the war  the entire conflict seems like an appalling loss of life  Which brings me too  2  The soldiers don t want to be there  The Trojan war began when Paris stole Helen  the wife of Menelaus  So  of the entire Greek army  approximately one man has a pressing reason to be there  The rest of the fighters come seeking glory and honor  the currency of their lives  Throughout  The Iliad   a few soldiers anticipate Falstaff by wondering why honor is worth dying for  Many were coerced into battle  Odysseus showed himself to be sane only when the recruiters tried to kill his son  Diomedes  the most badass of all the Greek soldiers  I have no idea why he has zero name recognition  fights because everyone taunts him and accuses him of not living up to his famous father  Achilles  thanks to a prophecy  knows he will die in Troy  but feels shamed into seeking glory  3  You see the consequences of war  Achilles s grief for Patroklos is the most well known  but there are many poignant scenes  Priam and Hecuba s grief for the fallen Hector is very poignant  and Hector s wife  Andromache  has some amazing speeches over her husband s body  Even Briseis and Helen  who are merely chattel in this poem  have long speeches on their own suffering  4  The high command is incompetent  At the start of  The Iliad   Agamemnon is forced to appease the gods by giving back a girl he had captured in a town  He retaliates by taking Achilles s slave  the greatest insult he could possibly deliver  This is  in fact  the premise for the entire  Iliad   In the rest of the poem  Agamemnon is tentative  uncertain  and defeatist  Menelaus  the reason they are all here in the first place  is practically a side character  Because they have higher rank  they sit back and make poor decisions while the competent and noble soldiers go out to die for them  5  They are all playthings  This  for me  was the most poignant part of the poem  The Gods of Olympus all take sides in this conflict  Aphrodite  Ares  Apollo  and  occasionally  Artemis fight on the side of Troy  while Hera  Athena  Poseidon  and  occasionally  Hermes back the Greeks  Zeus has the most interesting role by far  After Achilles has his manhood insulted  his mother begs Zeus to bring honor to her son  Zeus agrees to let the Trojans win every battle until Achilles rejoins the fight  thus allowing him to win the largest share of glory  Countless Greeks and Trojans die for Zeus s scheme to come about  Whenever anyone in battle falters  the Gods fill his mind with bloodlust  Basically  the Gods play the mortals like marionettes  To cite just one example  Hector tries to flee from Achilles  but Athena takes the form of Hector s brother and promises to fight with him  Hector agrees  Achilles throws his spear and misses  but Athena gives it back to him without Hector seeing  When Hector turns to ask his brother for aid  he understands he has been duped  and that the Gods have willed his death  Achilles kills him a few lines later The Gods swoop in to rescue their champions every few pages  but they also bring about the death of others  In order for Achilles to win more glory  Zeus lets his own son  the demigod Sarpedon  get killed by Patroklos  No matter how many sacrifices and prayers you have performed  the Olympian Gods will carelessly let you die Against this backdrop  I found Achilles both a compelling and strangely modern figure  Unlike the others  who bow to the King Agamemnon  Achilles dares to defy the incompetent leader  Rather than be swept up in the camaraderie  Achilles withdraws from the fight  determined not to die for an empty cause  When the Gods play with his fate  Achilles alone dares to defy them  he actually threatens to kill Apollo   And for all this individualism and defiance  his best friend Patroklos is killed  For Achilles  the last beautiful thing in the war has been crushed  So though he knows he will die in Troy  and though Agamemnon has mistreated him  and though the Gods are just playing his fate for their own amusement  Achilles puts on his armor and rides out  knowing that once he kills Hector  his own death is near   Nota sull edizione distribuita gratuitamente da Amazon per KindleDire che la traduzione sia datata e un eufemismo  V  Monti e vissuto a cavallo tra il XVIII e il XIX secolo   ma io la trovo assolutamente ben fatta  Ha un ritmo e una musicalita incredibili  Inoltre e comprensibilissima nonostante l italiano non proprio moderno  che somiglia piu a quello di Dante che a quello attuale  e  anzi  in un certo senso aiuta a tenere sempre presente che questa e un opera antichissima Tutto il contrario di quando lessi l Odissea su un testo scolastico di mia zia  con una traduzione sicuramente piu moderna  e mi fu difficilissimo capire cosa ci fosse scritto e seguire la narrazione Segnalo soltanto due nei Il primo  che a me personalmente non ha dato alcun fastidio  e che i nomi propri utilizzati sono quelli latini  ossia Marte  Giove  Ulisse ecc  invece che Ares  Zeus  Odisseo Il secondo  leggermente piu fastidioso  e l uso ricorrente dell esclamazione  deh   come intercalare nei discorsi degli anziani  anche se  per quel che ne so  potrebbe esserci nell originale un qualcosa di analogo che e stato reso in questo modo  There are many Iliads  and choices must be made among them  Lattimore s is the most faithful to the original Greek  But a faithful translation  handy as it may be when serving as a crib  quickly grows tiresome when reading the poem at length  This is why I enjoy Lombardo for extended reading  It is lively and straightforward  and whatever it sacrifices  and that is a lot  in the dignified language of the original  it makes up for with its own brand of clarity and vigor  It isn t Homer  as Bentley said of Pope s rendering  but it conveys the powerful force and spirit of the poem as well as can be expected for an English translation I also recommend his audiobook reading of his translation  which I listen to whenever I have to take an extended road trip  alone  of course    never try to make others listen to an audiobook reading of the Iliad   It contains brief summaries of each book told by Susan Sarandon before the full book itself is read by Lombardo  a useful feature  Fagles offers an idiomatic Iliad that is smooth  lively  and  at times  vital  The tropes of orality are minimized or stripped away entirely  which will leave some readers wondering why the sea is no longer wine dark  and why so few words are winged  That is a valid approach  though for my taste it s a wee too vernacular  I don t mind a little heavy lifting  and I found that in the service of making the Iliad accessible  Fagles has perhaps brought it a bit too far down to earth  Of the masterpiece itself  The Iliad is simply one of the greatest literary works in the entire human heritage  It is a work that I would recommend to anyone at all  Everyone should read it   bgdhrym z ynkhh chr yh khtb 150 SfHh y rw lftsh ddm t bkhwnm         dwssh dshtm yn khtbw w dr

about war   The Iliad   is said to be the best one for beauty and clarity  and I found that was true  Fagle s poem is very accessible and it makes clear what may be fuzzy for modern ordinary readers in trying to understand the culture  literature and emotions of a very ancient people who inadvertently passed down a story from millennia ago  Since the poem was written originally in another language  although the pain  hopes  losses and triumphs of war are unchanging  transforming Greek word meanings into English grammatical constructions can make or break an English reader s interest

whining about how boring or incomprehensible this entire 700 page of a monster book is  and if it wasn t that you needed to read it for a class or for the kudos of having read it  keep in mind the

is possible to know about the ancient Greeks  the Trojans  their myths  and the latest discoveries by archeologists uncovering what they believe is the actual  real city of Troy  IMO  this is a WAY more fun time to be reading  The Iliad   especially if the reader takes it slow and looks at the various translations to find the one which best suits That said  my eyes glazed over after the dozens and dozens of passages similar to the below excerpt  reciting hundreds and hundreds of names and genealogies  And Thoas son of Andraemon led Aetolia s units  soldiers who lived in Pleuron  Pylene and

because I know those original story tellers who made the monumental effort of passing down this poem did so entirely on a verbal  not written  basis  having memorized all of these names along with the entire poem  Bravo  you ancients One other major issue that people  especially sensitive people  have difficulty with in reading  The Iliad  is the explicit gothic horrors of war that seem to make up at least two thirds of the poem  According to experts  the slicing  cutting and stabbing wounds vividly described for thousands of lines are actually true to life  Despite the fact this war is fought with swords  knives  spears  arrows  chariots and other heavy and sharp bronze age gear  it is obvious that brains and guts are as easy to get at with yesteryear s cutting and stabbing instruments as well as by using bullets today  Agamemnon never saw him   tensed with a spear and slashed him under the elbow  down the forearm   a glint of metal   the point ripped through his flesh and the lord of fighting men Atrides shuddered  Not that he quit the foray even then   he sprang at Coon  gripping his big spearshaft tough from the gusting wind that whipped its tree  Coon was just dragging his brother footfirst  wild now to retrieve his own father s son  calling for help from all the bravest men   but as Coon hauled the body through the press Agamemnon lunged up  under his bossed shield

immortals fly down to earth whisking away their favorite warriors to safety  or setting up an opposing fighter for their favorite to kill  Zeus is not pleased  and spends some time  and verses  punishing and threatening his family of gods  to their chagrin  I thought their frequent commentary and obstructive behaviors very amusing  and to be frank  a welcome diversion from the very literal rivers of blood and body parts caking the boots of the fighters So  why is this book on everyone s  must read  list The pathos and pity of war is frequently on display  as heartbreaking to the Achaens

Edition  At the same time I was reading  The Iliad  for a bookclub read  I was also reading  A Clash of Kings  book two in the  A Song of Ice and Fire  series  I did not know what to expect from the Martin book when I started it  but it turned out to be an interesting complementary read to Homer s myths of warfare  gods and the emotional pain of loss  The similarities between the two are so many  I wonder at George Martin s inspiration I truly hope this classic read  meaning  The Iliad   although  A Clash of Kings  is good  too  is on everyone s TBR list   Confession  This is the first time I have ever read the entire Iliad out loud  It was delightful  The boys began to look on the time as a refreshing break during our school days and that took me by surprise because they are not quite so accommodating with Shakespeare  For my older children I had just assigned this and had read a few chapters out loud from an old translation but it felt like a struggle I know people in the know have various opinions about translations but for us the Fagles was pleasantly readable as a read aloud  The readings seemed to flow  All in all  reading The Iliad aloud will go down as one of the best things I ever did with my children at home  Binlerce yil once ulkemiz topraklarinda gerceklesen Troya Savasi ile ilgili bir kitap okumak cok hosuma gitti Ulkemizdeki herkese okunmasi zorunlu kilinmali bence  Just finished rereading The Iliad in Peter Green s wonderful verse translation  I loved it  I read it as a young man and I don t think I really appreciated it for its value at the time  It must be the most extensive description of a battle in all of literature  with the possible exception of War and Peace by Tolstoy   indeed  in all its gory detail  and yet  the story is luminous because of the way it is told   and perhaps also because ultimately it is a story of reconciliation and respect  There is also such attention to detail  it reads as if written by a soldier who knew what it was like to be in the midst of the fighting  Of couse  the battle  with its oh so human antagonists  is also intercut with the squabbles between the gods  which raises this story to the quality of half legend  Green s translation was designed to be a text that can be  declaimed  aloud  and the translation is full of sonorities that resound in one s mind as one reads  Delightful encounter with one of the greatest works extant in literature  and now I have a true understanding of why this book is so revered  One of the masterpieces of Ancient Greek Literature  It is one of those books that everyone should read at least once   An excellent translation by Robert Fagles makes this bloody classic worth a re read  An ur text for storytelling  Reading it was almost a mystical experience  discovering where so many narrative devices originated  No wonder this tale has fascinated people for centuries  There s so much to glean from it  and so many ways it can be read  For starters  though  treat it as a great war saga  It works perfectly well on that level  The most brutal and beautiful war saga ever  Truly one of the great reading experiences of my life  I m glad it took me so long to finally get to it  because I don t think I d have appreciated it as much at an earlier stage of my development  It came at just the right time to hit me like a ton of bricks and fill me with joy  The description of Achilles  shield in Book 18  a stunning passage in a book full of stunning passages  is still rattling around in my head  This edition had a fantastic introduction by Bernard Knox  I suggest you seek it out  as it was beautiful in its own right and added greatly to my appreciation and understanding of the book   Hay dos problemas fundamentales con los llamados  Clasicos  de la literatura  En primer lugar  hay una infinidad de versiones alteradas  adaptadas a publicos especificos  las versiones infantiles y juveniles   resumenes  y un sinfin de aberraciones literarias  Dado esto  en ocasiones es dificil leer la obra como se tenia dispuesta originalmente y altera nuestra percepcion de forma notable El segundo problema consiste en la traduccion  trabajo tan importante como el de la composicion del autor  El traductor debe conocer al autor a fondo  saber a consciencia que queria darnos a entender el escritor con su obra  sus sentimientos  sus mas reconditos pensamientos  El traductor tiene una labor incansable  dar fidelidad al relato original  Tarea ardua  no cabe duda Los Clasicos de la literatura estan abarrotados de miles de traducciones  ya que todos desean aportar su  version  de la obra y asi pasar a la eternidad  Dicho y hecho  algunos traductores forman parte de la tradicion literaria y se quedan hasta el fin de los tiempos como cronistas  inclusive  o copistas fieles  Nos entregan las palabras que habria dicho el autor en nuestro idioma  Otros  en cambio  comenten una verdadera hecatombe ortografica  acude a mi mente el episodio de  Casa Negra   de Stephen King  traducida por Plaza   Janes  que cometio la gravisima falta de llamar  Rey Colorado  al  Rey Carmesi   del original Crimson King   y otros muchos ejemplos   que pueden llegar a obligar al lector a infraestimar  menospreciar o abandonar la obra por dicha mala traduccion Ahora bien  un traductor ante un clasico compuesto por la literatura epica  la epopeya mitologica en su maxima expresion  la  cronica  que nos sobrevive a mas de tres mil anos  tiene una faena de las mismas proporciones que las mitologicas  Podria ser mas facil adentrarse en la mente de un contemporaneo  pero de alguien de la talana de Homero    creo que es casi imposible  Y es por eso que la version de Luis Segala y Estalella  catedratico espanol de principios del siglo XX  resulta a nuestros dias la mas fidedigna y hermosa de todas  Se enaltecen los sentimientos a la lectura de las grandiosas batallas desencadenadas fuera de Ilion  la rica descripcion de las armaduras  los escudos  principalmente aquel del de los pies livianos   los caballos  los carros  las fastuosas fiestas y juegos realizados por los argivos y los teucros  la valentia infundida a los heroes de ambos lados  la igualdad con la que la fortuna de los dioses favorece ora a unos ora a otros  la amistad y el amor fraternal  Podemos concluir que esta version  de Luis Segala  corresponde a una obra magistral inigualable  Mientras que la obra original  la obra achacada a Homero  resulta ser la apoteosis de la epopeya  Epico  Robert Graves translation really made the text come alive  his choice of prose and verse was just magnificent and I know what a superb translator he is after reading his translation of  The Twelve Caesars   I was suprised and disgusted by the numerous ways of man slaughter that Homers s imagination invents although this might just be his way to show how awful war is  Homer has a knack for language which immediatly hits you  his choice is fluid and just right  nothing overdone which is what makes him so relevent and fresh even after so many ages  I really liked his referencesto the countryside and hunting to get across a scene which might be difficult to imagine  two passages particularly struck me as truely the work of a master from book 6 and 13   Why noble son of Tydeus  why Must you inquire my name All forest leaves are born to die  All mortal men the same Though Spring s gay branches burgeon out  their leaves continue not Cold autumn scatters them to rout  And in cold earth they rot Next year  another host of leaves Is born grows green and dies Old mother earth their fall receives  The fall of man likewise  And Zeus evermore excelling  Of wisdom infinite Are you yourself compelling These men to fight their fight And sin against the light Dances are good  in measure  like love and sleep and song And yield more certain pleasure Than to defend the wrongBy battling all day long   hwmyrws byn lshrq wlmwrwth lsh ry   kn frydrysh  wjst fwlf  nbh

taking it on was completely voluntary on my part  I was doing it primarily because I want to cover it with my daughter this coming school year  My reluctance wasn t due to finding it irrelevant  I did not fight in the canon wars but would have taken up arms in defense of the study of Western Civ  I wasn t looking forward to it because it seemed like it was going to be crazy boring  I was wrong The Iliad is a supercharged tale of boundless passions and murderous rage and merciless warfare and heartbreaking lamentation and limitless hubris and unwavering loyalty  Of gut churning gore and capricious gods and towering heroes and hapless women  It is the story of men writ large  It made me wish I could read the Greek for myself  If we had worlds enough and time  that would be on my bucket list  But the stuff on my bucket list is more like  Buy Paper     Find Pens     Make Bucket List   Clearly  reading Homer in the original Greek is looking a bit unlikely So  not only did I do a tiny service to western culture by adding one more link to the rapidly rusting chain binding us to our ancient traditions  you re welcome  by the way  but I got to spend a month engaged in the kind of summer reading that had me chomping at the bit to pick this up every morning  I mean  I m not a stranger to Homer  we are acquainted  I knew how the story went  But I was still racing to find out what happened next  I can t speak intelligently to the quality of the translation  I found it breath taking  How close it comes to the tone of the original is not quite clear to me  I know the Lattimore translation is highly prized as the more  difficult  due in part to its fidelity to the original s dactylic hexameter  Meanwhile Fagles is considered more approachable as he plays it kind of loosey goosey with the structure in exchange for a fabulously paced story  In my dreams  I tackle the Lattimore at some later date  But I m naked and in the middle of my junior high school cafeteria so it is both a dream and nightmare  And the likelihood of either one happening seems fairly remote But  if that s your thing  go for it and let me know how you like the Lattimore  Lattimore s translation is pitch perfect  but it may not be the best translation for a first time reader of Homer  He is able to balance the poetry of the text with the literal meaning of the Greek in a sensitive manner  but this sometimes can come across as dry  There are parts of the Iliad which can be skipped on a first read through  like the catalogue of ships  and some of the intermediate books which focus almost entirely on the mechanics of battle  but even these parts you will want to go back to eventually  and probably in this translation  The metaphorical depth of these books is probably best appreciated once you have the  big picture   but I worry that readers get bogged down in the sea of minor characters hacking each other to bits and miss the beauty of the metaphors The first time I read the Iliad I was a little dismayed by the pawn like role of mortals    heroes or not  they are manipulated by the gods like toys  This time around I noticed some subtleties that I missed the first time  things that were probably so obvious to Homer s audience  and better contemporary readers  that they didn t need emphasis  The primary thing is that the gods are themselves in thrall to something higher than themselves    fate  Even Zeus must bend to fate  just as mortals must bend to the gods  It s a small point in the Iliad  but a crucial one I think  The Trojan War was a silly  stupid war  with many more to follow  but it ultimately isn t about Paris and Helen  or Achille s anger  or Priam s love for Hektor  Those are important elements in the story  but this time I came away thinking that the Iliad shares something in common with the Bhagavad Gita  The gods are intimately involved with the battles of men  and while I never saw the Iliad as a religious text  it was  and it is  and I think it should still be read that way   Endless descriptions of ships  soldiers  who came from where  who their families were  who killed whom  and in what matter    but I still love this book  Everyone with a love for the classics should read this  It doesn t run  as many would think  between the start of the Trojan War until the end  instead  it begins at Achilles  famous grudge against Agamemnon who stole his slave  until the burning of Hector  Priam s son  Some background knowledge is perhaps required  who is Paris and why did he steal Helen  why are the Greeks beseiging Troy  but otherwise it s perfectly readable   The Iliad was a poem  so it was probably very hard to translate into understandable English while still retaining that  Greek tragedy  feeling  but I think Robert Fagles  the translater  did a great job If you think you know the story just by watching  Troy  or any other films that try to convey what the story is really about  you couldn t be more wrong  Only the real thing can make you understand why this particular poem has been praised so much during the ages  I have read Homer before but reread it recently to rediscover the wonder of the Greeks and Trojans  Achilles  Agamemnon and Hector  It is a delight to wonder at the Gods and mortals and the role of fate in their enterprise  This mythic epic still speaks to us more than twenty five hundred years after it first began to be recited by the poet Homer  After withstanding the rage of Achilles  the Greeks go up against the Trojans led by Achilles friend Patroclus  But  fate has decreed and with Apollo s help Hector brings the final blow down on Patroclus  At this point you realize why this poem has been read for millenia and loved by many  But just as touching  perhaps more moving are moments like the one described in the epigraph above  For in the next book as Menelaus leads the Greeks to retrieve Patroclus body and the Trojans battle the Argives we are told of Achilles  horses who  wept from the time they had first sensed their driver s death    lines 493 4  p  456   This brings home the momentous occasion of Patroclus  death in a way that transcends the battle scenes and suggests it is the fabric of their life that has been rent   not just another battle death Achilles takes his fight to the Trojans as Book 21 of the Iliad begins with the Trojans routed  one half blocked by Hera with the other half  packed in the silver whirling river    line 9   Achilles slays Lycaon  son of Priam  and Asteropaeus  son of Pelegon  Then he goes after the Trojan s allies from Paeona  beating and hacking them  in a blur of kills   line 235   The blood of the men is so thick that the river rose  But Achilles proceeds to attack and fight the river itself  Continuing until the gods recognize that this cannot stay  Poseidon and Athena come to him and advise him   It s not your fate to be swallowed by a river    line 328   The gods take over from this point and the book chronicles the spectacle of battles among the gods  mirroring the battles of the men below  even through this the river remains a thread that cannot be forgotten  The Trojan s and Hector s days in particular are numbered from this point onward The final book of The Iliad begins with the games over and the armies scattered  but Achilles remains in grief over the death of his friend Patrocles  He slowly is persuaded that he must return Hector s body to Priam  Even as his mother Thetis mourns the future fate of her son who is also doomed to die  the gods gather and continue to argue over the situation  A rich tapestry woven with the strands of fate  divine capriciousness  and human agency  I could do without the gory battle details  but I suppose that s what you get when you sign up for the ancient equivalent of a Vietnam war movie           Pre read  I m going to finally come out of the  er  closet and admit that I have never read The Iliad cover to cover  though I  of course  read enough to make it seem like I had  The shame of it all is that I am the proud owner of a Classics degree      which  among other things  will grant me wealth enough to make even Croesus envious  fame

the Greek and Roman myths I really enjoyed reading it this time especially the capriciousness of the gods and how much of a jerk some of the heroes were  What I also found interesting is how it showed both sides of the war in a very even handed way showing the heroes on both sides     menin aeide thea Peleiadeo Akhileos     Que puedo decir yo que no se haya dicho a lo largo de mas de dos mil quinientos anos que se conoce la Iliada  Es la base de todo lo que se ha escrito despues y en este canto existen todos los conflictos a los que se enfrentarian las personas hasta hoy dia He de decir que los relatos belicos se me hacian dificiles de leer  sobre todo por la multitud de nombres  pero me he parado a leer a Aquiles  Andromaca  Hector  Patroclo  Agamenon    La parte mas humana  en total  Estamos sujetos a algo mayor  a los dioses   o a Paris Alejandro deiforme  que no se mantiene quieto en sus pantalones Aunque escribiera una resena durante dos anos  no le haria justicia  asi que me quedo mejor corta Tengo planes de releermela otra vez mas en el futuro  Con tres veces no se capta esta obra  la dureza de la violencia  No he leido descripciones belicas mas graficas  logrando que me llegaran los gritos de los aqueos a mis oidos  los llantos de Aquiles  al que he visto andar por la playa  tras el funeral de Patroclo  y las risas de los dioses   AAAAAAH   Un mes me llevo  pero que gran mi satisfaccion y dolor llegar hasta la ultima parte  los funerales de Hector  no es spoiler  es de tradicion oral del s  VIII a  C   asi pues  estoy cumpliendo una de mis tantas metas que es leer las principales obras de la humanidad que es de rigor leerlas y otra que es terminar los libros que me dejan en clases a tiempo   I loved it   Loved the introduction  Best Translation ever Review coming up I m just going to say it  Stephen Mitchell did for The Iliad what Seamus Heaney did for  Beowulf   Mitchell translated a text that had been rendered drily and tediously by other translators  and he breathed life into it  For the first time  I understood why this story survived millennia  This translation was among The New Yorker s best books of 2011  and maybe I missed the hullabaloo five years ago  but more people need to read this gorgeous epic To begin  the action is graphic and relentless  And quickly Peneleos sliced through his neckunder the ear  and the whole blade sank in  and onlya flap of skin kept the head attached  and it dangledto one side for a moment  and then he crumpled to earth   16 300 303 I mean  come on  that reads like a movie  A completely unrealistic  CGI d to the hilt movie It would have been easy for this poem to be reduced to a bloodbath  just a bunch of bronzed and bronzed armored men hacking each other to death on the coast of Anatolia  The reduction never happened  and that s where the relationship to a movie ended  Every death is a tragedy  Every description of a youth s departure from life is accompanied by a small tribute to the life that he lived  the parents that he leaves behind  the hopes he had for himself  his widow  The poet doesn t kill these warriors wantonly  for the sake of another cinematic death  he shows the price of glorious war These men are real  view spoiler  I feel genuine emotions for these people  The lot of women is unenviable  Helen and Andromache  the wives of Paris and Hector  have my sympathy  Helen is anguished by the decision to leave her Greek husband  causing the ten years of war  She is tortured by the goddess Aphrodite who forces her to have sex with her Trojan husband whom she no longer loves  Andromache lives with the dread of her husband s fate   I will have no comfort    only unending sorrow   I have no one else    6 417 418   The women know what will happen to Troy when the Greeks conquer  they and their children will be carried away as slaves  Achilles    I didn t care very much for Achilles  He is only slightly higher in my estimation than Paris  who is ridiculed by every Trojan as a good for nothing pretty boy  Achilles mopes for most of the poem because King Agamemnon took his slave woman  In retaliation  he refuses to help his fellow Greeks  God  what an emo kid  And then Patroclus is killed  and Achilles loses his mind  He is not  after all  the first man to have a friend die men have lost loved ones before  who were even closerthan this man was    a brother  perhaps  or a son and they wept and mourned for their dead  and then it was over since the Fates have put an enduring heart in mankind   24 38 43  The Song of Achilles is on my reading list  I wonder what that author will make of Achilles and Briseis  the slave woman who    we are led to believe    loves her master Where s Hector s book  Hector is the real hero of the war  Hector is the man all men should aspire to be  a loving husband and father  a good son  a brave soldier  In a world of Parises and Achilleses  my Hector stands apart   hide spoiler  More so than the treatment of women  slaves  and soldiers  the bonds of kinship and host duties are central to this story  Understanding them is key to understanding the story  and Mitchell s introduction helps The concept of the host guest bond is strange to our modern society  A ten year war because a man s guest stole from him  That is  um  extreme   Our modern inability to comprehend the sacred bond leads many preachers to say the sin of Sodom was homosexuality  It wasn t  The reflections on kinship and Greek proprieties made me feel like an anthropologist studying the Greeks  It s fascinating  I loved being thrust into this world   When I was in High School  my favorite teacher  Paul Petrianos had us read this  It started me on an obsession with epic poetry  I still remember him pounding on desks  having us stand on our chairs to recite bits  and taking us off campus for coffee and used book store shopping at Stanford to inspire us to go to college  He was part of my inspiration to become a high school teacher  I was really surprised to find this a really great story  I ve put it off for so long because I expected it to be dry and boring  but now I see why it has survived the Millennia  True  you have to wade through a lot of detailed death descriptions  and a lot of difficult to read names  but that was only reminiscent of watching the Lord of the Rings or the Hobbit  Within the setting of war and gods and heroes is a skillfully weaved and engaging story of very human characters  and a very moving and convincing portrayal of fear  anger  horror of war  and the grief of bereaved wives  parents  and comrades  It was very impressive how the author was able to coordinate the interactions of the gods and the heroes in a single coherent plot  how characters on both sides of the conflict were well developed  and how the faults and virtues of both sides were delved into very honestly  From a theological perspective  the Iliad gives a very helpful perspective on the pagan mindset  It is easy to see how the mythology is sort of a piecemeal attempt to answer the seemingly conflicting experiences of life  why does it seem like sometimes our prayers are answered and sometimes not  Why does it seem like sometimes life goes the way we think it should  or that justice prevails  and sometimes it does not  Why does it seem sometimes like events converge  and sometimes they seem random  The answer from the Iliad is a complex web of various and conflicting causations  a  Extraordinary human effort is sometimes sufficient to thwart the will of the gods  b  There are many gods  each of whom have their own will  Sometimes their will is based on the merit of the human being supported  but most often it is based on petty allegiances  jealousies  petty personal offenses  and a view of sacrifice that is very close to bribery  c  The gods are not omniscient and omnipresent  so sometimes events are due to a lack of involvement  either because Zeus is prohibiting involvement for his own purposes  or because the gods simply aren t interested  or because they are distracted for some reason  Even almighty Zeus himself can be distracted or manipulated by humans or the gods  especially his wife Hera   d  Even Zeus himself ultimately appeals to Fate for his decisions  At the end of the day  this ultimate appeal to impersonal fate  and the chaotic  internally inconsistent and easily distracted nature of the gods brings Greek paganism at its core to atheism  This is a sharp contrast to the Biblical view of God  who is  one   that is  unconflicted  within himself  God s love of mankind is universal  but sin  actions and attitudes that conflict with the image of God in which humans are made  becomes the only hindrance to man s relationship with God  God is perfect  and perfectly sovereign  and the seeming inconsistencies of life need to be reconciled to that reality  Even when events seem unfair or chaotic  God is still in control and is worthy of a trust that sees beyond the immediate circumstances  Sacrifice is a recognition of human sinfulness and the consequence of death that sinfulness brings  and that God himself is the ultimate provider for man s need of forgiveness and justice  Abraham says   God himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offering  my son   Genesis 22   and God provides Jesus as the sacrifice who takes the punishment on Himself for the sins of mankind  E g   Isaiah 53  John 3   We see some interesting consequences of the impersonality of fate  versus the personality God  God is personal  and therefore subject to his own personal attributes  such as love  justice  goodness  etc   and is therefore predictable  in that He will always act consistently with those attributes  and therefore is a sufficient object of trust  Fate is impersonal  and has no personal attributes  and is therefore completely unpredictable  The worldview of the Iliad  consequently  has ultimately no place for trust in anyone or anything outside of oneself  The ultimate conclusion of the Iliad is one of great despair  with the recognition that the gods  who are conceived of as being in the image of humans  are worse than humans  and the cause of human suffering  In contrast  in biblical theology humans are in the image of God  but the cause of our suffering is human deviation from that image  sin   Hope is possible because God remains faithful to His nature and will ultimately provide for justice and forgiveness  two seemingly irreconcilable concepts that are reconciled in the sacrifice of the Messiah

khld Ht  yfqd lbshr Hsshm bljml w yfqdw  nfshm  It s amazing that a book this old still has tremendous appeal  I liked it even better this time than the last time I read it  What an amazing  thrilling story  I had never read the Iliad in its entirety  And this translation by Robert Fagles  supposedly one of the best  was outstanding  This story had everything in it  love  honor  pathos  humor  And it s all set among a brutal  violent war between the Greeks and their allies against the city of Troy and its allies  I knew all the main characters  Achilles  Ajax  the two of them    Paris  Helen  whose kidnapping by Paris started the war   Agamemnon  King of the Greeks   Priam  King of the Trojans   Odysseus and of course  the Trojan hero Hector  But I never knew of their relationships with each other  This was a rousing epic  And now I cannot wait to read the sequel  The Odyssey  Was he  or was not he  That is the Homeric question  There s no horse  Recuerdo cuando lei la primera vez la Iliada  era un libro de apenas cientos de hojas  entretenidisimo que lo lei en un par de dias  Pero luego supe que el libro en verdad era mas extenso y fue la primera vez que compre una obra literaria con mi propio dinero  recuerdo que me costo muy caro para mi pues era un colegial  pero cuando lo tuve en manos bien supe que valio la pena  Me introdujo directamente en el mundo de la mitologia griega pues su relato aunque extenso no me fue para nada aburrido  claro esta me encanta los asuntos militares y no me aburri en ningun momento  todo ello aderezado con los mitos que se cuentan y que son una fuente importantisima en la mitologia griega por la gran cantidad de informacion que proporciona Es increible la cantidad de personajes tanto principales como secundarios que puede manejar Homero en sus relatos  y asi la Iliada es un conjunto de guerras  amores  desamores  traiciones  cobardias  pasiones  ambiciones todo ello entre una pugna de dioses y hombres no solo en el sentido mismo de la guerra sino tambien en el de la humanidad y la gloria  It s the Iliad  so of course it is broadly fantastic  It s been a while since I ve read it cover to cover  but there are salient features which stick out  at least in Lattimore s translation   the way  in Book 9  Athene describes helping Herakles as if it was just a chore her dad made her do  the characters of Andromache and Helen  even though they aren t in it that much  the odiousness of Alexandros Paris  and especially the fact that Helen  Hektor  and Priam know it  the fact that Odysseus is one of the most fondly thought of ancient Homeric heroes in modern times  but he still beats up a guy for suggesting he treat his troops well and says ugly people can t have feelings  the build up to Hektor s death from the death of Patroklos  Book 16 aside  I was less impressed with the build up to Patroklos  death   but especially the moment after he has died when Achilleus strips the body  before the Achaians stab at it  and he drags it back to the camp  Book 24  in its entirety  There are  it must be said  a lot of books that are just killing  Books 11 15 felt kind of unremarkable   which one hopes wouldn t put off the casual reader too much   if the casual reader got past the Catalogue of Ships in Book 2  of course  Lattimore s translation is certainly one of the best that I ve read  although I haven t read many so that is not an unequivocal endorsement  Truth be told I have always been intimidated by Homer s Iliad  Somehow I had dodged it in my undergraduate studies but always regretted it  The Iliad was just so damn old and revered I dreaded tackling the thing  Homer was a mad Bronze Age prophet invoking muses and gods to wreak havoc on the lives of poor mortals  I finally set my mind to read The Iliad but decided I would need help to make sense of the references to myths  city states  islands  gods  goddesses  and various Greek and Trojan heroes  Much as the Turks cast massive cannons to breach the mighty walls of Constantinople  I purchased the following resources to aid me in my reading of The Iliad  First I chose Richmond Lattimore s translation of the text  There are strong opinions on which translation of The Iliad to read  I was shooting for the most technically accurate and academic translation available  which Lattimore s appears to be  Also I felt Lattimore did an excellent job capturing Homer s narrative structure and poetic ethos  To supplement Lattimore s translation I bought Malcom M  Willcok s A Companion to The Iliad  Based on the Translation by Richmond Lattimore which was an extremely helpful line by line reference guide to the text  To provide more depth to the entire endeavor I also purchased Professor Elizabeth Vandiver s lecture series The Iliad of Homer  Professor Vandiver s lectures fleshed out ancient Greek culture  notions of  Glory  and  Honor   and the nature of the Greek gods in relationship to their mortal counterparts  Additionally Vandiver s lectures helped frame The Iliad as literature  I picked up a copy of Cliff Notes The  Iliad  to help with character and chapter summaries as I was reading the text and provide some plot analysis  Finally  I used a copy of The Oxford Dictionary of Classical Myth and Religion to run down more obscure references that were not fully elaborated by Willcok s notations  So the question is was it worth all of this hassle to read and appreciate Homer s Iliad I would say yes  I once had a professor make the assertion that Western European culture was founded on two books  the Bible and The Iliad  That statement had always intrigued me  The Iliad is one of those books you just can t get away from  it is constantly referenced in history and literature  I like to read so it always irked me when some author  reporter  or historian would throw in a knowing reference to The Iliad as a kind of gauntlet to her readership  It is empowering to have read the thing and now know those references  So gentle reader  I would encourage you to read and enjoy one of history s greatest books  Or as Homer might say to you Glorious Reader  god like  henchmen of Ares  breaker of horses  Stride out in front of the army  shaking a javelin in each fist  and make your spearcast  May you strike The Iliad in the chest two inches from the nipple So that the death mist cover that book s eyes And it fall to the ground  its armor clattering thunderously upon it   Rapturous             not only with Robert Fagles s luminous translation  but also with Bernard Knox s textual analysis and endnotes  This is THE founding story of the  Western  world and this version rocks with epic tragedy  gorgeous smilies  colorful epithets  graphic gore  and flowing theatricality  Humanity really hasn t changed much in 3000 years  This work has been analyzed ad nasueam since the Renaissance  so I won t go into it  Getting my right arm completely tattooed with imagery from this text though  and the artist is currently working on pencil drawings with beautiful fervor  At last when young Dawn with her rose red fingers shone once more the people massed around illustrious Hector s pyre      And once they d gathered  crowding the meeting grounds they first put out the fires with glistening wine wherever the flames still burned in all their fury Then they collected the white bones of Hector   all his brothers  his friends at arms  mourning and warm tears came streaming down their cheeks They placed the bones they found in a golden chest shrouding them round and round in soft purple cloths They quickly lowered the chest in a deep  hollow graveand over it piled a cope of huge stones closely set then hastily heaped a barrow  posted lookouts all aroundfor fear the Achaean combat troops would launch their attackbefore the time agreed  And once they d heaped the moundthey turned back home to Troy  and gathering once againthey shared a splendid funereal feast in hector s honor held in the house of Priam  king by will of Zeus And so the Trojans buried Hector breaker of horses   Homer s poems are doubtlessly masterpieces that everybody should read at least once in their life  Of course  it is everything but an easy read  it s highly lyrical poetry after all  and it is the expression of times long past   it has the prerogative of being a bit complicated  We all have heard about it  the general lines of the  plot  are very well known  the siege of the city of Troy by the Acheans united under Agamemnon  supposedly to retrive Helen  Queen of Sparta and wife to Menelaus  from the clutches of Paris  son of King Priam of Troy  Historically  this might have been an excuse to expand the Greek dominion  but that wouldn t have made such an epic impression as the honorable union of Kings and Princes to the rescue of a damsel in  apparent from the Greek point of view  but not so sure  distress But lovestory and reason of 10 years of war aside  there s characters such as Achilles that have fascinated readers and scholars  and me  ever since  The hinted and veiled homosexual  supposed  affair with Patroclus is an element that echoes through time and following literary works  including Virgil s classical masterpiece of a poem  The Eneid  where a similar friendship is even so briefly depicted  But there s so much more to Achilles  the man but especially the hero Of course then there s cunning Odysseus thanks to whom Troy eventually falls  I think the words Troian Horse should be no spoiler  and who gets a  sequel  all to his own  He s Nobody after all  So many mythological elements  so many godly and heroic characters  you can t but be sucked into this never dying masterpiece   When you reread a classic  you do not see more in the book than you did before  you see more in you than there was before     Clifton FadimanI find that every re reading of a classic proves the truth of this statement to me  No exception here in Homer s breathtaking depths of brokenness and heights of beauty  Achilleus grasp of the nature of bitterness   gall of anger  that swarmeth like smoke inside a man s heart and becomes a thing sweeter than honey    XVIII 109 110   As when in the sky the stars about the moon s shiningare seen in all their glory  when the air has fallen to stillness and all the high places of the hills are clear  and the shoulders out jutting and the deep ravines  as endless bright air spills from the heavensand all the stars are seen  to make glad the heart of the shepherd         VIII 555 559 I do love Lattimore s translation which keeps the beauty of the Greek poetic meter and wording  I have tried others  but keep coming back to this one  I felt that the first two thirds of this book were akin to pushing a boulder up a hill  the last third was the devastating and inexorable downward tumble  The Iliad details a period of several months towards the end of the ten year long Trojan War  It begins with the  rage of Achilles  towards Agamemnon  who deprived Achilles of his most treasured war prize  the woman Briseis  Achilles withdraws to his ship and refuses to fight  He calls upon his mother  the nereid Thetis  and prays that the Achaeans be crushed by the Trojans so that Agamemnon learns how wrong he was to disgrace Achilles  His prayer is granted  but the old platitude holds  be careful what you wish for  Needless to say  the poem is forceful and violent  but it also appeals to our sense of compassion and pity  Death is everywhere  yet there are no anonymous  faceless masses  it is made clear that each slaughtered man had a family  a story  and a life  It can become somewhat tedious to read so many of these descriptions  hence the uphill pushing of a boulder   but it reminds us that the business of war is the gory foreshortening of lives  regardless of whether we care to know the details or not  The many scenes of carnage also coexist with some lovely  touching passages  Andromache s conversation with Hector  Phoenix pleading with Achilles  and Hephaestus forging the shield are a few that come to mind  The event that finally compels Achilles to return to battle causes the story to gain momentum  it s quite a page turner  As it builds  Achilles finally reaches a level of maturity that allows him to appreciate his own humanity  as well as the humanity of those he s fighting  To me  Achilles s struggle with pride and grief is just as compelling and important as the larger struggle between the Greeks and Trojans   I didnt read this because its seen as important classic epic poem in Western Literature but because i thought it was imporant for any reader who likes classic literature around the world  Having experienced the whole poem  its complex story quality  brilliant poetry im thinking its amazing that there was a human who wrote this thousands of years ago  The poems topic of life and death and male heroism is traditional but immensly powerful  Its hard to read from todays POV a story that is full of pointless war  male honor being so imporant but Homer does it so well to show the futility of war and the contrast of life and death  Its not gloriying the war because there is respect for human life  there is no difference between the Greeks  the Troyans  They share the same Gods  the same fear of death  Homer made it almost too real for me the story  its people  It was hard to read the detailed realism of the war  showing the characters history before they are destroyed by their destiny and the horrific Gods  The Swedish scholar who wrote introduction to my copy said the scenes with the Gods in mount Olympus was respite from the war and it was mentally more lighter to read about petty Gods that fighting between and rest life and death theme The most impressive part of the poem is easily the imagary and the many methapors  There were so many pages of painting everything in the world in poetic descriptions  Some literary scholars who think the oral tradition history of the poem is important overlook it seems the clear signs of the writer showing literary techniques of writing down the right words  the vivid descriptions of everything  The poetic language itself is worth reading every word in this book even if you are not interested in the legendary war of Troy and its legendary heroes  There was never a dull page even in the slower parts  there was always a turn of words that made the never ending war scenes really easy  wonderful read  I have to also praise the translator Ingvar Bjorkeson  This is a Swedish translation from 2000 that is much better  kinder to Homer than the first two translations that was in 1900s  The first one was terrible and made me relize the imporance of finding the best translation of this poem Will be interesting to see if The Odyssey is as poetically rich and as powerful as The Iliad  This is a wonderful version translation of Homer s epic poem about the battle for Troy  it is filled with example after example of humans doing things as a result of manipulation by the gods or other external forces  and yet believing that they have some control over their own destiny  The entire story  concluding with the sacking of Troy  begins with a fit of jealousy and envy among the gods  And humans are the ones to suffer from the gods  weaknesses  Robert Fagles  translation is a fine read  the Introduction by Bernard Knox is illuminating and itself a welcome bit of reading The background  briefly  for the poem  Hera  wife of Zeus   Aphrodite  and Athena entered a contest to see which of the three was most beautiful  As a judge  they called upon Paris  a wondrously handsome shepherd who was also the son of Priam  King of Troy  Zeus refused to serve as judge for fear of becoming embroiled in a nasty fight as the losers would make his life miserable    Hera promised Paris power and riches if he chose her  Athena offered the prize of glory and renown in war  Aphrodite swore that he would earn the fairest woman of all in love if he accorded her the honor  Paris ultimately selected Aphrodite  In return  she conspired for him to take Helen  wife of Menelaus  as his own bride  Paris and Helen fled to Troy  Since Helen s beauty had attracted so many great kings and warriors in Greece  her suitors vowed that if any tried to take her away from her choice as husband  in this case  Menelaus  they would weld their might together to retrieve her  Thus  when Paris fled to Troy with Helen  a great force was pulled together  featuring Menelaus  his brother Agamemnon  Achilles  Diomedes  Odysseus  Ajax  and other worthy figures  Thus commenced the awful ten year slaughter that Homer describes so well  A direct result of humans being caught up in a spat among three goddesses  And  of course  once the battle was joined  Aphrodite used her powers to help the Trojans and Athena and Hera tried to influence the struggle in favor of the vast besieging army  led by Agamemnon  The Iliad begins with a crisis occurring after nine years of warfare  a crisis that has considerable consequences  And its root is in Apollo s anger with Agamemnon  the leader of the Greek forces and their allies   Rage  Goddess  sing the rage of Peleus  son Achilles  Murderous  doomed  that cost the Achaeans countless losses  hurling down to the House of Death so many souls        Begin  Muse  when the two first broke and clashed  Agamemnon lord of men and brilliant Achilles   Why the conflict between two important Greek leaders  The priest Chryses  who worshipped Apollo  came to Agememnon and asked him for his daughter  who had been seized as part of Agamemnon s plunder  The priest was willing to pay a handsome ransom  but Agamemnon refused        incensed at the king  Apollo   swept a fatal plague through the army  men were dying and all because Agamemnon spurned Apollo s priest   After much suffering by the Greek forces  Agamemnon relented and gave up Chryses  daughter  However  to replace her  he demanded that Achilles give up the beautiful Briseis  one of the latter s prizes from the war  This led to a rupture between the two  Achilles sat out some of the fighting in anger at Agamemnon s taking of Briseis  Without one of their fiercest warriors  the invaders suffered major casualties  In this instance  we see  once more  the gods at work  affecting human decisions and outcomes  Apollo s anger at Agamemnon  in the end  led many Greeks to die who otherwise might well have lived had not Achilles withdrawn  At another point  a truce has been declared by the combatants  Hera and Athena  with their hatred of Troy unabated  sabotaged the truce  Athena flew to earth and found the heralded Trojan archer Pandarus  Homer says that       Athena fired the fool s heart inside him   She spoke to him thus    Here s glory  son of Lycaon  let me tempt you  you with your archer s skill  Have you the daring to wing an arrow at Menelaus  Just think what thanks what fame you d win in the eyes of all the Trojans          Speaking to his pride  Athena tempted Pandarus into firing the arrow  wounding Menelaus  but not fatally   and causing the truce to end and battle to begin once more  Again  the gods influence human behavior when the actors themselves believe that they are in control of their actions  A metaphor for the hubris of humans  thinking that they control the fates   Why did it take me nigh on forty years to get around to reading what is  in essence  one of the great foundation texts of western civilisation  Of course I knew the story    who has not imbibed these heroic exploits through countless different mediums  from comics and cartoons through to games and films  And yet I d always put off visiting the source  though it has sat on my shelf for long enough When I first considered tackling The Iliad I cast around for a suitable translation  I was chary of starting an epic poem  since I had little experience of the form  and toyed with reading E V Rieu s prose version for Penguin  But then I read an article which said that to properly experience Homer it has to be poetry or nothing  so after several months of loitering in bookshops  reading different versions of the famous opening stanza I made a decision and started Robert Fagles  version I was surprised  Surprised to be actually enjoying a text that if I m completely honest I d considered more a worthwhile chore than a pleasure  Surprised at how naturally Fagles verse seemed to flow  and most of all  surprised at how easy it was to picture the lines being declaimed before a rapt audience Though I was familiar with the plot of the Iliad  what hadn t been absorbed from all those bowdlerised childhood versions was the sheer tragedy of this story  If war is indeed hell then Homer is one of the earliest extant authors to point this out  People die in The Iliad  die by the score  gasping out their lives in the Anatolian dust  But no consolation in Homer s world  No  a pen portrait is all they are owed  of happiness far away in the arms of loved ones before they are dragged  kicking and screaming from this world as the black mist closes their eyes The greater subtext of the story eludes me  Is it about predetermination  Characters frequently invoke the judgement of the Gods to excuse or explain their behaviour  Yet often people seem to make their own decisions despite heavenly authority  suggesting human nature can yet transcend our baser instincts  This would seem to be the case with Achilles  the hero whose rage encompasses this whole story  His motivations throughout can be seen as entirely selfish  yet at the end he appears to be approaching a kind of redemption  His meeting with the Trojan King Priam at the close of the poem  though still divinely ordained  nevertheless hints at a burgeoning sense of the futility of war  and a belated flowering of empathy The close of the story is somewhat elliptical  Little is resolved  The war goes on  Much is foreshadowed  but we are denied witness to the end of the siege  We keep company with Achilles  chastened  thoughtful but ready to fight on to his inevitable death  Meanwhile  behind the mighty walls of Troy  Hector  magnificent breaker of horses  is laid to rest  Reading The Iliad was an enjoyable experience for me  but I finished it feeling that I had missed something This translation was excellent  in that it was easy for me to read and understand  I appreciated the notes in the introduction  and I felt that the poetry flowed well I was already familiar with the story of the Trojan War  and was surprised to find that The Iliad ends before the most famous episode of that war   the Trojan Horse  It is primarily composed of battles and speeches The Iliad is a very violent book  with graphic descriptions of death in hand to hand combat  I wonder if the listeners in ancient Greece were excited by these episodes  For me  they definitely stripped the glory off of war  It s an ugly  nasty business The enjoyable part of reading this book was the notion of being in contact with a piece of literature that is thousands of years old  I also have enjoyed the stories of mythology since I was young  so reading original source material for some of those stories was great On the other hand  the actions of the gods often left me baffled  While often their motivations were obvious   petty jealousies mostly   at other times I just didn t get it Also  the lack of character growth was disappointing for me  Homer writes about a lot of larger than life characters who are seriously lacking in character  With very few exceptions  most of the Greek and Trojan heroes are not heroic in any area of their life outside of their martial skills  For example  Agamemnon doesn t change at all  even when it s obvious he s in the wrong  Even Achilles  change of heart at the end seemed only temporary  There just doesn t seem to be an insight into humanity here that I would hope for in great literature I wouldn t dispute that The Iliad is great literature  but I didn t connect with it in a way that I expected to connect to something so acclaimed  I plan to read The Odyssey in the future  and I wonder if I will feel the same  So I started reading the E  V  Rieu translation of the Iliad and it lacked the lyrical quality of Fagles work that I remembered from the Odyssey  Too stuffy and proper  two things which should never even be associated with the Iliad After reading the Fagles translation I say this  Fagles rocks  seriously  His Iliad is like a shot of pure testosterone and adrenaline straight in the jugular Gotta say though  Homer s giving backgrounds for just about everybody fighting on both sides made me sympathize with the Trojans  And Hector  To me  Hector is the true hero  he s trying to save his city from being destroyed  he s a new father  and he s bad ass  While Achilles is throwing a temper tantrum and jamming on the lyre in his tent Hector is out there  manning up  saving Troy  I felt sad when he died  I really did  and there was that terrible sense of dreadful inexorability to it  Hector running for his life  and how   while Achilles chases him down  You know he won t win  you know he ll die  but you want him to win  Sure  Hector may act like an arrogant guy through parts of the book but he s fighting for the one of the noblest of causes  for home and for family This  what did you think   turned into a lot of Hector love  Oh well  he s the best Oh yeah  side note  Paris is a self centered douche  I don t care if I m not allowed to say that on goodreads  it s the truth  I m reading a collection of books called the   Great Books of the Western World   door to door salesmen used to sell these hardcover sets door to door in the 50s  Most sets end up as furnishings for a den  I dusted my grandparents set off and I found them quite interesting  they represent the progression of thought in the western hemisphere in the last 3000 years  homer   plato  euclid   dante  mantainge   shakespeare   gallileo   Newton   Lock   swif   Smith   Goethe   Darwin   Freud   and many many more  Reading the whole set is a serious task and it will be challenging  but I m hungry for more  I think the idea of a Liberal Education is great  and being an engineer I feel a little deprived of this sort of stuff The Iliad was the first book of the set I mentioned  I thought the translation was great  This is one of the most violent books I ve read  I bet the makers of movies like 300 gained inspiration for the limb severing  torso piercing  slow motion bloody detail from books like these  There were many courageous acts in this book  One tender moment at the end when Achilles cries with king Priam nearly brought tears to my eyes The gods are more of an elite class of human and I found it humorous sometimes when seeing them bicker among one another No Trojan horse  I feel like I ve been lied to for my entire life  I read through this book to find out that the Trojan horse is not even mentioned The whole time I kept telling myself   maybe next chapter  no   mabye next  huh    its getting pretty close to the end  Oh well I guess that goes to show that one should approach books without expectations  This is my review of Robert Fitzgerald s translation  1974  of Homer s The Iliad  This makes the third translation of The Iliad that I ve read over the past year or so  and I quite liked it  While Fitzgerald s translation is perhaps not as rhythmically poetic as that of Robert Fagles  1990   or perhaps as ruthlessly faithful to the Greek text as Richmond Lattimore s verse translation  1951   it really is incredibly lyrical and reads very  very well  The Iliad is one of the greatest works of literature of all time  and this translation stands up tall with the best of them  in my opinion I think what I really came to love the most about Fitzgerald s blank verse translation was that he doesn t waste any words  It is spare and remarkably hard hitting  but still maintains a rugged and distinctly powerful lyricism  You can almost feel the  tramp  of marching feet and the reverberation of bronze swords crashing against ox hide shields  or hear the  thrum  of bow strings snapping as they launch arrows into the sky  It is visceral and living poetry that Fitzgerald has assembled and presented in his translation  Of course  I can t read the original Greek text and I can t judge if his translation fully captures and incorporates the essence of those ancient words  but I can tell you that this text is compelling and enthralling from the get go One of my favorite examples of the eloquence and pathos of Fitzgerald s translation is in Book 24  near the end of the poem  when Akhilleus and Priam meet late at night  and Akhilleus says to the King   Come  then  and sit down We ll probe our wounds no more but let them rest though grief lies heavy on us  Tears heal nothing drying so stiff and cold  This is the waythe gods ordained the destiny of men to bear such burdens in our lives  while theyfeel no affliction  At the door of Zeusare those two urns of good and evil giftsthat he may choose for us  and one for whomthe lightning s joyous king dips in both urnswill have by turns bad luck and good  That small section has always very powerfully affected me  and I have come to realize that young Akhilleus is an amazingly mature and astute man  wise well beyond his years Personally  I am of the opinion that Fitzgerald s translation is a very comfortable fit for a modern reader in our modern time who is reading an epic poem of nearly 16 000 lines that was first written down nearly three millenia in the past  but may well have existed in the oral tradition a thousand years before that  I think what I m really trying to say is that Fitzgerald has crafted an interpretation of the poem that flows with regularity and dignity  and is very respectful of Homer and his legacy  In so doing  Fitzgerald has not simply made his blank verse contemporary  nor has he erred and slipped into sounding stilted  archaic or pedantic  This translation is a good one  a very good  and one that I highly and unhesitatingly recommend  Read it  savor it  speak and hear it  and most of all  just enjoy it  This review is associated with Stephen Mitchell s translation of The Iliad  Free Press  2011   Maybe Stephen Mitchell answers the question of  Why we should read the Iliad   best in the  Introduction  to his new translation of this epic poem   We return to the Iliad because it is one of the monuments of our own magnificence   Its poetry lifts even the most devastating human events into the realm of the beautiful  and it shows us how vast and serene the mind can be even when it contemplates the horrors of war  Frankly  I m not sure that I ve ever before encountered such an eloquent or concise description of the relevance and true value of this great literary work to Humankind Some might say   Do we really need another translation of the Iliad    I think the pertinent response to the question should be   If the new translation advances our appreciation for Homer and deepens our understanding of the story he was attempting to tell and its impact on our lives today  then bring it on    This is  in my opinion  precisely what Stephen Mitchell has done with his new translation of The Iliad Mitchell s translation is based upon a re working of the original Greek text by the scholar  Martin L  West   West identified sections in the text that he classified as  probable interpolations by other rhapsodes  that were spliced into the poem over the decades and centuries after it was written down   A  rhapsode  is the term for the classical Greek professional performer of epic poetry  i e   kind of like a bard of the middle ages  and they were apparently common in the fifth and fourth centuries B C E   and perhaps even earlier   West and other scholars believe that what happened was that as the poem was recounted  time and time again  modifications and adaptations were made  and that some of these were ultimately transcribed and included in the Greek text that has been handed down over the ages   That this likely occurred is not particularly surprising to me  given that the Homeric tradition really was an oral tradition   Stories told over time and by different story tellers are quite likely to end up being somewhat different So  based upon West s work  Mitchell decided to omit these interpolated sections from his translation   This has resulted in a translation that excludes something like 1 200 1 300 lines from a poem of approximately 16 000 lines  or just under ten percent  The most noticeable deletion is Book 10   The Doloneia   which recounts the night time raid by Odysseus and Diomedes into the Trojan camp   The great majority of scholars confidently acknowledge that Book 10 was a later addition to the poem   About his translation  Mitchell says   I am under no illusion that I have translated the original text of the Iliad  as written or dictated by the anonymous poet called Homer  just the most intelligent attempt we have at getting back to an original  and a text that I could use as the basis for the most intense possible poetic experience in English  Personally  I think Mitchell has succeeded in creating a beautifully spare  but powerfully compelling poem that seems to sing to the reader as though it had been originally composed in English Mitchell has generally utilized an iambic five beat line as his meter   In contrast with the earlier translations of Lattimore  six beat   or Fagles  six  or seven beat lines   Mitchell s poetry seems rhythmically cleaner and more lyrical   In many respects  I think that what Mitchell has achieved is somewhat akin to the translation of Stanley Lombardo that endeavors to restore the Iliad to its proper place in the oral tradition   In other words  Mitchell s translation  like Lombardo s  begs to be read aloud   I am not saying that Mitchell s translation is better than those of Fagles  Lattimore  or Fitzgerald   No  I am simply saying that it is noticeably different  and that I believe that this will aesthetically appeal to some readers   Toward this end  I am going to provide an example by comparing a passage from the translation by Robert Fagles  1990   and then the same passage from Mitchell s translation  and you can be the judge of which you prefer   The section I have selected is from the latter portion of Book 24  the last book of the Iliad  and describes the return to Troy of Priam as he accompanies the body of his slain son  Hector   First  the Fagles  translation   Once they reached the ford where the river runs clear the strong  whirling Xanthus sprung of immortal Zeus Hermes went his way to the steep heights of Olympusas Dawn flung out her golden robe across the earth and the two men  weeping  groaning  drove the teamtoward Troy and the mules brought on the body No one saw them at first  neither man nor woman none before Cassandra  golden as goddess Aphrodite She had climbed to Pergamus heights and from that pointshe saw her beloved father swaying tall in the chariot flanked by the herald  whose cry could rouse the city And Cassandra saw him too   drawn by the mules and stretched out on his bier She screamed and her scream rang out through all Troy  Come  look down  you men of Troy  you Trojan women Behold Hector now  if you ever once rejoicedto see him striding home  home alive from battle He was the greatest joy of Troy and all our people   Fagles  Book 24  Lines 813 830 And now the same passage from Mitchell s translation   And when they came to the ford of the swirling Xanthus Hermes left them and went to Olympus  as dawnwas spreading its saffron glow over all the earth With groaning and lamentation they drove the horseson toward Troy  and the mule cart carried the body No one saw them at first  neither man nor woman But Cassandra  who was as lovely as Aphrodite from the top of Pergamus caught sight of her fathercoming to Troy in the chariot   then the herald   and then she saw him  on a pallet inside the mule cart She let out a scream and shouted to the whole city  Come and see Hector  you men and women of Troy if you ever were glad to see him return from the war so great a joy he was to our city and people    Mitchell  Book 24  Lines 686 699 Personally  I think Mitchell s crafting of those lines is the more poetic  at any rate  it is poetry that has been structurally organized that very much appeals to me on an emotional and intellectual level   For example  Fagles describes the coming dawn of the morning with   Dawn flung out her golden robe across the earth which  while a wonderful metaphor  is perhaps a bit formal and somewhat abstract   In contrast  Mitchell keeps it simple and natural with   as dawn was spreading its saffron glow over all the earth Now that is a sunrise that I can see in my mind s eye  the  saffron colored  low angled light of the rising sun   This makes me think of beautiful sunrises that I ve actually seen  and then I realize that this beautiful early morning light is actually illuminating and coloring a scene of profound sadness and grief  a father bringing his dead son home   That is the power of great poetry  in my humble opinion In conclusion  this was a powerful and very impressive interpretation  and one that I look forward to carefully reading again and doing more side by side comparisons with the other translations that I own and cherish   For me  I guess what it comes down to is that I m not sure that there is any such thing as a bad translation of The Iliad  it is just that some are better than others   Stephen Mitchell s translation is one of the better ones  It gets a solid five stars from me  and I highly recommend reading it Postscript  My wife and I attended a reading and book signing at Vroman s Bookstore in Pasadena  California  on November 5  2011  Mr  Mitchell did three readings from his translation   1  the meeting between Hector and Andromache  in Book 6    2  the description of the new shield that Hephaestus made for Achilles  in Book 18   and  3  the meeting between Priam and Achilles  in Book 24   It was incredibly moving to hear these three sections read aloud  and even better that it was by Mitchell  himself  He followed up the readings with a lengthy question and answer session  Of course  I ended up buying another copy and having him inscribe it for me on the title page  And this book would be another of the one s that I would give away to Goodwill  another casuality of my desire to shed some weight before moving  I suppose my decision to give it away has more to do with my desire to give away books that I will never feasibly read again rather than anything I have personally against the book  What really made me like this book  Perhaps my connection with the book is not so obvious  after all  it s not even really a book in the classical sense  It s a poem that has been recited and passed down over some 3 000 years  It s history transformed by literary tactic  politics  and the desires of an audience  What made me really enjoy this book is the lectures one of my professors John Paul Russo gave about this book  He had a way of really bringing to life the heroic elements of the book  I loved  for example  his explanation of Achilles as the first  anti hero   Wow  What an insight  Is there a connection between Spud Spicolli from Fast Times at Ridgemont High and Achilles  Was Achilles telling Agamemnon to cram it similar to good old Mr  Spicolli telling Mr  Hand to take it easy There is quite a lot to love about this book  but I think the book only really works these days if you have someone well versed in the history guiding you through it  For one of the first literary masterpieces  its characters are surprisingly complex  the landscapes very vivid  and the political and historical implications very profound  but you need someone to open these aspects up to you before you can really enjoy the book  I just hope whoever ends up with my copy of the book enjoys the experience as much as I did   this book has it all  every character is a badass  the descriptions of violence are extreme  brutal  and frequent  plus it has some of the most epic  naturally  shittalking i ve read  it is truly mindblowing that there hasn t been a good film adaptation of this yet  as far as i know  troy is the only adaptation filmed  and i will never watch that  allow me to digress for a moment and say that the day that movie came out i probably should have went to see it with the rest of my roommates considering the sequence of events that i chose led to me having a run in with new brunswick law enforcement that wound up costing me nearly two thousand dollars  but still  this got universally panned  i was reading a review of it on imdb and one dude who claims to be a professor in the classics defends the movie and one of his arguments was that the iliad wasn t  historically accurate  itself  no shit sherlock  i m pretty sure thats obvious from the first couple sentences considering that zeus isn t real  and that people haven t thought he was real in like two thousand years  well  i will concede that a few people still think he s real  but those people probably have pony tails and spend most of their time naked in the woods while reading dungeons and dragons monster manuals  so their opinion doesn t count for shit  the point is  if you re going to make a good movie out of something like this  why fuck with the story  the gods were an integral part of the tale and their removal would make no sense  it really blows my mind how lame hollywood is sometimes  someone should get hbo on the horn and have them do a tv series where they dedicate a full hour episode to each book  that would be awesomeand while i m digressing and going off on unrelated tangents to how sweet this book actually is  let me ask the two people who will actually read this the following question   series of questions  in doing a bit of poking around on the internet  it appears that there were six other epics in the trojan cycle aside from the iliad and odyseey  but all were lost aside from various sentences fragments here and there  our knowledge of the existance of this epics comes from a summary of them written by some dude named proclus  of course  reading a 1 2 paragraph summary of entire epics can be pretty boring  have any authors since then tried to fill in the gaps using extant legends  text  etc  i d be more interested in something that keeps in the same style that the greeks used  but wouldn t be entirely opposed to a more  modern  re interpretation as long as it doesn t go too overboard in certain stylistic elements This is a fantastic translation of the Iliad and what I loved the most about it  NO FOOTNOTES  NO ENDNOTES and NO GODDAMN 50 PAGE FORWARD written about one s perception and theory of WHY I should like this book  I flat out CANNOT stand when so many of our classics are infiltrated by all this menial bullshit that some collective of professors  publishers and editors feel thay just HAVE to put into a book  All that ever does is ruin it for me  Let me just read the story for what it is   I don t need you telling me about YOUR perception of the author s subjective insight into whatever the hell subject you feel like dwelving into WAY too far to the point where you have finally convinced yrself  this is what the author was trying to say  SHUTUP   If I wanted yr interpretation of the book then I ll go and buy YOUR book about what YOU think about said book Anyway  I ve gone WAY off subject here  This is supposed to be about The Iliad  right  Right Again  fantastic translation  beautiful story  incredible battle scenes  flawless characters   I loved everything about this book   Translator Robert Fagles gives us an excellent prose poetry  non rhyming   non metered  version of this ancient classic  the first of all romantic histories of the world  the first history story by which all other histories may be graded and compared Although modern scholarship considers Herodotus to be the author of history  Herodotus followed many similar forms and construction in his book The Histories which also appear in The Illiad centuries before him After reading and comparing with Mr  Fagles other book translation  The Odyssey  certain things become clear from the forensic analysis of the two  which run counter to modern orthodoxy First  whereas the Illiad  the first of the two chronologically  is written about war  the Odyssey  the second  written later  is about love and romance And whereas the Illiad appears to be written from a male perspective  that of a warrior  the Odyssey is written from a female perspective  that of a loving wife or sweetheart Thus  whereas Homer of the Illiad appears to be a man  Homer of the Odyssey appears to be a woman These great classics ought to be the first readings of every college student or college grad before he or she plunges into modern literature  for the benefit of the perspectives that the ancient Greeks give us in these two books  Though there are many translations of Homer s epic  Iliad   the Richmond Lattimore translation is by far the best I have read  I say this for several reasons  First and foremost  this is not a prose translation  this is a full translation kept in the original verse form  I have read prose translations of Homer and they simply do not do Homer s language justice  I was first exposed to this translation in college  and I could not put it down  Besides conveying the majesty of the characters  the rhythm and beauty of Homer s language is something to be admired  and this is probably the closest one can get to experiencing it in the ancient Greek  As with all classics  Homer s characters are dated to their historical period  yet their trials and emotional journeys are readily identified by a modern audience  This is high tragedy without compare  as Homer portrays flawed men who walk like gods  heroes who are filled with doubts for all their bravado  and at their center  the mighty Achilles  who embodies the best and worst of men  yet in private  when all things might point to him succumbing to his pride  he shows his best when dealing with Priam for the body of fallen Hector  Yes  there are many battle scenes  and they can be brutal in their description  This is a story of war  after all  but the savagery employed on the battlefield serves its place in contrast to the more noble actions of the lead heroes  Furthermore  unlike every movie I ve seen about the Trojan War  Homer does not try to equivocate the war in terms of economy  empire  and diluting matters through our very different modern morality  This is not to say Homer s world is morally simplistic  on the contrary  there is more than a fair share of debate among the heroes as to why they should continue the war  and questions as to its motivation  But all this aside  if nothing else  this is a fantastic epic  and  once read  it is no mystery why it has endured to this day   Note  this is not a suspense story  so I didn t hide the review  But there are  spoilers  in it Homer s  Iliad  is one of the great monuments in all of literature  and Lattimore s translation captures the rhythm and feel of it beautifully  Along with the  Odyssey  it illustrates the ethical ideal that moved the ancient Greeks for centuries  It is the story of the final year of the war between the Greeks  or Achaeans  and the Trojans  in which the Greeks had sailed from afar to recover Helen  who had been swept away by the craven Paris  aka Alexandros   But the story really revolves around Achilles  As the epic poem begins  Sing Goddess the anger of Peleus  son Achilles  and its devastation  which brought pain thousandfold upon the Achaeans  Agammemnon  the most powerful of the Greek kings  had offended the gods by taking the daughter of a priest  When Achilles  quite reasonably  suggests that Agammemnon relinquish the girl  Agammemnon reacts furiously  robbing Achilles of his own  prize   This enrages Achilles  the greatest warrior of the Greeks or the Trojans  who only refrains from killing Agammemnon at the urging of a goddess  For much of the rest of the epic  Achilles stays out of the fight  Initially  both the reader and the poet sympathize with the sulking hero  whom Agammemnon unjustly insulted  But when  later  Agammemnon attempts a reconciliation  admitting his error and offering recompense  Achilles rejects the offer  and  at that point  Achilles becomes a less sympathetic figure  His anger assumes a monstrous proportions  and even his closest friends among the Greeks upbraid him  Meanwhile  he even conspires with the gods to ensure that the Greeks are unsuccessful without him But when  much later  his friend and countryman Patroclus is slain in battle  Achilles forgets his grievance against Agammemnon and turns all his rage against Hector  a prince of Troy  and the greatest warrior of the Trojans  who had killed Patroclus and vaunted over his corpse  At the moment that Achilles reenters the fight  Troy s fate is sealed  Achilles demolishes the Trojans  forcing them to flee behind their city walls for protection  But Hector bravely decides to face Achilles in battle  then  realizing he cannot win  runs aways from Achilles in terror  Achilles chases him around the wall three times until  deceived by a goddess  Hector stands again to fight and is killed Achilles  again overcome with fury  drags Hector s corpse behind his chariot and refuses him any kind of honorable burial  At the urging of the gods  though  inculding his mother Thetis  he relents eventually  when Hector s father comes to him and begs Achilles to give his son s body back to him This is the outline of the main story  but there are many other great characters in it  like wise old Nestor  cunning Odysseus  valiant Diomedes  and the great Ajax  the wall of the Achaians  In the world Homer depicts  men are moved by very different sensibilities from our own  They exalt courage in battle above all else  and think nothing of raiding and pillaging  demolishing entire cities  killing men en masse and treating women of the conquered peoples as little more than chattel Much of this is appalling  and yet  one of the reasons to read the great books of the past is that we encounter  through them  worldviews vastly different from those of our day  And thus we are led to question our own beliefs  And this allows us to liberate ourselves from the prejudices of our age The gods  too  are major players in  The Iliad   They are frequently fighting amongst themselves and interfering in human affairs  The greatest of the gods is Zeus  often called  cruel   who came to power by deposing his own father  Chronos  The religion of these ancient peoples is peculiar  and seemingly incoherent  It is highly anthropomorphic  We see Zeus being nagged by his wife and quarreling with his siblings  He is much like the human heroes of the epic  with the same failings  only vastly more powerful  It is not surprising  upon reading  The Ilaid   that Plato recommended it be censored  lest people get a low opinion of the gods and learns from them some dangerous ethical lessons Still  for all the objectionable cruelty of both men and gods in this great epic  the reader also finds there a a sublime and aristocratic side to their ethic  If the heroes are brutal  they are also honorable  in their own way  And  in contrast with the cheerful and often superficial optimism many aspire to now  the ancient Greeks had a profound sense of the tragic in life  We see there King Priam s pitiful mourning for his son and that Achilles is moved by his pleas  And Achilles himself knows that by rejoining the battle he endures his own demise  Even Zeus  wept tears of blood  at the death of his son Sarpedon  In sum  everyone ought to read  and reread  this book  I recommend an audio version  since the poem was meant to be heard  and not read   Note  the interested reader might also want to read about Heinrich Schliemann  the wealthy German adventurer and amateur archeologist who  convinced that the Iliad was not merely a myth  surprised everyone by finding ancient Troy  or Ilium   http   en wikipedia org wiki Heinrich    Despite the best efforts of the translators  I felt like a hefty sum of the expressional nuances inherent in the Greek language were lost once translated into English  But then again who cares  we can t all be classics majors It s an absolute gem of a story  and unlike my initial fear of the epic brimming with flashy rhetoric and Homeric tropes  I was pleasantly surprised to be proved otherwise  it never lacks in action  read  battle gore  lots of it  or sense of humor  I especially found the interpersonal interactions relationships between the gods fascinating  often times hilarious  Personally  it was eye opening to see how the ancients viewed their immortal deities  complete with oscillating loyalties and fickle ambition  and how their traits are diametrically opposed to today s conventional template of what a  God  should embody The indefinite line that blurs the protagonist from the antagonist  where both sides have their heroes  antiheroes  and sponsor gods and goddesses  brilliantly gives the plot its humanity amidst the carnage produced by war  One can t deny that Hector s gruesome death doesn t pull at the heartstrings  or that Achilles  actions call for reproach  There s good on both sides of the equation  and it s almost painful to see one side fall to the other Entertaining  The epic draws you in  and Homer should rightfully be resting on his laurels  Whew  Done  Fineto  I don t know when the last was that I was so happy to finish a book  That being said  don t think I didn t love it This book is full of such rich language that you can t help love it  I loved the exchange between the Gods and the Mortals  The fighting and the human drama that took place on the battle field  This book is full of human passion for good and ill Reading this book was actually much easier than I had envisioned  In many ways it was easy to read then Shakespeare  The reason why is it is translated into modern day English   This book was very long in some parts  There are also some very gorey scenes  I think I would have done better had I read it straight through  but I drug it out for two months because of the numerous book discussions we had with it  I recommend going through this book with a mentor like I did  that really brought the story alive for me  It was also fun to read it at the same time as Alex  We had some great discussions on human nature  First off I can t comment on how good the translation is  but I read the Fagles one Read this ages ago and had forgotten all but the main bits  On re reading I enjoyed it  the style took a bit of getting into but once I d adjusted top stuff One thing I took away  apart from the carnage and humanity shown throughout  was that gods are shits  Their brat like behaviour making me root for anyone without a deity in the family   mind you just because your da  is a god doesn t mean much when unforgiving bronze is hurled out at you On that note  Sarpedon  with Zeus as a father  was more human to me than the demi god Achilles  At one point saying to his henchmen  look  I d rather live forever happily and give up glory and all that stuff   but since we re here anyway  let s go to work  I am obviously paraphrasing   A more human and heroic approach I think than sulking Achilles The majority of the engagements seem to occur over a fallen hero as opposing sides fight over the body and armour  The Armour as trophy but the body for proper burial or desecration by the victor   even Noble Hector threatens to put Patroclus  head on a spike and feed him to the dogs if he can get the body   not much of a better option than what later happens to himself The battles become like work with agricultural and fishing metaphors intermingling with the moments of  joy in battle  I enjoyed Nestor every time he turned up   I don t know if he was meant to be comedy relief  but I kept thinking of him like Corp Jones from Dad s Army   young folk today   when I was a boy   those Trojan s don t like it up  em Capt Agamemnon  Not so sure of his huge cup with its winey soupy barley cheese combo   an acquired taste And more comedy at the funeral games during the foot race I d forgotten the humour in amongst the horror of total war  Homer opens this work  and perhaps all of Western literary history  with an appeal for help and a clearly defined thesis  He asks a muse to help him relate the story of the rage of Achilles  Forgive me for uninvitedly calling Homer s own description of the work lacking  The richness of questions brought up in this work will be apparent to anybody on a first reading  The central preoccupations of the work go beyond the anger of a single man   spanning from the finitude of human existence to the sociopolitical duties of a citizen  It is awe inspiring that a work written so long ago can strike such a powerful chord in so many of us  Nevertheless  it goes without saying that this is a work of art  and  as a consequence  Homer strives to describe and to make us all too painfully aware of the basics of life  We are asked to reflect on not only the standard issues of family and friends  but on our roots  on our attachment to the land  and on our birth and death  Of course  not every squabble of the Gods or cataloguing of the ships strike us as particularly intriguing  Yet in every delightful passage where Homer taunts his genius by pretending to keep substantial issues at bay  proviking issues are to be found  Unsurprisingly  Homer offers us little in the means of answers for the question as to how we are to deal with the profound circumstances that surround us as humans  His use of the  divine  in controlling human affairs may sound too much like an awkwardly familiar tone of existential resignation  For those seeking  answers in life   whatever that may mean  the Illiad is not a bad starting point  We have much in common with Achilles   knowledgable about our own mortality  yet all to eager to presume otherwise  We also sympathize with Hector and the Greek soldiers   it is for the soap operas of the rich and powerful that too many of us shed blood  The striking beauty and emotive appeal of this work cannot be classified as uplifting  Yet the subtlety and craftiness of the spark of joy to be found in our peculiar human condition to which this work speaks should be ample answer for any reader as to why this work has survived for so long  Revelation   reading translated versions of old classics is much easier than reading old english  ie Shakespeare  and can be very enjoyable Though there s a lot of graphic death and everything the gods say as a message is repeated verbatim  I found the Iliad to be a fast and interesting book to read  Homer  and Stephen Mitchell  have a way of describing things  a turn of the phrase  that is evocative and lyrical It s clear from this epic that the gods were making all the major decisions and the mortals were merely following the roles pre ordained for them  It s interesting to think that everyone has a fate that they can t escape so they must go forward fearlessly  if it s their time there s nothing they can do about it and if it s not time yet they don t need to worry  This type of philosophy must have made it much easier to cope with all the deaths Since I ve had this revelation of old classics I might try Stephen Mitchell s translation of Gilgamesh next  This was amazing  I decided to read this the same way I previously read the Epic of Gilgamesh  I listened to an audio book reading of this translation while at the same time following along with a paper copy  I m glad I did it this way because it kept the pace of the story flowing and brought out a lot of the drama and poetry of the work  Listening to it also kept me from stumbling over names that otherwise I would not have been able to pronounce correctly  I will definitely be using this method for more ancient literature  Since most of this stuff was passed down in an oral tradition anyway  it seems only right to listen to it too  I approached this as an action story and I was not disappointed  The parts involving the gods interference in human affairs was also thought provoking  I probably missed a lot of the meaning in the story and it s effect on literature  Guess I will have to read it again  Awesome  Maybe closer to a 4 5  on the star rating  There was a lot of objectification of women  and that really bothered me  and so did the violence  Mostly I cared about Patroclus and Achilles  they loved each other so much   The Fagles translation is full of lovely and thought provoking phrases  and it s usually surprisingly accessible  There s a part where it mentions that some soldier has a headache and a sore shoulder  and small details like that made the story and its characters feel a lot more real and immediate  that people who are supposed to have lived over two thousand years ago experienced the same sorts of physical and emotional ailments as people still do now  A certain major character s death scene  no spoilers  was really hard on me  It sent me into an anxiety attack  actually  I don t think I ve ever been that intensely affected by a fictional character dying  especially on a first read through  J ai lu la version gratuite de Bibebook qui est superbe  La traduction de Charles Marie Rene Leconte de Lisle qui date du dix neuvieme siecle possede un style qui semble tres contemporain  Le texte est limpide et entrainant  Il faut avouer que je m y attendais a autre chose que j ai trouve dans cette epopee  Je pensais qu elle racontait l histoire de la guerre de Troie ce qui n etait pas le cas  L Iliade ne raconte ni la fin ni le debut de la guerre  Plutot  elle presente une serie d incidents qui arrivent au moment ou la guerre traine en longueur qui a pour but de demontrer que les guerres se font par les Dieux et par les homes  Les deux groupes agissent de facon illogique et irrationelle ce qui entrainent des multiples tragedies  Homere refuse resolument a nous donner une conclusion au conflit ce qui laissent le lecteur tres inquiet au sujet de l homme et son destin  My feelings are mixedThe Iliad has wonderful poetry  and it has scenes of moving tragedy  But    the violence in the narrative becomes nauseating because of endless repetition  although many of the depictions show great skill  It certainly depicts life in the era in a fascinating way  and its antiquity should never be forgotten  Was Homer anti war  He may well have been  I hope so  The Iliad deserves its place as the preeminent work of human literature  Despite so much of its content being the graphic gruel of battle  it is a relentlessly vivid portrait of humanity  It evokes every deep human emotion  from joy to grief  and it drives us to ask the real  meaningful questions about life and death  Nearly every page of my copy bears notes  questions of human existence  exclamations of delight  ponderings of awe  My first reading  Lattimore s translation  was powerful  but each subsequent reading  Fagles  which my 7th   8th graders also heartily approved  has deepened my appreciation  I fell in love with it in a burst of wonder and emotion  but this is true love because it mellows and buoys the soul more warmly and strongly with each new encounter  What can be said of such a masterpiece that has not already been said before  I read the Lattimore translation this time and from the first line I was in awe  How much truth about life is in this ancient poem  What insights  And so beautifully written I ve been reading a bit of Gilgamesh at the same time and the contrast is startling  The Iliad is great art  I don t think Gilgamesh comes close It is the original tragedy  Achilles is the original tragic hero  It is about our mortality  It is about our lives  living in the face of mortality  Reading Book 24   it s always as though I m reading it for the first time  I always knocks me for a loop  This is the beginning of Western Literature  I love that  It s  Go   Everything that follows comes from this poem   Like the Odyssey  I ve read and re read the Iliad about a dozen times  and it still excites me  I like the Odyssey better  probably  but only very slightly  I would recommend the Iliad to just about anyone because I really believe it is one of the best reading experiences one can have of a truly other culture outside of science fiction  The Iliad and the Odyssey may be in the foundation of the now much denigrated Western culture in which we reside  but the lives  values  beliefs  adventures  and deaths of the people in these stories is so far from our own I don t think anyone can fairly say it s just a bunch of irrelevant crap from some old dead white guys  Richard Lattimore may be an old  I don t think he s dead  white guy  but his translations are the best available   God  I love the Iliad so much  What else is there to say that hasn t been said  It seems to me more prefer the Odyssey  though then you hear people say more seem to prefer the Iliad  as it s the adventure story  but the Iliad is about war  anger  vengeance    that distills into a recognition of loss and a moment to be silent and grieve  Although I have to say  the Lattimore translation is rather dense  so if you just want to know the story maybe Fagles  I haven t read Fagles  Iliad BUT his Odyssey was really easy to read  Lattimore took forever  Also if you don t know this  the Iliad does not start with the golden apple and it does not end with the Trojan horse  Just a reminder if you re disappointed that this poem doesn t have any of that in it    nshd y hwmyrws   w  ml  l Hqb mwsyq    w lnhy  jml w sHr   fl rwH Zmy     w lqlwb mt b    w lnsny  wjf    w ladhan mkdwd  mn dw  l

This was Chapman s Translation If you want a book with a million characters  out of nowhere gore  and metaphors to nature  then here is your book Truly a great though  It s sometimes hard to believe that Homer wrote it so long ago  Bueno   este libro lo lei en primero de secundaria y LO AME   obvio que lei un librito super corto con la historia re resumida pero bueno    Another great classic  I love this version  The Iliad  i m kidding  right  nope  along with War and Peace  one of my two all time favorite books  it is epic poetry  of course  not exactly a popular genre these days for either poets or readers  but the story  while simple  is beyond compelling  i think the two most memorable human traits explored were savagery and the fickle nature of courage  i recommend Lattimore because i couldn t find a better phrase than the  wine dark sea  in other translations  nor  grey eyed Athena   doesn t take much to put the hook in me  i guess i much prefer free form verse to rhyme  but i have to admit that Alexander Pope s translation was really fun  as for the Odyssey  it is a collection of more thrilling adventures  but the poetry is not equal to that found in The Iliad  guess i m on the side of two different  or more  authors of these companion poems these two works  in an old fashioned  Golden Book  edition hooked me when i first learned to read  The Iliad also informed my novel  Sun Valley Moon Mountains  to be published in March  i hope  I suppose the Pope translation is the most famous  It was the one I read in college  Even though I have read others  this new version by Mitchell is terrific  I will let you compare  Achilles  wrath  to Greece the direful springOf woes unnumber d  heavenly goddess  sing That wrath which hurl d to Pluto s gloomy reignThe souls of mighty chiefs untimely slain Whose limbs unburied on the naked shore Devouring dogs and hungry vultures tore Since great Achilles and Atrides strove Such was the sovereign doom and such the will of Jove    Translated by Alexander Pope  1720 The Rage of Achilles  sing it now  goddess  sing through methe deadly rage that caused the Achaeans such griefand hurled down to Hades the souls of so many fighters leaving their naked flesh to be eaten by dogsand carrion birds  as the will of Zeus was accomplished Begin at the time when bitter words first dividedthat king of men  Agamemnon  and godlike Achilles    Translated by Stephen Mitchell  2012  This time I am reviewing The Iliad by Homer  The Iliad is the breathtaking epic by the ancient greek poet  Homer  Homer is an ancient greek poet from the time of around 750 B C   he is mostly known for writing the two famous epics  The Iliad and The Odyssey  The Iliad is the story of the Trojan War  a war between the Trojans and the Achaeans  the greeks   The story takes place in the Bronze Age   around the twelfth and thirteenth century B C    The war started when Paris  a self centered Trojan prince  abducts Helen  the beautiful wife of Menelaus  king of the Achaeans  After finding out his wife has been abducted the Trojan War has sparked  The story the The Iliad starts nine years later  The story begins when Chryses  a priest  wants his daughter  Chryseis back after she was taken from Agamemnon  After begging for his daughter back and offering ransom  Agamemnon still refuses  So the Chryses goes and prays to Apollo to help him get his daughter back  Apollo goes down and decides send disease to the Achaeans  So Agamemnon finally decides to send Chryseis back to her father  But then he takes Achilles prize Briseis away  This puts Achilles in a great rage  a rage so large that Achilles decides to leave the Achaean army and has his mom pray to Zeus to let the Achaeans fall to the Trojans  So After getting the prayer Zeus chooses to send Agamemnon a false dream telling Agamemnon to go out to Troy and fight  But the thing was Zeus had told the Trojans of that attack  With the Achaean in peril  Achilles close friend  Patroclus goes out to help fight the trojans  Sadly in battle Patroclus is killed by Hector  the mightiest and strongest warrior on the Trojan Army  Now Achilles now sad that his friend is now dead is now determined to avenge the death of his friend and kill Hector  this is when Achilles finally accepts the call to action  I really enjoyed this book  It was one of the most challenging books I have ever read  but still a very enjoyable read  This book is one of those reads that you need to read the sentence once or twice to fully understand it  I think personally one of the strengths of the book is the plot because it  in my opinion  was a very interesting one  When you finish the book you feel proud to have read it  But I would definitely recommend this book to a friend even though it is hard it is a beautiful piece of literature about one of the greatest stories of all time   This book the Iliad written by Homer Is the disaster of troy and the fact Achilles almost dies  In the story there is a bunch of men fighting over things like women  and jewelry  This war first started by Paris this war lasted nine years long  Paris stole Helen from Menelaus   an Argive  The Argive soldiers were in their ships  The Trojan men were in Ilium behind the walls in the city  There was so much blood guts and men piled up everywhere  This story and big ole war is about Paris and Helen betrayal to Menelaus  and it was also very much about the death of Achilles  Homer paints a picture so vivid with his words that I could see these things happen even as I walk away from the book  I could close my eyes and feel like I was there this picture was written so vividly  This story is just thoughtful I just think about some the things that went on a few days after I read it  All in All Homer put together a Great vivid story  There are so many things that could be said about this story  It is very popular around my peers and also I see a lot on television  The Iliad is definitely something you should read if you have not   La guerra e un affare sporco  E funesto  molto funesto  Ed adesso siamo in tempo di guerra  Come sempre  L umanita sembra sempre in tempo di guerra  Come la odio  la guerra  E allora     allora  mi chiedo  perche amo tanto L Iliade  Chiamiamolo Omero  non mettiamoci a contestare la sua identita  non ora  bisogna parlare di quest opera  della sua magnificienza  del suo miracolo  L Iliade parla di guerra  Di eserciti sterminati e lucenti  schierati in una battaglia insensata e protratta per dieci anni  Parla di guerre interiori  fra orgolio e senso del dovere  scatenate nei cuori degli eroi che Omero elenca con esattezza solerte  L Iliade sa incantare con le sue descrizioni di arme e di duelli  con le mirabolanti gesta di divinita impiccione come solo quelle grece sapevano essere  E  un poema che ci parla del lato piu sanguinario e animale dell umanita  Eppure  L Iliade trasuda di nobilta da ogni parola  Parla di sentimenti elevati e drammatici  che toccano i cuori dei lettori  e continuano a farlo da millenni  Non sappiamo nemmeno chi l ha scritta  questa storia immortale  eppure essa ci appartiene  fa parte di noi  Nonostante sia una terribile storia di guerra  O forse  proprio per questo  It s been a long while since I ve listened to this version of the Iliad on books on tape  my son was four and we were in the car on a very long drive  and I d never read it aloud  so when my now nine year old son  asked me to read it to him  I was quick to assent with an  okay   Now you may question my fathering skills  as I did  by reading this aloud to a nine year old for it is full of graphic descriptions of beheadings  disembowelments  and violent deaths  much of which I had forgotten of course  and obviously my son had not  somehow boys seem retain a better memory for graphic battle scenes than adults   but he seemed okay with it  and it was so very worth it  This book needs to be read aloud in the Homeric tradition to be fully appreciated and Fagles  language does it justice like no other translation  Somehow the almost endless battle scenes are never repetitive  it is new  and full of striking imagery  and one feels the connection to these people across the millennia in a way that cannot be described Now on to the Odyssey  The translation is the staple for readers since 1952  Lattimore avoids the lyrical rhyming which comes off terribly in some other translations  It is modern English and easy to understand Things to note  1  The introduction to this edition is amazing and encompasses a rich summary of events and historical implications from literature to modern film  2  The story is gory  exciting  layered with tense drama and beautiful description  It is a tale that glorifies honor and casts an unwavering light on the senseless loss that steams out of the cauldron of war  It s a protest piece embedded in mythologizing lore  Hapeistos new shield to Achilles and the detail as described is a brilliant description that captures the need for humankind to elevate above the idea of  bloodgrudge  and perpetual honor claims that lead to infinite vengeful reciprocations  The shield is an expression of divine wisdom that foreshadows a new society where disputes are settled without war  A sad juxtaposition to how Achilles uses his armaments against hector and his brethren in the end  3  It is a dude heavy story  Women are portrayed as property  Andromoche is a strong and powerful character but too little of her voice and expression are present  Sadly a sign of the historical context of the work  I read this over the course of two months during my shifts driving deliveries for a local Thai restaurant  Sitting beneath a wall mural of a topless mermaid and shoveling pad woon sen into my face  I learned about the rampant badassery that occurred within one of history s silliest wars  A few notable trashtalkings After a charioteer gets clocked with a rock and takes a tumble O er whom Patroclus thus with bitter jest   Heav n  what agility  how deftly thrown That somersault  if only in the sea Such feats he wrought  with him might few compete  Diving plunges to the ground  Troy can  it seems  accomplish d tumblers boast  daaaaaaaaaamnOr how about  Hast thou forgotten how amid thy herds Alone I found thee  and with flying foot Pursued thee down the steep of Ida s hill  Nor didst thou dare to turn  or pause in flight  Dear Aeneas  I seent you runnin   Thou art a li l bitch It s like watching 300  only nonstop  for two months  and slightly less homoerotic   This review is part of Common Humanity s  Books to Change the World  https   commonhumanitybbth wordpress      Homer sees everything without judgement  He is not shocked at any form of human stupidity  violence  or greed  and finds no need for consolation  He simply observes  and in the purity of that observation he can see life in death and death in life  the interpenetration of the human and the nonhuman  the equal truth of opposites  and the preciousness of even the smallest or most abject of creatures  His vision is not only an aesthetic but a moral one  I call it love  These sentences form the last paragraph of Stephen Mitchell s Introduction to his translation of Homer s Iliad  and though my love for Homer and the story of the Trojan War may colour my perspective just a tad  in my opinion  I have yet to read a more beautiful prologue to any work  Mitchell perfectly summarizes why I feel so strongly in the power of this story  and why it has endured across the centuries  And that s just the introduction   In translating this two and a half millennia old classic  Mitchell took a slightly more modern approach  incorporating some slang and contemporary idioms  He also cut some sections of the original text  causing many purist Classicists to squirm with contempt  So if you re looking for some unadulterated Homer  this probably isn t the Iliad for you  But that s not why this version is on this list  It s here because this is a relatable  accessible Homer  one that  sees everything without judgement   hwmyrws byn lshrq wlmwrwth lsh ry

en la Iliada no hay ningun caballo de madera ni cae Troya  y Aquiles no se enamora de Casandra  El poema original abarca solo cincuenta y dos dias del noveno de los diez anos que dura la guerra  Ofendido porque Agamenon secuestro a sus hija  Crises  un sacerdote de Apolo  le pide al dios que intervenga para que le devuelvan a su hija  Apolo hace caer la peste sobre el campamento de los aqueos  los enemigos de Troya  entre ellos estan Aquiles  Agamenon  Ulises  Menelao  Patroclo  etc    quienes deciden devolver a la muchacha  Y aca esta el quid de la cuestion  Agamenon  que se ha quedado sin la chica exige en compensacion a Briseida  quien forma parte del botin de Aquiles  Ofendido y humillado  a Aquiles no le queda opcion que ceder a Briseida porque Agamenon es superior en rango pero decide que ni el ni sus soldados  los mirmidones  van volver a la guerra con los aqueos  Las consecuencias de la ausencia de el mejor guerrero y su ejercito no solo llegan al campo de batalla si no que desatan la furia entre los habitantes del Olimpo Batallas alucinantes  acciones heroicas  escenas conmovedoras  y muchisimo mas  la Iliada lo tiene todo  y creo que en ello reside su mas grande valor  nos da una vision completisima de una epoca de la que sabemos muy poco  no por nada en la antiguedad clasica se la consideraba un relato historico mas que literatura  Y de hecho hay un trasfondo de verdad en el relato  muchos estudiosos coinciden en que la Iliada esta basada en elementos historicos anteriores a la epoca homerica y en el siglo XIX se excavaron en Hissarlik  Turquia  lo que muchos consideran podrian ser los restos arqueologicos de Troya Compuesta en un principio para su transmision oral  la version escrita del texto es muy posterior a su creacion  El cuando  donde y por quien fue compuesta son objeto de tanta controversia que el propio debate tiene un nombre oficial  la  Cuestion homerica  y hay quienes incluso argumentan que en realidad Homero no existio Cualquiera sea la  verdad  sobre el origen de la Iliada no le quita merito como la obra inaugural de la literatura en occidente  Particularmente me sorprendio que entre las escenas de batallas y las acciones heroicas hay un fuerte concepto de compasion  de familia y demostraciones de amor de los padres hacia los hijos  Me gustaron especialmente Patroclo  Menelao  Hector  Priamo  Aquiles  Ares y Afrodita  No suelen ser los personajes favoritos  pero me sorprendieron  En fin  me encanto  Mas resenas en https   lamariad blogspot com I never wrote a real review when I read this  if that s even possible for a text with this kind of cultural weight   but I do kind of want to keep a record of my thoughts somewhere  so I m just pasting in the updates I posted to Tumblr as I read 23 April  So far Achilles has called Agamemnon dog face and settled in for the sulk of the ages  Agamemnon has told his army they can all go home just so that he can turn around and say lol jk  and then we had to pause for roll call 30 April  I m not quite a third of the way through  The first battle has just finished with Hector and Ajax not killing each other  Approximately eight million other people have died  by name  in unnecessarily gory ways  and I am so confused by the two Ajaxes  Why are there two Ajaxes  Do I need to remember which is which  or does it not matter  Which one was that Georgette Heyer book referring to  All of the questions It s not a difficult read   so far it s really just a romp of boastful speeches and dying and stealing armour from corpses   but it is a conscious read  I ve never got so sucked into the story that I ve forgotten I m reading epic verse  or that the text is three thousand years old  even though Rodney Merrill s translation is very straightforward   Which I think is making me approach it less as literature than as a historical text  The oral tradition is so present in the repetition and the little flourishes where the author addresses the characters or the muses  or dives sideways into descriptive metaphors that feel so very old man ish  though quite visually evocative   I keep trying to guess how the text would have changed as the teller adapted to the mood of the audience  which parts would have been played up  voice soft or loud  where to hold the audience s eyes  and especially how it was changed and reworked in the transcription  And of course  what the contemporary references are  and how much actual history is in it  and how things like the endless roll call of names and lineages and geographical regions are used by historians I m fascinated by the role of women so far  It gets off to such an awful start  which Achilles and Agamemnon falling out over who gets to rape the slave girl  and you re just  sure  I have an opinion over which of you is in the right in this dispute  your feelings on this are important to me  But that is  clearly  something that you re expected to just accept  war means women are carried off as prizes  women s wills don t matter  When the city falls  the women will suffer as punishment on the men  Agamemnon makes a whole speech about it at one point  But then the goddesses are so active  and so powerful  and as well characterised and convincingly motivated as any of the male characters  and there s never any kind of double think or qualifier in it  And Helen  too  is pretty cool so far  and very human  if a bit heavy on the self hatred   And as a friend pointed out to me  nobody else hates her  she gets some blame but not as much as Paris  The only one calling her horrible names is her   So far we ve seen her stand up to a goddess  simply because she was sick of being messed around  even if Aphrodite did turn around and terrify her back into obedience  The only other person who s done that is Diomedes in battle  and he knew he had Athena on his side All of the characters are such jerks that it s hard to think about favourites  Achilles is still sulking out of the way  so I don t have any strong feelings on him  and Patroclus has barely been mentioned  Helen  as I said  I rather like  Athena I like  but also she s an asshole  and I ve realised that  inconveniently  I m on the Trojans  side  which is obviously going to turn out great for me  but in the meantime makes it harder to back her when she does cool things or gets one over on Aphrodite or Ares or Apollo  I m enjoying her alliance with Hera  though  Odysseus I m inclined to like  but I don t know how long that will last  Paris I rather like  for his mixture of good intentions and impetuous bravery and weakness and charismatic slither outing  and the way he baffles Hector In conclusion  Nestor  you need to sit down  nobody wants to hear about your glory days again 3 May  It s awful  but I m getting kind of fond of Menelaus  He wants to fight so badly  and Agamemnon is constantly pulling him back by the collar  it keeps getting funnier  This bit in particular  where Menelaus and a bunch of other guys have all volunteered to accompany Diomedes on a dangerous mission  and Agamemnon hurriedly says  Not for respect you feel in your heart do you leave here the betterman and the worse as your comrade take  giving way to respectand looking to birth  even if some other should be the more kingly  So he spoke  he was fearful about light haired Menelaus  You brother is right there  A  He can hear you  In conclusion  Seriously Nestor  nobody cares 6 May  I m not quite two thirds of the way through  Apollo is back in the battle  and they re fighting right up against the ships  I m still waiting for Patroclus to do anything  but he s just gone looking for Achilles  so that arc could be about to start  I m hoping that they will also talk a bit more  too  I was promised an epic tragic love story  I hope I get some of it while Patroclus is still alive I don t think I expected so many scenes to go to the gods  and I m kind of delighted  The battle scenes have their own appeal  with all the speechifying trash talking and people constantly being killed trying to steal somebody s armour  seriously  every third death  sometimes maybe the armour is not worth it  people   but being able to cut away to Hera and Athena fuming about Zeus and such is really necessary for breathing space  They re so much fun  and the lack of stakes is really soothing  Like  yes  Zeus can rain down immoderate punishment on any one of them  as he is constantly threatening  but nothing s really going to be permanent  it s ok if they get a bit carried away  As they are constantly doing   Ares in particular is hilarious  I wish I had a better handle on humour in the text  Sometimes I just can t tell whether people are being sarcastic or not  or if Homer s being sarcastic or not  So  e g   when he describes Helen s speech to Hector as  honey sweet words of persuasion   but her opening words are  Brother in law of the bitch I am   would that have made people laugh  or is violent self deprecation really honey sweet  Or when Zeus says that he s furious with Athena for her defiance towards him but not with Hera  because he expects Hera to attempt to thwart him at every turn  is he actually not angry with Hera or is that a burn  And so on In conclusion  How many children does Priam have  goddamn  I feel like his sons and sons in law have accounted for about a quarter of the Trojan casualties so far 16 May  I m heading into the endgame  currently up to  Achilles has feelings and wants you to know  part eleventy hundred   and I keep thinking about the way the ideas of shame and dishonour work in this story Like  there is so much trash talking  but the thing is  there s just as much between allies and friends as there is between enemies  Almost without exception  the speeches designed to fire people up to fight   and there are a lot of them   explicitly call on shame as the motivating force  Nobody stands up and says  The Trojans rock and we are going to crush these Acheans like bugs   or  Hector you can totally take this guy  I believe in you   They say This is a shame  to be driven by Ares beloved Acheansback into Illion now  by our own weak cowardice vanquished orHector  the noblest in beauty  in warfare much are you lacking Vainly an excellent fame holds you who flee like a woman or even more explicitly Yet of himself let each man move  feel shame in his heart lestnoble Patroclus become a plaything for the dogs of the Trojans  Patroclus  o    These are all random examples within a couple of pages of each other  btw  like  this happens a lot  It s so different to what I m used to in martial stories  In modern western narratives shame is a paralysing force  almost never a source of strength And the way this story talks about fighting and dying with honour and dishonour has similarly been baffling me  until I realised which of my expectations it was actually subverting  In the christian tradition of martial narratives  you can gain honour and glory by winning or losing  If you die well  then you can die with even greater honour than you would have had by living  In the Iliad there doesn t seem be such a thing as an honourable or glorious death  If one man kills another  he seems to literally take all of the honour and glory available in the encounter This is why all the armour stealing and stabbing people in the back has been confusing me  There s dishonour in being stabbed in the back because it shows you were running away  and there s dishonour in your armour being stolen  and there s dishonour in being slaughtered and your corpse mutilated and thrown to the dogs  but I m used to there being at least as much dishonour in doing those things  You don t stab someone in the back  you don t rob their corpse  jolly bad show what  etc But in the Iliad  that s all glory I m sure none of this is remotely novel  but I ve read so little classical literature that it s really startling to me In other news  I was really affected by Patroclus  death  and I m still not sure how much of that came from the text and how much was just the cultural weight of the event  Maybe it was just the way everybody in a fifty mile radius who wasn t a Trojan burst into heartrending wails   Guys  none of you had even talked to him in the past sixteen books  Are you sure you knew who he was  Is speechless depthless grief totally appropriate here I m just asking  In conclusion  Oh my god how are they finding all these rocks they keep hitting each other with  was the battle of Troy secretly fought in a quarry  How did the horses not break their ankles on all these rocks 17 May  So  turns out that nothing that s happened is Achilles  fault By the hugest coincidence  nothing is Agamemnon s fault either Also Achilles wishes the slave girl could have died before this conflict between him and Agamemnon could come about  That would clearly have been the best preventative measure Guys  you are the classiest  I first read this in Spanish and while it is written beautifully in English too  keeping up with the old spirit of portraying intrigue  deceit  passion between mortals and gods  it is not the same  I preferred the Spanish version because to me  it evoked more of those emotions when I read it in my native language  However  as for the story itself  Iliad is one of my favorite Greek epics simply because there are a lot of elements that are universal to history  We read intrigue  deceit  passion  ambition  sibling rivalry and last but not least the story ends with this concept of servitude that says that no matter who bad things are  you must always put yourself above these ordeals and live by this virtue of being loyal to the gods  It is basically accept what you have and conformity which the Greeks were trying to press at the population of the time  This idea of being conformed with what you have and obey the higher power and no one can escape the role the powers that be  in this case fate  not even the gods   are given  Which is something that I will always disagree with  but it is essential you read it nonetheless to get a view of the classical mindset Since it was first published  the Iliad has inspired many modern fantasy and science fiction novels  even historical fiction novels that run with the same themes of betrayal  lust  and ambition of this novel  And why not  One of the reasons it is still so popular it s because the heroes here are not perfect  they are not Mary Sues or Gary Stues like we often have today who are perfect and nice and dandy  but instead they are deeply flawed characters which makes it easier for us to identify with   The Iliad   by Homer  translated by Stephen Mitchell   Free Press  2011  audiobook read by Alfred Molina   Mitchell bases his translation on the edition of Martin L  West  who determined that much of what the world has known of the book is anachronistic additions  and eliminated hundreds of lines  Mitchell took that and translated it into exceptionally clean  powerful poetry  The story flows quickly and easily  the language is vivid  everything stands out in the strongest light  Characters are richly developed  arrogant Agamemnon  not necessarily the greatest general  clever Odysseus  brave Diomedes  who wounds two gods  Aphrodite and Ares   the Ajaxes  Ajax the Tall and Ajax the lesser  The Trojans  volatile Paris  wise  sad Priam  terrified Andromache  proud  courageous  doomed Hector  Achilles here is clearly a nasty piece of work  not just proud  but with a quick temper  vengeful  unforgiving  He refuses offer after offer by Agamemnon and the Achaeans to appease him  and finally only moves when Patroclus his companion is slain by Hector  They are not lovers  Mitchell declares in a lengthy introduction  The gods   Hera is treacherous  Zeus frustrated in his attempts to keep the gods from quarreling  and to manage the war below  This is such a rich translation  although  according to a review I read  it is actually very lean and leaves out a lot   The descriptions  Achilles  god forged shield and armor  the terrible fighting among the ships  the plain  the city  Hector is by far the most sympathetic person  He knows he is doomed  He loves his wife and child  Courageous as he is  he can be pushed back and made to flee  Achilles is the pitiless killer  Hector the human  Among other things that bugged me about Homer s being a homer  the Trojans  spears and swords always just miss  or are bent or thwarted by shields and armor  Achaeans  weapons rarely miss  and their armor withstands everything  The Achaeans kill famous men  the Trojans kills the lesser  except finally for Patroclus  I think I got more from this reading than from any of the others I ve read  Or else I just have forgotten most of what came before  http   stephenmitchellbooks com trans    What is there to say about Homer s epics  that has not already been said  These stories are timeless  and no matter how many times they are translated or adapted for the screen  the stories have become burned into our culture  The poem tells the story of the Trojan War  a conflict between the Greeks and Trojans  The two sides are fighting over Helen  the most beautiful woman on Earth  The Greeks are fighting to get her back  while the Trojans are fighting to protect their home  One thing that is excellent about this story is that it shows both sides of this conflict  Rather than simply telling telling us who s good and showing us their side only  we get to see how both sides view the war  Personally  I found myself sympathizing more with Hector and the Trojans  There are many translations of the Iliad available on the market  which are of varying quality  The Fagles translation seems to be the one that most favor and for good reasons  It preserves the poetic nature and does not come across as being archaic in the least  Everyone should read the Iliad at least once in there life  so that they can experience one of the defining works of Western literature   The Iliad was a great read  I loved it  Since I am a fan of ancient history the Iliad seemed like the perfect choice and I am glad to say I wasn t wrong The pros of the Iliad were  a fantastic plot  and well developed characters  The plot was mostly based around the battle of troy which was long and brutal  The characters were well defined and their backgrounds were given in great detail such as Ajax the large with his enormous shield and Diomedes the one who ravaged the Trojans at the beginning of the battle One example of a con within the Iliad was that an entire chapter was devoted for the sole purpose of describing each and every general  where he came from and how many ships he brought with him  Another con was Homer seemed to include unnecessary details repeatedly such as who the father of the person being killed was  Finally Homer exaggerates the details even beyond myth level which was frankly quite exhausting to read In conclusion the book was enlightening into what the Greeks believed happened at Troy  If you are planning to read The Iliad  and yes  it s one of those books that everyone  should  read   do a little research and pick a translation that suits you  In order to get a well rounded sense of this work  I switched back and forth among three different translations  Edward  the Earl of Derby  W H D  Rouse  and E V  Rieu  which were extremely different from one another in tone and style  There are plenty of good choices  but some will prefer a prose translation while others prefer poetry  some like grandly eloquent language while others prefer a more colloquial style  Homer was an entertainer   his work may be ancient  but it need not seem dusty and impenetrable  It should be lively and fast paced What I particularly enjoyed about the Iliad were the vivid similes  the complex view of warfare  and the characterizations  though capable of superhuman feats  the gods and heroes are given very human personalities   Even the minor characters who showed up only to take a spear to the guts and fall down dead are given names and a glimpse at a backstory  which lends both pathos as well as a sense of scale  that the world is bigger and deeper than the battlefield where the story takes place  I liked  as well  how the Trojan side is viewed rather sympathetically rather than demonized as  the Enemy  The battle scenes were very well written  with visceral detail and a good sense of what it would have been like to fight in that era  but there are many of them  and they do tend to be a bit repetitive  The other scenes  conversations among the gods  debates among the warriors  and domestic scenes in Troy  were usually somewhat more interesting to read  Notable were the scenes of Hera s wily seduction of Zeus  and Hector taking off his helmet to soothe his frightened son The climactic duel between Achilles and Hector was somewhat of a letdown  to be sure  but after some reflection  merciless brutality  cowardice  and luck  or fate  as Homer would have it  seem more honest and appropriate to the conditions of warfare than honor and courage  and an epic swordfight  hoped for in vain   While the final meeting between Achilles and Priam was one of the high points of the epic  I can t be alone in wishing Homer had decided to extend the story through the death of Achilles and the sack of Troy  Trojan Horse episode   instead of leaving these parts for other poets of the Epic Cycle  whose work has sadly been lost to history  Robert Fitzgerald does an excellent job rendering a readable translation in compelling poetic verse  The lines of this epic are filled with horrific violence and high drama between warriors and gods  so much so that it makes the  movies books video games are getting more violent  argument that cycles through the media every so often seem absurd  Surprisingly  this original version does not include the  Achilles arrow in the heel  or the Trojan horse episodes  which come from other sources  The main conflicts are between Agamemnon and Achilles and  later  Hector and Achilles  The whole epic takes place only in the last few weeks of the Trojan War  although the text often refers to many of the mythological tidbits and events one might be familiar with from popular  contemporary depictions of the story I was also reminded of battle scenes from Tolkien s Lord of the Rings and George R  R  Martin s Song of Ice and Fire series and suspect that the Iliad was an influence on both authors I thoroughly enjoyed Fitzgerald s translation and the lasting narrative power of this epic  I recommend it both in audio and in book form  Reading this solid verse translation over several months in the context of 2014 was illuminating Agamemnon and Menelaos are extremely wealthy men    feudal kings    who manipulate their wealthy fellows into doing their bidding  through guile and promised riches  That includes the lives of the women in the poem  most of whom are slaves and treated as property  the spoils of war  The gods and goddesses are fickle assholes  too  Zeus  Hera  Athena  Ares  Apollo    they are all vain and terrible  and slaughter humans without a second thought The  hero  of the poem  Akhilleus  is the worst of all  Essentially  he is a butcher  He sits out most of these verses  because Agamemnon has hurt his feelings by commandeering his favorite slave girl  Briseis  heh    I had written  Chriseis   for some reason  this reader could not get the Zappa tune out of his head whenever her name was mentioned  In the end  spoiler alert   Akhilleus returns to the fray  to flay  and flay  and flay    to slay  without remorse  mercy    or any shred of humanity until perhaps the final stanzas  His best friend has been killed  you see  and he is taking his vengeance  on everyone  Man  I love Homer  but it says a lot about western  civilization  that these are our great works  We have spent thousands of years trapped in these narratives in which a great  hero     our  protagonist   even    is someone who is unfathomably vain  treats other humans as property to be abused  considers women slaves  and slaughters men viscerally and horribly and with not a second thought So long as he s extraordinarily wealthy  the eyes of the gods smile upon him  Unless the gods  the real one percenters  change their minds  Then  watch out And there we remain  no  Be careful what you write  a good goddamn story can enslave millions  Billions   This is the best work I ve read and is likewise equal to being my favorite story ever  My reaction from reading the Iliad the first time around was if that was all  I wanted more and have read almost all Greek works related to the story and aftermath such as the Trojan epic by Quintus of Smyrna  the Aeneid by Virgil  The odyssey by Homer  The plays Agamemnenon  Orestes and Ajax  The characters are what make me most attracted to the Illiad and I am not the only one  Alexander the Great was told by Aristotle to always be like Achilles  Achilles  wrath anger is so intense due to his dishonor that most of this book is about the outcome of his disgrace  The climax was his beloved friend Patroclus  death which leads to the best part  Achilles killing herds of Greeks and Hector  Tamer of Horses  The honor of these warriors names themselves are unbelievable  Before most kills they give a speech it feels like which puts me in awe  This is sublime poetry at its finest  This is my favorite work of literature  I read it twice a year  It is the foundational work of western literature  and any person who desires to be called an educated person MUST read this book This is a superb translation  While not as poetic as Fagles or as fast paced as Lombardo s  it excellently blends beautiful English with the otherness of Ancient Greek  The notes are instructive yet not intrusive to the text  The introduction and synopsis are particularly useful   Finally read the Iliad  Not because I truly wanted to  but because any well read individual has read it  and if I at some point in my life want achieve the status of  well read  this is a requirement  Hundreds of pages of Greek and Trojan men killing each other with spears  swords and the occasional rock that  no mortal man  should be able to lift  Homer graciously describes each and every death including where the weapon entered the body and exited the body as well as the damage it inflicted on its way   something I found kind of funny given his limited knowledge of human anatomy  Not only are there detailed descriptions of this  but also of the slayer and of the slain s entire lineage and acts of valor  Has anyone actually totaled up just how many different names of people are mentioned in the tale  There is also a ridiculous amount of drama amongst the gods    Seriously it would be a tough world to live in with a pantheon of gods such as this    playing favorites  changing their minds being fickle and manipulative  sleeping with mortals  They would just be normal humans if they could actually die  Also lets talk about Achilles for a minute  I admit a complete deficit in knowledge of Greek mythology outside of this book so maybe I m missing something of his valor and the awesomeness but he s such a prick  He gets butt hurt by his friend and totally runs to his mom and then sits on his ship until enough of the Greeks die to make him feel bad  more specifically until Patroclus dies  and then he goes and kills Hector who was actually a cool dude  That being said  Paris is an even bigger prick  He s pretty much the whole reason the war happened  and he doesn t even come out of the city until half way though the story  When he does come out  he s an archer so he doesn t get in the middle of things and keeps his pretty little self safe so he can go steal other peoples wives  The women in the story are interesting  I had a pre conceived notion about Helen being a princess but actually she was pretty well aware that she was the inciting incident for the whole damn thing and counted herself as the most unlucky and ill fated woman  Hectors wife was rad too  Overall I think that I m glad I read it but I m also glad it s over  Homer sure has a handle on that drama   This book is extremely bloody  I don t recommend reading it unless you are fine with loads of violence  For the most part though  this book should prove interesting and exciting  The first few chapters don t have much going on  but after that  bang  there seem to be like battles every chapter  It talks about people getting killed in all sorts of gory ways  but it provides you with something entertaining and exciting to read   D I mean  can you really rate the Iliad  The foundation of pretty much all literature  Can you critique it  Not really  But you can make some observations  so here they are  The most compelling thing about this book is how perfectly imperfect everyone is  The characters here are more richly drawn than half the most popular characters today  The gods  the heroes  everyone has flaws and strengths  Some just have more than others  Achilles is very arrogant vain and extremely ruthless  but he s also very loyal  Hector has too much pride  but he s such a ridiculously nice guy  you forgive him for it  Paris is a douche  but at least he realizes it  And Helen whines all the time   I m too beautiful  Everyone loves me  I get anything I want    yet you do kind of feel sorry for her  because she s got a lot of pressure on her  At first  I thought  wow I can just predict what s going to happen next  and not just because I ve seen  Troy   But then I realized that when this was written  or spoken   it was the most original  fantastic thing ever  and nothing had ever been like it before  So really everything else after it is predictable  not this  The bottom line is  you should read the Iliad  because this is the original book  the original piece of literature  the original everything  Historically it is incredibly significant  and you will recognize so much   The Illiad is a fantastic classic  written around 700 BC  this epic poem is to the date one of the most important classics and essential to anyone who desires some sort of culture in their life  The poem relates the last couple months of the Trojan War  which was actually like 400 years before it was written   Homer is also the author of The Odyssey  These books  in my opinion The Illiad is much better  were so ahead of their time we find Homer being praised in the writtings of many famous figures of Greece such as Plato  I highly encourage you read this book having studied the history behind the war previously  I read it in a class in college where all this background information was thoroughly covered and I believe it enhanced the experience of the poem  I cannot emphasize enough  this is a beautiful piece of art  I recommend everyone to read it  I dont read classics often  but this book changed my mind  The Iliad  by Homer  is a Greek poem which provides an in depth and detailed story of the Trojan War  Most wars start over religion or a woman  this one started over a woman  specifically Helen of Troy  Helen was married to Menelaus  who was the brother of the King of Greece  The cities of Troy and Sparta had been at each other s throats for quite some time but their leaders had finally decided to make peace  While the two princes of Troy are in Sparta the youngest one  Paris  has an affair with Helen  Paris falls madly in love with Helen and decides to take her back to Troy  This single act of love creates the nine year long war  While this war started over a woman its truly more about a fight for honor and the glory of victory  This war also produced some of the greatest names in history  i e  Achilles  Diomedies  Nestor  and the great war strategist  Odysseus  This book has something for everyone  It provides a great story about a very famous part of history with a backdrop of romance  anger  betrayal  love but mostly war  The intrigue and suspense keep you turning the pages and rooting for different people throughout the book  People interested in war and the strategy of war would be most drawn to this book  I give this book three stars  I liked it mainly because I really enjoy Greek mythology and history  I would think if you were in the military or working to become a leader in the military that this book would be really interesting  It began with the love of a woman but the book really is all about war  It gives you the perspective of those who won and those who lost a lot during the nine year period   This book is hard to like if you don t understand the Greek worldview  The Greeks believed in a system where the main goal was pure glory  or in other words kleos  When the book starts with Achilles supposedly acting like a baby he is justified in walking away because of the glory that Agamemnon was taking from him  Now when Odysseus  Ajax and another come to convince Achilles to join the battle with gifts beyond compare and he refuses  that was wrong because of Agamemnon trying   Another aspect is the gods intervening in basically every chance they get  Them doing this leads man to blaming everything on the gods and not taking any responsibility  In a way man has this right  but not always  In instances the gods clearly warn man but man goes and does exactly what not to do  One example is Paris  His parents knew that Paris was going to burn Troy to the ground  but rightfully so they had trouble killing him as a baby  They left him on a mountain where he was found by a shepherd and asked by the three petty goddesses who was prettier   I thought Pope s was the translation for me  until at last I listened to Keats and not the critics  and tried George Chapman s  It has to be both  although they go ill together when you put a passage side by side   I had to stop that   did Pope a disservice  It remains true  for me  that nothing  no one  ever  can beat Pope s opening  these lines   Achilles  wrath    such is the will of Jove    I admit it  I can hardly read the Greek and Roman classics  There is something about the way they are on the page that just defeats me  Listening to them is another matter  Hearing Sir Derek Jacobi read The Iliad is pure pleasure  The pictures of the battles that form in the mind are so vivid as you listen to that wonderful voice  Just thinking of the phrase  the wine dark sea   gives me a thrill  What a difference decades make  I read this in high school  college and several times In grad school  writing a few papers on epic theory  but never enjoyed it as I do now  Never appreciated how inventive he was with metaphor  or with his unique way of depicting character by pitting aspects of the self in human vs the gods  Never enjoyed it so much for the story of it as I did this time  Fortunately I enjoyed Homers classics a second time in college while taking Ancient Greek history  He demands a lot of concentration as do all classics not written in this century  but once you have locked into iambic pentameter and made friends with the Greek gods  hold on  because it is an epic adventure  Oh   the rosy fingers of dawn      I look forward to indulging in this again  The Iliad is an epic poem  written by Homer  about a part of the Trojan War  that takes place just before the Greeks arrive at Troy  The book follows both the actions of the two armies and those of the Greek Gods  showing how the Gods are in control of the mortal world  The book is filled for the most part with violent fighting between the Ahkians  Greeks  and the Trojans  but also contains the quarrels and actions of the Gods  Homer s writing itself is filled with lengthy similes and descriptions of characters  which may be difficult for people without a lot of stamina or patience to enjoy  His writing  while being very descriptive  often seems to lack an emotional attachment to the characters  and if any emotion is present  then it is the impacts of the character s death upon their friends or family  Also  Homer spends a great deal of time on descriptions of just about everything from where a dying character was born and how they were raised to the silver bands on a pair of greaves  Personally  I liked the amount of detail  since it allows a view of what things were like in Ancient Greece  though the sheer amount of description could be boring for many people  The only thing in the book that I disliked was how Homer ended the book  it seemed as though he had stopped at the end of a chapter and decided not to continue to the end of the war  Even so  the rest of the book flowed smoothly  As for the translation  it seemed to be very good  Nothing stood out to me as being roughly translated  and the book flowed smoothly  The only thing to mention is that the names of the characters are not their modern versions  like Hector being spelled with a k instead of a c   Overall  I found the book to be readable and enjoyable  I would recommend this book to anyone who likes classics  Ancient Greece  or to anyone with enough patience  It captures a good portion of the Trojan War  and also the Greek heroes and Gods  The battles can be lengthy and the descriptions are tedious  but it is truly a enjoyable book Una de las mejores lecturas del ano  un clasico que de verdad no esperaba que me iba a encantar tanto  Mas que la historia detras del relato y la literatura sus personajes junto a los hechos hicieron que de verdad se convirtiera en unos de los clasicos que mas me gustan hasta ahora  Hay tantas cosas de que hablar sobre este libro que no me alcanzan para explicarlas aqui  Sin duda  Aquiles fue la estrella del relato y el que mas se llevo mi corazon de una forma complicado Por otro lado  batalle como todos para poder leer esta pieza  pero al final le encontre el gusto y de verdad me deje llevar hasta terminarlo Magnifica obra de verdad  no es mentira los que muchos me decian  aunque lo unico que debo agregar es que no es para todos y que debe ser leida al momento adecuado  sino no se puede encontrar la verdadera belleza detras de este libro   Although I could say that I read this because I m self teaching Classics A level  I think it s really more appropriate to say that I chose to do the A level so that I could read and commit a reasonable amount of time to Homer  I knew I d enjoy it before I started reading it   there s something inevitably interesting in Homer  just in trying to understand the place he has in Western literature  There s little else with such a good recommendation as him  My commitment to writing reviews here was that I wanted to capture my emotional response to whatever I read  more than to make note of anything technical  Perhaps   unoriginal thought as it is   the most striking thing I found was how much emotional response it did evoke  It didn t consistantly have me on edge but particularly towards the end I was enthralled in the world of the Iliad  anxious for it s heroes  pitying Hector  enraged by Achilles  I was surprised how easy it was to understand the same experience as a man who lived three thousand years ago  I was really taken in by that  I think it was perhaps  more than anything  structural things that reminded me of it s place in history that I was reading something so old  Sometimes it feels more like a collection of short stories than a singular work   one tale can feel profoundly human and representative of a universal  relatable culture  whilst the next book will be a portrayal of an unfamiliar culture and feel an emotionally inadequate sequel to previous book  The catalogue technique  although I had seen it before in the bible and imitated in The Great Gatsby  felt antiquitated  although it created an impression of a great  un navigable scale of war  it makes sense in an epic   it felt out of place or like a weak writer s technique and undermined the build up of tension  encouraged skimming bits of the text entirely  which obviously  is not so important to an oral poet as a modern writer   this was a sort of reminder that what I was reading was incredibly old  I m reading the early parts of my bible at the same time as I read this  and I have to point out that I thought the parallels between the two were fascinating  The small contrasts between the two cultures are nice to explore   the contrasting way similar sacrifices were made was interesting  the Greeks usually sacrifice before acting  whereas the Hebrews only sacrifice to redeem themselves  the Greeks make voluntary sacrifices and choose what to sacrifice themselves whereas the Hebrews are instructed by God the precise nature of each sacrifice  the Greek culture celebrates it s heroes and motivates through pride and honour  the Hebrew culture revolves around the idea of guilt  The gods in Homer are far less frightening  and far less impressive  than the God of the Hebrews  I thought the characterisation felt more real than it did in the Odyssey  I was taken in at different moments by Patroclus  Hector and Achilles in particular  whereas in the Odyssey  I found Odysseus himself quite hard to access  for all his  perfection   and only really was impressed by the way Telemachus developed  I think that particular observation is something I ll try to use when defending the view that only tragic heroes  ones who feel guilt and who suffer  are the only ones we can relate to   because guilt and suffering is the vital part of our nature  I m moving on to read the  Cambridge Companion to Homer   as follow up reading for this one  I do tend to follow up everything I read by at least reading a couple of reviews  but there s such a wealth of critical history for Homer that I think committing to a book this sort of size is worthwhile  I think it might give me more understanding than I need for the exam I m preparing for but more knowledge is probably necesarry to compensate for the complete lack of professional tuition  This book told the stories of a mythical soldier Achilles and his fight against the prince of Troy  Hector  It was also about the king of Sparta Menelaus and his war against the Trojan prince Paris  over the beautiful Helen  The book does a great job of narrating the whole story until the very end of the battle even when the god s themselves partake in the war  Like many of us  I found reading this as an adult very different from my grudging experience of it in high school  There were so many beautiful passages   Homer s flights of simile are truly lovely  But on the other hand  the violence was hard to wade through  52 ways to kill a guy with a sword or spear as graphically as possible   eww  and the casual references to raping and enslaving women were hard to read  OK  OK  I know it was the culture  but still  By the end  too  my family was really tired of hearing me spout off about what an idiot Achilles is  pouting in his tent for nearly 2 3 of the book while the battle wages on and on  And how about those annoying and meddlesome pesky gods  Goading on the soldiers to yet more slaughter  bringing in fog  or whisking their favorites to safety   and their personal battles were even more vindictive  But you can see why it is considered a classic  On to the Odyssey  Miles Jochem  Editorial Intern  Tin House Magazine   In a throwback to my freshman humanities class at college  I have been reading The Iliad  tr  Richmond Lattimore   It s amazing how well the story of the strong greaved Achaians  swift footed Achilleus  and Hektor  breaker of horses holds up by modern standards  and I love me some Homeric epithets    Sure  there are dry moments  All but the most stalwart classicist will be bored to tears by the catalogue of ships  But there s more than enough excitement to counterbalance the mustier of the epic conventions  Lust driven  jealous gods fighting over arrogant  adulterous kings  more epic battle scenes than all the Die Hard movies combined  and the downright soap opera that plays out between angry Achilleus and proud Agamemnon over a pilfered girlfriend all combine to ensure the millennia enduring popularity of Homer s great poem  The Iliad is a brutal reading experience  but   rereading it after many years in Fagles  powerful translation   I felt more than ever its stunning power as a work of art  Here are a few reflections This must be one of the most violent works ever composed  and how odd that it leaves one with an overwhelming sense of compassion  That flows from the pathos the poem constantly evokes by bringing together the soldiers  humanity with visceral descriptions of their fates  as well as many other details that conjure the peaceful hinterland to the warfare  These themes culminate in the poem s denouement  when Hector is killed and Priam comes to Achilles  tent to reclaim his body  The meaning of the entire poem is distilled in this encounter  Achilles an amazing example of a character without interiority  its absence is a key to his strength  And yet by the poem s conclusion he has changed  Perhaps you can t exactly say he knows himself better  but he has become something other than the fierce agent of his impulse to victory and glory What other work maintains such intensity over such length  Paradise Lost  certainly  The Divine Comedy perhaps  Nothing else comes close I find convincing the case Bernard Knox puts in his Introduction that this is the product of a single artistic vision  Forget images of the untutored bard  or the idea that the poem was produced by a lineage of oral compositors  The Iliad s compression and precision can only be the product of a single shaping mind  It is a remarkable and daring feat of story telling that focuses on a single  intense period of the siege of Troy  The action is driven by Achilles who is absent for the majority of its length  In fact  I wonder if The Iliad really is an epic in the same way as The Odyssey  It seems rather the precursor to the tragedies and even the modern novel  I very much appreciate the taut  expressive sinuous language of Fagles  translation  which is far superior to the others I know  not that I have studied this   I especially enjoyed the vividness of his verbs  there s scarcely a  he was  or  they are  to be found   Recently read the Lattimore translation  which is based on the Greek  while concurrently listening to an audio version based on the Latin  It was more of a fun exercise   not for academic purposes   that I found to be rather stimulating  I stopped short of going all the way and watching Troy again      Anyways  I ve heard scholars claim that the Lattimore translation is the best  and I certainly enjoyed this reading better than the one I read in college with the Fagle s translation  but that is probably due to maturity and taste than anything    I m not enough of an expert to judge the difference  Either way  Homer was a master story teller and his ability to critique and comment on the worldview  collective and individual  of his day while writing an engaging and tense drama is a skill that is rarely accomplished in modern times   I see why people are still reading this book 3 200 years later  It s amazing  Beautiful imagery throughout  What s striking is how much nature factors in to similes and metaphors  which makes sense  because there was hardly anything else to compare it to  No Biblical allusions  no comparisons to anything invented past the bronze age  not even a mention of writing except for when someone marks a rock with a single vertical line The story is fantastic  encompassing a series of battles between the Trojan and Achaeans  The momentum shifts back and forth several times  Then the Gods get involved  The Gods have their own alliances  rivalries  and petty concerns that cause them to interfere with the humans  war I loved it  It s an entertaining page turner that s only slightly less violent than a Cormac McCarthy novel  A wonderful masterpiece by Homer that fascinates you from the opening pages  Although the epic is centered around the Trojan War  particularly on the last weeks in the final year of the war  but it is filled with stories and myths that go far in the past  narrating stories of both illustrious men as well as gods  The epic tackles many themes and topics  perhaps  the most important one is the individual glory  Kleos   where every hero in the epic seeks to achieve his personal glory and a sort of guarantee eternity in life that lasts beyond one s death  Other topics and themes include anger  honor  hospitability vs  ingratitude  treason  the power of speech  desperation low spirits vs  motivation  courage and facing death  the power of the situation and the necessity to kill in war  the crazy nature of war  the relationships between humans and gods  prophecy  deception  the inevitability of fate  the longing of many characters to go home and to one s family  and the powerful role of the parents  legacy and heroism  which their children should consider as glorious examples to be imitated  Other points that are essential too might be the importance of the religious rituals and giving sacrifices to the gods  as well as the importance of providing the dead with appropriate rituals and funeral  The scene I loved the most was when Hector was with his wife Andromache and their little child Astyanax on the city wall  because his son was afraid of the helmet  which is associated with war   he removes it  and then kisses his son  who is now smiling and comfortable  It shows that Hector  although a warrior  has a human side and emotions and is a loving parent  The scene which I found very touching is when Priam goes to Achilles to plea to Achilles for the dead body of his dearest son  Hector  and the amazing reaction of Achilles  The depiction of gods and their behaviors and emotions  as well as their biases and side taking was so beautiful  It was surprsing to see that Gods were sometimes acting in a way similar to humans  jealousy   Finally  it is painful to see the destructive consequences of war  the long lasting damages and harms it can cause to the individual  country city  people  families  and the generations  The language was so beautiful and the epic was an enchanting work I enjoyed very much  The Iliad is a great story of the Trojan War  There is hips being crushed by rocks swords through the back of heads and then through eyes  and much more blood spilling  I thought books could not be bloody  I was wrong the Iliad is more bloody then Jaws  I love this book                                                                    To read the Iliad without this course would be to miss the heart and soul of the story  Vandiver is an excellent professor   thorough and insightful   and her grasp on classical mythology and Ancient Greek culture is undeniable  She uncovers and explores so many details that most readers would otherwise miss   I certainly would never categorize this as a  favorite  book  for it is raw and heartbreaking in its depiction of mankind in ancient times  Yet I do feel the richer for having read and studied it  My main takeaway is the realization of how very little mankind has changed over the centuries  A work of staggering power  Perhaps next to Tolstoy  there is no text that communicates the horror of sustained brutality  the horrors of organized violence  and the endless cycles of death perpetuated by vengeance  Our Canon begins here  and it is a fitting place to start  Great translationI m not a scholar of Ancient Greece  and I don t have anything new to say about The Iliad  I recommend the most recent audio version narrated by Dan Smith  The story comes alive when you here it recited as it was meant to be heard  The Classic of the Classics   The Epic poem that lived for thousands of years     This is one of my accomplishments this year  p I have read the Iliad        Something that lived as long as this  Poem  lived a flag issue with the translation will always rise    it s difficult to keep something so long in its original or even nearly original form    I avoided my native translation  _  they never or at least I have never encountered a decent work by them  _  they have many taboos to get around  _  I set to find one of the suitable first time with this work till I settled with the Robert Fagles edition keeping in mind that one day I ll re read it by Fitzgerald Lattimore     With Fagles I didn t get the sense of rhythmic verses  but he tried his best I think or much accurate translation of the word  On the other hand the language was so simple and understandable that you could go through all of it without any difficulties The story itself was Epic  and maybe even epic is not an enough word to describe it    The Trojan War Saga    The heroes Achilles  Hector  Ajax  Diomedes  Agamemnon  Odysseus  Patroclus    the gods Zeus  Hera  Athena  Apollo  Poseidon  Ares     the events  the tactics  the honor  the fights  the war     It was great The thing that bothered me in the story were with every conflict a woman was behind it    why in hell I drag an army and stand for 10 years  10 years  outside the walls of Troy for her  Zeus Hera Achilles Agamemnon     It always came down to a woman    but the reason behind the war  O 10 years is a very long time and I can see that logic of there is no going back after that long time    One way or another it will end    And you think after going through the whole poem you will witness the fall of Troy    and guess what it will not happen here    and maybe that s a port of its epicness   Other thing  how the gods behaved  their up in Olympus and they have nothing better to do    the little cwarel between them deciding fates and choosing sides    and how Zeus was that big bad not in the way of his power in how he treated everyone else  _ The finale books were the greatest when finally Achilles joined the war    his fight with Hector  the actions of the gods in the battle field  the games after the funeral    I liked those one better than first books All the killings and the gore on the battlefiled was great  each death was focused upon with much detail    too much blood on both sides  But I really didn t care about the Trojans  Maybe for Hector a little in the beginning as he had to do it but going towards the end I had no problem with what Achilles did to him I really liked it    Now to the Odyssey     This epic war story  e g  Trojan War   and its sequel  the Odyssey are foundational to much of Western literature  I found Fagles translation to be quite readable  and the introduction and notes to be invaluable  Probably the most revealing truth found in this work is the belief that mortal man is a reflection of his gods  In Knox s excellent introduction  we read  The Olympian gods are a family like many a family on earth  It has an all powerful  philandering father  who cannot be defied but may be deceived  a watchful  jealous and intriguing wife  and sons and daughters who vie for their parents  favor as they pursue their individual aims   Compare this with the God of Israel  the God of the Bible  the contrast could not be greater  One of the most violent books I ve ever read  and one of the most spiritual  I wish we lived in a time when the gods walked among us  were woven into the cultural fabric of our everyday lives  Guess I m going to have to read the sequel now   I will read this again What an unforgettable experience this has been  I have laboured over Iliad this last month and a rewarding one it has been This massive poem was written in 750 BC by Homer  Poetic  lyrical  it reads like nothing I have read before  A brutal poem on the inescapable tides of fate and a celebration on the meaningless brutality of war It begins in the middle of the Trojan War and ends far before the end and covers the story arc starting with Agamemnon offending the god Apollo  Agamemnon s judgement being clouded by the goddess folly  resulting in his insulting Achilles and the war between the Trojans and Achaens that follows Most of the book is gory  graphic descriptions of brutal killings in war  Every scene of killing is beautifully described  Homer probably sat with his quill and thought    Let me count the ways to kill thee    The best parts of the book are the gods involvement in the war My Gods have always been powerful but good  all knowing  and just  The Greek gods are petty  vengeful  mean spirited and biased  They are awesome  They interfere in the war  favour he who curries to them by sacrificing hecatombs  get annoyed  sulk  cry  behave pettily  plot deviously  fight and bash each other up  The Greek gods are ask powerful and immortal but behave otherwise just as mortals do  Song 21 best depicts the gods at their worst and is my personal favourite As poetic as Iliad is  my favourite passage in it was when Priam goes to Achilles to ransom Hector s body  King Priam kisses the dread murderous hand of Achilles that had slain so many of his sons and makes a heart rending plea to him which includes the line    Fear  O Achilles  the wrath of heavens  think of your own father  and have compassion upon me  who am the more pitiable  for I have steeled myself as no man has ever yet steeled himself before me  and have raised to my lips the hand of him who slew my son   The Iliad is an epic that deserves to be read  I should say one thing though  translation  It makes a world of difference  I tried to read the Fitzgerald translation but it could not capture my attention  I read about 70 pages of it  before I started on this translation  Richmond Lattimore s translation is the one to read  There are disagreements and Fagle s newer translation is popular  but I can t comment on that  Onward to my impressions of the Iliad  I read it about three weeks ago  so it is still fresh on my mind  There are a lot of names  so having one with a glossary is necessary  I loved the prose of the Iliad  I enjoyed learning of the Greek gods  and their interactions  It gave a back story to the names  that I ve heard over the years  The buildup and anticipation of Achilleus reentering drives the story  There is a lot of detail in the war that the Achians waged against the armies of Ilion  I enjoyed every bit of it  I won t say much more  So  if you so dare  Take some time out of your schedule  and read this literary classic  Read this before The Odyssey  since it takes place before the events of it  You will not be disappointed  What masterful storytelling and truly epic imagery is found within the pages of this book  I read another version of this in high school but the Richmond Lattimore version is hands down the best translation  Simply glorious  That is all  I read the Odyssey twice and The Iliad has been on my bucket list for awhile  Finally I committed the time to read it and it was well worth it  That Homer  boy can he tell a story  This is a story of war so it gets pretty violent and gruesome and I will admit there were times the battles went on too long and then  I would get caught up again in the prose It s also the story of Achilles   a hero   how is quick to anger  full of pride  and ruthless  Here s the thing  like the Odyssey  I was reading a story I was already familiar with   I mean  I know the story of the Iliad yet still  I was caught up in its unfolding   There is a reason this is a classic and is still read today   and it s because it is truly great   The Iliad is a timeless piece of literature with lessons for us all  and this Fagles translation brings it vividly alive  To see my review visit http   anzlitlovers wordpress com 201     Rage Goddess  sing of the rage of Peleus  son Achilles  murderous doomed that cost the Achaeans countless losses  hurling down to the House of the Dead so many sturdy souls  So begins the greatest of the epic poems  Most of us are only vaguely aware of the poem  We normally read The Odyssey in high school  The Iliad itself is too big to be read in class  It is a class all by itself One of the most heartbreaking and moving passages is Achilles news of the death of his friend and lover Patroclus  I have read a couple of military history books  one by a Medal of Honor winner  The pain over loosing a comrade in arms is something I cannot understand unless I myself am in combat  Reading that scene helps me in a way to see the comradeship formed by men at war and the death and carnage they experience  The loss one feels over the death of a comrade must be unbearable  It gives me a respect for the men and women who go to war  Many will be surprised to hear that the Trojan Horse does not appear  Sorry to spoil it  but I think I should let you know before you pick it up  You will have to read The Aeneid by Virgil for that memorable scene   Lombardo s translation did what no other translation has done  made me like the Iliad  Despite my dislike of the main character  Achilles  and of the theme setting  war  I still managed to enjoy reading this epic   The scene where Ares is gutted by Diomedes spear is spectacular  The notion that a mortal  albeit helped by a god  can injure a god is so radical  and let s face it  just plain awesome P S  Achilles is a wuss  I love Hector and Andromache more each time I read this story  but I just can t understand why the Trojans didn t give up Helen and toss Paris over the city walls to suffer his deserved fate   Far be it from me to presume to review this classic work of Homer s  but I will comment on this particular translation by Robert Fagan  Fagan translates it using modern language and idiom  but without losing the sense of its original form as a poem written in verse  This made it quite easy to read while still getting the feeling of a story being passed down from almost 3000 years ago One helpful feature of the book was an extensive glossary of names    of which there are hundreds mentioned in the text    along with the pronunciation of each one I am always struck in these writings at how easy it is to understand some of the human elements and emotions of people who were not that different from us in many ways  while at the same time operating under belief systems that are totally foreign to us  If you think you know this story but have never really experienced it  you owe it to yourself to read it at least once in all its  literally  gory details  I really enjoyed The Iliad by Homer  I thought the plot was engrossing despite difficult to comprehend at times  as so much happened  I had to put down the book to run through what I had just read  I also found it hard to differentiate between POV s at times  With it being one of the two or three foundational texts for all of western culture  I definitely appreciated what it taught about the depth of insight into human life  and I found myself entertained by the mythology  something I ve always found an interest of mine  The analyzation of the ethics of war in the poem was very insightful and expanded my thoughts on the matter after I was finished reading   Fagles  translation is vivid and immediate  It brings the deathless gods and the death defying mortals into strong relief  It s amazing  I am floored by this book   I loved this book even though I did not finish it  I got exactly half way through  The book was great because of the way it tied back to their believes about the gods  I also liked how there was conflict with in conflict  like what was going on with Achilles and Agamemnon  It also does not help the fact that after the arguing Achilles ran off  He did make up for it by giving away his armor which then again was stripped from another s body  It also does not help that every one knows about the Trojan war so any one can write about this book  I would recommended this book to any one that really loves about history about the Greek gods   Reread May 2013  I always remember that I love the Iliad  but somehow I forgot the sheer sass of the taunting  So much hilarious battle taunting   Great plot  very descriptive fighting scenes  however there were many slowly flowing areas of the book that really weren t that interesting  Whether cavemen throwing rocks  Greeks thrusting spears  or drones launching Hellfire missiles it s a sad fact that human beings are pretty good at fighting each other  One recent scientific study even suggests our hands evolved in order to throw better punches And because our nature hasn t really changed in the past thirty two centuries   1200 B C  being the latest consensus for when Homer s  real  Trojan War occurred    The Iliad  speaks to us just as well as it spoke to the citizens of Greek city states constantly at war Yet  last week  I could count on one hand the number of people I know that have read the tale  actually  one finger  But now I can raise a second finger I won t gussy up the facts  Epic poetry is a struggle for the modern reader  It s true that a good translation can increase readability while staying true to the original spirit  and I picked up the Robert Fagles version for those very reasons  based on this review   Still  the world of Homer s poem is largely unfamiliar and filled with a daunting number of characters Luckily  like most good stories  the action focuses on a select few while the majority serve as minor or background characters  Also like most good stories  this one has it all  fantasy in the form of meddlesome gods  neck breaking action  literally and figuratively   and a deep analysis of human nature I m sure a few of you had  The Iliad  thrust upon you during your secondary or higher education days  quickly skimmed  quickly forgotten  Most of us think we know what it s about  I know I was surprised to learn that the story wasn t about the Trojan War and some big  fake horse  The horse isn t even mentioned here  The first eight lines of the poem sum up the story quite well  Rage  Goddess  sing the rage of Peleus  son Achilles murderous  doomed  that cost the Achaeans countless losses hurling down to the House of Death so many sturdy souls great fighters  souls  but made their bodies carrion feasts for the dogs and birds and the will of Zeus was moving toward its end Begin  Muse  when the two first broke and clashed Agamemnon lord of men and brilliant Achilles  In essence   The Iliad  dramatizes the consequences of a demigod spurned  Achilles is a renowned warrior who s been slighted by the Achaean commander  King Agamemnon  As a result  Achilles sits out the war while his mother convinces Zeus to make the Achaeans pay And pay they do  Only when Achilles  loses his best friend to the spear of noble Hector  does he have a change of heart  bury his anger at Agamemnon  and unleash his fury upon the Trojan armies The Trojan War  bewitching Helen  quarrels between the gods  these are all set pieces through which the consequences of Achilles  anger play out and peace remains a distant  often temporary  concept Following Mortimer J  Adler s advice  I read  The Iliad  once just to orientate myself  Yep  it was a struggle  My mind constantly wandered as I grew overwhelmed with so much unfamiliar material  The second reading was more exciting  because I could focus on subtext and the plain beauty of Homer s words Still  there is no way to absorb all that a story like  The Iliad  has to offer in two readings  let alone one  I will undoubtedly come back to it again with new perspectives  excited to discover what else may reveal itself As an added benefit  the Fagles book has a great Introduction  Resisting the obvious  I highly recommend reading it after you ve read through the poem one time  It will be more useful as he references parts of the story while tackling its history  current thoughts on who really wrote the thing  and the skilled intelligence through which the story is told If  like me  your knowledge of Greek storytelling begins with Ray Harryhausen movies and ends with Hercules  The Legendary Journeys   Xena Warrior Princess  I encourage you to spend some quality time with Homer  You won t regret it  I like Fagles s translation best   the lines leap  this is the most savage  destructive  chilling  and gory book I have ever read    I didn t actually read the widely praised Fagles translation of The Iliad  I read a translation by my brother  who is an independent scholar and writer  www williamguy com He began translating The Iliad on a whim  when he had a student who wanted to translate a few lines  The student soon quit  but my brother continued I have no idea how his translation is  since I don t know Greek  but the language of the poem is magnificent  as is the entire work  I don t think I had read it since college  or maybe I d read it once since then  There are so many things one could praise  the language itself  the structure  the marvelous storytelling  The Iliad is one of the wonders of world literature  I had forgotten this  but I would say that it is the most violent work of art I ve ever encountered  including any movie I ve ever watched  Like all truly great works about war  it is profoundly anti war  At the end of all this fighting  absolutely no one is happy  everyone is in mourning  The whole thing seems pointless  All builds to  He fell  thunderously  to the horror of all the Achaian people   Doesn t get much better than that  Fight fight barbecue  mope  argue  fight fight barbecue  chariot race   fight  barbecue  fight  The first and one of the greatest books ever written  A fast paced and accessible translation   Este livro e um dos maiores classicos da historia  e tentar escrever qualquer coisa sobre ele ja me faz sentir intimidado  Esta fantastica obra de Homero e enorme  porem nao muito densa  Li em um ritmo muito agradavel  de um livro por dia  junto do livro de acompanhamento da minha traducao  e acabei ate me divertindo  Sem duvidas fui pego de surpresa em muitos aspectos que parecem ate serem modernos dessa obra  e a primeira coisa que me surpreendeu e como o poema flui tao bem  Como disse  a Iliada e uma obra muito mais moderna que eu imaginava  Os personagens de Homero  embora em maioria presos no modelo do tipico heroi grego  sao surpreendentemente humanos  ate para os padroes de hoje em dia  Claro que temos  tropes  de personagens que sao extremamente antiquados  afinal  o poema foi composto para os gregos de 2700 anos atras  Mesmo assim  Homero explora os seus personagens muito bem  criando um  roster  muito completo de varios herois  que representam um leque impressionante de tipos de personalidades  Uma coisa que me surpreendeu e como Homero trabalha fantasticamente com o simbolismo  principalmente entre a relacao entre Hector e Aquiles  que so fiz depois que acabei o livro e o deixei cozinhar um pouco na cabeca  O contraste entre os personagens principais da trama e feito com um toque de mestre e o seu simbolismo e composicao sao quase que naturais  Os mesmos elogios se aplicam a analise feita ao personagem de Aquiles como o  heroi individual   Homero trabalhou muito bem para compor um poema que e bastante lindo  mas ao mesmo tem camadas de caracterizacao e comentario tematico profundas mas sutis  principalmente relevantes aos mitos e a condicao do heroi  Um problema que encontrei no livro foi o uso muito comum de nomes  Todo soldado citado na guerra era um heroi  portanto Homero nos dava seu nome e geralmente sua origem e uma historia sobre sua grandeza  Isso  junto com o uso abundante de epitetos para todo tipo de personagem  acaba sendo meio confuso e ate chato de se ler no comeco  Porem  conforme voce vai se acostumando com a obra  voce comeca a gostar e ate notar que sem esses detalhes  Homero nao seria Homero  O uso de diversas tecnicas de composicao e o que torna seu poema tao belo de se ler  Outra coisa que me incomodou no livro por um tempo  foi o fato de que quase absolutamente tudo que acontece e atribuido aos deuses  dando quase merito algum para ninguem alem deles  Mas apos certa pesquisa  eu entendi que um heroi aceita essa vida de  receptaculo  da vontade divina como o seu chamado  e isso e parte do que compreende um tipico heroi grego e homerico  Essa diferenca que me incomodou durante boa parte do livro  e cultural  e apos entender o verdadeiro motivo por tras disso  nao me incomodou mais  Pode ser meio frustrante sentir que nada na Iliada tem impacto verdadeiro criado pelos personagens  mas ajuda pensar que para os gregos apenas o fato de um heroi receber a ajuda de um deus ja dizia tudo sobre o seu proprio merito e valor  Foi completamente essencial o uso de um guia especifico para a minha traducao  feita por Richard Lattimore  O livro foi escrito para os gregos da epoca e portanto as diversas referencias a mitos obscuros   lendas urbanas  da epoca  uso de nomes regionais e citacoes geograficas sao realmente confusas sem um guia  Os gregos e troianos sao chamados por diversos nomes  muitas vezes correspondidos as suas regioes especificas  O guia explica a traducao linha por linha e ate ajuda em explicar o motivo do tradutor ter escolhido certas palavras e ate mostra onde ele errou ou podia ter feito uma melhor traducao  Para finalizar  tenho nada alem de elogios sobrando para a Iliada  Essa obra de Homero sobrevive ao teste do tempo com facilidade  e mesmo que nao sobrevivesse  so o seu status como uma heranca primordial da civilizacao ocidental ja garante seu merito como uma leitura essencial para qualquer que tenha interesse em aprofundar se no berco de nossa cultura atual   Excellent  This deserves its place in Western literature  Simply beautiful  and at heart  its message is clear   war is beautiful  but the consequences are destructive and awful  so richly cemented by the descriptions of those slain in combat  Fight for your honour and principles  but never needlessly  That  I suppose  is the message  But this simply was fantastic to read regardless of what you think of it  Like war or not  there is something for everybody  It s required reading and honestly  deserves to be  Though I will admit   Hector shouldn t have died  Achilles should ve  A very awful  spiteful man  But anywho  good  good  good  A wonderful book if a tad repetitive  Contains many  glorious and violent scenes too    One of my favorite book from growing up  that and the Odyssey and Beowulf  What a finish  I m still trying to come to grips with The Iliad  It is no wonder that this ode has stood the test of time  It has it all  intense violence  jealousy  love  seething hatred  quirky polytheism and above all  drama  Despite being nearly 3000 years old  these characters are relevant  and Homer makes you care about what happens to them That explains why this tale is still so compelling  The books dealing with Hector and Achilles are breathtakingly exciting and heartbreaking at the same time and will stay with me for a long time I mostly read the more recent Fagles translation but also downloaded the Samuel Butler translation on my phone and they are both excellent  I think I will give a slight nod to the Butler out of a preference for his era  Add this one to your  must read  list  You won t regret it   This is a brilliant  albeit idiosyncratic  translation of The Iliad by Peter Green  What is interesting  for well read fans of Homer  is the way this reading presents the story for those with no Greek  There is an excellent introduction with lots of notes  and a select bibliography for those wishing to learn more about the epic and the history of the region Particularly interesting is the manner in which the book was designed around the concept of the work as it would function within the oral tradition  from which it emerged  Peter Green s translation has a real chance of becoming the new standard English translation  Highly Recommended for fans of Homer and those looking for an introduction to the world of the Homeric epic  A MUST READ BOOK  Rating  5 out of 5 stars   None Why did this book made me cry  The Illiad  by Homer in my opinion one of the worlds first tales to describe a lot of different feelings  emotions  and themes  It consists of a collection of many different tales  All of them describe the Trojan War  Originaly The Illiad wasn t written  but was told in the form of a song by Homer  Who collected all of these tales and combined them into one song  That s very impressing considering this tales length  I recomend this book to those who enjoy greek mythology  and to people who like to think about what they read  listening and reading    really great A timeless masterpiece  Team Diomedes for

nos puede aparecer en las manos en tres versiones  Una traduccion elegante  epica  respetuosa con el original  en poema y dificil de digerir  una traduccion amistosa y respetuosa pero que no conserva

version no adaptada  aunque mejor la  traducida   The Iliad is an enticing Greek epic poem originally by Homer  also writer of The Odyssey  The Iliad is about the Trojan War  between the Trojans  and Greeks  or more commonly referred to in the story as the Achaeans  The war began when Paris  a royal Trojan prince  steels Helen  considered the most beautiful woman in all of the ancient world prized valuable royal asset to Menelaus  king of the Achaeans  This act prompts the Achaeans to attack the Trojans and the Trojans to defend Troy  creating the war  The conflict involves many long and strenuous battles  as well as blood drawing one on one duels between superior warriors  The book The Iliad explorers many philosophical ideas about life and the essence of humans upon earth and what is done in the time given  This is primarily done through the protagonist  Achilles  who had been foretold would have a short life  This book  due to it s origin in Greek culture  by famed writer Homer  lends itself to have a very challenging essence  Because of this  sometimes passages must be read many times and must be thought about to understand what is trying to be conveyed  Overall  this was a great book  and the tantalizing themes and intensive literature only add to its comprehensive plot and structure   The Illiad is one of the oldest and most celebrated works of literature of western civilization  a classic among classics  no world literature class would be complete without it  It is part of the western heritage  from it come phrases like  Trojan horse   Yet  being a classic  it may intimidate some readers  especially given its form as epic poetry  Barbara Leonie Picard s interpretation of it into a prose should make this lovely piece of western history open to a wider audience  especially considering her introduction and epilogue  and the use of bronze and gold plate illustrations which hearken to ancient Greek pottery The story is set during the Trojan War  a decade long conflict between the city states of Greece and the state of Troy and its allies  The feud has its roots in mythology  with Paris    a young prince of Troy    judging a beauty contest of goddesses and being rewarded with the queen of Sparta  Helen  as his bride  Since Helen is already married to Menelaus  this causes something of a problem    and the Greeks invade Troy  where they lay siege for ten years  The Illiad is a story of men and pride  for the pride of two Greek warriors divides their army and weakens their cause  It begins when King Agamemnon  leader of the Greek alliance  seizes a woman who Achilles    the greatest Greek warrior   took as a war prize  Achilles is outraged by Agamemnon s arrogance  He abandons the fight and prays to his mother    the goddess Thetis    to ask Zeus to turn the war against Agamemnon  and as the days progress many a Greek will die The official author of The Illiad is a  blind poet  named Homer  In truth  we do not know when the story arose and it is probably the work of multiple generations  the story expanding with every retelling    for this is an ancient story  one originally passed on orally   The use of gods as active characters in the story bears witness to its age  Zeus  Athena  Apollo  and others are not mere background forces  but take an active but sometimes unseen role on the battlefield  They deflect spears and arrows  cast mists to prevent foes from seeing one another  and directly assault the players  Although Zeus    supporting the Trojans    forbids his children from taking part  Athena never abandons her beloved Greeks  and Apollo does not forsake the Trojans  Sometimes the gods work against one another  when a river god tries to drown Achilles for his arrogance  Hephaestus creates fires to keep the water away The Illiad captivated me  although I am familiar with the general story  I have never read it properly and so experienced the feud in full  The relationship between Achilles and the two princes of Troy especially interested me  Paris is a despicable character  and it amused me greatly to see Hector reliably addressing him as  Most wretched brother   The story is far fairer to Hector than I anticipated  he is almost as noble here as when he was portrayed by Eric Bana in Troy  though his behavior at Patroclus  death made me think his corpse s being dragged around the city every day at dawn was something of a just dessert  Perhaps the most striking element of the book is its emphasis on individual heroism  these men are not selfless soldiers of Greece  they fight for glory and reputation  At the same time  there is a bond between them    and sometimes pride bowed before that camaraderie Rarely have I been more entertained by a classic  if you ever have an interest or a need to visit the Illiad  I would suggest looking for this translation  It is commendable   The Fates have given mortals hearts that can endure   24 57 The Illiad is a story of the heart  It is the story of the heart that wells with anger at the sight of enemy and it is the story of the heart that sinks with grief at the death of a loved one  Throughout the epic poem we are reminded that these primordial emotions are at the center of the events  We re told of the heroes fighting  their stories  their families  their lineage  all in exquisite detail  Then  moments later  that same hero may just as well perish as a spear shatters his skull and we get the full effect of his death in gory detail The brilliance in this juxtaposition  these two hearts at war  is that Homer s ring construction is used to detail both  We re able to zoom in on very particular characters who would otherwise be lost in the sea of armies  Further  we zoom in on their deaths  the brutal savagery where this man  a man who meant so much more as family and friend  is reduced to a corpse in excruciating slow motion  Of course  these are techniques largely used to treat the smaller cast  The main heroes  the ones of which Greek audiences need no introduction  these are the centerpiece exhibits of the thematics currents  Most significantly  we have the deaths of Patroclus and Hector  both sharing similar exaltation on their respective sides and likewise eliciting properly large gestures of grief  We see the ripple effects of these deaths on both sides  the same faces of mourning  even the twin funeral processions  which are mirrored in books 23 and 24  What s striking is that these people are so similar  so saddened  so human  but never cease the fighting  In an offhand remark  Priam says that after the last day of respite for the funeral has passed  they will go back to fighting  if necessary  Already they ve ceased the battles  they ve stopped all of it  and they re able to stop precisely because both men understand the depths of grief  But to the ends of this agreement  Achilles coldly replies  Yes  they will go back to fighting  It is then the aforementioned duality of the heart which drives both sides to destruction  Just as each army is so wrecked by defeat  so too are they stirred toward rage and fighting once again  Priam doesn t even exit the Achaean camp before he s got Hermes whispering in his ear that the enemy may kill him in his sleep   thoughts of revenge are already afoot It s worth noting that this advice comes from the Gods themselves  In fact  for the duration of the story we ve seen the horrors on the field mirrored up on Olympus through the bickering of the Gods  Indeed  many of the conflicts we see play out are manifestations of one divine s feud with another  The men below seem little more than puppets  Time and time again  we re reminded that no mortal can change a God s will  Hector and Achilles equally accept their deaths as fate while other times we see soldiers like Aeneas literally picked up and thrown out of the fighting  presumably so he can go found Rome   These processions of life and death are intricately linked with the divine  It seems evident that these two hearts playing out with one another are not purely a failure of man  but a deep seated truth of the universe  So long as there are men on Earth  there will be rage and ruin in their hearts  this is fate  And what may we do  We may endure  I don t think I could give this book any less than 5 5  Although I did lose some interest around the midway point  with lots and lots of namedropping and lots and lots of fighting   so many parts earlier on and towards the end were breathtakingly stunning  I found myself riveted throughout Book 20  Olympian Gods in Arms   and teared up a few times from Hector s death onwards  What most captivated me about the Iliad was the humanisation of the enemy  with the Trojans being depicted as noble  brave  and pious people  even winning the sympathy of some Olympian gods  To end this text with the funeral of the Trojan prince  rather than any comment on the Greek armies or the deceased Greek soldiers  seems incredibly progressive and just  Further  for a text so central to Classical Greek thought and identity  eg featuring so many heroes  I was surprised at how much emphasis was placed on the tragedy of war  rather than the glory  War is depicted as destroying young men in the prime of youth  tearing apart families  and instead of being offered a portrait of the victorious troops  we are repeatedly presented with scenes of parents grieving over their dead sons  widows mourning their husbands and their now fatherless children  and most vividly  men angrily unable to accept the death of their lifelong friends  While I admit to finding a bulk of the centre text a bit tedious  with  lots and lots of fighting   perhaps the point is to overwhelm us with this violence before showing us the aftermath  the funerals  the tears  the rage filled vengeance  The message of the Iliad seems to be echoed in the words of Herodotus a few hundred years later   No one is stupid enough to prefer war to peace  in peace sons bury their fathers and in war fathers bury their sons   This classic text has such a seminal place in literature  both ancient and modern  and Western culture in general  I m glad I finally got around to reading it  I was surprised that many of the stories you hear about the Trojan war were not actually from the Iliad  The story of the Trojan horse  for example  apparently comes from Virgil s Aeneid  which follows the exploits of Aeneas after the fall of Troy The story is obviously great  Everyone pretty much knows the broad strokes of it  what I m writing about here is the translation  I can t read Greek and have not read other translations  but I recognize in this translation a respect and approximate rendering of many of literary devices that Greek and Latin poets employed Although some of the lines may sound contrived to modern ears  I ve never appreciated those translators who either cut material that they believe the modern reader would not understand or appreciate  or simplify the story by dropping antiquated references  or expound overmuch in their translations trying to represent foreign words and phrases with no direct translations  Pope gives the reader a short synopsis of what s coming at the beginning of the chapter  and afterwards leaves the reader  more or less  to fend for himself  He doesn t ruin the flow of the story by inserting extra lines to explain each time that Telamon is the big Ajax  that Pelides is Achilles  that the Cyprian goddess is Venus  etc  I prefer it that way And on top of avoiding the things that I dislike in translation  I think Pope s translation flows nicely and has compelling images and feeling  I don t like bland translations  That s not a problem with Pope  who fearlessly translates passages where someone s entrails fall out onto the ground or a spear crushes their teeth I liked it  I m overwhelmingly grateful that Barry B  Powell did not use the word  careering  in his translation of Homer s Iliad  That word jarred me all through a previous translator s translation  name withheld to protect my own backside   It is an ugly  unfortunate word which in my mind wars against its very definition  It was like riding with a driver who slams heavily on the brakes at every stop  annoying and exhausting  Perhaps I m overreacting  but this is my review  so I think that is my prerogative  Right  Well  anyway  back to Powell s welcome translation Apart from a few typos  The funniest is when  gods  is put in for  dogs  in book 24 line 402  which makes it sound like the gods eat humans  Wrong religion  I think   and at least one place where a footnote is indicated but nonexistent  22 327   knees    and a few notes which a quick glance at a few other translations would solve     the most troublesome example is book 24 lines 44 46  Here Powell translates the Greek aidos as  respect   which I think really only works in it s old connotation  i e  and e g  the phrase from the King James Bible   God is no respecter of persons   Acts 10 34   In that way  i e  respecting another s opinion of you can cause harm   For a more thorough look at this idea  read  Bertrand Russell s The Conquest of Happiness  where he writes       the respect of their neighbors depends upon their possession of a good car and their ability to give good dinners       The other translations I looked at chose to use  shame   which makes it more evident how it can harm as well as help      this is a wonderful translation  It is easy to read and the copious notes make it a valuable addition to any Homeric geek s bookshelf  There are several places  marked in the text by a speaker icon  which are read by the author  These recordings can be found at the book s website  Unfortunately  this feature is not mentioned in the actual book  I had to dig around online to figure it out  It would have been quite easy to mention it in a footnote  or in the introduction  I can only assume that this was another overlooked and forgotten footnote  Still  I haven t listened to the recordings  so     I am partial to Lattimore s translation  but find Powell s enjoyable and refreshing  if that can be said about such a bloody and violent work  I try not to let those themes keep me from the other  more interesting and pertinent themes for our time  A new translation of Homer s Iliad only serves to show the continued importance of this classic  Of course  as usual  not everyone will agree with that  That s okay  Without the strife of disagreement  the friction necessary for growth would be missed  I plan to reread and reread Powell s wonderful translation  I hope you will read it at least once and decide for yourself if you like it or not  This book is not an easy read  Yes  it s a cornerstone of Western literature  but it s also 2700 years old  My guess is that your average reader who is valiantly trying to gain some perspective on the history of Western thought and literature  some sense of where we ve come from and perhaps where we re going  will not make it through the catalogue of ships in Book 2  Certainly  this was my own experience when reading it years ago But Homer is well worth the effort  This should really go without saying  because a work of literature doesn t last nearly 3 millenia for no reason at all  In fact  calling it a work of literature is too limiting  Iliad is at once a work of literature  a poem  a metaphysical treatise  a statement of Greek identity  an exposition of the nature of value  and a work of history all rolled in to one  My insignificant opinion on the importance of Homer can be omitted Granting the importance and quality of Homer s work  what matters here is what Fagles brings to the translation  and he brings a great deal  In preparation for this reading I started out by reading the Samuel Butler translation of the poem  and though his was the one I finished for the first time  the poem didn t quite resonate as it did when I read the Fagles translation  This translation is highly acclaimed for a reason  it strikes a near perfect balance between the elevated and noble language befitting of Homer  and the readable vernacular of today s English speaker  In Fagles  hands the poem has a muscular drive and directness that it lacks elsewhere  and the one criticism I have is that at some moments it seems just a bit too contemporary  but overall this is a strength and not a weakness It also must be stated that Bernard Knox s comprehensive introduction gives us valuable context and commentary on the poem  and will deepen the experience of reading Iliad for anyone with an interest in the classical world  Lastly  the packaging is fantastic  the book itself looks outstanding for a paperback  is well bound and the effect of the pages  size varying ever so slightly makes it a very attractive addition to my bookself overall  So  a Western power goes into the Middle East to correct an affront and gets bogged down for ten years  can anyone really imagine such a thing really happening  And then it takes another ten years to get fully disengaged  Actually that does not sound too bad The tenth book from Professor J  Rufus Fears   Books That Have Made History  Books That Can Change Your Life  that I have read  The seventh book that I have finished this year I was struck by the similarities between Gilgamesh and Achilles  I had not seen anything suggesting that Homer might have known the story of Gilgamesh  but when I Goggled  Gilgamesh Iliad   I found this http   legacy owensboro kctcs edu cru    Homer s epic may have been influenced by Mesopotamian heroic poetry as well as by a common Indo European background  The Epic of Gilgamesh includes a number of motifs found in the Iliad and Odyssey  To see how this turns out  after you read  The Odyssey   read  The Trojan Women  by Euripides p  18        see if he will help the Trojans and drive the Achaians back to their ships with slaughter Achilles pleads with his mother  Thetis  for her to appeal Zeus to have his fellow lose to the Trojans out of his affronted pride  This is a pre polis tale  Achilles is the antithesis of  post polis  Jason in  The Argonautica  by Apollonius Rhodius  See also p  189 The suggestion that Achilles is torn between personal desire and responsibility to the collective  or that he is torn between the desire for honor  time in the Greek  and or glory  kleos in the Greek  vs  a longer life is entirely misguided  This is a tale about rage  Achilles rage over his injured pride and the death of Patroclos  The Iliad is also about God  Fate and the meaning of life  We learn though suffering  and what Achilles learns  through is suffering  is to be careful what you worship  in Achilles case honor and or glory  when Odysseus encounters Achilles  during his visit to the underworld  in the Odyssey  Achilles clearly expresses that he would trade one day alive  as the lowest of slaves  over his status  glory  in the underworld  Of course this is foreshadowed on p  110   For to me life is worth more than all the wealth of that noble city Ilios in peace time          The unitarians are wrong  The analysts are wrong  The Iliad is a oral formulaic product  Not withstanding that to the contrary there is real genius in the  ring structure  between Books I  II and III  and Books XXII  XXIII and XXIV  One example is Achillies  Book XXIII  p  275  attempted reassigning of the second place prize from the chariot race  at Patroclos  funeral games  that mirrors Agamemnon s earlier arrogation of Achillies  prize  The  ring structure  in Book XXIII also includes Antilochos  deferral  p  276  to Menelaos  in contradistinction to Achillies  earlier refusal to defer to Agamemnon  Of course  like all classical literature   The Iliad  is off the charts misogynistic   p  38  63  131 174  2126  224  229  273  275  278  Notwithstanding this to the contrary  I am retrodicting  resisting presentism  and giving it five stars Book IIp  36  But Philoctetes lay in an island suffering dreadful pain  in sacred Lemnos  where hate had left him behind tormented by a horrible would from a poisonous serpent Hence  Philoctetes  by Sophocles  p  38  The Darwinians were led by Aeneas son of Anchises  His mother was the divine Aphrodite  who lay with Anchises on the foothills of Mount Ida  goddess with

Hector deserved the treatment he received from Achilles  but        Book XVIp  189   O Father Zeus  Athenaia  Apollo  If only not one single Trojan could be left alive  and not one Achaian  but you and I might be left  that we alone might tear off the sacred diadem of Troy  p  195   This is very sad  Sarpedon  whom I love best of all men  is fated to be killed by Patroclos Menoitiades  I really don t know what to do        you mustn t say that  A mortal man  doomed of old by fate        Many of the mortals       Zeus will not  cannot  must not  save his favorite  Book XVIIp  210   Ah  poor things  Why did we give you to a mortal man like Peleus  when you are immortal and never grow old  To share the sorrows of miserable making  For I think there is no more unhappy thing than man  of all creatures that breathe and move on the earth        p  214  He may be furious against Hector  but he could not fight naked and bare Homer did know know the story of Achilles being invulnerable  except for his heel Book VIIIp  216  The captive women also whom he and Patroclos had taken  wailed in grief  and ran out to where he lay  beating their breasts and half fainting p  221  The Trojans cheered this speech  in their folly  for Pallas Athena stole their sense away p  224        and I had to endure a man s bed against my will Book XIXp  228  He lay with Patroclos in his arms  weeping bitterly  while his comrades were mourning around That does not sound so much like  friends    lover and beloved    See p  267  If there had been a relationship when they came to Troy ten years earlier  Patroclos would have  outgrown  it by now  not that Homer seems to be bound by such time constraints  p  229  I wish Artemis had shot her dead with an arrow on that day when I took Lyrnessos  Then all those brave men would have been saved who bit the dust in battle because I was angry Pathetic  Zero personal responsibility on the part of Achilles  it is all the fault of the woman p  230        but it was not my fault  Zeus   fate   the Avenger that walketh in darkness   it was their fault  They put that blind madness in my heart O K  Perchance it was not entirely the woman s fault  she was simply the God s used p  236  I do not care about their killing one another like that  But this is what I want to say  I mean to stay here  and sit in a sheltered spot  and amuse myself by watching them This is the reason  I think  that philosophy arose in the Hellenic Civilization  they were remarkably alone  their Gods were entirely indifferent to them Book XXIIp  255  But Hector stayed where he was  in front of the Scaian Gate  for the shackles of fate held him fast Book XXIII Why have you come here  beloved one  with all these charges of this and that        let us lay our arms about each other and console ourselves wit lamentations  p  270        while he sent back for prizes        women also        p  273  What a shame   let a mare beat a pair of stallions  p  275        the women and tripod were taken in charge by his comrades p  278  For the loser  he brought out a woman well skilled in women s work  valued at four oxen Book XXIVp  282        he had affronted those goddesses when they came to his farmyard and he preferred the one who granted his shameful lust It cannot be overstated what a shameful  see Fredo  character Paris was  The ending was always clear  The Trojans would lose and the Achaeans would leave triumphant  Odysseus would his famous journey home  Do not let these facts stop you  For  within this text  is heart breaking language that will stir your soul  Of course  there are many problematic issues with the text  glorification of warfare and the appalling treatment of women  bitch is a recurrent word  But  for the beauty of language  the eloquent use of metaphor and imagination I would recommend this to all  I will definitely revisit this text again and again Perhaps because of my foreknowledge of the text being within an oral tradition  or the text s own tendency to dance in your mouth  it is such a beautiful thing to read aloud  Yes  for most of us who are not able to easily pronounce Greek  c   names and places its hazzardous for our tongues  you will trip over the names  But  do read it aloud and enjoy the flow of the text  The rapidity and the softness of pace that compels you onward  One of my favourite characters is Hephaesteus  He creates Achilles s armour  and I believe this section is one of the most beautifully rendered scenes in the poem  You know the ending  just let the story swallow you up  Poseidon  the earth shaker  will make sure you survive your journey just fine  Xx  Ranking has changed from four to five  reasons below  I hesitated to write a review of The Iliad at first  because it is a lot to take in  But I decided to do it now that I think I ve digested enough  First  I d like to say that The Iliad is epic  It s epic in size  it s epic in scope  it s characters are epic in both the deeds they perform and the emotions they display  and it s quality is epic  I only really have two problems with The Iliad  The first is that it is repetitive at times   all those battle scenes start to get on my nerves after a while  The second is that the plot often moves at a snail s pace  Other than that  it is a near perfect book  Every single character in the cast is compelling  from the major players like godlike Achilles  shining Hector  and Agamemnon the Lord of Men or to side characters like Odysseus  Nestor  Helen  Ajax  Paris  and Priam  to one hit wonders like Diomedes  You really  truly care about the primordial struggles of these archetypical characters as they engage in a fight that will determine the course of history  What I like most about the Iliad  though  is the writing  Homer can make war seem beautiful without taking away its nightmarish and savage character  such as when he compares soldiers to migrating birds  There is one beautiful section where the generations of men are compared to leaves on a tree  There are so many excellently written blood pumping speeches that the generals of the armies give to there soldiers in this book and any one of them could be used to get an athlete excited to run a marathon  or an ordinary person excited to take on the daily war known as life  My all time favourite parts  though  involve Achilles  There is one section where he questions the values that Greek society has taught him   The same honour waits for the coward and the brave    and another where he affirms that he will fight as well as he can his even though he knows it is his destiny to die in battle   For my own death  I ll meet it freely   whenever Zeus and the other deathless gods would like to bring it on     Anyway  The Iliad is an epic book  go read it  Just carve out a block of time for yourself to read it so you can have enough time to appreciate it  It d make for a great summer reading book  or something to read over a vacation      EDIT  Upon further consideration  the reason why it is repetitive is because this was initially an oral text  Imagine how epic it would have been to have heard this work recited  The more I reflect on this work the more I think I like it  It deserves a five star rating  I look forward to reading it again   What can you say about a classic like this  It is amazing  The particular translation I read was really good  too  but since it s an e book I got from the library  I can t seem to figure out who the translator is  The translator did not even attempt to keep this in verse form  thank goodness    and the story really benefitted from that It kind of cracked me up how whiney the gods were when they d come groveling to Zeus about their ill treatment at the hand of mortals  Mortals  Who knew that that miserable race could have such an impact on the inhabitants of Olympus  And of course  the machinations among the gods were strangely comic as well If you re looking for a powerful female character  I think you ll be happily satisfied by Athena  If you re looking for a variety of female characters  you can compare her to Aphrodite and Hera   Just through and through this book was a surprisingly good read  Homer was a very successful manipulator of emotions  as well  I was breathless through the war scenes even though  of course  I already knew who won and lost  Priam s reaction to the death of Hector and the subsequent disrespect of his remains was such a strange de ja vu of the situation in Somalia with the downed Blackhawk pilots  and a painful emotional experience that I would imagine most parents could at least distantly relate to No wonder this is a classic  It is certainly timeless  That being said  it took a chunk of time to get through it  but it was time well spent   I figured out who the translator is  and now that I m reading a different translation of the odyssey and comparing it to this translator  I m more appreciative than before of this version of the Illiad  The translator is Butler and it s the Canterbury Classic edition from 2011  published by Baker   Taylor     Quest ReviewsI know  I know what you re thinking  Why the hell are you reviewing the Iliad  Ellen  Isn t it pretty much cemented critically  Why don t you go review The Princess Diaries instead  I might get to The Princess Diaries soon  reader  As it is  I was writing a post listing my top ten influential  school assigned reads  and it snowballed into an essay on Homer s foundational poem  I read the Iliad in the 7th grade  with my favorite teacher ever  Mrs  Cassidy  This was the first book that I ever had a strong  intellectual connection with  So much of this was due to Mrs  C s passion for the subject matter and for teaching   She went on to found her own school   However  I remember not enjoying every word of this text  In fact  the Iliad is the first book I where I struggled with keeping my attention on the page  There is quite a bit of REPETITION in this work  and CATALOGUES  and things called DIGRESSIONS   Nestor  I m looking in your direction   However  despite these attention releasing details  I became intellectually obsessed with The Iliad The epic poem is divided into 24 books  It begins in the middle of the action  near the end of the decade long war  There is quite the ensemble cast  but the protagonist is    arguably     the warrior Achilles  as the plot hinges on his action  Speaking of the plot  it s a complete soap opera  It mostly features drama at the Greek camp  drama in the Trojan city  drama on the battlefield  and drama among the gods  who interfere with the mortals like they re playing a high stakes game of Risk Interspersed with the drama  action  and tragedy is a swath of historical detail  Ancient customs are described freely and draw a picture of an other worldly way of life  If you love history    and love being transported to another  older version of our Earth    this poem is an extraordinary resource  It s been a long time since I read the Iliad  but I still recall how pretty much everything the Greeks did had a sense of ceremony    sacrifice  storytelling  bathing  feasting  mourning  even arguing  Reading the Iliad makes an incredible period of human history come dazzlingly to life Also dazzling is the language  Although I read the poem in translation    obviously    the ancient turns of phrase are intriguing in their difference from modern prose and affecting in their similarity to one s own emotional understanding  There are some gorgeous quotations that come out of the Iliad  And  even though the work is about a foolish  testosterone driven war  the poem has something to say about everything    life  death  friendship  infatuation  marriage  parenting    Furthermore  unlike many ancient texts  the Iliad also contains quite a bit of dialogue  which provides modern readers with the kind of accessible characters that we re used to encountering  It is possible for readers to get emotionally attached to the characters in the Iliad  because the language allows us to understand the characters as relatable individuals  No other better example is that of Achilles and Hector  The two men are mortal enemies  but you can t help but root for both of them  Their final showdown is so full of tension  and so tragic  Note  For comparison  think of the Epic of Gilgamesh  What schoolchild ever cared about stupid Gilgamesh as a person and fretted over where he d end up  Overall  the Iliad a viable option for those seeking to further their own literary education  It is not an insurmountable read  However  I would highly recommend reading an annotated version  like this one  available online  It has the nifty feature of providing helpful illustrations and notes when you move your cursor on top of an underlined word or phrase I m so fortunate that I had the opportunity to read the Iliad with an incredible teacher and discuss it with a class of peers  If you re still in school  consider signing up for a class on Homer  If you are in the continuing education phase of your life  and haven t yet read the Iliad  don t shy away from the opportunity  It s an amazing piece of literary history and a foundational work of Western civilization   This is my third time reading Homer s Iliad  I read Robert Fitzgerald s translation in college  In 2008  after reading his rendition of the Odyssey  I turned to Robert Fagles  This time  I read a much older version  done by Edward Smith Stanley  the 14th Earl of Derby  He published his work in 1864  He was also a UK prime minster  serving three  non consecutive terms  He studied at Eton and Oxford before venturing into politics  I wish he d stuck with classics and published an edition of the Odyssey I didn t like the Iliad the first time I read it  however  Derby s translation blew me away  It read so much faster than Fitzgerald s  yet kept close to Homer s original intent  as far as I can tell from reading multiple translations and studying a bit of Homeric Greek  Fitzgerald s translation was good  but it seemed stilted in its word choice and the pacing stuttered at times  Fagles seemed to write his own interpretation of the story  rather than translate it  like Pope did with his version of the Odyssey  As an example  see the various sections that describe Achilles s new shield in Book 18 of the Iliad  It just sounds so much better in this translation than in Fitzgerald s or Fagles s versions When I read Fagles s version  I gave the book only two stars  After finishing this one  I gave it five stars  I savored each book  chapter  and truly was sad as I neared the end  I wish the 14th Earl of Derby had translate the Odyssey so I could turn next to that  For more on the Iliad and its translators  see this excellent article from the Chronicle of Higher Education  http   m chronicle com article articl    George Orwell once essayed that people have two  shelves   one filled with books we read  the other with books we display  The implication is that some books entertain us and some impress us  however  the Iliad soundly fits onto both shelves  The Iliad is layered with themes of war  love  and suffering and is equal parts epic and poem  If I had to shorten a list of  must reads  to just ten books  the Iliad would safely make it near the top  if not the very top  Where to read  Somewhere near a beach as most of the action  at least between the mortals  takes place in the shallow margin between the beached Greek ships and the Trojan walls Tips  Write out a small outline  The Iliad s 24 books  chapters  can seem out of place without a reference to the myriad of characters  the pantheon of Greek Gods and Heroes  and their sub plots  Also keep in mind that the Iliad represents only a sliver of the Greco Trojan War  depicting  in its most basic sense  the struggle between Achilles and  his superior   Agamemnon   This book has had one of the longest shelf lives so far  I picked it up in the international book fair 6 7 years back  Since then it has sat on my shelves for more reasons than one  Ere I read the other Greek tragedies  my mind kept prodding me to pick The Iliad up  But it somehow never happened till my last visit home  I finished Dr  Sacks  fascinating case stories and before I had a chance to pick anything new up  I was looking at the dust covered books in the shelves back home   The Iliad   Finally I would like to think that I am no stranger to Greek tragedies  I have read Euripides and Sophocles  though I am yet to read Aeschylus  I had thoroughly enjoyed the plays and the  deus ex machina s  I have even read Virgil  But never had I enjoyed anything as much as when I read Homer s  The Odyssey   The story was more complete than the shorter plays and much more gripping  So I expected the same from  The Iliad   And it exceeded all expectations  I finished the book faster than any other work of similar nature or length  The poetry was fabulous  And so was the story  Fagles had done an amazing job with the translation as well  At times I read it out loud to myself  Such was the joy of reading this one  My biggest regret is that I should have started my foray into the Greek works with this one  It is now that the characters of the other plays are falling into place  Most of the other works have been written around this epic  It is here that the primary characters make their mark  The great Agamemnon  pitiable Hecuba  Aeneas  beloved by Gods  god like Diomedes  the cunning Odysseus  But this book is about swift Achilles  Him and his rage  Him and his inescapable hands The book begins in the ninth year of Troy s siege  The city has not yet been taken  In the opening scene Achilles and Agamemnon have a fall out when Agamemnon takes the beautiful Briseis from Achilles  Achilles swears to no longer fight for a king who does not respect his captains  So while Achilles holds off from the battle  the Trojan forces advance till the Achean ships  All this by the will of Zeus of course  for nothing happens without the will of the son of Cronus  Now as the Gods fight on either sides  man eating Hector pushes forward and the Achean captains are injured and disabled from battle one by one  But Zeus would not relent  He wishes to give Achilles the glory for his mother  Thetis  had held his knee and asked him the favour  But Achilles rage would not be doused  not by gifts from Agamemnon  But he yearns for the glory that war brings  Despite knowing well that that glory would come at the cost of his life before the city is taken  So as the Trojans keep advancing  he sends Patroclus  his beloved aide in arms  to the war on his behalf instead  Patroclus shines in battle  but is taken down by Trojans and Hector claims the glory  Achilles sees blood  He forgets his rage at Agamemnon and instead rages at Hector now  He needs Hector s blood  His mother gets him armour made by Hephaestus and once Achilles dons the armour and picks up his legendary shield  he is an unstoppable force  He tears through the Trojan ranks  He pushes them back behind their walls and Hector  who dares to face him  is humiliated and killed and humiliated again  The book ends after funeral games for Patroclus and Priam s ransoming of Hector s body The above story is beautifully portrayed in twenty four parts  There are adjectives abundant and the introduction provided a good reason for them  It is one of those introductions that are as important  perhaps even more  than the book itself  To sum it all up  the book was a joy all through  Right from the original story by Homer to the beautiful translation and the introduction to top it all off  I have already read Odysseus s tale  so I guess there is nothing more that I can get from Homer  But I have a revived interest in the Greek tragedies again and I have Aeschylus  Oresteia lying in my shelves   Bird signs  Fight for your country  that is the best  the only omen   The Iliad is peculiar  It s the greatest story of ancient Greece  though it predates their golden age   was the envy Rome  they attempted to match it  and failed   has become one of the most well known and celebrated stories of western culture  though none read it   and stands as mankind s greatest masterpiece  though it was composed three thousand years ago by illiterate barbarians   The parenthetical statements express my confusion with the text s status in our society  celebrated but not read  studied but not replicated  ancient but not obsolete  These questions can be applied to much of classical literature  but here they loom largest  Why isn t the Iliad more popular Let s begin by summarizing the story   The Song of Ilium   or Troy  actually only focuses on about ten days out of a 10 year war  Paris  a prince of Troy  steals the wife of Menelaus  King of the Spartans  and brings her back to his home city  Menelaus and his brother Agamemnon rally the tribes of Greece  collectively called the Achaeans  and sail to Asia Minor where they siege the city for 10 years  eventually conquering it with a ruse  The ten day period the Iliad covers concerns Achilles  the greatest hero of the Greeks  who gets mad at Agamemnon for stealing his girlfriend  Achilles withdraws from the fighting until Hector  the greatest hero of the Trojans  kills his cousin  Achilles returns and kills Hector  desecrates his corpse  but eventually returns the body to Troy after the father of Hector implores Achilles for mercy  The tale ends with Hector being buried Historically speaking the tale is fiction  A league of Greek tribes did siege the city of Troy around 1200 BCE  though this was probably due to the control of the Hellespont rather than love  Following the death of so many adult males coinciding with devastating fires of capital cities  Greece submerged into a dark age  Here the  Trojan War  was preserved and transmuted within an oral tradition that bound the communities together  Homer  a chief bard and editor of the Iliad  helped the story get written down around 800 BCE  We know that this was only one of a few epics circulating around this time  but all we have are Homer s  Greece was to draw inspiration from these works for centuries to come  eventually holding the epics as golden standards of art  They ve retained a similar status ever since Does the Iliad still live up to its reputation  Hell yes  Written as a long poem in elevated   heroic   language  the story is primarily a war drama  Horrific yet beautifully rendered fight scenes litter the book  and I have yet to find their superior  Homer s masterful use of similes  where combat is contrasted with analogues of peace  gives poise to senseless butchery Patroclus rising beside him stabbed his right jawbone ramming the spearhead square between his teeth so hardhe hooked him by that spearhead over the chariot rail hoisted  dragged the Trojan out as an angler perchedon a jutting rock ledge drags some fish from the sea some noble catch  with line and glittering bronze hook  Framing violence within scenes of calm and banality has two effects  We are jarred by how identifiable the act is  now that our imaginations have tethered the two activities together  But we also see through the lens of a warrior  whose kaleidoscope vision transforms scenes of war into peace  and peace into war  These two walks of life blur and the dichotomy fades  the world isn t divided into soldiers and civilians  We re both  War and civilization are inexorably joined  and both are given equal weight  This is exemplified within Achilles  famous shield  scenes of destruction live alongside scenes of creation  and though we may favor one over the other  both make up the circle of life The tale s length gives it time to breathe  Every fight  every character  and every speech is equally respected  For being a communal work the unity is incredible  Homer was an excellent editor  The many digressions propel the story s fated ending ever closer  Hector will die and Troy will fall  There is no suspense in ancient Greece  stories are known well beforehand   But the choices and conflicts that plague our characters are somehow not diminished  Indeed they even know their destinies beforehand  The Iliad has been described as  courage in the face of death   and I agree  Everyone seems to understand how arbitrary their lives are  yet they re infused with such pride  such determination  Heroes are unabashed in their beliefs  almost aggressively so  And it s not as if there s only one perspective here to celebrate  the wide cast of characters in this drama each have their own unique vision  Achilles is war incarnate  Odysseus marries intelligence with strength  Nestor revels in oration  Hector protects civilized values  Paris embraces love  Helen is beauty incarnate  and even minor characters find time to postulate claims  But none of it matters  The great conflict in the Iliad  and this is a story of many conflicts  is of barbarism versus civilization  The Achaeans are  if we can use such reductive terms  the bad guys  They siege the walls of hallowed Troy for a woman and their own twisted sense of pride  The Trojans have families  art  allies  technology  temples  wealth  and everything else civilization entails  But it s not enough  in the end Ilium falls to the wrath of Achilles  It s not their character  views  or beliefs that doom Troy  simply their inability to defend themselves against aggression  Hector  for all his humanity  could not defeat the Achaeans The ending of the Iliad provides a ray of hope  Achilles  submission to Priam s request  his ability to feel empathy for his enemy  is both surprising and puzzling  At first light his decision is of little consequence  Troy will still burn to the ground  Achilles will soon meet his fate  and Zeus will get his way  But amongst all this death and chaos such a small act of kindness  particularly from the cruelest man  means a great deal  As I said before  everyone knows the end to the Iliad  Everyone is doomed  Trojan or Achaean  Achilles or Hector  warrior or citizen  But being able to make a redemptive choice that rebels  even impotently  against fate is heroic  More so than proficiency on the battlefield  Homer both celebrates and insults warfare  with the same breathe destroys civilized values and infuses them with meaning  Achilles  by returning Hector  regains some of his humanity  It ll change nothing  but it s precious all the same This rare tenderness is worlds away from the idiocy of the gods  who rule and play with men s fate without any regard for their wellbeing or value  Zues  Athena  Hera  Apollo  these are characters in a story  They are not real or logical  they represent the chaotic forces that destroy or make men s lives  Their comical antics make the human tragedy that much more painful to experience  They will not be forced to endure the consequences of their decisions  They are incapable of change or loss that would bring significance to their existence  They simply are  and so cannot identify with humanity  It is a good thing both Helen and Achilles shed their destructive selfishness for self criticism  It is no compliment to be called godlike And so I have realized why the Iliad isn t more popular  it explores ideas fundamentally bitter to our  enlightened  tastes  Our lives are meaningless  and though we may admirably infuse them with significance our fates will not change  But this infusion must stem from artistic appreciation of life s bounty  War is both beautiful as well as horrible  Self criticism is necessary for humanity  The gods  if they exist  should not be emulated  The good and bad guys aren t all that different  Life necessitates both pain and happiness  and diminishing one perhaps diminishes the other I adore the Iliad  an artistic creation that houses such maddening destruction  with gems of hope and beauty if one is brave enough to look  Homer s community  slowly reclaiming their civilized life from dark barbarism  poured hundreds of years of hard earned wisdom into this epic tale  They would not abandon their past  not completely  but they would learn from it  They would move forward with a sense of having won and lost some infinite thing  That thing is courage in the face of death  art in the face of destruction  and simple human decency in the face of war  Yunanistan in kutsal kitabinin ilk kismi olarak tanimlayabilecegim  Iliad   Ilyada  destani

06 07 2014Istanbul  TurkiyeAlp Turgut Well  it s been a good 2000  years since Homer first decided to write this epic  So is it unfair to talk about how some things don t hold up For this review  the cons will actually be discussed first  The Iliad is a greatly violent work of literature  especially as poetry goes  As a matter of fact  the sheer level of gory violence was quite surprising  and often off putting  There are scenes in which swords slice very sensitive places  abdominal walls  throats  foreheads  and the  darkness  swirls down into lots of people s eyes  In addition  don t forget Book Two s great gathering of armies  in which basically 10 pages are spent describing the ships and soldiers gathered for fighting  The violence  combined with Book Two and the length of the poem  most likely constitute the book s push factors  The Robert Fagles translation is never difficult to read  but there s only so much gore endurable before almost deciding to skim over the rest of the gore until the next time you read some of the book        desperate  begging  Achilles slit open his liver the liver spurted loose  gushing with dark blood drenched his lap and the night swirled down his eyesas his life breath slipped away   518  Children s stuff  right  Dr  Seuss would ve killed to use it in Green Eggs and Ham Initially it seemed Homer had done it to show the brutality and horror of war  but also note  this book was written by an ancient Greek    the same time the Romans were around  The average fighter in this that civilization could not really be described as a  pacifist  or a  conscientious objector    This is part of the reason I don t like when people today say society is getting  more violent   Look back to these guys   I occasionally worried throughout reading if Homer was simply trying to entertain people with all of that  Some of those who would ve heard a reciting of this enjoyed seeing gladiators fight to the death  The first one  or both  is always possible   in the last few chapters  Homer focuses more on the mourning of important characters    but maybe just because the Trojan War is nearing its end at that time  And maybe Book Two s great gathering of armies was written in the repetitive  nearly tedious way it was written in order to show how devoted these civilizations were to something so horrible  We can t really speculate what was in Homer s mind Regarding the story itself  nothing really grants the Achaeans more empathy from a modern reader than the Trojans  There isn t anything intrinsically better in one than the other  Both could sometimes be big hypocrites  The Achaeans were generally criticizing the Trojans  blood lust  but let s not forget Achilles is the one who chased someone around an entire city three times   It s undeniably great literature  Books six  ten  and 22 24 all contain a multitude of passages among the finest writing I ve ever read  They re also quite poignant  Also  there s imagery throughout  and not just imagery of violence  thankfully   The book is also quite relevant  in that it shows us how the problems of some powerful people can mess the whole world up and change the course of history  The middle stretch  around 11 13  I did not fancy so much  They contain some of the most gore if I m not mistaken  and they are not quite as well written  well translated   as the rest So yes  I m just going to admit it  there are elements of The Iliad which simply don t hold up today  But the poem is extraordinarily ambitious  well written  still relevant  and impossible to deny the influence of  That s a hard combination to beat  Despues de 3 milenios  una obra puede perder facilmente su significado social y sus raices solo en su importancia historica  Definitivamente no es el caso de esta obra magistral  mas que las palabras siempre se puede correr el riesgo de ser injusto  porque no pueden abarcar toda su importancia Contada como un thriller de accion  sin deberle nada a la Riddick mortifero o cualquier otros esteroides en servicio  la trama se desarrolla con diferentes protagonistas  entrelazando sus historias y forman el telon de fondo del drama de Aquiles  Agamenon  Hector y Paris Efectivamente  el autor consigue transmitir a la escena de la accion  a pesar de estar tan lejos en el espacio y el tiempo  y nos hace comprender claramente todavia los dilemas morales y conflictos psicologicos presentes en las civilizaciones antiguas Escuchar el texto en la prosodia griega es lo que le faltaria para completar la inmersion en homeriano universo  Aprender griego solo para entender a los griegos Este libro realmente merece el titulo del clasico  hace 2 700 anos es una necesidad  Awesome  The visceral descriptions of combat  death and deeply emotional moments made me think of the action style of Frank Miller s  300  and the emotional intensity you get in Shakespeare   that W  H  D  Rouse chose this tone is awesome  There is nothing more deflating than trying to read some over blown poetic rendition that gets neutered in unrealistic Victorian sensibilities  not to mention how faithful to the SUBJECT and CONTEXT this telling is  all the gods and names used are kept Greek  This is critical for me as a reader for clarity  While Roman names and gods were mostly influenced by the Greek traditions it is a crime to equate them  not to mention confusing as hell for any reader who now suddenly has to remember multiple names for each character god just because the translator wants to make something rhyme  or has some crap thesis about viewing the narrative through a more western heritage   With a cast of characters so huge and so many neat back stories and details running together  prose is probably the only real way to tell this story in English And I may be rambling a bit too much here but this really makes me think of the movie Troy that came out several years ago  I really liked that movie  even knowing then that it  deliberately  fell so short of the source material  But man  to read finally how much more involved the original is  how many more back stories exist to add depth to such a huge cast    I cant help but wonder why more modern media forms don t try to tie in to this saga  In all seriousness there is even a dearth of video games based on Greek myth  There s as much stuff here to work with as the entirety of the over bloated  and Spam can quality  Star Wars mythos now  I think one of the characters out there fighting was a descendant or some relation of Jason  who found the Golden Fleece  I m too lazy to look up which dude at the moment   A few different warriors are sons of Herakles  Nutty old Oedipus was even mentioned towards the very end  I think by Nestor  who was old enough to remember something about the life and times of Freud s fetish  And Diomedes kicks ass  Ok enough rambling  On to the Odyssey  I finally finished reading The Iliad on the train this morning  A colleague who is studying a degree in Classics loaned it to me  as I mentioned that I have wanted  but never gotten around to  read it since reading The Odyssey at uni  I like the Lattimore translation  partly because it is in verse  and I really don t see the point in reading prose translations of poetic works  and because he spent years getting the hexameter right  I m the first to acknowledged that I am an ignoramous when it comes to poetry  but I can t read Ancient Greek  so Lattimore is probably the closest I will get to Homer Anyway  I liked it  I find it most interesting that The Iliad isn t  as such  about the Battle of Troy  Or  at least  only a few smaller battles therein that take place over the course of a few weeks  or months  The action opens nine or ten years in to the Battle and closes before the city is sacked  I find it amusing that Achilleus goes into a major sulk and refuses to fight when Agmemnon takes the former s concubine  The gods  too  are not immune to hissy fits  as most often demonstrated by Hera of the white arms  What a bitch  I think one of the hardest things to get one s head around is that destiny  or Fate  is final  Not even the gods can alter fate  They seem to make the lives of the mortals difficult just because they can  I can t say I thought much of Athene or Poseidon after reading the text  but then I largely come down in favour of the Trojans  I don t think much of Hektor  but I think less of Achilleus when he dispoils the former s body  There are some literary devices in the text that I recall from The Odyssey  such as the author calling on the Muses and repeated lines such as  When they had put away their desire for eating and drinking   My colleague told me that the thinking is that these aided the individual reciting the poem   I suppose as markers and to give him time to think what the next line is  I m sure epic poetry puts some people off  but there are some amusing episodes  My favourite has to be when Hera glams herself up and seeks the aid of Aphrodite and Sleep to seduce Zeus  Of course  being a heterosexual  bisexual   male  albeit an immortal one   he isn t able to resite her womanly whiles and promptly falls asleep once he sates his desire  I find the slaughter  which  naturally  occupies a large part of the narrative  difficult  but it is epic poetry after all and tells the story of a bloody series of battles  The bloodlust  lack of pity and hypocrisy does not sit well with me  but it is what it is  The poem as a whole is a mix of bravery  bloodlust  tragedy and comedy and I can see where it  or at least individual books therein  as it was later divided  would have been used to good effect as entertainment  Homer s Iliad is a book I read excerpts from in my undergrad Humanities course in college  but I eventually got enough leisure time to read it in its entirety  The Iliad documents a time when the Greeks are first coming together and beginning to think about themselves as Greek  this would have been around 1260 BCE  and The Iliad itself was probably written circa 725 BCE  What is helpful in the Greeks  coming together and seeing themselves is a united people is a common enemy these people have in Troy  which is located in modern day Turkey  in the Anatolia According to The Iliad  the Greeks sail to Troy to fight the Trojan War because one of the princes of Troy named Paris has stolen the wife of the Greek king Menelaus  her name is Helen and she is revered for her great beauty  Although the Trojan War frames most of the background  the real conflict of the book seems to be with king Achilles  who is a young  beautiful demigod  great hero  and great warrior  widely feared by men  The large bulk of the book concerns Achilles  refusal to fight for his Greek countrymen on account of the fact that a fellow Greek king Agamemnon has publicly shamed him in front of the Greek council and stolen away a woman of his  a woman who was among the spoils of war Achilles had captured Some observations about the book  Achilles is not really the model citizen soldier of the book  but rather the very real and brave and human Hector  prince of Troy  is  Whereas Achilles fights for glory  Hector fights to defend his country and his family  The best way I could express how strange it is that the hero of the most famous epic poem of the Greeks is Hector would be with the following comparison  Imagine if a famous work of American literature depicted King George III of England as the noble and righteous model for leadership during the American Revolution  by way of analogy to Achilles  General George Washington depicted as the young hothead  not to be admired  That is what I find most remarkable about The Iliad  that the true hero for the Greeks is the Trojan prince Hector  It is not until The Odyssey that we get to see what a model Greek looks like   Trojans to the left of me  Agamemnon on my right a wooden horse and Gods meddeling in everything  So here is the short version  After an invocation to the Muses  the story launches in medias res towards the end of the Trojan War between the Trojans and the besieging Greeks  Chryses  a Trojan priest of Apollo  offers the Greeks wealth for the return of his daughter Chryseis  a captive of Agamemnon  the Greek leader  Although most of the Greek army is in favor of the offer  Agamemnon refuses  Chryses prays for Apollo s help  and Apollo causes a plague throughout the Greek army  After nine days of plague  Achilles  the leader of the Myrmidon contingent  calls an assembly to solve the plague problem  Under pressure  Agamemnon agrees to return Chryseis to her father  but also decides to take Achilles s captive  Briseis  as compensation  Angered  Achilles declares that he and his men will no longer fight for Agamemnon  but will go home  Odysseus takes a ship and brings Chryseis to her father  whereupon Apollo ends the plague  In the meantime  Agamemnon s messengers take Briseis away  and Achilles asks his mother  Thetis  to ask Zeus that the Greeks be brought to the breaking point by the Trojans  so Agamemnon will realize how much the Greeks need Achilles   Thetis does so  Zeus agrees  and sends a dream to Agamemnon  urging him to attack the city  Agamemnon heeds the dream but decides to first test the morale of the Greek army by telling them to go home  The plan backfires  and only the intervention of Odysseus  inspired by Athena  stops the rout  Odysseus confronts and beats Thersites  a common soldier who voices discontent at fighting Agamemnon s war  After a meal  the Greeks deploy in companies upon the Trojan plain  The poet takes the opportunity to describe each Greek contingent  When news of the Greek deployment reaches king Priam  the Trojans too sortie upon the plain  In a similar list to that for the Greeks  the poet describes the Trojans and their allies   The armies approach each other on the plain  but before they meet  Paris offers to end the war by fighting a duel with Menelaus  to the advice and will of his brother and head of the Trojan army  Hector  While Helen tells Priam about the Greek commanders from the walls of Troy  both sides swear a truce and promise to abide by the outcome of the duel  Paris is beaten  but Aphrodite rescues him and leads him to bed with Helen before Menelaus could kill him   Pressured by Hera s hatred of Troy  Zeus arranges for the Trojan Pandaros to break the truce by wounding Menelaus with an arrow  Agamemnon rouses the Greeks  and battle is joined  In the fighting  Diomedes kills many Trojans and defeats Aeneas  whom again Aphrodite rescues  but Diomedes attacks and wounds the goddess  Apollo faces Diomedes  and warns him against warring with gods  Many heroes and commanders join in  including Hector  and the gods supporting each side try to influence the battle  Emboldened by Athena  Diomedes wounds Ares and puts him out of action  Hector rallies the Trojans and stops a rout  the Greek Diomedes and the Trojan Glaukos find common ground and exchange unequal gifts  Hector enters the city  urges prayers and sacrifices  incites Paris to battle  bids his wife Andromache and son Astyanax farewell on the city walls  and rejoins the battle  Hector duels with Ajax  but nightfall interrupts the fight and both sides retire  The Greeks agree to burn their dead and build a wall to protect their ships and camp  while the Trojans quarrel about returning Helen  Paris offers to return the treasure he took  and give further wealth as compensation  but without returning Helen  and the offer is refused  A day s truce is agreed for burning the dead  during which the Greeks also build their wall and trench  The next morning  Zeus prohibits the gods from interfering  and fighting begins anew  The Trojans prevail and force the Greeks back to their wall while Hera and Athena are forbidden from helping  Night falls before the Trojans can assault the Greek wall  They camp in the field to assault at first light  and their watchfires light the plain like stars  Meanwhile  the Greeks are desperate  Agamemnon admits his error  and sends an embassy composed of Odysseus  Ajax  Phoenix  and two heralds to offer Briseis and extensive gifts to Achilles  who has been camped next to his ships throughout  if only he would return to the fighting  Achilles and his companion Patroclus receive the embassy well  but Achilles angrily refuses Agamemnon s offer  and declares that he would only return to battle if the Trojans reach his ships and threaten them with fire  The embassy returns empty handed   10  Later that night  Odysseus and Diomedes venture out to the Trojan lines  kill the Trojan Dolon  and wreak havoc in the camps of some Thracian allies of Troy   In the morning  the fighting is fierce and Agamemnon  Diomedes  and Odysseus are all wounded  Achilles sends Patroclus from his camp to inquire about the Greek casualties  and while there Patroclus is moved to pity by a speech of Nestor  The Trojans assault the Greek wall on foot  Hector  ignoring an omen  leads the terrible fighting  The Greeks are overwhelmed in rout  the wall s gate is broken  and Hector charges in  Many fall on both sides  The Trojan seer Polydamas urges Hector to fall back and warns him about Achilles  but is ignored  Hera seduces Zeus and lures him to sleep  allowing Poseidon to help the Greeks  and the Trojans are driven back onto the plain  Zeus awakes and is enraged by Poseidon s intervention  Against the mounting discontent of the Greek supporting gods  Zeus sends Apollo to aid the Trojans  who once again breach the wall  and the battle reaches the ships  Patroclus can stand to watch no longer  and begs Achilles to be allowed to defend the ships  Achilles relents  and lends Patroclus his armor  but sends him off with a stern admonition to not pursue the Trojans  lest he take Achilles s glory  Patroclus leads the Myrmidons to battle and arrives as the Trojans set fire to the first ships  The Trojans are routed by the sudden onslaught  Patroclus  ignoring Achilles s command  pursues and reaches the gates of Troy  where Apollo himself stops him  Patroclus is set upon by Apollo and Euphorbos  and is finally killed by Hector  Hector takes Achilles s armor from the fallen Patroclus  but fighting develops around Patroclus  body  Achilles is mad with grief when he hears of Patroclus s death  and vows to take vengeance on Hector  his mother Thetis grieves  too  knowing that Achilles is fated to die if he kills Hector  Achilles is urged to help retrieve Patroclus  body  but has no armour  Made brilliant by Athena  Achilles stands next to the Greek wall and roars in rage  The Trojans are dismayed by his appearance and the Greeks manage to bear Patroclus  body away  Again Polydamas urges Hector to withdraw into the city  again Hector refuses  and the Trojans camp in the plain at nightfall  Patroclus is mourned  and meanwhile  at Thetis  request  Hephaistos fashions a new set of armor for Achilles  among which is a magnificently wrought shield  In the morning  Agamemnon gives Achilles all the promised gifts  including Briseis  but he is indifferent to them  Achilles fasts while the Greeks take their meal  and straps on his new armor  and heaves his great spear  His horse Xanthos prophesies to Achilles his death  Achilles drives his chariot into battle  Zeus lifts the ban on the gods  interference  and the gods freely intervene on both sides  The onslaught of Achilles  burning with rage and grief  is terrible  and he slays many  Driving the Trojans before him  Achilles cuts off half in the river Skamandros and proceeds to slaughter them and fills the river with the dead  The river  angry at the killing  confronts Achilles  but is beaten back by Hephaistos  firestorm  The gods fight among themselves  The great gates of the city are opened to receive the fleeing Trojans  and Apollo leads Achilles away from the city by pretending to be a Trojan   When Apollo reveals himself to Achilles  the Trojans had retreated into the city  all except for Hector  who  having twice ignored the counsels of Polydamas  feels the shame of rout and resolves to face Achilles  in spite of the pleas of Priam and Hecuba  his parents  When Achilles approaches  Hector s will fails him  and he is chased around the city by Achilles  Finally  Athena tricks him to stop running  and he is caught and killed by Achilles  Achilles takes Hector s body and dishonors it  The ghost of Patroclus comes to Achilles in a dream and urges the burial of his body  The Greeks hold a day of funeral games  and Achilles gives out the prizes   Dismayed by Achilles s continued abuse of Hector s body  Zeus decides that it must be returned to Priam  Led by Hermes  Priam takes a wagon out of Troy  across the plains  and enters the Greek camp unnoticed  He grasps Achilles by the knees and begs to have his son s body  Achilles is moved to tears  and the two lament their losses in the war  After a meal  Priam carries Hector s body back into Troy  Hector is buried  and the city mourns  There  There will be an exam next week  Dude  It s the Iliad  this is the pimp shit  One of the oldest and greatest works in the Western canon We re in the middle of the Trojan War which started because Helen jumped ship  She fell in love with Paris  a Trojan  even though she was Menelaus s  a Greek  wife  So  naturally  Menelaus gets the entire Argive  Greek  nation to go get her back from Troy  They ve been there for 10 years and countless people have died when this story picks up  All because Menelaus just can t let her go and live with the insult  Honor was a big thing back then Achilles is pissed  Agamemnon has seriously insulted him  so he s not going to do any fighting just to get his point across  His point is that he is the best fighter there is and the Greeks have no chance without him So  while Achilles is crying in his Cheerios  Hector is kicking some serious Argive ass  He s a Trojan  and he s directly descended from the gods  No one can stop him  Seriously  Agamemnon  Odysseus  everyone is going down  Spears are literally bouncing off the guy s skin But then some shit goes down  He fucks with the wrong guy  and Achilles finally decides to get involved  And if there is one thing everyone knows  it is that Achilles will whoop the ever living shit out of you  He will kill you  There is no doubt  Hector may be descended from the gods  but Achilles was born of one  so  that sucks for whoever gets in his way Anyway  some intense battling ensues  lots of blood and guts  gods get involved  and some cool magicky kind of stuff happens with that  Some important people die  some dragging of dead bodies  there is a giant funeral pyre  funeral games  and wicked character development Plus  there is a top notch introduction chock full of information that puts it all in context and explains some stuff that I certainly wouldn t have picked up on by myself It s a totally kick ass read  Don t miss out   I m NOT reading the volume shown  I m reading Lattimore s translation  Fagles would be my second choice  I ve read both translations at this point and opted for Lattimore this time around  His translation really does reveal a bit more of the poetry  I d recommend his translation above anyone s now available  At this point in time  I ve read the Iliad thirteen times  I don t know why it hits me in such a primal way  but I keep returning to it  The repetitive nature of the warrior s death is both horrifying and noble  The light going out of the slain soldier s eyes and the black blood leaving his body is a constant throughout the poem  As a product of western civilization  I realize that the Iliad and Odyssey along with the Hebrew scriptures helped define who we were and who we are in the present  why it hits me in such a primal way  but I keep returning to it  The repetitive nature of the warrior s death is both horrifying and noble  The light going out of the slain soldier s eyes and the black blood leaving his body is a constant throughout the poem  As a product of western civilization  I realize that the Iliad and Odyssey along with the Hebrew scriptures helped define who we were and who we are in the present   Created in the 8th century BC  contemporary with some of the oldest books of the Bible   The Iliad is a marvel  It is a savage telling of one man s anger and the last days of a city civilization  The story is told plainly with little artifice  Yet it brings to life some of the most amazing characters and situations  It is as good as anything written since  There s not much I can add to the 2 700 years of commentary this book has received  It is one of my favorites and one that I go back to again and again  I ve read Fitzgerald s and the Fagles  translations  and a bit of Pope s   and I like them both  I have to give the edge to the Fitzgerald version   Though reading both at the same time does provide an enlightening contrast   Fitzgerald s version is a bit tighter and more cryptic  which provides a faster read that seems truer to the intent of the book  Fagles s version  being a bit wordier  clarifies some of the action  and it contains many beautiful lines of poetry  I ve also read Lattimore s translation and it reminds me of Fagle s  It is wordier and thus explains what happens more clearly  but I find the poetic syntax a bit awkward and it makes the reading slower and more difficult   No matter how many times I read this  I still find something new  This time I marveled at the similes  Many of the similes in the battle scenes dealt predictably with lions and wolves  but there were others that evoked daily life  the widow measuring her wool  or inanimate forces of nature  rocks falling like snow   The most striking thing about them is that they aren t all that brief  like my examples   but can go on for a while  longer than you would expect in a narrative  They d be full blown metaphors if they d not been prefaced with  as  or the like  I discussed this online with a group and found that very satisfying  This translation just happened to be one I have  but I see that it s recommended by many  including Dr  Vandiver who does the Homeric Great Courses lectures  for being translated line by line  so you can make comparisons to the Greek  and for preserving the archaic flavor and the poetic  formulas   Dang  I just thought it was a great story Amusing note  on the back of my copy  Robert Fitzgerald is quoted as saying no one need ever produce another verse translation of the Iliad     but I guess he changed his mind 25 years later  Heh  The classic that defines the Western world and civilization   a book of war  violence  glorification of heroes in war  culminating at the end with the battle between Hector and Achilles  and about the pain and suffering endured by Hector s father  mother  and his wife at the cruel slaughter of Hector and mutilation of his body  Despite the war and agony  the civility is maintained  as when Trojan King Priam  Hector s father  is received warmly and respectfully by Achilles and was able to dine with the latter  or when the dead are properly buried or rather burned at the pyre  or when the comrade is properly and proportionally avenged  as Achilles did for Patroclus in killing and mutilating Hector   Thus the Greek ideal of civility is illustrated and exemplified in the midst of  and perhaps because of  horror and pain of war  After all  did not Heraclitus say   War is father of all      Indeed  beings   are at war with one another and are thus together   as Levinas paraphrases it  War is said to accentuate the strength  skills  and valor of the heroes  that strife sets apart the exceptional ones from the indistinguishable masses  Nietzsche was keenly aware of the Greek infatuation with crusty when he said   Thus the Greeks   have a trait of cruelty  a tigerish lust to annihilate          Why did the whole Greek world exult over the combat scenes of the Iliad       from  Homer s Contest   1873   Achilles summed it up very well  that we are left to suffer and die by the gods who themselves do not face death  We live in pain and suffering for gods  sport  as another Greek poet said  The purported reason for the war  Helen  is only cursorily mentioned  like the existence of the snake that tempts Eve in the Garden of Eden  The reason for human suffering is not at all addressed or explained  because life is suffering  albeit for gods  entertainment  and because the origin of evil cannot be explained  Tracing evil to gods  devious plots does not work either  because gods themselves are persuaded and deceived by other gods and humans in what it all seems to be a human drama  Gods  intervention only seems to prolong the war  as Apollo protects Troy and Zeus sides with the invading Achaeans  and thus prolonging human suffering  Perhaps  the Greeks should be commended for gripping the harsh reality as such with no comedy  for facing crucifixion head on without resurrection  But is reality at bottom war  Does not goodness precede being exceeding dignity and power  as Plato said who undoubtedly read Homer  There is another path at the heart of the Western  and all  civilization s   I read this book as part of the CiRCE Institutes  Apprenticeship program  with Andrew Kern  www circeinstitute com   I started reading it in July and finished it today  It was intended that we would read through it slowly and deliberately Homer is brilliant and The Iliad is a powerful example of this brilliance  The book is more about Achilles than it is the Trojan War  although it plays a heavy role in the book  Three important things are learned through the reading of this book 1  Homer is a master rhetorician and his characters continually give real life type examples of rhetorical mastery in their speeches  In the study of rhetoric  one could hardly do better than to study the speeches in The Iliad 2  Homer is a master mythmaker  a storyteller  In his book Notes from the Tilt a Whirl  N D  Wilson explains how God is the author of a story  life  in which every player  every object  has a an entire back story  There is no person or thing with which or whom we interact that doesn t have a story of his own  On the contrary  the stories we read rarely have a back story for every or even most of the characters or creatures in them  Not so with Homer  While it would be true to say that they don t ALL have a back story  more do than in a normal story we might read  In some cases  he will tell us the history of a man being killed in battle  in another the history of the horses pulling Achilles  chariot  in another the history of the sword or spear a hero is using in battle  He tells a masterful story in a way few mythmakers have 3  Achilles is a powerful example of a norm and also a character who creates powerful questions needed to establish norms  Norm here being the norms or ideals of life according to which we live  Achilles has been wronged by King Agamemnon  As a result he has not participated in the Trojan War  until his friend Patroklos is killed and shamed in battle  He forgives Agamemnon  and he returns to the war  After his return to battle  he hosts competitions for the men of Greece to take their mind off the war  This happens during a time of no fighting between the Trojans and Greeks  During one of the competitions  Agamemnon arises to compete against Meriones in a spear throwing competition  Achilles ends the competition before it begins saying   Son of Atreus  Agamemnon   for we know how much you surpass all others  by how much you are greatest for strength among the spear throwers  therefore take this prize and keep it and go back to your hollow ships  but let us give the spear to the hero Meriones  if your own heart would have it this way  for so I invite you  Achilles  who had previously been wronged by Agamemnon  now gives him the first prize in a competition in order to prevent him from having to compete against one of his people  saving him from the possible embarrassment of a loss  The duty and honor owed one s  father  is something rarely remembered among Americans today  we who are more consumed with protecting our  rights  than we are our acknowledging our  duties   However  the story of Achilles also creates questions about  norms  as they existed in the culture of the Greeks  Achilles lives in a world where glory and honor come through success in battle or success in war counsel  Achilles has attained honor through his war time feats  but Agamemnon takes that glory away with one ill fated decision  From hence forward  Achilles  and the Greeks  would be asking the question  if glory can be take at will by gods or men  then from whence comes true glory  A question whose answer can only be the Triune God  through Jesus Christ  I must admit that the idea of this was introduced to me by Andrew Kern through the CiRCE Institute  but having read through The Iliad  I believe he is onto something This is a must read  And likely  more than once  I love The Illiad only a little bit less than The Odyssey  the other epic poem attributed to Homer  Together the two works are considered among the oldest surviving works of Western literature  dating to probably the eighth century BCE  and are certainly among the most influential  The Illiad deals with just a few weeks in the last year of the decade long Trojan War  As the opening lines state  it deals with how the quarrel between the Greek s great hero Achilles and their leader Agamemnon  caused the Akhaians loss on bitter loss and crowded brave souls into the undergloom  So  essentially  this is a war story  One close to three thousand years old with a mindset very alien to ours  One where unending glory was seen as a great good over personal survival or family  One where all felt that their ends were fated  And one with curiously human  or at least petty  gods  Some see the work as jingoistic  even pro war  and I suppose it can be read that way  but what struck me was the compassion with which Homer wrote of both sides  We certainly care for the Trojan Hector as much as or more  in my case much more  than for the sulky and explosive Achilles  For the Trojan King Priam as much or more  in my case much more  than King Agamemnon  Homer certainly doesn t obscure the pity  the waste  and the grief war brings  And there are plenty of scenes in the work that I found unforgettable  The humorous scene where Aphrodite is wounded and driven from the field  The moving scene between Hector and his wife and child  The grief Helen feels in losing a friend  The confrontation between Priam and Achilles This is one work where translations make a huge difference  Keats poem  On Chapman s Homer  is all about how a translation opened his eyes to  realms of gold  in The Illiad he had not appreciated before  I was forced to read Homer in high school  I suspect the Lattimore translation  and hated it as boring and tedious  Maturity might have helped change how I felt on reread  but I had my own  Keats Experience  when I discovered Robert Fitzgerald s translation  I ve never read the Fagles translation some reviewers are recommending  but you might want to look up various translations to see which one speaks to you before embarking on a full read  Ok after 2800 years since it was written by the illustrious Homer  being one of the world s top 100 books of world literature  famous beyond belief in legend  film etc and finally being read and reread by countless individuals and experts  is another review  even by yours truly  worth doing    oh well let s give it ago in my usual format The story takes place outside the walled city of Troy  aka Ilios  where the Achians  aka Greeks  have sailed  10 years earlier  to avenge the theft of Helen  wife of Menelaos  by Paris  aka Alexandros   The leader Agamemnon unfortunately upsets his main warrior godlike Achilleus  who taking offence goes off to sulk  The gods  aka Zeus  Hera  Ares  Poseidon etc  meddle and fight amongst themselves but set in motion the great tragedy where by fate will ensure that Achilleus wins honour by defeating the Trojan warrior Hektor son of Priam  King of Troy   caring little for the thousands dead along the way  It includes famous depictions of funeral games  death of Achilleus friend  Patroklos   the  toing and froing  of the battles as at one the Trojans pin back the Greeks to their boats but lose out eventually  ways of waging war  chariots  spears  and armour   the historical setting of Troy and in deed mention of still present Greek islands  Crete  Samos Kepalonia etc   and the finale of Priam begging Achilleus to return the body of his son Hektor I read the prose version of the poem by Penguin  trans  M Hammond  and is structured very well mirroring the poetic style  repeated reference to  godlike    hollow ships  or orders given and actions completed etc   One can instantly understand why this is a must read book  It is at one a gripping tale of war  honour and death  an immense insight into bronze age Greek life  at home and at war   a wealth of fable and Greek god myth and finally a deep tragedy on personal goals and maturity Who am I to criticise this book for there is none  but it is quite long and is very detailed  there is a 50page index of people and places mentioned and a 50 page introduction  and can be intricate in individuals lives  named farmers turned warrior etc  so does require a certain dedication to read in one go and especially  much to my surprise ends before the Trojan defeat  i e  no horse  so is like the ending of  The Empire Strikes Back  in somewhat anticipation  Achilleus destined to die etc   What a literary tale and education  this really is a classic amongst classics My quotes  Earthshaker  you would say I was not in my right mind if I do battle with you for the sake of wretched mortals  who are like leaves   for a time they flourish in a blaze of glory  and feed on the yield of the earth  and then again they fade lifeless  In a young man all is decent if he is killed in war and lies there torn by sharp bronze   though he is dead all that is revealed is beautiful  But when an old man has been killed and the dogs are mutilating his grey head and grey beard and private parts  this is the most pitiful sight that poor mortals can see  I would probably place this in my top ten of favorite books  poems  literary works  I first decided to read the book mainly out of a curiosity in the writing style  description of interaction between gods and men  and methods of warfare of this time period   With the writing style  I did get the feeling that alot has been lost in the translations  which is to be expected considering the language discrepancies between it s origin language and english  but I was still pleasantly surprised by how intricate  unique  and captivating it was   The description between the interaction of the various gods and the soldiers was also interesting  but more from a purely literary standpoint  The main idea that I derived from this aspect of the story was that men should always do what they can to appease the gods and should not interfere with their divine plans  I found this general lesson difficult to apply for anyone with a specific religious set of beliefs or for someone who is more biased towards the atheistic side of the continuum  Among religions which have specific  literal conceptions of divinity  some of these religions continue to call for sacrifices and unquestioning obedience to god  while other religions have  usually in an effort to become more contemporary  abandoned such practices in favor of facilitating a more personal relationship with god s   In either case  the main idea from the Illiad will either not tell them anything new or contrast with their beliefs  in my opinion  there does not seem to be much room for integration or application  For atheists or agnostics  the idea also seems somewhat useless  since it does nothing to prove or disprove that these gods exist at all  Just to clarify  I use the term  atheist  somewhat lightly  since I think that it is naive to say that you are absolutely certain that there is _no_ god  likewise  I think that it is equally naive to say that you are absolutely certain that there _is_ a god  A continuum seems more appropriate in this case  with strict religious observance on one end  pure atheism on the other  and an uncertainty about the nature of god in the center  I know that this probably isn t an original idea  but it bothers me to hear the question asked with only agnostic  religious  or atheist as the potential answers  The description of warfare was also incredibly detailed and captivating  and the method of warfare which the poem focuses on allows it to become something which I was not expecting  an excellent analysis of human psychology  A very wide spectrum of emotions is portrayed in the novel  showing how horrific warfare  whilst bringing out the most savage and destructive parts of basic human nature  still could not extinguish their capacity for love  happiness  and heroism  Many novels and movies that I have seen focus intently on the psychopathological symptoms that are produced by exposure to warfare  but none have also analyzed the more  positive   social contract obedient characteristics which continue to be exhibited in human behavior in spite of the massive situational factors that discourage it   Excellent novel  both from a purely entertaining standpoint and  obviously more importantly  lol  there s my bias again   a philosophical standpoint  However  I found the Odyssey to be very disappointing  expecially when compared to this   The Iliad was written down probably in the 6th century BC by a Greek poet  or poets  known to us only as  Homer   though it had certainly been an oral tradition for a long time before that  The poem s subject matter is the war between the Greeks and Trojans  set off by the elopement to Helen of Troy   daughter of the Greek King Menelaus of Sparta   with Paris  son of the Trojan King Priam The Greek army  under the command of Menelaus s brother Agamemnon  sets off for Troy to correct the insult to Greek honour and also  of course  to sack the greatest city in that part of the world at the time  One can t help thinking that avenging the elopement was a mere pretext to wage a war that had been brewing for some time  borne from plain old jealousy Meanwhile  on Mount Olympus  the gods and goddesses take sides for the grand game  All that s missing is the popcorn  but you can imagine them knocking back the ambrosia and getting as involved as English football fans watching their team playing in Germany The initial confrontation of the forces resolves itself fairly quickly into a series of individual duels between the heroes on each side  The overall action  however  concerns itself with the half divine  on his mother s side  Greek hero Achilles and the Trojan hero Hector  son of King Priam  Although these two actually meet only towards the end of the poem  their polarity forms an invisible force field that arches over the smaller duels  and the tension between them is felt throughout the poem  Everyone knows what it s all leading up to  and the question they re always asking themselves is when Achilles is going to stop sulking off stage  over an insult by Agamemnon at the beginning  and make a decisive appearance on the Greek side  Actually  it s only when his best friend Patroclus is killed whilst wearing Achilles  borrowed armour that Achilles finally takes the field About the skeleton of the heroic duels is constructed the flesh that makes the Iliad live down the ages  imbued as it is with the common passions  strengths and weaknesses of real men and women  and it is full of marvellous psychological insights that we can all relate to In the end  of course  Troy falls and there is the usual rape and pillage by the victors  though this takes place beyond the ending point of the Iliad  the action of which had started ten years after the beginning of the siege  The poem is thus mounted like a jewel in the broader context of the siege  and the fall of Troy itself becomes the launch pad for the epic tale of Aeneas  who escapes the burning city to eventually found Rome  in Virgil s later poem The Iliad  with the Odyssey  was memorised by Greeks of the time as Muslims today memorise the Koran  They constituted their moral code and the heroes within them were their life models The tragedy of the Iliad is on the grand scale  The gods preside over a field of death  on which men are locked into a pitiless struggle  their individual actions dictated by rules of honour and heroism  Achilles himself is the ultimate tragic hero and man of destiny  fully aware that his life is destined to be cut short in its prime  and motivated only by his own inflexible code of conduct  in which his personal wishes are paramount  Nowadays he would be locked up as a psychopath  and yet there is an overwhelming pathos about him that transcends the carnage he metes out and raises him in our eyes to the point that we accord a respect to him that we would not accord to the gods  those inhuman creatures who dole out death and destruction from their Mount Olympus for the pure pleasure of it  to relieve their immortal boredom  Lattimore is my favorite translators of ancient Greek texts  He stays as true as one can when translating to the actual text rather than adding his own touch  I like that he refers to Aias as such instead of the commonly English Ajax  the Greeks have no letter equivalent of j   However  I often suggest Fagles  translation if you are looking for something that is easier to read  because Fagles adds that fancy English to his translation to make it more comprehendible and enjoyable There is much debate about the reasons why Homer wrote the Iliad and exactly who Homer was  Regardless  the book was most likely orated many times before it was written  as can be seen when there are lists  passages and epithets that are repeated  Sometimes I think that this repetition makes it difficult or sometimes boring to read  However  once you get past the lists  the Iliad is amazing  A friend of mine once told me that she thought that the scene between Hektor and Andromache is the most beautiful scene in literature  I am inclined to agree with her   The Iliad was written about 2800 years ago  but it will remain relevant as long as nations and peoples go to war  What stood out to me in my latest reading of Homer s Trojan War epic poem    perhaps because I am writing these words at a time when American soldiers and marines are fighting in a faraway land    was the way in which Homer conveyed the ordinary soldier s experience of combat  Such an achievement might seem impossible  considering all the time that Homer spends either chronicling the intrigues of the gods or setting forth the differences between the Greek and Trojan nobles who lead the armies  but nonetheless the poem dramatizes powerfully the manner in which the experience of war brings out the best in some soldiers and the worst of others  Robert Fagles  translation brings forth well the rich and evocative quality of Homer s poetry    the way in which it mixes lyrical descriptive passages with images of shocking violence  Agamemnon  Achilles  Hector  Andromache  Helen  Paris  Priam  and the original  cast of thousands  come to vivid life  It is always good to visit with the characters of The Iliad  as almost 100 generations of readers have done before us  Wow  I stayed away from the greek classics for a long time  foolishly thinking they had nothing to offer me  How wrong could I have been  This book is a mammoth  it almost defies belief considering how hard it would have been to write  but its soul is intimate  The book follows the tragic arc of battle and leaves a lot of modern books far in the shade  The characters are real fallible humans and their mistakes look a lot like our mistakes  The consequences are a lot more visceral  i e  get in a huff  get your friends killed  but still it s clear what s happening and even across the distance of time it s quite possible to empathise with the characters  Strangely the foreword is an excellent read and sets a solid context for what follows  If I m critical the bits I don t like are the bits around the Gods  But then if you think about it Homer is just using the common thought tools of the time to explain the mysterious  So that s an unfair nitpick in a lot of ways The translation is excellent and based on this I m going to the bookshop to buy more Homer  You should too       UPDATE  Achilles is about to kill Hector  Sigh  A guide to my rating system                                                                     5 Stars  This book is a timeless classic and undisputed member of the literary canon  I read and loved it 4 Stars  This book is a personal classic  A book I am happy to read again and again and think you would enjoy it too 3 Stars  This is a book I read and thoroughly enjoyed  I recommend only if you are interested in the subject matter I do not list books that I would not eagerly pick up and read again  including those in the literary canon   i e  Kant  Hobbes  etc                                                                        I first read parts of the Illiad during my freshman year   Fall 1985   I recently re read the Odyssey twice and am about to finish the Illiad  6 27 2009 What can I say  I love Homer  who now ranks with Shakespeare and Whitman among my favorite poets  I wish I could could read and speak Ancient Greek  I ve read the Fitzgerald translations of Homer s classics and they are great I am struck by several things that I will list and will elaborate on at another time 1  The aphoristic quality of the poems  It is hard to turn the pages without cherry picking lines and pondering their deeper meaning  Each is its own bible  They say Alexander the Great lugged a copy of the Illiad around  The great Roman General Scipio  who razed Carthage  is said to have had most of the Illiad memorized  19th century PR William Gladstone argued that you could construct an entire college curriculum around Homer  Not bad endorsements  2  Both books got me thinking about religion  about God and Gods and the nobility of paganism  I ve longed believe that we need a form of religion in our lives to function well  Piety  in other words  is important and it can have different forms  More on this later 3  The Illiad  War as metaphor for life and how we should live nobly and with virtue  4  The Odyssey  The long and dangerous journey home as metaphor for living nobly and with virtue To be continued     Things I liked about this book I had boldly signed up for the Centuries Challenge where I had listed this book as one of my selections  I went to the library and asked for it  The librarian  she knows me well enough     gave me this look   the look that was somewhere between surprise and sympathy  Surprise because I pick up YA   mysteries   chick lit from the library and sympathy because she could tell that I didn t know what I was getting into I took me 30 minutes with the book to realise what I had done  I had got the library s oldest translation of Iliad  No offence to Iliad fans but I was lost   Then I had the sense of calling a friend who s a major in literature and asking if there was an easily readable translation of this great book  On her suggestion I got Penguin Classic with translations by Robert Fagles and Bernard Knox After that I sailed through  Took me a month to finish it though   Most important thing was I finished it The story of Final days of battle of Troy has been told in a very beautiful manner  I had the 911 on Greek mythology after reading Percy Jackson and watching some movies like Helen Of Troy and Troy   so I was on safe grounds  But now coming to the story   did I like it   Tricky question My answer   Yes and NoI was taken by the style but this whole Battle Of Troy scenario has never impressed me   You might ask why  I  ll give you some of my reasons Achilles  Hector  Menelaus Odysseus  Aias  were not just warriors they were men of valour and courage who fought a battle so long and so unnecessary Trust me it was avoidable   but they had to keep the oath and all  so they fought   Interference of Gods was something I totally disliked   Could have let them fight their own battles for once  Gods being Gods had to meddle in this   Good thing was  these men were immortalised by Homer through this epic  This blood bathed battle took away so many years out of these mens lives   just think   Is there anything to be happy about this story Even though I absolutely loved the writing   I don t always find that this story is justified  This is solely my opinion And I know I will be criticised for criticising this immortal classic but it s my opinion I am staying away from Greek Mythology for a few days  A month long Iliad reading was all I could handle but that doesn t stop me from recommending this book  which I feel is a must read for anyone who loves literature Things I disliked about the book   Too many sub plots   too many characters   Too many things going wrong for everybody  exception   Gods  Loved the writing style but couldn t disagree more with the plot  On my rating scale   This is an excellent piece of literature for which I am not qualified enough to rate  A breathtakingly good translation of what is perhaps the most powerful and important work in Western literature  Fagles  translation is fast  readable  and well worded  This is my new favorite translation This is my third reading of the Iliad  and what follows are my general reflections on the poem  independent of what is peculiar to Fagles  translation  Almost everyone in the Iliad is proud  arrogant  petty  and even childish  both men and gods  Moreover  the Greek gods micromanage the affairs of mortals  directing their individual and national fates rather like obsessed fans and gamblers injecting steroids into their favorite racehorses and sabotaging others  sneaking into the stables while the staff s backs are turned  praying that they won t be discovered by the track owner  who claims to maintain fairness but who frequently tips the odds in favor of one horse for the sake of some bonny young lady who fawns over him  such are the Greek gods to the mortals beneath them  They are nothing like fathers loving and guiding their sons  The Greeks have nothing that compares with the Incarnation  whereby God altered the destinies of all men alike by an act of supreme self abasement and self sacrifice  The pagans were too small minded to anticipate such a thing  We are all small minded  No one could have guessed what God was going to do  The gods which man invents purport to save only his body and serve his physical  economic  and political needs  but the God who made man saves his soul and serves his spiritual needs before all others  even  when necessary  at the expense of all others   It would take nothing less than the Incarnation of Christ for true virtue to appear in the world  a world which today  having rejected the one  can no longer hold on to the other   I wanted to know more about Troy and Achilles and this story satisfied me Although written in what we would describe as the simplistic language of the day    it made it easier to read because of it  eg  describing the onslaught of soldier to the large waves of a storm breaking on to the shore  The story of Achilles is a somewhat sad one      as his destiny is written when he is born    he knows it lies in Troy   his end is in Troy   and his mother the Goddess Thetis cannot change that Although he refused to fight   the Gods who were playing the battle like their own chess game  came down in a human form and put the idea of sending Patroclus dressed in Achilles Curass to frighten the Trojans back The rest is history What surprised was that the Gods played a major role in this battle for Troy  Sometimes coming down in human form and putting ideas in men s minds  Perhaps they were the ancient aliens  It certainly seemed this way I love the story     but then I love all things ancient   This is my second time reading through this book  I really enjoy the Iliad  This book is not written as a politically motivated piece to convince to reader of the moral superiority of one of the sides  Troy was destroyed because it was fated to be so  Nothing the combatants could have done right or wrong could avoid their fate  Zeus the master of the Gods  could not overrule the fate of Hector  Unbearable a man I love  hunted round his own city walls and right before my eyes  My heart grieves for Hector  Hector who burned so many oxen in my honor  rich cuts    Come your immortals  think this through  Decide  Either we pluck the man from death and save his life or strike him down at last  here at Achilles  hands   for all his fighting heart  Athena reminded Zeus   A man  a mere mortal  his doom sealed long ago  You d set him free from all the pains of death   Then Father Zeus held out his sacred golden scales  in them he placed two fates of death that lays men low   one for Achilles  one for Hector breaker of horses   and gripping the beam mid haft the Father raised it high and down went Hector s day of doom  dragging him down to the strong House of Death  Hector was the more likable man in many ways  He was defending his home from an invasion and trying to fight for Troy s independence and freedom  He loved his people  his wife  and child and was a dutiful son to his father  He was also dutiful to the gods  But in the end it was his fate to day that day and nothing would let him escape that fate  Achilles was not spared that fate for long  He was the best warrior there and killed scores of men but his fate brought him down as well Homer had a unique insight into war at least for his time  The people who died were often described  Some were great men  some were overachievers  and some neither good or bad just happened to be their time  I have read this book twice and have loved it better the second time  I have the Robert Fitzgerald translation and it is wonderfully easy to read  After trying to read the Elizabethan English version of Hamlet  this is a breeze  I am enjoying following the story  My only issue is the spelling of names that Fitzgerald uses  I was reading the Wikipedia summary before I realized that one of the Aias in the book is actually Ajax  And I slow down every time I read Achilleus  return Homer certainly described the battles well  He moves around  shows the various individual battles that occur  and always keeps the interference of the gods clear  A lot of people get wounded or killed while trying to steal the goods off of a fallen warrior  Greed could be a major theme of this book  return One thing I liked about the book  that I was afraid of when I started  is how well the text does of clarifying what side each person is on  There are so MANY names mentioned in this book  But usually each time a name or conflict is mentioned something is said to help point out who is with the Trojans and who is with the Greeks  return Achilles is a warrior who makes war and takes power easily  Yet he is a man of passions and when he is angered by Agamemnon he cannot let go of his pride  When Patroclos is killed  he cannot move forward in his grief  but holds it and is held by it for 11 days  Even the abuse of Hector s body does not provide him any relief  just exhaustion with no rest  When Thetis comes to tell him Zeus says to give Hector s body back  he quickly agrees  Tired and ready to lay down the load of grief  For my final in English class  I had to read this book  The book The Iliad was written by Homer  The basic idea of the story is  Paris picked Helen as being the fairest in the land and got to marry her  Helen s people did not like this so the ten year war began between the Trojans and the Greeks  At the end  the Greeks devised a plan  They would build a huge wooden horse  A few soldiers would then hide inside the horse and the rest of the army would appear as though they had left  The Trojans would then take the horse as a parting gift inside the city  Then  the soldiers would come out at night from inside the horse and open the gates for the rest of the army to come in and slay the Trojans  The plan worked perfectly and in the end  the Trojans were defeated  The original version of The Iliad is for seniors in high school and college students  However  simpler versions can be found for sophomores and juniors in high school  People who like mythology and action books would like this book  This is not a book for people who are against war or like romance books  But  for people who like action  war  and mythology  this is the perfect book   A classic might be defined on many counts  But when a book can tell a tale so grand and so glorious and so vast in its reach  that it makes me feel as tiny as a bug  then that story is a classic for me  no doubt  Iliad  the tale written centuries back  is such a classic  I took my time reading it  a long time indeed  right from January to December of this year  It was a journey of sorts where sometimes I walked  sometimes I stumbled  and sometimes I glided  as steadily I moved from the opening pages of the book when Achilleus and Agamemnon enter into a dispute which hurts Achilleus  ego so much that he decides to not fight in the war with the Trojans  to the grand and massive war that holds many tales within itself of glory and deceit  to eventually the reasons that bring back Achilleus in the battle  Iliad is not for the faint hearted as it holds many gruesome fights  nor is it for the amateur readers for the book calls for patience that only experience can deliver  But if you love the tales of fiction  and if you have a love for anything Greek  and if English of the old is not a daunting language  then Iliad is a fine fine read  indeed  The book  said to be originally written and narrated by Homer  is the story of the war between the Achaeans and the Trojans  which began after Alexandros  also known as Paris   the younger brother of Hektor  brings home Helen  the wife of Menelaus  who is the brother of Agamemnon  The Achaeans bring their army to Troy to carry back Helen  their army also includes the Myrmidons led by Achilleus  After years of on going war with the Trojans  a dispute between Achilleus and Agamemnon causes Achilleus to withdraw from the war  Much of the book then talks of the various heroes in this battle  their moments of bravado in trying times  and their loyalty for their king  The story of the men fighting the battle on the ground shows just one side of the coin  The other side is equally colourful if not more  that of the Gods and their ways  Zeus  the strongest of the Gods  is one of the central characters of Iliad and much of what happens has to do with his desires and his furies  The other Greek Gods  like Athene and Apollo and Hera and quite a few more  too take sides in this on going war  and try to turn the tide in favour of their favourites  whenever possible  The story shows the Gods in another light altogether  with their emotions of love and jealousy are no less human  They provide this glorious tale its best moments of twists and turns  Iliad is filled with numerous personalities  all with big egos and their own sense of fair and unfair  There are a few who are intimidating by the strength they carry in their deeds and voice  the likes of Hektor  Achilleus and Agamemnon  The book is filled with lengthy dialogues and long monologues  rich in their language  carrying a style of their own  The story is also rich with anecdotes from Greek mythology  which are enjoyable to look out for separately to know that much a little more  As I said before  Iliad is a book for an enthusiast  someone who loves literature of the richest and purest form  and who is patient with the words he reads  tiring even if at times they may be  Iliad is a book for a lover of historic tales that carry with them a sense of awe and grandeur  which nothing of the modern world can replicate  For such folks  Iliad will be a classic  a story that would stay with you for years and years to come     24 books of meticulously translated epic Greek poetry is pretty difficult to read in two weeks  especially while conducting a college level study  but the quality of the translation  as well as the fun of the story and the absolute importance of it all  makes this a reading experience that stands out from the rest What strikes me first about THE ILIAD was the attention that the Greeks paid to violence in battle  Homer doesn t just describe the killing  he characterizes it  giving specific details as to how the various Trojans and Greeks killed each other in battle  Spears are stabbed through throats  arms are severed below the elbow  and innards are spilled in any manner of ways  Certain books seem to contain almost nothing but fighting and battles  esepcially through the middle of the book  Patroclus  masquerade as Achilles  which predictably costs him his life  is a beautiful sequence  as the dramatic irony builds alongside the violence  It serves to escalate the war to its peak  the duel between Hector and Achilles  and the gruesome aftermath The story of the Trojan Horse is probably the most famous and most alluded to event in Greek mythology  and to read the narrative from which it came is a satisfying experience  Odysseus  methods are on display lavishly  as they set up the equally long narrative that follows THE ILIAD and as they win the war for the Greeks  It s the first story sequel of all time  perhaps  these two poems of Homer s and for that alone they are worth reading  Thankfully  Fitzgerald s translation makes them even more so  Others have talked about the amazing story of the Iliad and it is great  but for this review  I m just going to focus on the translation  The three definitive translations of The Iliad are Lattimore  Fitzgerald and Fagels  As others have pointed out  Lattimore s translation is considered to be closest to the text  but I found it awkward  Fitzgerald is considered more poetic and readable  but not particularly true to the text and personally I found it less readable  Fagels seems to find a happy medium between literal translation and readability and is my favorite translation  Translation is always going to change the impression and meaning to some extent  so if what one really wants is to read the original  one is probably best served by learning the language in which the story was originally written  Of course this still won t achieve the aim of understanding the text as it was meant to be interpreted  For this  one must also study the history  values and culture of the author and his or her audience extensively so one can assess how it would have been viewed in context  If you were just hoping to enjoy one of the greatest stories ever told  and learning ancient Greek is more than one was up for  just pick the translation that suits you best and enjoy the story  Considering the vast cultural differences between most English speakers and Homer  supporting your reading with supplementary material may also be worth your while in grasping some of the subtleties  For example  Book II lists the various stuff each Greek commander brings to the fight down to the number of cooking pots per boat  I ve struggled with this chapter a few times and suspect I will always find it immensely dull  A friend who enjoys MTV s  Cribs  however  loved it  Anthropologists  though  can explain why this catalogue is important in understanding how the various leaders stack up against one another  In understanding why Achilles and Agamemnon are so angry with one another  it is useful to note their respective places on in the pecking order   It s implausible to think that I could add much of value to 2 800 years of commentary and analysis on one of the foundational works of western literature  So that leaves me with making few stray  possibly stupid observations This is my second reading of The Iliad  the first  more than a decade ago  was a translation by Robert Fagles  Of the two  Robert Fitzgerald s seems more forcible  more lofty  more inspiring  Fagles was the more accessible translation in the popular sense  but if forced to recommend one over the other  read Fitzgerald s What stands out in this second reading is how strange and wonderful it is that a national epic  the ancient Greeks   in this case  is not a one sided  nationalistic tale  The most sympathetic character in the entire affair isn t a Greek  but a Trojan  Hector  The most touching moment in this bloody and glorious epic occurs in Book Six  when Hector visits his wife and infant son for what will be  unbeknownst to all but the reader  the last time  Homer relates the scene and conveys dialogue with such poignency  it packs a serious emotional wallop that should tug the heartstrings of even the most cynical modern reader It s sometimes believed that this epic amounts to a multi week temper tantrum by the Greeks  greatest warrior  Achilles   The Wrath of Achilles  would  indeed  be a better title than  The Iliad   not least because most of the major events that people today know about the Trojan War  from its cause at the Judgment of Paris to the death of Achilles via his heel to the Trojan Horse  don t occur in this particular poem Even so  I think viewing Achilles  rage as somehow unjustified fundamentally misreads the story  not simply because the Greeks had a different  and more strict  standard of honor than we do  No  Achilles was justified  The entire Trojan War was precipitated because one man  the Trojan prince  Paris  stole the wife of another man  a Greek king  Menelaus   What sparks Achilles  wrath is that the Greek leader  Agamemnon  not incidentally  the brother of the very Menelaus on whose behalf all the Greeks are going to war  is upset that he needs to give up a female slave to please the gods  and when Achilles points out that Agamemnon should do the right thing and give her up  Agamemnon peevishly steals Achilles  would be paramour  Briseis  Agamemnon commits the very breech of decency against Achilles that drove the Greeks to war in the first place  When it comes to Achilles  rage  honestly  one can t blame the guy In any case  The Iliad is probably the greatest work of literature I ve ever read  I can t recommend this sumptuous feast enough  It s hard to think up something to say about The Iliad  It s been an acknowledged classic of world literature for longer than most genres have existed  While reading it I was editing City of God for a class and was reminded that Augustine quotes Homer  There isn t anything I could possibly say that would contribute to its critical repuation So I ll say something about its popular image  When people asked me what I was reading and I told them  they were taken aback  The Iliad is not supposed to be summertime reading  Similarly  a misguided high school English teacher who will remain nameless told me that The Odyssey was better because it was just about a guy trying to get home  and therefore  more human  than a story about a bunch of muscle bound guys hacking at each other  I think both these attitudes are a product of The Iliad s immense reputation as a serious work of literature  It is  but it s also a great story with some excellent characters and  approached the right way  it s downright fun  It s clearly not a modern novel  There s odd and seemingly perverse behavior  times in changed in the last several thousand years   There is nearly a complete book that just lists the Greek and Trojan forces  that s what they invented skimming for   But give it a chance  and it might surprise you  now that i have turned in my essay i suppose i can now click the  i m finished  button  sometime at the beginning of the year  possibly not even during latin class  chenier said that everyone is either an odyssey person or an iliad person  and that if you re an odyssey person  you re wrong  i thought about that often while reading this and i have to conclude that he is correct on both counts  a one star review of the iliad on here  written by an odyssey lover  bemoans the lack of adventure and mystery and mythology that the odyssey has and the iliad does not  which makes the odyssey sound pretty epic lite  i don t know  those words  the way they written  are like inherently flashy  an advertisement for a 3D cinematic spectacle  or something  that s like  the worst of the odyssey  the iliad is far more bare and brutal and essential  and by essential i m trying to transform  essence  into an adjective  weird how essential isn t just an adjectival form of essence  it s become something else   as in  the iliad doesn t stray far from a core something  i don t know  certain core human values  words like  core  and  essence  and  root  fit it well  when i try to talk about essence or core or root i m always transported to the heavy lurching rhythm of the beginning lines from the sylvia plath poem  elm    I know the bottom  she says  I know it with my great tap root  It is what you fear  I do not fear it  I have been there   the iliad is about the bottom  the much feared bottom where only the root emotions dwell   such as rage  an emotion that also plays a big part in  elm   elm and the iliad have a lot in common  sort of  weird   i mean  the iliad isn t just this lean dark humorless epic about rage and root emotions  but also at bottom that s what it is  it s strangely conceptual  a study in rage via a telling of the trojan war  which also isn t to say it s  like  concept over plot character  especially because this would be nothing without THESE characters  without achilles or hector  patroclus  priam  agamemnon  etc etc phoenix etc etc zeus etc etc   that would be  er  rather high concept for something created a few hundred years BC  but you know  not sure how to  rate  this  never sure how to  rate  literature  but right now in particular  because the iliad is beyond me and my goldenrod cartoon yellow stars  i m not sure how it could be anything other than what it is  that s not my duty to comprehend  so i guess i ll give it five stars   Here are some things that I think are important about the Trojan War and the Iliad  Please help correct me if I m wrong  This is just a series of notes The Iliad was meant to be performed  Its authors were almost definitely non literate and its performers were definitely non literate Most scholars are almost certain that we have the original version of The Iliad  word for word  but only from the Peisistratian Athenian tyranny Everything the civilizations Homer wrote about  Mycenae and Troy  was lost to him  We know more about Mycenae and Troy than he does  The Iliad is a legend and a myth The Iliad was written in 750 BC  Mycenae fell around 1 200 BC  The Trojan War occurred shortly before the fall of Mycenae  around 1 180 BC  according to the earliest scholars of the Trojan War  who were only Homeric scholars and not true historians  Mycenae only could have destroyed Troy VI through Troy VIIb  archeological layers of Troy  The warriors are a series of individual portraits  They fight and think differently  This is usually attributed to the characteristics and preferences we have as individuals  Their differences are explained by their different personalities  I believe that the warriors are a pantheon of heroes selected from different times  that span centuries The story s heroes are mythological but mortal warriors  The gods involved in the story are not meant to impress so much as interfere with the warriors and their fortune The cause of the Trojan War is no longer a cause of war today  The theft and rape of women was the motivation behind the war  as it was so many wars in ancient times Patroclus and Achilles had a relationship that does not exist in the modern world  with some exceptions I won t get into  as not to offend people   it was a sexual and hierarchical partnership between erastes and eromenos  I listened to the first five or so books of the Iliad as an audio book  I read synopses of all 24 books  and then I read in detail several sections  I m probably not going to read the whole thing straight through without the encouragement of a class or fellow reader  I have wanted to read The Iliad  and The Odyssey and The Aeneid  for ages  so I m glad that reading a modern retelling by Madeline Miller  The Song of Achilles  prompted me to finally delve into this iconic story I was utterly fascinated by the scope of the narrative  it sort of starts in the middle and only covers a short period of time   the development of the characters  the narrative voice  the conventions of language  the interactions between gods  the backstories of many I find it easy to understand its timeless appeal  I find it less easy to understand how to interpret its overall message  It does not seem to glorify war  and yet is is much about war  As a companion to the Iliad  I read Caroline Alexander s masterful interpretation of the Iliad as an anti war epic The War that Killed Achilles The True Story of Homer s Iliad and the Trojan War from 2009  I find her thesis very convincing and her explanation of the Iliad s cultural setting completely riveting I don t know that it matters how one interprets it  though  The fact is that it endures because it is a reflection on life  death  war  fate  fame  glory  mortality     and the cost of each to individuals  to families and to society  You read it  you reflect on it  you talk about it with your friends  That s probably what Homer intended and what has been happening for a long long time A good review of Alexander s book can be found here  http   www nytimes com 2009 10 18 boo    I can t write my whole review just yet  but I can put down sixteen of my main observations  I m just glad I finished it  Talk about a huge work that must be read by all with a Western education  1  War is extremely hard to do when you have really annoying gods always messing everything up  2  Zeus might be my least favorite character in all of literature  and he has some very unusual seduction tactics 3  Odysseus is one of my favorites  4  I thought I would be siding with Achilles  but I ended up rooting for Hector and liking him a lot more  Achilles is almost like Hamlet  if Hamlet had an intense anger management problem  5  Achilles is a huge jerk when he gets angry  6  He also cries a lot  7  The Iliad is quite possibly the most violent book I have ever read 8  The Greeks were big on repetition  9  This is the only war book I have ever read that describes each person that fights and dies in excruciating detail  Including their name  background  and whether the spear went in their brain or nipple  10  Paris might be the sissiest guy in all of literature  The name doesn t help  11  The most violent description I read was when someone smashes a guy s face in with a boulder  and the victim s eyes pop out of their socket and the face actually caves in  Ouch  12  There s no Trojan Horse here  go check out The Aeneid for that 13  Considering that  Homer  tells us at least 20 times that the Achaeans have long hair  I was waiting for who their favorite rock bands were  14  I don t really know why people complain so much about the catalog of ships  its quite skippable  15  The point of the poem is to chronicle Achilles  decision to attain either nostos or kleos  A homecoming or a death that will give him eternal glory  I think you know what he chooses 16  I was quite surprised by the fact that this book does not glorify war at all  There you have it  for now   wow  what didn t I learn from this book  loyalty  courage  gods and goddesses in the affairs of men  only the good die young  everyone has their Achilles heal  sorry   even Hector  Homer was a brilliant writer  whoever they were  Thanks to Byzantine and Artab and Irish and Jewish culture for saving these books for us  The Cretans and the Amazons rocked  Friendship and guest friendship is all  Be careful which translation you read  some are good  some are not  I still enjoy Fitzgerald but I am also still a King James fan      in other words     old fashionned or possibly just old   above all  WAR SUCKS  This may be the greatest anti war book ever written  check out the descriptions of the wounds and the deaths  And the ancients gace great funerals   Also my favorite totem animal the trojan horse  not in the book but that s what ends the war  NOT a glorious battle  And the gods goddesses in the end will desert you  Cassandra was right  You are on your own  Everyone should read this book  It is truly a classic  Now that I ve read it  I understand what a literary work has to be to withstand the test of time  Many passages were unbelievably uplifting granting me the opportunity to experience a new level of pleasure  This constantly reminded me of Longinus and his concept of the sublime  No wonder that Plato was mesmerized by Homer s elevated style  Surely  this is one of the books that worth revisiting again and again  I highly recommend it to book lovers Among the issues it revolved around  I strongly enjoyed the struggle of power between the gods  Zeus on his part tried  sometimes very hard  to show himself as far more powerful than all other gods together  Of course  a god that has chained the titans and is the first born should have such power  However  he wanted this fact to be highlighted here and there  so he would not be challenged  Nevertheless  there were some parts that he was challenged  which went unanswered  This notion of power was extended to mankind as well  between allies and enemies  One might even say that Achilles had the role of Zeus for the Argives  while Hector had it for the Trojans  Both Achilles and Hector at times tried to prove their power to other soldiers  If probed  this notion was ensconced in every part of this epic   Mnoho desetileti uplynulo  nez jsem se dostal k teto knize  Presto vsak myslim  ze je treba do ni dozrat  ostatne jako do kazde knihy  a precist si ji Obaval jsem se  co se mnou udela literatura stara skoro tri tisice let  Musim rict  ze jsem byl hodne prekvapen  a to v tom dobrem slova smyslu  Bezpochyb tomu dopomohl i vicemene soucasny Sramkuv preklad  ktery na rozdil od originalu pouziva volny

velka pohadka pro dospele  aby se meli cim zabavat  kdyz zrovna nejeden Internet  Ja si navic udelal docela poradek v recke mytologii  ktera mi do teto doby znacne splyvala s rimskou  Ba co vic  tehdejsi pojeti bozstev mi je mnohem sympatictejsi nez soucasne sigletonni  Tehdy byli bohove stejni hajzlove jako lide  hadali se  byli korumpovani  intrikarili  podvadeli  svadeli  Az je skoda  ze byla tato predstava nahrazena necim tak uboze sterilnim  Ovsem to je na jinou debatu  I first read this book when I was 12  I remember it as an old book  with a cardboard for a cover and a handwritten  Iliad  on the front  dog eared and with some edges either torn or folded  I remember thinking that it must have been a good book to be in that condition It was better than good  To am impressive little girl  the poetry of Homer is pretty amazing  Indeed it was very long and at times I would skip pages and go straight to the action parts  It was through this book that I developed my interest in the Greek Gods and through the years I would sought out old books about Greek Mythology Yes  the god s were petty and their quarrels can be tiresome  but one must admit that their loves and lives were very entertaining  well  at least to me  a mere mortal I have re read this book at least three times since then The current Hollywood trend of making movies based on the Greek gods made me want to read The Iliad again  And it was as if I have never read it  I was still awed by the prowess of the Achaeans  moved by the resilience of the Trojans and pissed at the sheer stupidity of the gods  Fast paced  action  and death  is exactly what this book contains  This book has a never ending flow of action  It might start out slow but once it takes off it takes off  The way this book describes the action and the blood lust of war just makes you feel as if you were actually there  This book doesn t just tell you about the trojan war but paints a picture for you in your head  The characters in the book are just so awesome that you just need to read on to see what happens To start off the action in this book makes  I mean non stop battles and killings just make it impossible to put down  The action is great but also very descriptive at the same time  which helps you get a picture rather then just reading a few lousy words  Not only is the action good it carries the plot along to make the book enjoyable  and fun to read Characters  characters  and more characters  What can I say about the multitude of different characters in this book  There is the almighty Achilles a walking god amongst men  Then their is the greedy and bloodthirsty King Agamendon who is just out for money and power  Then there is the son of Troy Prince Hector who is a noble and one of the greatest warriors from Troy  The list goes on and on  Just as many characters as there is there is as many personalities which means there is a character someone can find a little of their self in Lastly the question this book raises is was there really even a trojan war  Many historians say it did some say it didn t  Weather it was real or not the author Homer has made a great story  May it be based on real events or not it is a great piece of work to real and enjoyable To wrap it up this book was a masterpiece I would recommend to anyone who enjoys action  The book is just action packed and doesn t leave you bored as many other books are known to do to people who aren t to fond of reading  such as me  The characters really make the book  Without them it would just be action but do to the characters and their actions it shapes the story and the book  Even though people aren t sure if the trojan war was even real there is one thing i am sure of  and that is that this book is a piece that everyone should read  I often feel profoundly uneducated  particularly around the subjects to which I supposedly devoted the better part of my education  namely literature and history  This is not an indictment of the teachers and professors I had throughout my schooling  who were by and large excellent  but rather owes to the fact that it is quite possible to go through 20  years of formal education in the United States and still not be exposed to the classics of world literature or significant portions of world history It was in such a mood that I picked up The Iliad  not so much for pleasure but rather to fill in an essential gap in my mental bookshelf   Amazingly  although in school we read portions of the Aeneid  the Epic of Gilgamesh  and the Kalevala  we never read the The Iliad   I expected reading the book to be rather like taking medicine or going to the gym  I knew it would be good for me and I could feel virtuous for having done it  but I expected no real pleasure  Frankly  I expected to be bored I was delighted to discover that I found the The Iliad to be both exciting and extremely moving  There is a sense of futility that clings to all of the characters  but most especially Hector  as they struggle against other warriors and the capriciousness of the gods  all for a cause that is not theirs  The complete senseless of the war  brought about by vanity and pride  is underscored by its terrible human cost  the scene of Hector leaving his wife for the last time and her  accurate  vision of her coming enslavement and their infant son s death is heartbreaking  made more so because honorable men on both sides of the conflict are powerless to stop the horror  This time around I was struck by Knox s astute observation  in his introduction to this Fagle s Penguin  on the nature of demigods  Achilles and Helen  he argues  behave much like their immortal parents  They are one sided and almost primal in their force of personality  Neither has any qualms or remorse or really any consideration for the consequences of his actions  Achilles is not only the consummate warrior  but is  on some level  the essence of the Greek warrior  Likewise Helen is not just lovely  she is the force of love  Slowly through the text we see the humanization of both  Helen feels remorse for the war her actions caused  a remorse she had not demonstrated before  Achilles calms down enough to give Hector s body to Priam  He can  it turns out  be touched  This transformation is in part the subject of the poem  Achilles  rage eventually subsides as he becomes more human and less divine It is amazing to me how many abuse Achilles for returning to the field after Patroclus  death   Briseis no longer matters   my students ask   Achilles just drops it after all that bloodshed   What they miss is that Achilles  dishonor at Agamemnon s hands is not the subject of the poem  the rage is  Achilles is full of rage as the demigod of war  a semi mortal Ares  The object of the rage hardly matters  It switches from Agamemnon and his injustice to Hector quickly enough  and Achilles dismisses Agamemnon s half apologies as entirely irrelevant in his towering fury  Agamemnon is nothing to him  That lack of compassion is another of Knox s attributes of the semidivine and it abates only after Hector s demise What a great poem  Formative in Western literature  still insightful and relevant almost 3000 years later  and beautifully  if a little freely  rendered by Fagles  Knox s introduction makes this worth the  12 even if you adore Lattimore  An excellent book  The pathos and emotions of the characters are brilliantly brought about  It is not entirely about Helen  Nor does it end with the fall of Trojans  It is mainly about the two ill fated  ill starred characters  Achilleus and Hektor whose destiny is that  their souls fluttered free of the limbs went down into Death s House mourning and youth and manhood behind them   Multitudes fall in a war wherein even immortals take sides  The poem starts with a bitter dispute between Atreus s son Agagmemnon and Achilleus a division in the ranks of Achainans  The poem ends with a dirge for the fallen Hector  That headstrong Hector who refused to heed a sane advice but broods about the tragic consequences when faced with a man slaughtering Achilleus It is a tragedy of immeasurable proportions for the Trojans as the his parents and wife lament about the miseries which were likely to fall on them  their slavery and even death for the son of Hektor  Achilleus feels after the death of Patroklos   I wish strife would vanish away from among gods and mortals  and gall which makes a man angry for all his great mind  that gall of anger that swarms like smoke inside of a man s heart and becomes a thing sweeter to him   But it is destiny as he tells Priam   Such is the ways gods spun life for unfortunate mortals  that we live in unhappiness  but the gods themselves have no sorrows   Thus the gory details of a disastrous battle  there lingers humanity amongst mortals  Naturally  the poem ends with the lamentations of the parents of Hector and his wife  Helen for whom the bitter war is fought also laments his fall   I love The Iliad only a little bit less than The Odyssey  the other epic poem attributed to Homer  Together the two works are considered among the oldest surviving works of Western literature  and are certainly among the most influential  The Iliad deals with just a few weeks in the last year of the decade long Trojan War  This tale is of combat between eternal enemies  the Greeks and the Trojans  Achilles rage compels him to abandon the war after he feels betrayed by his King  Agamemnon  His anger is the cause of a terrible series of tragedies  as well as fuelling the Greek Gods of Mount Olympus to take sides and assist in the ever lasting battle Homer basically accomplished what I imagine one of his goals was   to immortalize the heroics and feats of the warriors and document the destruction of Troy for all time  There is a great collection of characters on both sides  while the story is filled with vivid action scenes and some epic speeches  There is quite a lot of  this one killed that one  and another one bit the bloody dust   There are more creative ways to kill someone with a spear than I ever imagined  Some of the details are actually fairly gory  yet Fagles beautiful translation makes it completely absorbing Whether Homer was one man or many  whether he composed it primarily from an amalgam of the existing tradition of epic poetic devices or it came primarily from the mind of a genius it is a work that does stand the test of time and is well worth the time of any reader  I read portions of this  I think  somewhere between 7 10  The Iliad has always been a story I ve just known  Much like the Bible or Lewis  Narnia books   Some classics  like the Hobbit  I distinctly remember more as discovery  Even if I felt like it dragged in places  I loved Homer s sense of grand poeima of tragedy as I found him in Lattimore I have just finished Fagles translation this 2012 and he does a decent job  though I am beginning to suspect that the Greek is the best  Nonetheless  the themes of mortality  grim war  glory  pity  and rage  resonate still  The characters of brilliant Achilles  Lord of Men Agamemnon  wily Odysseus  doomed Hektor  silver tongued Nestor  wronged Menelaus  ancient Priam  massive Ajax  bold Diomedes  and silver footed Thetis will all be remembered Iliad is always first on the Western  Great Books  lists  It earns it s keep  This is what Christ came to save us from Postscript  just read the version by Robert Fitzgerald  He s very close to Fagles  just a bit more lyrical and a bit less blasphemous  i e  does not use the word  cockles of your heart    The poetic technique that stands out to me is his lines that do not stop  His translation takes from both dynamic and antique and one wishes sometimes that he would chose This reading I really enjoyed the beginning and the end quite a bit  as well as the slow growing sense of urgency as the fates finally worked themselves out  The beginning is especially well done  telescoping events that happened before the ten years through similar events  The middle books  11 15  are a bit obtuse to me  Of course the scene at the end is heartbreaking as ever  and I m really wondering this time whether Homer means us to admire or despise Achilles  battle anger in books 17 22  I also love that the first  Great Book  of Western Civilization should be about the inevitability of death and remain in awe of how well Homer could put his civilization on display  almost as if he knew that the Gospel was coming  The Iliad is about a few weeks near the end of the Trojan War  which has been going on previously for ten years   where Achilles gets extremely pissed off that Agamemnon took his lady prize and decides that he and his Myrmidons weren t going to fight  The rest of the poem is about what happens because of that view spoiler    but ends after Hector s death and before the whole Trojan horse thing  hide spoiler   Achilles and Hector are surprisingly giant d bags  but for some reason I m okay with that  I guess that it makes sense in the context history of the poem  Either way  they re both dicks and both awesome  Patroclus is kind of a dumbo  though  He s like a puppy that just wants to please its master  Achilles   The ladies  as usual  are less like characters and more like reactions to sad parts and I m okay with that  too I d be interested in seeing a graphic novel version of this like Miller did with 300  I d also really love a Briseis PoV a la Wide Sargasso Sea  Someone get on both of these things  I love The Iliad  It is a fantastic story  However  one s enjoyment of The Iliad often comes down to the brilliance not of the writer  but of the translator  I downloaded this one for free from Project Gutenberg  so it doesn t say who the translator is  but I just don t enjoy it as much as I have in the past  The translator  rather gleefully announces in the introduction  which I skimmed when I was done  that he was choosing to use the Latin instead of Greek names where possible  Thus instead of  white arm d Hera  we have  white arm d Juno  and for some reason that really disturbed me  On top of that  the translation is not consistent sometimes using Greek names  Apollo  and sometimes Roman  Neptune   However  that as I already stated  is the fault of the translation The Iliad is the story of three year olds in the clothes of adults  God  gods   forbid Paris accept that the most beautiful woman in the world is already married  No  he won her in a contest neither she nor her husband had anything to do with  and by gum he ll have her  No one say anything negative to Aggememnon  lest he take away your  spoils   read as  human captive  even though you already have a wife you love  forcing you to throw a temper tantrum and get your buddies killed  Had the Greeks never heard of a time out  But then  isn t that part of what makes it so great  We all read it  or some parody of it  thinking  I would never do that  or  I couldn t behave like that  and yet   would you  Could you  Isn t The Iliad really a story of how we might behave if we could blame someone else for our behavior   Does anyone else hear a whiney petulant two year old   But Aphrodite promised me     or  Mommy you have to deal with that bully for me       The beauty of The Iliad is that  although few of us want to admit it  it deals with real people  Real people whom you know by name  and you know who their families are  and you know their dreams  And then you know the gruesome way they die  You know that no man in war dies in a vacuum  It affects not just him and his back story  but each person that he knew  The leaders of the world should be required to read it in all its horrific glory before declaring war  just for the reminder that they want to send real people off to fight and to die and that they don t want to be doing it over something stupid  When I first read The Iliad in college some 25 years ago  I thought that it would make for a great big screen action movie  And  despite Hollywood s recent effort  I still feel that way  There is plenty of action  it is  after all  a war story   with heroes and main characters on both sides of the battlefield and in the heavens  It can also be viewed as a psychological drama in the way the characters relate to one another and grapple with such concepts as glory  pride  and fate  Ah well  maybe one day a motion picture that captures all the swirling details of The Iliad will be made  Homer s great poem is widely considered to be the beginning of literature in the Western civilization  The tales told about the 12th century B C  war between Greeks and Trojans had been passed down for generations and enjoyed for centuries as an oral tradition  Homer  who lived in the 8th century B C   has been generally ascribed the story s author for combining the various tales into one narrative  divided into 24 chapters or books  Yet The Iliad offers only one small glimpse inside the Trojan War  As the story unfolds  we discover that the war has been going on for nine years  and an account of the events that led up to the war are sketched in for us here and there through dialogue between the characters  From such dialogue we learn that the war started when the Trojan prince Paris  sometimes called Alexandros   abducted Helen  Queen of Sparta  The leaders of the Greek city states rallied around the Spartan king  Menelaos  and  led by Menelaos  brother Agamemnon  organized a fleet to sail to Troy  located in modern Turkey  with the intention of sacking the city and returning Helen to Sparta  In Homer s day  and indeed in the centuries after The Iliad was transcribed  the details of the Trojan War were common knowledge among the Greeks  But a modern reader might become frustrated by what is perceived to be entire sections missing from the tale  For example  you will search in vain looking for the story of the Trojan horse within the pages of The Iliad  As I said  this poem concerns itself with just a window of time within the ten year war  So instead of a full account of the war  The Iliad concentrates on the war s larger than life heroes  Although both sides had proud warriors fighting for them  more Greeks are mentioned than Trojans  The reason for this  no doubt  is because the Greeks won the war  Homer knew his audience whom  one can be sure  expected no less than to hear tales of their great forefathers in this celebrated victory  Among the Greek heroes who fought for Menelaos and Agamemnon were Odysseus  whose 10 year journey back home after the Trojan War is the story of Homer s other great work  The Odyssey  the giant Ajax and his wily smaller cousin  known as little Ajax  the youthful Diomedes  and Achilles  the Greek s greatest fighter  Paris  older brother Hector led the Trojans  Other Trojan characters include Paris and Hector s father King Priam  and Aeneas  whose own wanderings after the fall of Troy are recounted in Virgil s The Aeneid  One last set of characters that needs to be introduced is the Greek gods  From their vantage point on Mt  Olympus  they watch the war like spectators at a gladiator fight  However  often in the poem they are said to control the actions of some individuals  and even to actively fight alongside the two armies  Indeed  each book is filled with moments where a god or goddess figures into the scene  Their supernatural powers also allow some of the heroes to converse with rivers and horses   view spoiler  It is curious to note that the goddesses Hera and Athena sided with the Greeks  while the male gods Ares and Apollo took the Trojan side  Since it was the Greeks who were victorious  what does that say about who were the stronger  more powerful gods  The gods also provide comic relief from the harshness of the battlefield  which is welcomed in such a tension filled epic  Homer describes them as argumentative and childish  not at all like the wise and omnipotent deities the Greeks and Trojans believe them to be  Zeus  the father of the gods  remains neutral  bent on guiding the war toward its destined end  but he does it in such a way that the other gods do not know his intentions  Thus  he indirectly creates the turbulence that exists between them  His wife Hera comes across as spiteful and Athena does not conduct herself much better  The war god Ares acts like a schoolyard bully and Aphrodite  who started the war by promising Helen to Paris  behaves like a spoiled child  Only Apollo displays some sort of restraint  bowing out of the conflict when Zeus  scales tip against the Trojans   Anger  is the first word of the poem  Specifically  it is the anger of the Greek warrior Achilles  who refuses to fight because of a wrong he feels he has suffered from Agamemnon  This is the key plot twist of The Iliad  as Achilles  pride and perceived affront to his honour get in the way of the greater well being of his fellow soldiers  Much of the first third of the book is devoted to a two day battle  At times  the action in the story becomes very intense  Homer does not mince words and has a way of describing death and mutilation in graphic detail  Take this example of how Diomedes slew a Trojan named Pandaros  His weapon being guided by Athena To cleave Pandaros  nose beside the eye And shatter his white teeth His tongue the brazen spearhead severed  tip from root  Then plowing on came out beneath his chin   Book V  When there is a pause in the battle  it is a welcome relief  as when Diomedes befriends another Trojan fighter  Glaucus  or when Hector takes a break from the battle and visits his wife and infant son  Achilles  continued absence from the war bookmarks the middle third of The Iliad  the events of which take place within a twenty four hour period  In Book IX  he makes a series of stirring anti war declarations when Odysseus tries to persuade him to return to the battlefield  Then in Book XVI  he makes the fateful decision to send his close friend Patrocles into battle  Though Achilles appears only sparingly up to this point in the poem  his presence  or lack thereof  overshadows much of what goes on in the middle eight books  Achilles  pride affects his decision to enter the war and makes it appear that he does not care about his fellow Greeks  But he does take an interest in the daily battles  particularly when the Trojans drive the Greeks back to the beach and threaten to set fire to their ships  Achilles was promised that Zeus shall redeem him before the whole army  so he can afford to not be too hasty to enter the battle because he knows he has divine right on his side  Though the Greeks sorely miss Achilles  they are still able to make small advances on their enemies  as when Odysseus and Diomedes attack the Trojan camp in a night raid or when Agamemnon rouses his army to fight  However  many of the army s best warriors receive wounds and must withdraw from the battle  leaving a scant few healthy leaders to rally the troops  It is during those times that they miss the strength and valour of Achilles  Indeed  the Trojans take advantage of his absence by waging war so far away from their city that they feel their courage and boldness increase as the battle wages on  The final third of Homer s epic resolves the struggle that began the work  Achilles wins back the honour lost to him and learns mercy and compassion  That is his lesson and the purpose of telling this story within the context of the war  The evolution of Achilles is a slow one  For two thirds of the book he broods  then after Patrocles is killed  he is vengeful  It is only in The Iliad s final two books  during the funeral games and when King Priam visits him  that we witness what his character was probably most like before the epic opens  There are allusions to his humane treatment of captured Trojans in previous battles  as well as his kind manner towards visitors of his camp  but much of what we see in the epic is a rash  temperamental young man  Of all the characters in The Iliad  Hector seems the noblest  This is somewhat surprising considering the Greek audience for this story  But Hector displays the leadership role of a hero  and he is not afraid to admit his mistakes  as when he foolishly decides to camp outside of the city the night before Achilles re enters the battle  His momentary decision to face Achilles unarmed and negotiate a peaceful settlement shows that he believes in other options besides fighting  It is only when he realizes that Achilles is out for blood that he dismisses the idea  His death is a tragic one  because he is all too aware that he cannot defeat the powerful Greek warrior  yet he fights him just the same  The one Greek who comes closest to matching Hector s gallant character is Diomedes  though his youth sometimes makes him act too brash   hide spoiler  I have read both a verse and a prose translation of The Iliad  W H D  Rouse s 1938 prose translation uses contemporary English  reads like a novel  and at 300 pages makes for a good pocket paperback edition  It is available as a Signet Mentor book  Robert Fitzgerald translated The Iliad into verse in 1974  Though it is a bulky 600 pages  the verses practically leap off the pages  I imagine them to be close to the essence of Homer s original poem  at least as close as one can get when translating a 2 800 year old work from the original Greek to a poetic English  It is available through Anchor Press  I am not an expert on translations of The Iliad but I know what I like  I do not like struggling to understand what is happening  I like my literature clear and direct  I browsed a number of versions of The Iliad and settled on this one as the best for me  It is clear and direct  It allows you to easily understand and enjoy what is a powerful story about real life battle and about not so real life interaction with gods  It is perhaps the greatest anti war story ever written  or at least worthy of mention in that category There are versions of The Iliad that don t even mention Zeus and the rest of his buddies on Mount Olympus  Instead  they mention Jove  the Roman god  Why  Homer  if my memory serves me correctly  was Greek  not Roman  Achilles and Agamemnon  Menelaus and Helen  and the rest of the cast  were all Greek or Trojan  Not a single one of them was a Roman  Why would a translator decide to translate the names of gods in Greek mythology to Roman mythology  Bad decision  And yet  some translators make that bad decision  Not our friend E V  Rieu  This translation is as Greek as pastichio  As part of my quest to be a Better and More Cultured Person  I decided I really needed to have read the Iliad already and it was kind of appalling that I hadn t  Sadly  I have not made myself learn Greek yet  so I went with the Lattimore translation  which was recommended to me as the translation that sounds the most like reading the original without actually having to learn Greek  It is in verse  and it s hexameter  though it s not dactylic hexameter  which is good because epic meter sounds really bizarre in English and I don t think I could deal  Anyway  this one has six beats per line  but a varying number of syllables  Sounds good to me I knew  going in  what was going to happen  because really  doesn t everyone   although I kept having to remind myself that most of the Trojan War isn t actually here  The casus belli  Nope   I kept wondering why Hera and Athena were so mad at the Trojans  Oh  right  the apple   The horse  Nope  that s the Aeneid  Penthesilea  Achilles dying  Pyrrhus  Nope  nope  nope  Not here What is here  pretty much  is  Agamemnon  Briseis  Achilles spending the entire poem being mad  Aeneas occasionally showing up and being awesome  I see why Virgil  you know  gave him a sequel   the problem of the duals  possibly not so relevant in translation   Achilles and Patroclus  Patroclus wearing his armor and dying  Achilles killing Hector and despoiling the body  some funeral games for Patroclus  Priam begging for the body back  Achilles not being mad  and Priam taking Hector s body for a funeral  That s it  Oh  and the gods screw around with pretty much all the things  Everything else you think happens in the Trojan War happens somewhere else  unless you count the lines and lines of people dying in great detail  By  great detail  I mean  we will list  for every dying soldier  which internal organs the spear that is killing them is puncturing   So I hope you like that  Also epithets  I really hope you like the words  breaker of horses   because you ll be seeing them a lot  In this translation  anyway I think I pretty much have to give this five stars because  well  classic of Western literature for a reason  I was pretty sure I was going to like it because  well  I already read the Aeneid  and I enjoyed the fighting dying battle parts  so I figured I was probably going to like the Iliad  And I did  Even if Achilles spent the whole thing whining because Agamemnon took Briseis   Also  yes  Achilles Patroclus  I think everyone ships it   Really the best adjective I have is  epic   but given that this is literally the definition of epic  I am not sure it is very helpful as an adjective  Seriously  It s awesome  No  really Yeah  this is a pretty awful review of this work  I m sorry  maybe someday I will try to come back and do it justice with a better review  But  hey  either you ve already read it or you really should  and you know you should  The Iliad  What can I say about this dark and beautiful story  If I m honest  I barely glanced at this book until my college years  most of my middle school high school education focused on The Odyssey instead   Even then my college grade classics courses mostly glossed over this first installment of Homer s epic  and I feel a little bit embarrassed to say that my interest in learning more about the story came from watching the movie Troy  At the time the movie came out I had no idea just how different it was from the actual narrative  The book is almost always better than the movie  I knew that much  but the extent it was true for this story totally knocked me through a loop  I don t have the space here to go into a lot of detail  but I will say the original themes of war  possession  and regret are treated with greater care  wisdom  and depth in the book  And the characters have far  far more nuance and complexity  I m not sure why I expected anything less In particular  I d like to highlight three characters who surprised me the most  Helen  Patroclus  and Hector  In the movie  Helen doesn t get a lot of credit for her opposition to the war  In the book we get a better understanding that she isn t an entirely willing party to her sojourn in Troy  She not only regrets coming with Paris  she actually lauds her husband Menelaus for his courage and prowess in battle Patroclus  too  isn t some whiny teenager who steals his cousin s armor in a fit of pique  Although the epic does portray Patroclus as gentle in nature  he s also a fully grown  strong and capable fighter  almost equal to Achilles  and certainly someone Achilles trusts and respects  In fact  Achilles gives Patroclus his armor to wear into battle  He trusts and values him that much  And Hector  Wow  Squeaky clean as he was portrayed in the movie  I was shocked to see some of the things he did in the narrative  Not only was his killing of Patroclus somewhat less than noble  he makes a point to strip Achilles  armor from the corpse and parade around in it afterward  Because Patroclus was so beloved by his comrades  Hector even orders his men to seize the corpse  defile it  and so humiliate and demoralize the Greeks Overall  I was deeply impressed by the vivid imagery and the complex and compelling motivations that tie this story together  Having enjoyed a lesser version of this tale in its cinematic form  I truly fell in love with it when I was finally introduced to the words  This is another story I come back to again and again and I always find something new to discover among its pages  The history of Western literature begins with Homer  The Iliad and The Odyssey are  in my opinion  two of the best ever written and are two of my all time favorites  If you want to begin to get more from all your reading  begin with Homer  and if you can  while in Ancient Greece  visit the  other  Greek bard Hesiod   because of the phenomena theorists call intertextuality you will soon see conscious and unconscious allusions  references and borrowings from Homer in many other works you read With this in mind I have tried over the last year to read all the great epic poems in the Western canon in order to enrich my reading generally  Homer  Virgil  The Aeneid     about the birth of Rome     another epic based on the sack of Troy  this one by a Roman almost 1000 years after Homer and inspired by Homer   Dante  The Divine Comedy   Milton  Paradise Lost  Homer was a great start Make sure you get a good translation     Fagles  Fitzgerald or Lattimore are all verse renderings and I ve read parts of all and I can recommend them  I know typically  between Homer s two works  The Odyssey tends to be more popular than The Iliad  Some people find the endless battle in The Iliad frustratingly boring  but I defend  that The Iliad is so  so much more  At its heart  The Iliad is politics personified  The Iliad really isn t about the Greeks and Trojans at all  In a way  both warring factions are a bit unimportant  The Iliad is about the Gods  About their favoritism  their arrogance  their scheming and lying and their very intricate and complex relationships with both each other and the mortals  The Iliad is my favorite epic because it s a real life lesson  You know  the one that teaches you ultimately that absolute power corrupts absolutely  and considering they re gods  when this lesson is applied  you just kind of end up with a bag full of assholes I love the Iliad  I rave about it constantly  I love the war  the meticulous details  the characters  the rich story that ebbs and flows  the petty gods  the heroes  the villains and everything in between  For me  from start to finish  the Iliad is a ride that can t be duplicated by any other work  not even The Odyssey But I do think it warrants saying that I do think someone who s familiar with Greek culture and Green mythology will enjoy this much more than someone who isn t  The Iliad is steeped in Greek culture  from the way in which the characters talk to each other  behave with each other  and ultimately the rituals that happen continuously through the book  Someone who isn t familiar with the culture may not understand the importance of the festival games after someone s death  or the sacrifices before any major decisions  Likewise  if someone isn t familiar with the relationships between the gods  all of their inner fighting may seem pointless  Knowing all this isn t necessary  but it probably helps At the end of the day this is a book I never get tired of reading  It s action packed  tense  crazy and all the things that make it an epic  It s a work of art and I can t recommend it enough   The Illiad is not lighter fare for the casual reader  but it stands as one of the most gripping tales I ve ever read  Knowing that the epic poem was preserved through time in the minds of storytellers such as Homer  the performer credited with our current version  amazes me  It is a story that blurs the lines between Heroes and Villains  As Hector and King Priam are praying for victory against their assailants  King Agamemnon is praying for the preservation of his men  Literature has never given us champions the likes of Hector and Achilles  Their efforts and their ends are the stuff of legend  The themes are potent and hold sway with modern readers just as they did so many ages ago  Purpose  honor  duty  devotion  love of family and country  sibling rivalry  measuring up  faith  etc  are all central to the story  Though not poetic in the typical sense  The Illiad does have a cadence  a rhythm  and it eases the challenge of tackling the unfamiliar vocabulary and sentence structure  I can t recommend this book highly enough  though  again  it should not be attempted unless the reader has the time to devote to it  With each read it becomes more and more a favorite of mine  and I find myself wishing I d known such men  I was truly amazed at how great of a story this book was the fist time I read it  seeing as how it was translated rom ancient Greek  Speaking of which  I was also quite surprised that the comprehension level of the book wasn t exceeding my abilities  and I understood it fairly easily  I love a book that can bring history to life  and The Iliad is a perfect example of this  I enjoyed reading about the great Olympians  and how the ancienct Greeks believed they tied directly into their everyday lives  particularly in the wars  It was fascinating to learn a little more about the culture and beliefes of this ancient people  especially the sacrifices and ceremonies they performed which were thought to be necessary to appease the all powerful deities of Olympus  I feel as if it would be wrong to say i disliked about the Iliad  though one of the only problems I had was the section in the beginning where Homer decides it s a good idea to list every captain including where the re from  who thei fathers are  and the number ships they commanded of he entire Achain arm  The list literall went on for seven and a half pages  and Homer even states that he couldn t name everyone  lmlHm  fy Hd dhth  ktr mn ry   ltrjm  knt  qrb ly lsw mnh ly kwnh  l b s bh  m  l lm  n msh trjm  l stdh dryny khshb  lly qryth   dy trjm  tny  Hsyt  nh fy b D l Hyn qT t l

mythology and studied Classics in university and Homer is definitely one of my favorites  In May I took on the challenge to read Homer s Iliad  I realized that it must be nearly 20 years since I read it in university  so decided it would be fun to read it again  this time without the pressure of essays and exams  I don t feel that a traditional book review is something I could write about this epic novel  so I will write about some of my favourite things and impressions First off  I had to pick a translation   there are so many to choose from  After looking through about 15 boxes of books that I have in storage to find my old Lattimore translation  I decided to go to our local used bookstore and buy the Robert Fagles translation  I was skeptical at first because I had loved the Lattimore translation  but I quickly found that the Fagles translation was amazing too   it is a poetry translation  but is also very readable and has a great feel to it  I would highly recommend this one to anyone wanting to read The Iliad  especially if they are looking for a modern poetry translation  It won the Academy of American Poets 1991 Landon Translation Award and I can see why And then there is the story itself  it takes place over a few days near the end of the Trojan War  and is about Achilles  rage at Agamemnon for his slight to his honour  The first lines tell it all  Rage   Goddess  sing the rage of Peleus  son Achilles  murderous  doomed  that cost the Achaeans countless losses  hurling down to the House of Death so many sturdy souls  great fighters  souls  but made their bodies carrion  feasts for the dogs and birds  and the will of Zeus was moving toward its end  Begin  Muse  when the two first broke and clashed  Agamemnon lord of men and brilliant Achilles I found The Iliad interesting and exiting to read  though it did take a lot of concentration  This is a story that was originally intended to be recited aloud  so reading it uses a different part of the brain  I think   or  at least for me   There are certainly different devises used than in modern writing  such as repetitive epithets  For the most part  I found if I took my time and was not distracted  too much   I could read through it fairly easily  But  the exception to this is Book 2  the catalog of ships  Here Homer lists all of the ships and heroes who have come to Troy from around Greece  This is very long and tedious to read  but if you can make it through that  the rest of the books should seem easy The other thing that was a bit hard with The Iliad is the lists of people fighting and how they died  This is a story that takes place in a war and there are lots of battle scenes with grizzly deaths One of the really fun aspects of the book is the gods meddling in human affairs  Some of this was quite funny and a welcome relief to the battle scenes  Then there is the human element of The Iliad  the stories that make the book what it is  such as Andromache worried about her husband coming home from battle  the friendship of Achilles and Patroclus  Menalaus fighting to get his wife  Helen  back from Paris  Achilles  rage at Agamemnon for being slighted  and Priam doing whatever it takes to get his dead son s body back for burial  It is always amazing to me that Priam  after watching his son s body get defiled for days by Achilles  the man who killed him in battle  can go to him as a suppliant  and even feast with him  It is absolutely heart wrenching  This is only one of the incredibly touching and human scenes in The Iliad  The old mythical Illiad is very much alive and kicking  Let us firstly define the myth as phenomenon  A myth is written or told when someone suddently discovers that the old world he or she lived in is definitely gone and that a new  world is    here  That kind of discovery normally seems to be a terrifying experience  an experience coloured by terror  by fear and it arrives in pain If you haven t read the Homer s secret Odyssey  please  it s waiting for you since Sept 2011 Now  poetry is about love and death  as we are told by Robert Graves in The White Goddess  and don t see any reason to questions his and others  similar views  It works for me I would like to point out a detail in the Illiad  when Ulysses or Odeis or Ulixes refuses to go to war  he preteends to be mentally ill  ploughing a field and  fertilising  with salt  To prove that he is not  Palamedes puts his newborn son before Ulisses  equipage  One of the two animals used is much smaller than the other  perhaps a camel and a donkey  a combination in fact used on Ithaca a few decades ago  The are photos on the internet  Why would he do this Ulysses stops the animals and the baby is saved  Palamedes can therefore prove that Ulysses was preteding No    no   He was not  He did stop his team because he wasn t allowed to circumvent the obstacle  his son on the ground  And why not  Well  his plough was supposed to describe a labyrint  kind of holy symbol describing his path from the very birth to his death    he was following the animals and the plough to the middle of the labyrint where his wife  Penelope  a title meaning the weiled  a princess priestress awaited him  to kill him with a labrys  Did he die  Was he killed  yes  After the incident with Palamedes Ulysses comes back    as a mentally sound person  then    who died  Ulysses the Fool died or was killed  or suffered a mock death as sacred kings did at the end of the Bronze Age  And his son  Telemachos  Ulysses didn t have a son  Telemachos was his name when he wasn t reigning  in most cases sacred kings had someone to replace them when they were  dead  for half a year  Nichts fur Schlappschwanze und Weicheier Ich mochte in meiner Rezension zunachst die Ubersetzer fur sich selbst sprechen lassen  das sagt mehr als tausend Worte Zweiter Gesang  Zeile 142ff Voss ubersetzt Jener sprach s  und allen das Herz im Busen bewegt  er Ringsumher in der Menge  die nicht anhorten den Ratschluss Rege nun ward die Versammlung  wie schwellende Wogen des MeeresAuf der ikarischen Flut  wann hoch sie der Ost  und der SudwindAufsturmt  schnell dem Gewolke des Donnerers Zeus sich entsturzend Wie wenn brausend der West unermessliche Saaten erreget Zuckend mit Ungestum  und die wallenden Ahren hinabbeugt Schrott schreibt zutiefst aus der seele hatte er seinem heer damit gesprochen  allen  die beim altestenrat zuvor nicht dabei gewesen waren aufgewuhlt war die versammlung wie die dunung vor ikariawenn der sudost und der ost an der insel aufeinanderstossenund beide als fallwind die wellenkamme zu gischt zerreissen oder wie wenn der westwind eisig in ein gerstenfeld fahrtund die hellen ahren unter seinen harten boen knicken Nun kann man dazu stehen wie man will  wenn Schrott statt  Scham  schon mal  Eier  schreibt  statt  Weichlinge  durchaus  Schlappschwanze  und statt  zanken  den Begriff  rumzicken  verwendet   mir gefallts  Als ich an diese Ubersetzung der Ilias heranging  war ich zogerlich und dachte  dass jetzt ein harter Brocken Geistesarbeit erforderlich wird  Aber nein  In Schrotts Ubersetzung liest sich die Ilias wie ein modernes Buch  die verquaste Sperrigkeit der alten Ubersetzungen wird durch frische Satzstellung ersetzt  Musste man bei Voss jeden Vers funfmal lesen  um sein Deutsch zu verstehen  liest man Schrotts Ilias flussig  Ein weiterer Vorteil dabei ist  dass das Pathos und die Heldentumelei realistischer wird  die Protagonisten werden menschlicher und wirken nicht so vollig entruckt  die ganze Geschichte wirkt sehr viel weniger verkopft  Der Vergleich zwischen Voss und Schrott ist vielleicht etwas unfair  da 200 Jahre dazwischen liegen  allerdings ist die Voss Ubersetzung auch heute noch immer mit die verbreitetste Alle Leser  die schon immer die Ilias lesen wollten  aber sich verstandlicherweise nicht rantrauten  konnen hier unbesehen zuschlagen  und sich dieses Werk in der begeisternden Ubersetzung von Schrott reinziehen  Wer die Nase rumpft ob der Hemdsarmeligkeit und sich Homer nur in Hexametern vorstellen kann und glaubt  Homers Epos verlore etwas in dieser Ubersetzung  muss sie schon aus rein akademischem Interesse lesen Die Prasentation ist ahnlich gut gelungen wie die Ubersetzung   ein grossformatiges Hardcoverbuch  sehr schones Papier und Druckbild  Lesebandchen und Schutzumschlag machen den Band zu einem echten Hingucker  Ein ausfuhrliches Vorwort zur Rezeptions  und Entstehungsgeschichte  eine knappe Zusammenfassung der Kypria und der Aithiopis  also der Vor  und Nachgeschichte der Ilias  sowie ausfuhrliche Annotationen komplettieren das Werk   I read the Fagels translation quite a while ago  when it first came out  so its not fresh in my mind  But I have to say that it was a revelation how great it was  Do not bother even thinking about another translation  Honestly  I don t know why there isn t some sort of translation award so people can easily distinguish a great book from a rotten one  because not all Homers are the same Homer unless you are reading Greek  I had the same issue wondering why anyone thought Victor Hugo was worth reading until I found a translation that was actually decent  Another thing about the greek mythos  if you want to add a layer of understanding  There is an amazing book called The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral MInd by Julian Jaynes  and it convincingly argues that the interaction of Gods was the way Greeks dealt with emerging awareness of self and consciousness  A fair critique of this work is that most humans are puppets of the Gods  but if you accept the premise that what Homer describes is actually the schizophrenia of developing consciousness  where multiple conflicting voices and urges are talking inside one s own head  the whole tale is entirely different  It s hard even to rate a work of art as embedded into western civilization as the Iliad  While it s the foundation of almost all of western literature to follow  I also found it to be a door into an alien world  The touchstones of classical Greek culture  the Acropolis  Sophocles  Athenian democracy  are hundreds of years in the future  This is a pre literate  pre monetary society  lit by fire and accompanied by the rolling breakers of the Aegean  I read the Robert Fagles verse translation  It s as sturdy and evocative as the narrative requires  while hewing close to Homer s dactylic hexameter  In my opinion  the Iliad is Hector s poem  Despite the focus on Achilles and his outsized passions  Hector is the fully formed human which gives the poem its tragic dimension  Achilles is all aggression  His home is far away  and although he loses Patroclus  both were fellow combatants  Hector  on the other hand  has to balance the life of the warrior with that of the husband and father  When he dons armor before returning to battle  his infant son screams in terror  Hector faces the incompatibility of life as the bloodthirsty commander and the nurturing father  Perhaps this also foreshadows Hector s death  incurring Achilles  savagery by wearing the armor he stripped off Patroclus  corpse  The Iliad ends with Hector s burial  a fitting conclusion given that Troy s fall will come soon after  He was a man that could neither fully be the bloodthirsty warrior bent on glory  nor the father who shirks the front lines to care for his family  The final meter of the poem is a perfect  poignant epitaph to the man required to be too many things to fully be one  And so the Trojans buried Hector breaker of horses The Iliad is never jingoistic  It s not celebrating the martial virtues of either the Achaeans or the Trojans  Homer often juxtaposes the carnage of battle with scenes of idyllic life  like when Patroclus brutally spearing a charioteer is likened to a fisherman hauling in his catch  The elaborate description of Achilles  shield as it is crafted by Hephaestus crystallizes this dichotomy  The shield is an image of a city at peace versus a city at war  both scenes surrounded by the Ocean River  Homer isn t interested in championing Achaeans over Trojans or vice versa  any more than he is concerned with championing war over peace  It s almost as if he is celebrating the inscrutability of war  how a peaceful society can segue into a warlike one  and he is turning over and examining the prices and costs of both  The Iliad is a sad and thoughtful poem hidden in a savage and warlike narrative  It seems ridiculous to even rate this book  Whether I  enjoyed  it or not isn t as relevant as the fact that it is a basis for so much of Western Literature  I mean I don t like reading about war  but it doesn t go away just because we don t look at it and this shows the grit  the hate  the honor  the fear  giving yourself up to fate  raging against the gods for their arbitrariness  forgiving  loving  and treating women like objects   so many themes in there  I am not sure about the Fagles translation  It is very active and the language seems quite modern  even informal at times  I am angry with those gods  I read over the blood and gore bits quite quickly  In a nod to the orality of the story  I listened to Derek Jacobi reading it  but this version only covered about 60  of it  so I read the rest of it to myself  I think listening and reading together helped me like it more This is what I really loved 1  It doesn t tell the whole story of the war   not the point2  The description of the shield Hephaestus made for Achilles which is like its own world is so beautiful and I wonder if Keats was aware of it or if Fagles was thinking about Keats when he wrote it the way he did 3  In WWI  many thought that God would decide who won even though religious people prayed to the same God and it s a tragically wrong idea  Both the Achaeans and the Trojans believed in the same gods and the gods took sides  It is just an incredibly sad connection to make  but something to think about 4  The Gods are right out there saying every thought   they are characters   not so with the God of Abraham   read Auerbach s Mimesis on this   a really fascinating take on the traditions of Western Literature5  They follow rules in their war partly based on hospitality6  Finally  the best scene in the book is in book 24   lines 559 646   it might be the most poignant moment that I have read in literature  I would highly recommend listening to it  but it is better if you can read along  I read this as part of Hunter s history studies this year  I am not sure what to rate it  In parts it is 5 stars  amazing description  anguish  personal tragedy  passion  In other sections there are endless list of people  deaths  and historical background  You also need to appreciate Greek Mythology  The scenes between the gods are some of the most humorous in the book and they read like a modern day soap opera  At the same time they are some of the most depressing sections when you realize the Greeks really did feel that their lives hung in the balance of jealous  manipulating all powerful beings who are willing to let cities fall over petty disputes Personally  the more I read about different cultures the easier it is to understand what is  human  and what is cultural  I appreciate the Iliad for helping me develop this perspective  I am going to give this book 5 stars for the historical nature of the book but also because I found the passages to be filled with deep  raw emotion and some of the most vivid descriptions I have read  The Iliad is one of the greatest treasures of Western Civilization and not just because a teacher told you it was  On the surface  it offers raw emotions  visceral action sequences and colorful characters you admire and hate  often at the same time  But it is much  much deeper than that  The scene where Hector bids his young wife good bye and holds up his infant son to the gods  praying that the boy will one day be a better man than ever he himself was  has never been equaled as a statement of what it means to be a man  husband or father  The debates about honor and duty are still the same we face every day  The humanity  insight and profound philosophy are remarkable especially for a work now 3 000 years old The problem  How do you convey all that power  How do you do so in a way that captures the feel of original Iliad translations have started to come fast and furious  as every ten years or so someone tries to tackle the monumental task of bringing the poem to modern readers  The process isn t helped by the fact that the text was already 300 years old to the classical Greeks like Aristotle  Sophocles and Euripides making it as vaguely old fashioned as Shakespeare is to us  Should it sound antiquated to us  too  If you really want a line by line translation  one that has some kind of meter that approaches the Greek original  the obvious choice is Lattimore s classic translation  It has the side benefit now of being somewhat dated in its English usage too  That said  for just a good ol  read of the Iliad  Lattimore isn t even my third choice  For all its accuracy  I ve always felt I was reading a textbook  written by a classics scholar rather than an honest to goodness writer Lombardo  on the other hand  is my preferred translation for sitting back and reading what is still a rip roaring adventure  with enough deep thoughts to give it extra weight   Lombardo confesses there really is no way to adequately convey the  musicality  of the original  and goes on to re cast it in freer poetry  based on natural speech  He s built up his translation thru multiple performances of the poems  with drum accompaniment  in public places  and his Iliad is honed to a razor sharp edge  The musty old poem students rolled their eyes at becomes a terrifying  beautiful beast that grabs you by the throat and doesn t let go  It is so immediate  trilling and relevant  Lombardo s translation is an Iliad you will feel  not just respect Pick up the Lombardo translation and you will understand immediately why this work is still called the cornerstone of Western culture  One of the great classics of western literature  Read this for the first time over 40 years ago  Worth a second reading  Not  however  for the faint of heart  Much battle description is graphic  Graphic battle description  however  is not the point of the poem  and shouldn t deter a reading  It clearly emphasizes the relationship Hellenistic culture had with the deities  a culture where the gods not only mingled and interacted with mortals but took active roles in directing a particular mortal s fate  It seems as if mere mortals are but chess pieces in the hands of the gods who vie with each other in spinning out the thread of fate  It is also a book about Greek  shame  culture where pride and making a name for one s self becomes more important than the overall good and aims of society  This theme is announced at the very beginning of the poem in the encounter between Agamemnon and Achilles where neither is able to sacrifice  face  for the higher needs and purposes of the Achaean army  This conflict nearly results in disaster as the fortunes of the Trojan and Achaean armys ebb and flow across the plains of Troy So why should we waste time reading this stuff today  Isn t this a book about ourselves  Don t we see this same theme played out day by day in our own culture  whether it be on Main St   USA  or in the halls of Congress  Individual pride and self interest still get in the way the higher interest  This poem is set just before the fall of Troy about 1184 BCE  Nothing has changed  Homer would have been appalled to find his name on a required reading list for high school students The Iliad is pure entertainment  It s an action hero story  powerful and spellbinding as anything you will find in the theater today I had the good fortune to read this book when I was 15 years old  a runaway American child living in a cave nestled on the cliff of an island in the Aegean sea  The island is called Ios  and one can see both Athens and Troy from the sandstone ridge It was as if Homer were telling me the story himself  The first words are  wrath  fury  rage  Achilles   The Greeks are failing in battle  Agamemnon has made a stupid threat  Patroclus is slain  Athena has set herself against Apollo  and Achilles is venting his rage at being in the middle of a bad war The story opens as a riot  and is driven forward by the impulse of anger and fear  Homer s characters are flawed  even Zeus is called into question  Achilles is sullen  moody  hesitant  and impetuous  What arises from the dust of chaos is the concept of glory  and a familiar crest of horsehair worn by a hero for the ages  Homer does well in the making of Achilles  He must have known that it would leave an indelible mark on the mind of a 15 year old boy For me  the Iliad has always been just as vivid as the day I read it  Much has happened in Homer scholarship since this translation was first written  so first  a little background  if you re not interested in this  skip to the second paragraph for the core of my review   as a person with intermediate experience reading Ancient Greek  I ve come to doubt whether a really faithful English translation of Homer is possible  In the 20th century alone many different translations were hailed as flawless renderings of Homer s muscular Greek  and yet  having reviewed them  I found each successive translation to be as radically different from the last  as from those which came before  In light of this  I ve gravitated more towards the translations that would be more aptly described as adaptations  with the translating poet subjecting the text to the will of the language  rather than vice versa  I ve found this to be a much more edifying read and  from what I ve read of Homer in Greek  I ve also found it to be more faithful  in a roundabout way  For though  taking this approach  the poet has to forget about rendering the sound of the language   a very pretty poem  Mr  Pope  but you mustn t call it Homer    it s important to remember that l Iliade ou le poeme de la force  and  to the experience of the text  I think that above all  the force of language must match the force of the action  My impression is that  in attempting to be faithful  modern translations tend to end up using pretty stilted language  usually without a real meter By the standard of linguistic force  two translations stand alone  Pope s and Chapman s  Pope s translation is edifying  but  even in spite of everything I ve said above  I found the heroic couplets to be too radical a departure from the Greek  Chapman  in a risky but ultimately brilliant move  employs couplets but lengthens the line to a heptameter  which can be a bit difficult at first  but if you have any experience reading English poetry  your ear will quickly adapt  I will also report something sort of counter intuitive  even with the long line  I remembered the text of this translation much  much better than I did some of the more modern translations  especially Fitzgerald  which did not stick in my mind at all  Only don t read the line too slowly  that s where the difficulties mount  Read at a trot  and comprehension will fall into place I do feel a certain self consciousness about this interview  as it could appear to tow a certain critical line  But for me to rate this lower would be insincere  Remember that Chapman is thought to have been the  rival poet  in Shakespeare s sonnets  and was a contemporary with the latter  If you enjoy the language in Shakespeare  and of the period in general  I think you ll probably enjoy Chapman s Homer I would not recommend this translation for those reading Homer for the first time  for them  I would recommend Fagles  whose translation is also a great achievement   This is a challenging translation  and having some background knowledge of the work is almost required for understanding  Another option is using Fagles as a reference  which I did a few times  I will also say that I have a very classical taste  so I m biased in favor of  The Canon   but I understand that many other tastes exist  If your taste tends to be non canonical  and you have aesthetic objections to the canon  I seriously doubt that you ll enjoy this translation  And  again  if you re looking for something that s  faithful  to Homer  don t read this  Chapman takes enormous liberties  not only with the language  but even with the poem itself  inserting whole passages that simply do not exist in Greek  which is the first reason why it s a good idea to have Fagles next to you while you read   I really like them  but you might not  or might object to this kind of thing on principle One last thing  as far as I can tell  there s currently only one edition of this translation on the market  mostly as used books   and the binding proved to be less than great  or maybe just worn  since my copy is used  I ended up reinforcing the inside seam with a piece of duct tape  right on the first printed page in the edition  the publisher page  which reads  Bollingen Series XLI   You may want to do this preemptively   To everyone complaining that Homer starts the story in the middle and leaves out the abduction of Helen and the Trojan Horse  you really need to do some research  The Iliad and The Odyssey are part of a cycle of stories of the Trojan War  There were several others  but they were lost over time  These two stories are just the only two left from a long oral tradition  So no  The Iliad is not the first epic of Western literature  it is just the oldest that we still have besides Gilgamesh The repeated passages are like the chorus in modern music  and it gave the orator time to think about the next passage A lot of people are upset about translation issues and not Iliad issues  Instead of dismissing it because of the translation you read  pick up a different one and try it out  The one you were assigned in high school sucks  It s the kiddie version  Lattimore is the best  in my opinion   because it sticks close to the original Greek  He wrote it in poetry  you know  the way it is supposed to be  It is fast paced and entertaining  The best way to read it is translate the original yourself  which I have been blessed with being able to do  If you can t do that  try a couple out and see what you like best It is gory  Welcome to war with spears  swords  and stones  If that s not your thing  don t read a book about war  Personally  I love reading about this kind of war  because it is much more interesting than reading   He shot him  Then  he shot that guy  This is a hard read  If you don t want to be challenged  don t read this poem  Yes  it will take you a long time  I have read it several times in more than one translation  and my rereading this time took me about 2 weeks  It is rough  but it is rewarding  While reading Homer  look for different patterns you see in books you read today  Trust me  they are there  and it is a wonderful thing to see the beginning of our literary traditions   The Iliad  Or  sex  violence  and gorgeous similes  Overall  I enjoyed the Iliad more than the Odyssey  It s pure adrenaline  the language propels you through 600 some odd pages of graphic violence  bickering gods  and heroic exploits with grace and even  at times  beauty  Robert Fagles  translation is highly readable  although perhaps too modern at times  and he balances almost perfectly the brutalities of war with the hypnotic quality of Homer s dactylic hexameters  There are passages that gave me chills  and were my copy less pretty  you can bet I d have underlined like crazy The battles are undeniably cool  and there are heroes on both sides of the war to root for  In some ways  it appeals to the same part of my brain that movies like Gladiator do  Yet  amidst the carnage are tucked incredibly human moments of pathos  It is not only exciting  but moving as well  It s these moments of humanity that set the Iliad apart and make it truly magnificent  Homer is something like candy to me  He s an absolute joy to read and I do so unfortunately quickly  I reached the end and wanted more    I suppose I ll have to re read the Odyssey  If you ve somehow missed this one  pick it up  It s an exhilarating  compelling  and majestic portrayal of a mythic war in all it s glories and agonies  It s won a spot of my favorites list  for sure   So many revelations brought about by the considerable effort I made to complete The Iliad  Apparently  Richmond Lattimore s translation is famous  and certainly his introduction to the work is invaluable  Here  we discover that the story of the Illiad is only a small piece of the greater Fall Of Troy  It was news to me that the poem only covers a 2 week period on the tenth year of a siege against Troy What stands out for me in this work  That Homer s style includes a variety of repetitious methods  ie  if a thing is said well once  it should be said the same way again if the occasion calls for it  Furthermore  that Homer had to navigate the treacherous story structure pitfalls surrounding the Achilleus Dilemma  namely that the Greeks are reliant upon one man only   Achilleus  however  the army is replete with Heroes  Diomedes  Odysseus  Menalaos  etc   and if heroes they truly are  then how shall they be so entirely reliant upon the solitary actions of Achilleus alone Brilliant  Lastly   read as much of it aloud as possible  It rolls better off the tongue than in the head  in the oral manner it was passed down from approximatey 1300 B C   or so estimated by Lattimore  The first classic book I read in my Kindle  I started with the Iliad because at that time I loved classics  The book had like details of the plot of each section in a nutshell which I thought was helpful since I got absorbed by the prose and forgot the plot Not really spoilers  but don t expect the Trojan horse to be mentioned here  I did expect but sadly it never came  This book takes place during the final moments of the Trojan War  It revolves around the trials of some of the characters such as Agamenon  Achilles  Odysseus  and Hector  A lot of death revolves around this book  and the book carries a pretty anti war message in it Some of the chapters include the Greek gods arguing on how to deal with the events of the war  The theme of whether supernatural forces or man have greater power of the world is a theme that also extends to the Odyssey  I don t remember too much  but there are a lot of battles  Also  the war does not end with the book  After all  there is no Trojan horse I thought this story was good  It was my first experience with classics and would allow me to experience the semi sequel the Odyssey  Alasdair MacIntyre  in After Virtue  compares the ethical life of the characters in the Iliad to a game of chess  the rules are fixed  and there is a shared sense of what a positive outcome is  One important disanalogy  he says  between chess and the ethical life of the Greeks and Trojans  is that chess players can let other concerns interfere with the pursuit of checkmate  if  for example  you don t checkmate you opponent because your goal is teaching him how to play  MacIntyre says that unlike a chess player  the characters in the Iliad cannot step outside their shared system of values  see After Virtue  pp  125 6   But Achilles  sitting in his ship  arguing against the embassy sent to try to convince him to rejoin battle against the Trojans  is able to step outside the standard system of heroic values and ask what it all means   What lasting thanks in the long run for warring with our enemies  on and on  no end One and the same lot for the man who hangs backand the man who battles hard  The same honor waitsfor the coward and the brave  The both go down to Death   9 383 387 Is Achilles the first philosopher in western literature   Credit to Jay for suggesting the idea    The first time I read this book  it was the Fagles translation  I picked it up because we had just read  Jean Giraudoux s  La guerre de Troie n aura pas lieu  The Trojan War Will Not Take Place  for 12th grade French  and I naively thought that the  Iliad was about the Trojan War  It wasn t  and it left me kind of ehh The second time I read this book  it was just a few months later for the first quarter of my Human Being and Citizen course at the University of Chicago  It was the Lattimore translation  and it immediately struck me as the most important work of literature ever written  Maybe that s just because Professor  Herman Sinaiko is just that awesome Then a few years later  I read two books  Books 1 and 9  the ninth book being when Odysseus  committee comes to ask Achilles to fight again  and his response   of the  Iliad in my second year Greek course  and I thought it was the most brilliant work of literature ever written I would give this book more stars if I could   This book is like a certain person in my chemistry courses  who had to get A  s in order for the rest of the class to get Bs  if I were to set my standards at five stars for this book  all my other favorite books would have to get two or three   Before reading this for my humanities class  I never appreciated the Iliad  It seemed dull and confusing and nothing happens  and I liked the Odyssey better  Buuut  now I see that I had some wrong preconceptions about the Iliad  It is actually not about the Trojan war so much as it is about Achilles  My seminar professor describes it as an ode to Achilles  death  I could go on and on     I m having so much fun finding new motifs and parallels with my HUMA class    I still like the Odyssey better  but the Iliad is certainly a wonderful book I keep rewriting this review  sorry about that  But I just have to say that I never realized just how depressing this poem is  I attended a lecture on the Iliad the other day  and when he discussed the scene in which Achilles picks up his immortal armor and finally embraces his mortality I got very depressed  The whole thing with Hector and Andromache is horribly depressing as well  In my notes I wrote   This lecture is so depressing  Ahh  I want to go home and cry   Haha  I m antsy about reading poetry in translation because so much of a work s content is contained in the language itself   not the explicit meaning of the words  but the sound and rhythm of the language  Much of that is bound to be lost in translation What to do  I can t read Greek  modern or ancient  and I m not going to learn it  So I may as well find a translation of Home s Iliad   Odyssey I like and stop worrying about what I m missing in the original  Though I ve always found Homer s story compelling  I ve never read a translation of The Iliad that made the story real  that made it seem like something other than an academic and obligatory exercise  This is the first modern translation of The Iliad I ve read that has really captivated me  that keeps me turning pages out of desire rather than obligation  The language is natural  but not talky or too informal  Fagles keeps up the narrative drive in language that is elevated to match the epic subject without seeming stilted or formalistic The mythic characters   Achilles  Agamemnon  Hector  Odysseus   are alive and real  Maddening  inspiring  funny  capricious  cruel and tragic If you ve read The Iliad in translation  but never felt like you were reading a vital  living story  I highly recommend this version  It may provide what you ve been missing  First off  I first read the complete Iliad in Fagles  translation  It is  let me use the cliche  vibrant  If you ve found the Iliad boring in the past  you might try it  Anyway   The Iliad is  in short  brilliant  read it  Just keep an open eye  the is no mere adventure or fantasy story  though arguably it s excellent on that level too   and if you go looking for that  you re likely to miss all the reasons people like it  It is  no doubt  ostensibly a story about war  or at least  one man s part in a war   but as an epic it doesn t fail to address many other themes  In fact it seems on the whole concerned with the general misery of human existence  describing as it does a war fought by persons who would much rather be doing something else  goaded on and manipulated by capricious gods  who are themselves subject ruthlessly and painfully to the force of fate  Modern readers may find the intervention of the gods  and probably fate too  to be odd  but most will probably find the description of war and human conduct in all spheres to be worthy of consideration Besides its thematic and anthropological depth  and besides the large body of mythology for those into that sort of thing  the Iliad has two other important things to offer  poetry and drama  I can t say anything about the poetry of the original Greek  since my Greek is for now nearly non existent  but one can t doubt that The Iliad has given many translators a good scaffold on which to build their own solid poetry  Even more significant though  The Iliad manages a dramatic quality that you might expect from a Shakespeare tragedy  It s full of hyperbolic action and dramatic monologues  and saving some of its best lines for them too   it revels in situational irony and pathos To demonstrate several of these points I leave you unannotated an excerpt from one of my favorite speeches in the Iliad  again in Fagles  translation  slight spoiler alert  as it were    Come  Friend  you too must die  Why moan about it so Even Patroclus died  a far  far better man than you And look  you see how handsome and powerful I am The son of a great man  the mother who gave me life  A deathless goddess  But even for me  I tell you Death and the strong force of fate are waiting     I can t really put into words how much I like this book and why  I have tried and failed many times already  I am going to c p a bit I wrote elsewhere just so I HAVE IT HERE for the record  maybe I will find better words later I think the way you react to this book has a lot to do with what you think the book is about    war  glory  heroism  for me it was all these things  but more than these a story of love and grief  a fatalistic story about the impotence of humankind  and yet it is also a story that is strangely hopeful    one that celebrates the human condition at its heart  the iliad is really a story about human tragedy  told about a man who disdains his own humanity  who through sheer force of will escalates himself to the semi divine  and who is brought low by the greatest personal tragedy he could possibly endure    all so he can learn to recognize in himself  mere humanity   not mortality  not grace  not humility or mercy or kindness  just humanity  that pathetic and noble condition he shares in common with everyone who has ever lived and who ever will live  the sheer scale of that story  of the emotional power in that  is just overwhelming to me  it overwhelms me every time I think about it  I don t think I have ever read a story with this kind of emotional power behind it  if you have  please tell me so I can go and have another semi religious experience  I would love that this is just  it is just the best book ever  please give it a try  I hope you get out of it what I did  because I got something really marvelous out of it  Review December 2006A note on the difference between ancient Greece and UsThis book is one of the greatest masterpieces of Greek Civilization   and yet to become the Greece we today know  i e   the Greece that we both remember and revere  the single minded values of Heroism and Honor that resound throughout these pages had to be diluted  if not entirely set aside  for the  cosmopolitan  values that eventually lead to us  If you were today to randomly stop people in the street and ask them  who was the greatest Greek   you could expect to hear the name of a philosopher  poet  tragedian or perhaps a  probably Athenian  politician  But if we were to ask that question of the Greeks of the Classical age or even the later periods  Alexandrian  Roman  they would almost certainly answer Achilles  Achilles  But it is difficult to imagine him even living in a city without eventually destroying it    This dividing line between the Archaic Greece of Homer and the Classical Greece we idolize is personified by the heroes Achilles and Odysseus  Achilles  and his rage  represent the old fashioned way of doing things  while wily Odysseus represents the cosmopolitanism of later Greece   the Greece we know  remember and revere  Look at Book 9   The Embassy to Achilles   for a dramatic representation of this transition and see how skillfully Homer works his magic  The rage of Achilles is still unimaginably self absorbed  it experiences nothing but itself  His dishonor by the leader of the Greek alliance  Agamemnon  who had taken  among other things  Achilles  war prize    white armed  Briseis   still boils in his heart  As a result Achilles  and his men  have withdrawn from the battle  When the embassy arrives  consisting of Odysseus  Phoenix and Ajax  it finds Achilles worse than indifferent to the suffering of his allies  Odysseus speaks  giving what seems to be an exact re presentation of Agamemnon s  priceless ransom  to appease Achilles rage  But wily  or if you prefer  diplomatic  Odysseus leaves out the concluding remarks of Agamemnon   Let him submit to me  Only the god of death is so relentless  Death submits to no one  so mortals hate him most of all the gods  Let him bow down to me  I am the greater King  I am the elder born  I claim   the greater man   Odysseus shrewdly leaves these last remarks out   but Achilles is not deceived   I hate that man like the very Gates of Death who says one thing but hides another in his heart   This is said not only of Agamemnon but also to the face of our dear Odysseus   the man who  far more than any other hero who fought at Troy  personified the ability to say one thing but mean another  Literary theory has often  more often in the past than today  been hesitant to place Achilles and Odysseus in opposite corners   but let s not be so delicate  Nor should one assume that these remarks of Achilles are meant for the entire embassy  After each subsequent speaker  each one less eloquent than the preceding  Achilles relents a little from the initial total refusal he threw in Odysseus  face  The next to speak  Phoenix  is Achilles teacher   failed teacher apparently  he intended  after all  to teach Achilles both what to say and what to do  But the Achilles that stands before the embassy is no man of words  Phoenix recounts his life story to Achilles  which is also one of betrayal and rage   but one in which Phoenix does  at least  step back from the brink  He does not murder his father who had so dishonored his mother  Thus there are things more important than honor  or so Phoenix teaches  But Achilles will have none of it  but still   Achilles does hesitate  he says after this speech that if Phoenix stays with him tonight then tomorrow they will decide whether to leave or stay  Note that staying must here eventually mean fighting   if only to defend his own ships  But apparently Achilles has not drawn that conclusion   yet  Ajax now gives the shortest speech  It is little more than a simple  honest heartfelt farewell with one last plea to relent  Begging does not come easy to this giant among men   Helen  of such  terrible beauty  that it caused the deaths of thousands and eventually causes the ruin of Troy  had much earlier described Ajax as a  wall  or bulwark  unto the Greeks    Indeed  Achilles says of this simple speech that it alone is most akin to his own heart  And so again Achilles relents a bit  he will now fight  but only when the Trojan Hector reaches his own ships  So  the three speeches of Odysseus  Phoenix  Ajax had these three results  Achilles will leave  Achilles will decide tomorrow whether or not to leave  and lastly  Achilles will not leave but he will only fight when the Trojans reach his ships  A very great pity for the Greeks that there was not three like Ajax to send to Achilles  But that is not the end of it  the embassy has an  ally  in Achilles  camp  Patroclus  Now  there are many people today that want to say that Achilles and Patroclus were not only the greatest of friends but that they were also lovers  But this is only an important point for our au courant culture wars   to the Greeks who fought at Troy this would have been either an idiosyncrasy or an irrelevancy  In any case  Patroclus  later during the ensuing battle  but before the Trojans reach Achilles  ships   convinces Achilles to let him go and fight in Achilles  own armor  Hector slays Patroclus   and thus eventually Achilles returns to the fight  He has discovered that there is indeed something outside his own sense of Honor and Rage at Agamemnon  friendship  or if you prefer  love     Though one can understand this as the replacement of one Rage  aimed at Agamemnon  for another rage aimed at Hector  So  eventually Achilles slays Hector but he then refuses to allow the body to be ransomed by Priam   who is Hector s father and King of Troy  This is the same selfish Rage that had earlier caused the great warrior Achilles  the  slayer of men   to sit idly in his tent while battle raged all about him  This selfish rage was cooled by Phoenix and Ajax  during the embassy  Book 9  and finally the death of Patroclus brings him back to the conflict  After slaying Hector Achilles attempts to desecrate the corpse but the gods don t allow it to decay  Now  something completely unexpected happens  King Priam sneaks into the camp to beg Achilles to return his sons corpse  These two great enemies share their even greater anguish and Achilles is moved to forgiveness  It is here that Achilles actually has a change of heart  that is  he doesn t merely replace rage with rage  One anguish has spoken to another  It is here that  godlike  Achilles joins the human race  The only other human being that is  godlike  in the Iliad is Helen  Of course you see the pattern  Helen  by leaving her Spartan husband  Menelaus  for  the Trojan Prince  Paris  causes the Trojan War  Achilles  in his rage against Agamemnon  is prepared to let the Greeks be destroyed by the Trojans  It is only another rage  caused by the death of Patroclus  that forces him to return to battle  Human civilization becomes sustainable because its inhabitants no longer simply follow their impulses   as do gods and animals    Oh  but the beauty we have lost due to civilized moderation  Perhaps you doubt that one can draw such a deep line dividing Achilles from Odysseus    did the Greeks themselves ever think in this manner  Let me conclude by calling on the testimony of the greatest poet of Greece  Pindar is of the ancient race  and his judgments belong to an Archaic Greece that was gradually being transformed into the  Classical Greece  we revere today   I believe that Odysseus story has become greater than his actual suffering because of Homer s sweet verse  for upon his fictions and soaring craft rests great majesty  and his skill deceives with misleading tales  The great majority of men have a blind heart  for if they could have seen the truth  mighty Aias  in anger over his arms  would not have planted in his chest the smooth sword  Except for Achilles  in battle he was the best      Nemean 7   Ajax  or Aias   and not Odysseus  deserved Achilles arms  This is the ancient  that is  the archaic  Greek judgment  but today  we who have been formed by a history that truly begins in Classical Greece all feel differently  We moderns  for the most part  all believe that Odysseus deserved Achilles armaments upon Achilles death  But Homer knows better  Thus Homer weaves into this tale the petit fait that it is Ajax whose speech  in the embassy to Achilles  is said to be closest to Achilles heart  When I was young and first read the Iliad and Pindar it was then that I realized that there had once been a different world    But I think that most moderns would prefer the Odyssey   with some reason  Odysseus  native  wiliness  makes him a much more  modern  man than Achilles could ever be  I am unusual in that it is the Iliad that I have loved since youth  not the Odyssey  The Odyssey  to the archaic  and even the classical  Greeks  must have been an extremely strange book  It really is so  un Greek   The chatty friendship between Odysseus and the Goddess  the centrality of Penelope in the tale  non Greek myths  like the people who thought that an oar was a winnowing fan  i e  they had never seen a ship   and the fact that the struggle in the Odyssey is not for glory but rather to get home  to remain faithful  etc   all add up to a profoundly  ahem   un Greek  work  No wonder Butler detected a woman s hand in it   For those that don t know Samuel Butler once proposed that the Odyssey was written by a woman   The Odyssey is often mentioned in the secondary literature as if it were the defining Homeric book   and who knows  today that may in fact be the case  But I think it more likely that it is the defining book only for post classical readers  This is a work of unsurpassed beauty  nobility  suffering and  for us  strangeness  Do not impose an unwarranted familiarity upon this text  The Greeks  who adored beauty but did not think it was easily found  used to beg the gods to allow them to see three beautiful things in their lives  The Iliad is one of those things    What is not to like about The Iliad  In terms of dramatic and epic intensity  it is a stunning work  particularly in light of its antiquity  Once again  in comparison to other ancient literature  say  Gilgamesh  the richness  humanity  and complexity of Homeric literature is stunning  Passages of brutal violence and interspersed by heartrending glimpses into ancient ties that bind  Take for example Patroclus  killing of Thestor  Homer goes into full extended metaphor mode   And next he went for Thestor the son of Enops   cowering  crouched in his fine polished chariot    crazed with fear  and the reins flew from his grip     Patroclus rising beside him stabbed his right jawbone    ramming the spearhead square between his teeth so hard   he hooked him by that spearhead over the chariot rail    hoisted  dragged the Trojan out as an angler perched   on a jutting rock ledge drags some fish from the sea    some noble catch  with line and glittering bronze hook    So with the spear Patroclus gaffed him off his car    his mouth gaping round the glittering point   and flipped him down facefirst    dead as he fell  his life breath blown away   The specificity of the violence is perhaps what is so unsettling  the spear through the jawbone  the moth gaping around the shaft  Thestor s fear at the approach of Patroclus  But the violence is delivered mater of factly  clinically  even through Homer s metaphor of a fisherman getting a catch  And though there may be a darkly comic sense to this metaphor to us  comparing the killing of a man to fishing  the grim reality of the Homeric metaphor is its rootedness in reality  Fishing was a part of survival  as was warfare and death  By transfiguring Patroclus into an angler  the violence is domesticated  Compare this with a more literally domestic moment as Hector meets his wife and child briefly in between fighting   In the same breath  shining Hector reached down   for his son  but the boy recoiled    cringing against his nurse s full breast    terrified by the flashing bronze  the horsehair crest    the great ridge of the helmet nodding  bristling terror     so it struck his eyes   Here the innocent child has what we would think a more properly modern reaction to the miltarized father  Hector  in his battle gear and horsehair helmet  looks monstrous to his son  And we might be inclined to agree with him  as the barbarity of the war and the violence we re shown throughout make us cringe  but then Hector and Andromache s response is telling of their world  they laugh  They laugh at the silly naivete and innocence of their son that he would be scared of his father in his armor  And then Hector  takes off his helmet  lifts his son in the air  and prays to Zeus that his son will be an even greater warrior than himself  that  one day let them say   He is a better man than his father       when he comes home from battle bearing the bloody gear   of the mortal enemy he has killed in war     a joy to his mother s heart   That this is Hector s hope for his son strikes us as odd  especially in light of the grisly end we know Hector eventually comes to  The scene of a father lifting his son above his head and rejoicing in his family is familiar too us  But his prayer immediately takes us to a different place  Why would a father wish such a life for his son  But this is the reality of their world  a reality that brings us up against the brutality of humanity in much the same way that Patroclus s fishery does  And it is a sign of Homer s great skill that we can still relate to such a tender scene of domesticity and yet be challenged by its lingering violence  This is literature with its finger close to our pulse  close to our blood to the very extent that it is filled with blood  familial and militant  What can I say about the Iliad that hasn t already been said  It is the father of Western civilization  a distillation of the essence of war  a vision of manhood and divinity  a cracking good read  By coincidence  or by God s will    at the same time I also read Hans Urs von Balthasar s commentary on Homer in his  Metaphysics in Antiquity   The book  The Importance of Homer  just came out  and among the reviews was a quote I agree with   The first work of literature  and still the best   The Illiad is my favourite work of Literature  It makes my heart beat a bit faster and makes my eyes water whenever I read E V  Rieu s amazing translation The Illiad is often described as the story of the Trojan war  That is inexact  It s the story of a specific event of that war and centered around a specific character s personal conflict  The Illiad is the story of Achilles s anger You have to keep in mind that this is the oldest literary work of Western culture that we still have  And yet somehow  it s still one of the most modern ones  Achilles  emotions are developed through story telling just as well as any of our modern authors up to date with the advances of psychoanalysis  The unity of time and action were respected long before Aristotle introduced his rules of classic tragedy  And the plot follows a perfect arc starting with the rise of Achilles  anger and finishing only when that anger has fallen  It s just beautiful in a way no other book I ve ever read is  There is something very cool about reading one of the oldest stories ever told written The thinking is that it was originally an oral history passed down through the generations  from approximately 13th century B C   and that it was eventually written down  approximately 762 B C   Long Greek names and a 10 year war  yes  but I stand by my first sentence    cool Here is an intriguing image  http   www insidescience org content       The classic battle for Troy  this book captures the atmosphere perfectly  Unlike most people s perception The Iliad does not feature the wooden horse and the fall of Troy  but sees the reader join the battle in its 10th year of war  The book cleverly takes us into the past but also prophecies the future so that come the end of the book we know of things that are to happen after the last page  Many heroes are depicted in the book but also all the human flaws  I love the way it shows how even the best of heroes show a full range of emotions and characteristics  both good and bad  The story is told with Gods and Goddesses overruling all decisions  and for me these create the most humourous parts  and like real siblings they fight and squabble and try to get the better of each other to help their personal favourites in the war  A great read and a great incite into the ancient Greek  whether you take this for fact or fiction or a as I believe a mix of the two  5 Stars  Lectura finisima que nos transporta a una historia llena de pasiones humanas  donde la muerte y la gloria conviven en el campo de batalla  no estamos hablando de una Aquilada  sino de la narracion de la guerra desarrollada por la conquista de Illion  Sin un apice de ideologia  simplemente una gran historia donde los mas humanos son los dioses con sus desbordadas y desordenadas pasiones  Una epoca diferente donde el hacer humano y su comprension es muy diferente  Lecturas que dejan algo mas que un analisis  un libro para la vida  un libro que educa y apoya  un libro para conservar y compartir con todas generaciones venideras Dificilmente comparable a otra obra por su minuciosidad y sus detalladas historias  incluso de los personajes secundarios y hasta terciarios  Recomiendo la edicion de AKAL  con introduccion de Carlos Garcia Gual para habla hispana  que cabe la pena senalar nos regala una investigacion profunda y seria sobre la obra en cuestion  I can t speak to the translation  as I neither read Greek nor have read a non Lattimore translation  but it seemed very good to my unqualified eye  On the other hand  having just recently read some translations of Aristophanes that I loathed  I think I have a handle on what makes one decent  so    I don t know The story  however  was magnificent  I came in knowing the story  or so I thought  but in retrospect I had no idea what to expect  The story is told through the three perspectives of the Greeks  the Trojans  and the Olympians  and I was very surprised to find that it wasn t the Greeks  neither Odysseus  nor Achilles  nor Agamemnon  or even Ajax  that were the heroes  but it was the Trojan  Hector  The story is really a tragedy  and  if I may say  it is a better told tragedy that anything from Shakespeare  Odd  surprising  and wonderfully done   Okay  maybe the battles and endless lists of Greek names were a little much  but the ending made up for that   Talvez se Afrodite nunca tivesse sido preferida por ParisTalvez se Helena nao fosse seduzidaTalvez se Menelau nao fosse reiTalvez se Peleu nunca tivesse agradado aos deusesTalvez se Patroclo tivesse seguido o conselhoE ainda se Heitor nunca tivesse saido para enfrentar Aquiles de pes levesTalvez nunca tivesse existido a Iliada  o canto que sendo o primeiro escrito no ocidente e aquele que nos caracteriza Aquele que tem nele impresso o fado de toda a nossa cultura  First off  if you are at all religious in the  new monotheistic  sense  I apologize in advance  Now  come to think of it  you most likely would never have got thru half this book before you threw it in the trash and went to prey for Agamemnon and Paris s sins if you were a deeply religious person    The plot turns on the whims of the gods and while people retain their individualization  there is no chance  everything is exactly as planned by the gods    As any normal person prly has already realized  we assign religion as a way to explain the unexplainable  This usually refers to creation and afterlife  But the Iliad gives such a palpable taste of the nature of the jelous  vein  meddlesome  and vengeful gods of old  that I saw how these gods were explaining different unanswerable questions and were set in place for far different misunderstandings  than gods of today  I feel like it really had two plots that sometimes crossed paths  one each for gods and men  If I had a sixth star I d click it The greatest most violent war story ever  A story that is as relevant today as it was back in Ancient Greece  A book of egos so stubborn that a ten year war could be lost If you re a fan of a good action adventure  war story  or fantasy mythos  with violent scenes that have yet to be topped in any work since  then this is the story for you  It is critical that you pick up the Robert Fagles translation   I know the translation might sound like the author is uncomfortable with English  but this register is perfectly suited to Homer s artisanal language The story itself impresses me more and more every time I read it  Remember  this isn t the story of the fall of Troy  it describes primal emotions ambivalently  Consider Achilleus  pride  the worth of a man in this mytho historical context is measured by the esteem of his peers and the quality of his possessions The main characters are well developed with complicated histories and even more complicated futures  for the survivors  Surprisingly lacking is the misogyny the Ancients are infamous for  as seen in the nuanced depiction of Helen and her psychology Also  make sure you have a box of tissues at hand for the encounter between Priam and Achilleus Lattimore s translation approaches the original as much as English can  and for the curious  it is also a line by line translation  Ho riletto il Libro XXIII perche lo racconto ai miei studenti di prima superiore  che studiano la storia greca  per introdurre l atletica leggera Achille e disperato e roso dal senso di colpa per la morte dell amico Patroclo  Dopo le cerimonie funebri organizza  per rendergli onore  i ludi sulla spianata di Troia Si svolgono gare di cavalli con le bighe  di lotta  di corsa e di lanci L eroe consegna i premi ai vincitori ma non solo  aggiusta la classifica o raddoppia la vincita se durante la gara nota che il concorrente abbia dimostrato particolare valore Come dire  una forte coscienza dell individualita e del primato e determinata solo dal confronto con l avversario  il merito passa anche attraverso un processo di valutazione soggettiva che considera le condizioni iniziali di ciascuno ed a ciascuno rende onore  indipendentemente dalla vittoria Si gioca per vincere  motivazione  ma importante e partecipare  processo   A fantastic translation  I was poking through Pope s version  which is just ridiculous  and thought I d try something different  I ve read the Fitzgerald and Fagles versions  but Lombardo s is now my favorite  by far  Visceral  lyrical  compelling    I don t know that I ll ever read another translation  If you need to familiarize yourself with one of humanity s greatest creations  and you do  you can t go wrong here   Una de las obras mas grandiosas que jamas haya leido  Me encanto ese estilo epico  los personajes  las batallas  las descripciones de los objetos y de los personajes  aposiciones de paginas que narran la historia de cada objeto o de cada persona   Mas alla de que Homero tenga la fama de haber sido el primer poeta y el padre de la cultura y la civilizacion helenica  la obra me gusta en si  Disfrute muchisimo su lectura   Attempts the same thing Richmond Lattimore attempted in his translation  a line for line rendering in an approximation of an English hexameter  The difference is that Green s version is readable and moves constantly forward in a way that Lattimore s never does  I think it s brilliant  I would love for someone to do an audiobook   and I hope Green  who I believe is in his 90s  lives long enough to do the Odyssey as well  It surprised me when I found that I liked this work even more than I liked the Odyssey  because I usually very much dislike war stories  But this one was different  This was a war story that wasn t so much about the war  but the characters  While the heroes were all irrational at one point or another  there was still something about them that made them human and likable  The language in this work is also stunning  But that s sort of to be expected with a Homeric ancient greek text  My favorite thing about the work  I must say  were the books devoted to god to god relationships  Homer literally portrays the gods at certain points like young whiny siblings who get angry and complain to their father when they don t get what they want  He also portrays them as gossipy middle schoolers  Truthfully  to me  that s priceless   The first novel produced by humanity  If you are a human being  this should be on your bookshelves  The Fagles translation of The Iliad and The Odyssey are the gold standard  and I had the great fortune of discovering them in college under a man who knew ancient Greek  The difference between this and other translations  to paraphrase one famous writer  is the difference between lightning and a lightning bug  Fascinating for many reasons  A look at how people three thousand years ago saw themselves  A strangely inspiring tale of bravery  despite the characters not being  relatable  in the way modern characters are  you can t help but be inspired by their heroism  And at times a raw  emotional look at the tragic aspects of war  especially toward the end  I can see why it endures as a classic of Western literature   A brilliant translation of a timeless classic  true to the poetic intent of Homer without lapsing into the literary license of Pope  Shockingly  far more fun than I expected  and by far more humane  Less a story of a war than of one man s temper tantrum  and the tragedy it takes to thaw a heart of iron and pride  Men die in the Iliad  their armor ringing about them   but none die nameless  Each goes to the dust chronicled  his origins and titles marked in a way anonymous modern warfare doesn t allow  Men die as men  raging like lions or boars in the parlance of Homer  each one known to the sight of the deathless gods  Perhaps this  then  is the key to the Iliad   the gods may be fickle  cruel  and unforgiving  but they know the men they make their toys of  Perhaps it s this remembrance  and the hope it gives us of being remembered ourselves  that keeps us coming back to it again and again across the ages  A genuinely great book that I will almost certainly read again  Tragic  heroic  petty  humorous  and more A word about the edition I read  the iBooks edition  It is  in a word  an atrocity  It was made from a poor OCR job  what  no electronic form of the text  Penguin  Really   and was either never proofread or was proofread by a novice with a naive trust of OCR software  It was terribly distracting It also seems that Penguin did the job on the cheap  There are end notes    textual commentary by the translator    but Penguin couldn t be bothered to hyperlink these notes to the text  I have seen better work from Project Gutenberg  If a bunch of volunteer labor can do things well  one would think it is not asking too much to expect the lazies at Penguin to do a better job with their own product  Let us hope that they fix this mess and that purchasers of this beta version of the book get a free upgrade      Quite possibly my favorite book of all time  I find it interesting that there s a god in the sky  Zeus and a god down below  Poseidon  Of course in Greek mythology there s a god for everything  The Iliad is also striking in its detail regarding warfare of the time  The tactics and weapons developed during the Bronze Age would remain relatively unchanged for millennia  That men like Achilles and Hector are still remembered and revered today speaks to the men they were   I have ruined my book with highlighters  pencil  and pen marks  It is defaced and well loved  I don t recommend borrowing my copy  I have made my pocket dictionary pay for itself while reading this  I have loved every minute of reading The Iliad  I read it with a Great Books discussion group  and it was the best way to read the Iliad for the 1st time  I am sorry for all the high schoolers that  had  to read it for school and didn t like it  How unfortunate  It s a beautiful poem  The battle scenes could be a little too wordy for my taste  but I genuinely loved reading this book  If you spoke to me at all while I was reading it  my enthusiasm for it was noticeable  I couldn t stop talking about it  Onward to more Great Books   Best version of this great epic story I ve read  Robert Fagles translation   Much easier to read than the famed Alexander Pope version  I won t go into great detail about the story as I think the majority of readers are very familiar with this epic poem  If not from reading it then from the plethora of movies  illustrated comics  and other forms of storytelling  This version very clearly shows what I believe is the major theme in the story which is the rage of Achilles  There is never a dull moment  I was never bored and never desired to get through slow moving passages  I enjoyed the journey of reading every passage with great care  It took me three weeks and I enjoyed every minute of it  This is not for the faint hearted    the battle scenes  of which there are many  are very graphic and worthy of Robert E Howard  Nuff said  If you haven t read it I believe this is the penultimate version   Thanks to Dr  Troyer of MSU Denver for helping me to flesh out the FULL extent of this epic  I feel like I ve been cheated all these years  reading Homer for school   There are SO many themes to be discussed and pondered  not to mention all the bad ass heroes rocking face  Robert Fagels translation is incredible  I burned through this 600 page epic in 3 weeks  and I m STILL internalizing about it    The Fagles translation is  IMHO  the best one there is  His language choice gives a rhythm  and therefore power  to the work  missing from previous translations  even Milton s  Reading this version you can truly picture that this was an oral epic passed down from generation to generation  The allegories  symbols and repeated phrases give a cadence to the prose  Fagles is not only a fantastic Greek scholar  but he understand that this was a sung work  which Homer then committed to writing  As to the story  the torment between taking the easy path or doing what is difficult  but what we know is our destiny is a timeless story  If you aren t a fan of ancient Greece  you might get bogged down in some of the names and practices  like why are the gods participating in disguise   but I really would recommend this book  and particularly the Robert Fagles translation  as a must read for anyone  I love the Iliad  full stop  but this is just a review of this edition 1  I love the cover series that they were going for with this  using extremely emotional pictures from the present to parallel what was going on then  Is the war for Troy really comparable to D Day  Hell no  But is the Iliad totally about a war of attrition and the effect it puts on peoples  relationships  and their questioning of the cosmos  Yes 2  Stanley Lombardo s translation is excellent  Homer s earthy  bloody writing doesn t come across with more formal  respectful translators   especially those trying to write in verse for some awful reason  thank heavens we ve passed the Victorian era    and Lombardo gets that  It s extremely easy to follow for those who are unaccustomed to Greek epic  and at once immediate  and action packed  which is especially important for the long sections of relentless slaughter  This marks my 4th read of the Iliad  Beautiful translation  Some of the dynamic equivalent idioms bother me  personal taste   but overall the translation easily accessible and lyrical without being foppish or condescending  Insightful introduction  I do like the other translations I ve read  but would definitely recommend this one  Especially for people just getting acquainted with Homer  I read the Robert Fitzgerald translation and cannot seem to find it on Goodreads  You don t really review The Iliad  but I wrote these on my blog   On Translation and reading The Iliad by Homer On death  control and reading The Iliad by Homer   the iliad by homer provided me with the satisfaction of knowing that movies really mess up your perspective of books if you see the movie first  i  sadly  watched the movie  troy  before picking up the iliad and i must say that brad pitt definitely skewed my opinion of achilles  this book is more of an epic poem  but if you pay attention to the imagery and the subplot this will be an amazing read for you the iliad begins with the youngest prince of troy  paris  sitting by a tree filled with gold apples and three goddesses of unique talent approaching him for an apple  athena  godess of war  promised that troy would never lose another battle as long as he lived  hera  zeus  wife  promised him all the riches of the world  and aphrodite  goddess of love and beauty  promised him the most beautiful woman in the world  paris makes a decision that will change his life and his land  This is the book that began my love of reading  I was in 7th grade and saw it in a bookstore and convinced my parents to buy it for me  I immediately fell in love with the heros  adventure and interaction between the gods of Olympus and their lawns on the field of Troy  I love this book and have read it more times than I can remember  Perfect book for a young boy seeking adventure   jml m f  trjm  dryn  khshb  llktb hw t

started thinking  Why did anyone ever write anything else   Everything that later came to be written was already The Iliad  To be written by a Greek but Troy is what s mourned  Even knowing how it s going to end up  you find yourself hoping somehow this time it won t  My go to favorite book  It s sad that this book is required reading for teenagers when their hormones are raging and the last thing they want to read about is some dumb old war that happened 3000 years ago  It least it s exposure Who this book should be required reading for is everyone entering the military  yeah  I know a lot of them are teenagers    military academies  elected state and federal offices  Make  em read it before they draw their first paycheck  Is a soldier ever justified in challenging his superior officer  Should he sacrifice his life for someone else s cause  Does a man betray his family by giving his life for his country  Can glory ever compensate for death  How can a catastrophic war ever be allowed to start  and why  if all parties wish it over  can it not be ended  These are all questions worth considerable thought  And that s what this book does makes you think about them  I read this Freshman year at Wildwood Catholic  I loved this  I was into Greek mythology at the time and I loved the stories I recall being behind in my reading  I was so busy  it was evident I wasn t going to be able to get it done  I wrestled and there just wasn t time  So I feigned an injury  I tossed myself down a flight of stairs so I could stay home from school and just read  Well  my folks overreacted and I ended up in the emergency room  Sigh       I did get caught up and earned an A on the test    This is not the edition I read or have  I have The Iliad of Homer  Modern Library College Editions   Paperback  Walter Leaf    Ernest Myers   Introduction By Gilbert Highet Homer   Translated From The Greek By Andrew Lang  Publisher  The Modern Library Random House  Reprint edition  January 1  1950   ASIN  B003X66QI8I have no idea how to add an edition to GR  I listened to The Iliad as translated by Robert Fitzgerald while at the same time reading the Iliad in book form  The benefit of combining the two was avoiding getting hung up on the pronunciation of the names  A magnificent representation of war and the waste and heartache that accompanies war  The Trojans and the Achaeans are locked in battle as the gods shift sides at their emotions dictate  What caused the war  One man stealing another man s woman  What lengthens the war  One man stealing another man s woman  Women are property to be bestowed as reward same as a two side bowl or a half bar of gold  Homer s war is hand to hand combat  The action is personal and gruesome with each wound inflicted graphical described and each death recounted with honor and sorrow  The lives of young men lost and wasted as their women and parent watch from the sidelines   Yeah  it s the Iliad  so a review would be presumptuous  Anyway  numbing repetition and stylization punctuated by startling  lovely moments  And a whole lotta  and then Patroclus thrust his spear through the liver of Glaucon  that mighty breaker of horses whose father owned many vineyards  His blood flowed out in a purple stream and his eyes grew dim   etc  If the quality of a book should be judged on the extent to which it reveals the  truth   The Iliad is certainly one of the greatest works of literature ever produced Homer captures the horror of warfare  and the devestating effects this most brutal of human endeavours has on a country  the ruling elite  families  lovers and the individual  From the graphic descriptions of slaughter  to the extremely moving conversation between a doomed husband and his loving wife  with their infant child held close   to the taunting of enemies  the power of the poem is ever present Even people with a slight dislike of narrative verse will find something here  in the Richmond Lattimore translation  Lattimore tried to capture the meter and rhythm of the Ancient Greek  which gives it a prosey like form  whilst retaining the poetic elements of the original    Wow  Amazing literature  The war between Greeks and Trojans  the same war that pitted gods against one another  The legendary warriors of the story  Odysseus  Agamemnon  Achilles  Hector  etc     come alive in Homer s epic  The description of the war was brutal  I loved the parts with the gods fighting one another  For people that think parts of the dialogue are repetitive  just remember that this was so audiences back in the day could keep track of the plot  For me  I felt bad for both sides  The writing was absolutely beautiful  For me  it ended with closure on both sides  A great classic for years to come  Wow  Finally got around to reading this one  And I was perplexed till I did some more research  Thought the story ended with the fall of Troy and the Trojan Horse  but that is in the Odyssey  Still  did enjoy this tale  Not sure so much about the chariot race at the end  A chariot race while a siege is going on  Well  one way to alleviate the boredom of a siege I guess  Introducing Finn to the greeks and having a blast  Guess which book is next This project derailed around book 16  Finn is mobile and wants to manhandle books and  really  this isn t appropriate subject matter anyway  It was fun while it lasted  Finished on my own  Wow  I m not into the nitpicky translation thing  so I loved the Fagles  Readability  Kinda  like that crazy bud light  But better I hadn t read this in 20 years and I m glad I picked it up  I ve been reading and re reading a lot of  great lit  recently and I m amazed the works still hold up and speak  as it were  to me  There s so much human in this tale of petty gods and asshole men  so much power and truth  And gore  I did not remember the gore so much  Who knows how I read things 20 years ago  but I d like to think I read things better now  mw La verdad es que me ha sorprendido mucho conocer la  historia real   tal y como fue escrita por el autor  Lo que mas me ha gustado del contexto historico ha sido el hecho de haber aprendido mas sobre sus costumbres  En lo referente a lo literario  sin lugar a dudas  encontrar a unos Dioses Mitologicos luchando codo a codo con los humanos en sus guerras me ha hecho pensar en   los Dioses estan creados a imagen y semejanza de los hombres   y no al reves   Parece mentira datar el genero fantastico en s  VIII a  C  Puedes leer la resena entera en el blog de Bukusonline This is such a beautiful poem  and this particular translation captures the energy of war and the drama of men and gods so well  This book is hard to read for any extended period of time the way you read a novel  but then again it wasn t meant to be read at all  so I don t count this difficulty against it  One sees the flash of bronze  one feels the sun and the dust stirred up in the heat of the day  stallions whinnying  and one empathizes with the pains and triumphs of characters despite the immense cultural gap  as the themes presented    of lust  revenge  loyalty  courage  fear  and most of all grief    are such fundamental facets of the human experience  However this a very phallagocentric book and female readers should be prepared for that  Its rolling lines arouse the violent hyperactive boyish passion in me  certainly  This was Samuel Butler s 1898 prose rendition reissued in 1942 for Walter J Black s  Classics Club   I enjoyed his translation of this famous epic poem   The Iliad  begins in medias res  so I recommend reading some background information about the Trojan War  Greek deities  and the heroes before starting  The Epic Similes were a treat   We translated parts of the Iliad in my Ancient Greek class and I was very interested  and encouraged  to read a translation of the whole work  Of course  this is a review of the translation by Robert Fagles and only indirectly of the Iliad itself  I do also have a very literal translation by Wolfgang Schadewaldt  and while that is a great study help  it doesn t make for a very captivating read I think Fagles has managed to make this text sound as poetic as Homer  or whoever wrote it  but that s a different discussion  intended it to be  and even though it s not a word for word translation  he has kept key writing styles present  e g  word for word repetition when say  a message has been told to the messenger and when he in turn presents it to the recipient A highly recommended edition to anyone interested  Very distinguished and lyrical translation by Fagles  but the version I really wanted to showcase here is the Stanley Lombardo translation  titled simply  ILIAD  and cover illustrated with a black and white photo of American troops coming ashore in Normandy in 1944  I was not able to bring this up here  The Lombardo version is bold  vigorous  and loses nothing of the poetry but is the most readable translation of this glorious epic that I ve ever encountered  especially recommended for younger readers tackling the Iliad for the first time  Lombardo s version is one they won t want to put down  This is how it must have impressed the ancient Greeks  Lombardo s ODYSSEY  lovely cover of the Earth seen from space  is the companion piece  Homer never sounded more contemporary  in a good sense  not the stupid sense   wow wow wow  though it takes a little to get through the Iliad  it is amazing  I thought it was about the story of the trojan war but that is really just the setting  I learned its about RAGE  Achilles RAGE and the brutality of war  The book is pretty gory at times and grossed me out a little bit  The way it was written in metric poem style is very interesting and confusing if you dont know that its about rhythm and beats  Homer uses lots of different names for the same person to make it fit the meter  Also you may notice when you read it that HOmer mentions millions of other people and drops so many names your head will spin but I did learn that he does this to pay tribute and honor the people he knew  I would recommend this to anyone  It is just as relevant today as it was 2700 years ago  Very interesting  a great book  a vivid narration that fuelled my imagination to the limits it was bound too  the beautiful chivalric pride and valour of the heroes enlightened me with courage and bravery  The gods and their corrupt nature and communion with the mortals gives a psychological portrait of our own human nature in a symbolic way which talks more to us more that it is put on the pedestal of celestial beings I read the Iliad in sections as a child and always loved Greek mythology  but as I grew older  I appreciated the history and the morality of this book  I discovered  in college  that this book is the first to show contemplation   the inner ponderings of a character and it changed how I looked at the development of literature  My favorite book is Marauding through the Camps  I have used this chapter alone and also have had my students read the entire work  but this one chapter captures the sights and smells and daring of the Greeks  Odysseus and Diomedes of the War Cry  Impulsive  human  sweaty and real  this book is a wonderful teacher of spunk  individualism and love of country  My son s favorite character was Ajax and  of course  Old Nestor  Who wouldn t love an old charioteer with an oversized red cape   Since this was my first reading of the Iliad I thought it d be cool to listen to this on audiobook while reading along so I chose the Stanley Lombardo translation  also narrated by him   Listening to samples of the various audiobook translations his seemed by far the best performed  he s a big Ezra Pound fan and he d been doing inspired performances of his Homer translations for years before it was published in print   plus unlike some of the other audiobooks this was unabridged  Since I haven t read any other translations I can t compare it  but this seemed fantastic to me as a first time reader  I m looking forward to trying some other translations though and I ll update this review if that changes my opinion   and I d definitely recommend it  I LOVE mythology  and nothing gets better than Homer s The Iliad  well  the translated version    It s just one of those books that I keep going back to time and time again  I love The Odyssey too  don t get me wrong  but The Iliad is the golden fleece of all mythology in my opinion  I absolutely adore it  the masterpiece of Greek and European ancient literature  Iliad by Omero fully represents the complicated and wonderful conception of the world by Classics and mostly Greek populations  even if thousands years old  today this book with its stories and its poetry can teach us a lot and move our hearts  Un clasico de la literatura griega  que ha perdurado con exito hasta nuestros dias  Hasta el momento ha sido mi mejor lectura del ano  Homero es bastante descriptivo en su narracion y con el uso de similes logra crear una escena aun mas detallada en la mente del lector  Eso si  a lo largo del libro me puse del lado de los troyanos y me dio infinita tristeza el final por la muerte de Hector  Aun asi  es inevitable negar la fortaleza y valentia de Aquiles  One of my favorite books of all time  I used to read it every couple of years  but find I haven t opened it for over ten years  probably ever since Brad Pitt was cast as Achilles  I think it s time to engross myself once again in this poetic adventure thriller disaster war tragic love story  This is one of those books I wish I had read years ago so that I could have reread it several times since  In addition to the warfare between Greeks and Trojans  there is conflict between quarrelsome gods who interfere with human events  using men as pawns to settle their own petty feuds  Both gods and heroes have extraordinary powers that are offset by ruinous character flaws  Extensive similes throughout the work provide a broader picture of the Aegean world at the time  with lively portraits of its landscape  people  and wildlife  The entire epic is beautifully written and translated  even the harsh violence of battle  which is described explicitly  remains somehow poetic  An excellent 64 page introduction by Bernard Knox makes the work more accessible and understandable  I had only read small excerpts before  so it was a pleasure to finally read the whole work  I found a lot of what I was expecting  a moody Achilles  a patriotic Hector  brutal battles  and meddling gods  in fact  quite a bit more of all of these than I was expecting   I was surprised at the focus on the pain and horrors of war  the longing of the soldiers for peace  especially in the early books   the criticism that both Paris and Achilles took from their compatriots  and the regrets of Helen Stanley Lombardo s translation was very informal and very readable  I would like to read a more formal translation at some point  but I enjoyed Lombardo s quite a lot  Robert Fagles  translation of The Iliad is brilliant  far better than any previous translations I ve read  Fagles makes the story and its characters come alive in a very modern way  If you re trying to choose which translation to read  my recommendation is to go with this one   Absolute classic  Literally  Just completed my 102nd reading   yes  I admit the first 100 were of the Classics Illustrated  comic book  version when I was a kid  but still     Had forgotten how much  trash talk  went on between the Greeks and the Trojans  Very modern in that sense  This is the wellspring from which all great stories arrive  We now know the events  partially fact  partially fiction  occured around 1200 BC  maybe Troy 4 archaeologically  Homer  whomever he was  gives us views of the gods  of mortal men who make errors  and a view into the mindset of very early Greeks  We find a use of the chariot by the elite  and historically  we can see how this vehicle had its practical problems Essentially  the Illiad is the oldest known novel  predating such classics as the Satyricon  the Decomeron  and the Romance of Three Kingdoms  There are good and bad versions available  and this one hits mid road  It s  Homer s best   and frankly I m not sure  he  wrote the Odyssey  I gave it five stars because there is no alternative to the one original  I ve read parts in ancient Greek  all in English  and most recently listened to it on audiobook while driving  I needed to get it back current in my memory bank  I had so little to hang the Iliad onto when I was younger  even though I was a philosophy major and Greek minor  I hadn t travelled  hadn t reached the ages of these characters  had some knowledge of mythology but didn t even realize there were different names for the different god types in different languages cultures  Hadn t read DUNE  And all the rest of the Dune books  Didn t have enough  background knowledge   readin   writin  friends  Don t you love it when student teachers  tell  the kids background knowledge  But not so funny  when the textbooks tell them to tell them background knowledge   The Iliad  by Homer shows just how great the Greeks were when came to long  interesting  and action packed stories  When I read the first few pages I knew I had to read the rest The story starts when Paris of Troy kidnaps King Menelaus of Sparta s wife  Helen  The characters in the story are pictured as heroic and brave  A perfect example of that would be Achilles who left the war but returned to avenge the death of his best friend  This story takes place in Troy which is located in present day Turkey For all of you who like to read the classic Greek stories or a story with mythological beings then you must read this In conclusion  not only does this book have a huge impact on future Greek literature  its known to have a huge impact on future European literature as well  This is an impressive story  much more complex than most modern day tales  although it helps that I read it in an ancient literature course  so I got more context for it than the average reader  It kind of just throws you into the middle of it all  things went on before   things go on after  and the more you know about both the more interesting the tale is  There aren t any bad guys  it is people acting on all sorts of motivations  and how people handle themselves in their different situations  and how they try to deal with the consequences  are quite enthralling Where to put it when you are done reading it  Mid height on your favorite bookshelf  so people won t notice it unless they are actually looking at your books because front and center would be just too pretentious  I actually listened to this on audiobook  read by translator Stanley Lombardo  It s amazing  Obviously it s an epic story   literally   and Lombardo s translation and inflection make it sound very contemporary and easy to follow  It s no mystery why Homer is still popular thousands of years later  The drama is very human  even the parts that feature immortals  and many of the battle scenes sound exactly like something out of a modern day action movie  gory descriptions of brains  bones  and blood included  I will definitely be listening to this audiobook again in the future  but first I m working my way through Lombardo s translation of The Odyssey  I highly recommend these particular translations if you re looking for an accessible version of the great Greek dramas   Homer me prekvapuje neobycejne svezi a originalni poetikou  Puvabna prirovnani  Uprostred vrazdeni  probodavani mozku a vyhrezavani strev pusobi obzvlaste prekvapive nahle vylevy neznosti  spjate vetsinou s

it  I used the EV Rieu revised translation which is pretty good  I do have to use the Martin Hammond translation for my A Level course and I admit I m not keen on that translation  It s quite rambly and I dislike his choice for spelling  But the plotline is fantastic  Ancient Greek epic war saga  including constant gory descriptions of spearing  swording  dismemberment and always inevitable death  All of which makes Game of Thrones look like a round of tic tac toe There is beauty in some of the descriptive passages of heroes  the seeming randomness of tragedy  and the poetic metaphors throughout  I listened to the audio version of this and I will have to listen to it again  probably more than once  It s a rambling story  but a great window onto another time and place  and perhaps more importantly  a pre modern  oral mode of storytelling which I could stand some more of   Right now I am in page 10  but overall I love the book  I am going to study about Greek Mythology and reading  The Iliad  is helping me throughout the process  After reading this book I am going to read  Sopchocles  The Oedipus Cycle  Oedipus Rex  Oedipus at Colonus  Antigone  This book is one of the books I thought I would be daunted by but was actually a very easy read  I found the book to be hard to put down  despite the fact that it was written hundreds of years ago  Homer s vivid imagery is very engaging and impressive  I would recommend this to anyone  An amazing epic that shaped the course of literature for the rest of time  This poem has not lost its relevance or poignancy in thousands of years and reveals much of the human experience  It shows us to be a people who wrestle with meaning through story and our desire for transcendence is displayed as nearly all encompassing  The human response only takes us so far  and the gods as they were believed to be show the inclinations in the human heart to look heavenward for vindication  but the Greek gods ultimately give less than satisfactory answer in that regard  Indeed  it is the compassion of Achilles towards Hector s father that is the single most powerful response in the face of death and empty glory  The critique of hubris should be headed by all men  Obviously  The Iliad is great  This edition made it easier to appreciate  The translation  by Fagles  was fluid and exciting  the notes and guide to characters were very helpful  and the introduction provided an excellent analysis of the work and its production  I not at all qualified to give opinions about the strengths or weaknesses of this book  I cannot add anything new or enlightening to what centuries of reviewers have undoubtedly said already  I will say that Stanley Lombardo s translation is very easy to follow and highly entertaining  I loved the book and recommend to anyone  especially those who love a good battle  I read this once in high school but didn t get much out of it  This summer I picked it up again as the start to a grand scheme to read a huge chunk of the Greek classics I can t believe how I missed so much the first time around  The contrast of Achilles and Hector is awesome  I defy anyone to read this and not conclude that Achilles is a huge bastard  The battle descriptions are gruesome  It is obvious why this work has stood the test of time There are some small annoyances though  In particular  there are several scenes which don t really make sense chronologically  though they make sense in the context of telling the story  Also  certain phrases are reused too much  presumably  this is an artifact of the oral nature of the epic  The most important thing for the Greek heroes is personal glory  It is even more important than the own life  let alone family or fellow citizens  Satisfy all your passions before doing anything else  rage  lust  love  glory  honor  etc    From the beginning to the end  Achilles is satisfying his thirst for joy  revenge  wrath  sadness  etc  etc  etc  I cannot say that some of the discourses weren t inspiring or even stimulating  but all in all  it looks so vane when looked at with contemporary light  Even that final scene when Achilles takes Hector s body himself for burial  after having destroyed it so much with rage    it is all so vane  that I came to understand why all the drama that is based in those poems is in the end so shallow and futile  An all time classic and one of my favourite books   and like a few of them  I go back to them time and again  just because  This is the oldest of them  I first read it in high school and it was time to read again  Love it  HIGHLY recommended  The Iliad is a classic for all time that still reads as fresh as over 2000 years ago when it was written  Eventful  action packed  and comical to read squabbles between the Olympians  the Iliad is still a competitor for all time best fiction  Third reading after many many years  We had a wonderful discussion in the Classic Book Club    everyone had worked hard on the text  I was awestruck at the beauty and the terror of Homer s work  It is really a marvel of poetry  but not easy to take in  I wrote a poem on my blog http   www lornacahall blogspot com Shaking Off the Iliad   beating on the bronze gatestrying to deny their power  seekingsomewhere an inviolate garden a healing rain  soft to washaway the long lines of hard eyedobservation  those careless godsrolling dice in their ambrosialcoliseums Yet undeniable  a blind poet seeingour generations falling like leaves killing tsunamis  the rage of armies nations  cults locking us behindthe merciless gates   This is perhaps the greatest story ever written  The Iliad engages every aspect of the diviersity of human experience  our existential uncertainties  our relation to eachother as humans and to the universe and its divinities  It engages  love  passion  truth  hope  honor  politics  religion  warfare  life  death  afterlife  compromise  idealism  light  dark  humanity  divinity  good  evil and the entire stratigraphy between the polar world  we as humans  see set against itself If there was one book to read in your lifetime   maybe second only to the bible   this would the the one One cannot claim their education adaquately complete   or even adaquate   having not read The Iliad I just wish I could read it in the Greek  The second best book I ve ever read  The Brothers Karamazov being the best   I didn t like some of the long battle scenes  and some of the backstories given by the characters were boring  but the story is timeless  I read it for class  and by the end I disagreed with most of my class in that I considered Achilles to be a true hero  by the end   The intervention of the gods is a wonderfully compelling topic  but the story is  as the first lines tell  about the wrath of Achilles  It s interesting to note that while the movie  Troy   which is a fairly poor adaptation of the story  in my mind  does away with the gods  the heros themselves are more godlike  with the exception of Paris  who is significantly more pitiful in the movie   They say there are only seven  maybe nine  original stories  That all tales ever since have sprung from the same well spring  This surely has to be one of those as it seems to encompass all that followed one way of another  The last book I read in the 20th century  A bloody  vivid telling of war  brought to life by Fagles  evocative verse  The ficklesness of gods and the snap of tendons and the breaking of jaws have not been better rendered  Although I already own a couple of translations of the Iliad  I haven t actually read either of them  When this new translation by Stephen Mitchell appeared in waterstones  I started reading and found the language and rhythm exciting  There is some controversy about it because one book of the poem is not translated but a old version is included at the end I found it a very good read  There are perhaps a couple of battles too many  but so vividly described  It is clear why the book has resonated down the ages with the vividly drawn characters of Achilles and Agamemnon  amongst others  Some day I will return to the other translations  which might be more accurate but which might not be quite so gripping   The Iliad is by far the hardest book that I have ever read  This book is masterfully crafted and dynamic in it s own way  Everything about this book just makes you think and rethink what you have already thought  No one will be able to read this book just once and understand everything that it entails  My favorite part of this book is the role that Achilles plays  Imagine a hero  that is practically unstoppable  Everything about him is just unbeatable  From the way that he battles  to the way that he speaks  even with the way that he carries himself  Achilles is overall one of the most interesting characters that I have ever read about  Overall  this book is very difficult to read  but I highly recommend it  I ve had a cursory look at other translations  but ended up getting Fagles  one because it looked the most lively and accessible without being overly compromising  It was a beautiful read  I d definitely recommend it  This epic poem was the first reading assigned to me for Humanties Core at University of California  Irvine  so this may have some sort of sentimental value to me in years to come  One of my favorite features of this narrative is the fact that there is a back story for every casualty  no death goes unnoticed  The action of the war can still hold the attention of readers many years after the story was written  Howdy  Sweet Readers I feel I should detract a Star Rating for the God awful  Catalogue of the Ships    but I can t  Can t bring myself to do it  Yes  it was an awful way to spend half a chapter  but this epic poem is so epic that it actually makes me gleeful   3Thank you and good night  Whether Homer really existed as sole poet or whether the story of Troy is an oral tale passed down through generations before anyone wrote it down  and really  the mystery behind the speculation is part of the appeal   no one who has read it front to back can deny its dark  tragic power  Everyone knows the gist of the story  but its word for word delivery is the driving force behind it  Although I can t read Greek to confirm it  my notion is that Robert Fagles has skillfully translated to English the depth of human emotion and brutality laced in each line of verse  It was a fantastic read that transported me back to ancient Greece in much the same way that the course I took in Greek Mythology managed to  One of my absolute favorite Greek tragedies  I highly recommend this book  but to read it carefully and a few times  It s easy to misunderstand and lose details  It s a very well written and detailed book  Listened to the Audible edition of this epic    the poem was utterly wasted on me when I first read it in high school     Now I can read it as a masterpiece of metaphor and Ancient Greek masculinity   My 5  rating is specifically for the translation by Stanley Lombardo  Amazon com does a disservice to readers by lumping together reviews for all translations of the Iliad  Lombardo is much better  more readable and exciting  than the translation that I read in a college course  Among other things  the Iliad is a story of the futility and harmfulness of macho pride  With so many battle scenes it is the bloodiest book I have ever read  with vivid descriptions of the lethal wounds caused by spears and swords  I was surprised that it did not end with the story of the Trojan horse  I had forgotten that that story came from other Ancient Greek sources  and was later retold in Virgil s Aeneid  Me ha gustado mucho  No tanto por la trama  mas que conocida por todos  sino  mas bien  por la importancia que tiene esta obra en la literatura universal  Considerada como el clasico de los clasicos  el poema escrito mas antiguo de Occidente creo  debe ser leida por todo buen lector que se precie  Durante la lectura de La Iliada me he sentido como cuando me lei El Quijote  No se explicarlo con palabras pero  es como cuando conoces a alguien a quien hace tiempo que admiras mucho  Algo unico y que muy pocos libros pueden aportarme  La recomiendo aunque  soy consciente de que a muchos lectores les puede parecer una obra un poco aburrida y reiterativa  Ahora  vamos a por La Odisea con muchas ganas   Perhaps the best story ever written  Certainly one of the best books I ve ever read  There is a reason it is a classic  There are so many themes it is almost impossible to know where to start  The main theme is Achilles  anger  but that seems such a simplification  There is tremendous character development as well as numerous character themes that are developed to their logical conclusions  such as Achilles  anger and pride leading to the ultimate death of Patroclus  Remarkable in scope  I read the Cliff Notes to gain an overview of each chapter prior to reading each chapter which greatly aided my understanding of the events as well as their significance  It also alerted me to literary devices  This is an amazing book written up to 3000 years ago  This edition I have was translated in 1938  The text is so small that I decided to try another edition in a larger format  I purchased a book which is the one many schools use  No wonder the kids do not like to read this  The modern translation was so difficult  I finally got out some stronger reading glasses and kept to this one which is so much easier to understand  It is written in a beautiful prose and is more  modern  than the newer text  I wanted to read it again now because it has been so many years since I first enjoyed reading it  and I can now start the Song of Achilles which I felt needed a bit of background to enjoy  De la colera de Aquiles a la elegia de Hector  la Iliada de Homero merece todo el esfuerzo que exige su lectura  Leyendolo se entiende que sea uno de los textos  por no decir  el  texto  fundadores de nuestra literatura occidental  A pesar de contar una historia epica y legendaria  el libro esta repleto de momentos y actitudes muy humanos  incluso cuando se trata de los dioses  Tiene una primera frase celebre  y acaba con otra que  en su sencillez  cierra toda la obra de forma completa  Pero si he de quedarme con una  escogeria esta   Ainsi dit elle  pleurante  et les femmes lui repondent par des sanglots  sur Patrocle en apparence  mais dans le fond  chacune sur son propre chagrin    Ch  XIX  Beautiful poetry  He fell  thunderously  and his armor clattered upon him  and his hair  lovely as the Graces  was splattered with blood  those braided locks caught waspwise in gold and silver  As some slip of olive tree strong growing that a man raises in a lonely place  and drenched it with generous water  so that it blossoms into beauty  and the blasts of winds from all quarters tremble it  and it bursts into pale blossoming  But then a wind suddenly in a great tempest descending upon it wrenches it out of its stand and lays it at length on the ground  such was Euphrobos of the strong ash spear  the son of Panthoos  whom Menelaos Atreides killed  and was stripping of his armour   This is the best translation I ve read  Lattimore s Iliad is fierce and beautiful  and most importantly  he captures a rhythm persistent throughout  He takes pains to un latinize most of the Greek names   and he provides a glossary of proper and place names  so Achilles is Achilleus  Hephaestus is Hephaistos and Ajax is Aias  et cetera  this is all fine  and I appreciate the effort  but he offers no help in the way of pronunciation  which is all to say  I m not a Greek scholar  so I have no idea if Achilleus  Odysseus  and Zeus are supposed to rhyme or not   Ultimately  it doesn t matter  the violence here bloody and stylized  I m looking forward to reading his translation of the Odyssey   I recently felt the need to re read this book  I haven t read it since College when I took Greek Myth for a extra class  I LOVE all things Greek Myth and this is one of the best books out there  As a neophyte writer determined to learn from the classics  I read this book in an act of discipline when it first came out  I had tried reading Greek works  in English  in my youth and couldn t get through them  However  something about Mr  Fagles s translation worked exceptionally well for me  This great tale came alive in a way that I was clearly ready to experience  The Greeks  or more specifically  Homer  seemed to understand the emotions and parameters of physical conflict exceptionally well  So if you re a writer and need to have scenes of physical altercation in your work  I recommend reading and learning from Homer s Odyssey and the Iliad  as translated by Mr  Robert Fagles   I feel wholly unqualified to review this book  For the obvious reasons So I ll just say that I enjoyed it very much  I listened to most of it  and then read the last 150 pages  I think the audio version brings home the brutality and gruesomeness of the long battle scenes  I might have missed a lot of that in a casual reading   letting my eyes bounce over the unpleasant descriptions  Despite the gore  I feel like I took in so much information about the battles  the warriors  and the gods   and I wasn t really aware that I was learning it  Nice  Next up in the books I read to feel and sound smart queue is The Aeneid  But first  something a little less daunting from my bookshelf     So many wonderful threads come together to make this a great read  The book revels in ultraviolence that would make Tarantino blush  but also honestly portrays the violence of battle and various facets of death  All of this happens on a farcical battlefield where tens of thousands of warriors stand around perpetually idle as a few heroes move from act to act as if in a play  At times the gods are vital players in the story and at other times they fit comfortable into superstition  There isn t a lot of recognizable character development  but they come to life quickly  perhaps because each has been the inspiration for hundreds if not thousands of characters we ve encountered over the years  I must say  I feel silly giving  stars  to such a surpassing work of literature  I have read this book about five or six times in the past three years  Every time I am more stunned by the beauty and horror and humanity of this story  The descriptions of battles challenge the finest special effects we have currently in film  The characters are deeper and more complex than the majority of modern protagonists  I weep now when I read it  which was not always the case  Either I am getting soft  or the story is finally having its way with me It is especially rich when read with a group of people  which is no surprise I guess  give the fact that it was birthed out of oral tradition   I ve read several translations and I agree with Keats   Much have I travell d in the realms of gold   And many goodly states and kingdoms seen   Round many western islands have I been  Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold   Oft of one wide expanse had I been told   That deep brow d Homer ruled as his demesne   Yet did I never breathe its pure serene  Till I heard Chapman speak out loud and bold   Then felt I like some watcher of the skies  When a new planet swims into his ken    Or like stout Cortez when with eagle eyes  He star d at the Pacific  and all his men  Look d at each other with a wild surmise    Silent  upon a peak in Darien  I have to laugh at the thought of  rating  Homer  Well  he gets 5 stars from me  This particular translation is excellent   was recommended to me by a Latin scholar  I have to say that I enjoy The Iliad even more than its successor  there s something about the Greeks holding seige outside the battered city of Troy that is truly epic   worthy of awe  The heroes we see    Achilles  Hector  Prius  Agammemnon  Ajax    are truly larger than life and nearly the equal of the gods  Gore alert  Homer does not stint on details in battle  so be prepared for the ancient equivalent of splatter  He also loves to make lists of warriors arming themselves before they go out to the field  OK  so I guess I like stories about sweaty men stabbing each other with their  spears   I don t care  This book is a non stop brain splattering war scene with maybe two breaks for conversation  one of which is followed by fire Idomeneus skewered Erymas straight through the mouth  the merciless brazen spearpoint raking through  up under the brain to split his glistening skull    teeth shattered out  both eyes brimmed to the lids with a gush of blood and both nostrils spurting  mouth gaping  blowing convulsive sprays of blood and death s dark clouds closed down around his corpse And people wonder why reading isn t popular any more  This book is fucking amazing  I really really really love these old Greek stories  including this of course  It s totally epic and timeless  with Achilles the asshole and Hektor the slightly less of an asshole hero  I enjoyed The Iliad very much  In the beginning  books  or chapters the story is kind of boring  All the first book does is describe why Achilles is mad at his ruler and why he refuses to fight  But after the first book it spices itself up a little  All the fight scenes are in later chapters of the book  I personally like the fight scenes because it offers a break in the monotony of the ancient Greek translations  My favorite fight scene is when Achilles takes on Hector  It just seems really raw to me that Hector s body is drug behind Achilles  chariot  Achilles to me is an amazing warrior with the bloodlust to deprive a vampire  Therefore I believe The Iliad is a very good book   Quien no conoce la famosa historia que se narra en la Iliada  lectura obligatoria en la escuela que llega a ser fascinante por lo que respresenta historicamente para el mundo occidental  Recuerdo las reglas de las batallas  el respeto por las muertes de los guerreros  y un sepelio marcado por juegos y competencias en memoria del heroe caido  El paso y los lamentos de los vivos al mundo de los muertos  y las intervenciones de los dioses en estas batallas  Las versiones que utilizaron el estilo poetico son las que mejor ayudan a comprender el peso historico de esta obra  pero claro  no son para cualquier tipo de lectores  Cien por ciento recomendable para leerla y releerla  This is my third reading of The Iliad  I get more out of it every time  and it always seems fresh and new  This time  it occurred to me that the gods are LESS noble than the men who figure so large in this epic  they are almost petty by comparison  And in fact it is the nobility of man that strikes me with awe in this timeless  grand epic  For all their raw savagery  the heroic spearmen of this eternal poem encompass the gamut of all that is fine about our species  If aliens should stumble across the husk of our planet ten millennia or a hundred from now  I hope there is at least one copy of Homer s Iliad still extant  It will explain us at our finest  and at our worst  Srdzbu mi  boginjo  pjevaj Ahileja  Peleju sinaPogubnu  kojano zada Ahejcima tisucu jada Snazne je duse mnogih junaka ona k AiduPoslala  a njih je same ucinila plijen

that is as alive today as it was nearly 3000 years ago  Troy  and it s story  seems to have a special attraction to western culture  and maybe it is because of this classic that it does  I won t give a synopsis   there are far too many as it is   but will advise the potential purchaser of these lectures that you won t be disappointed  it has it all  seduction  sex  slaughter and sorrow   I ve just finished Liz s Iliad lectures  for the second time   and will be re listening to the Odyssey shortly  These are bargain lectures  very often on sale   and they are some of the best   ann dr an hngm

way through  Though now having finished it I feel the need to vault loudly and arrogantly over the completed tome  like some bronze clad Achaian  Also  I was rooting for Hektor the whole time  A great book on the Trojan war  It s a good way to get more familiar with Greek mythology while hearing such a great story  The book is written out in the form of a poem  it was originally an oral story than was then translated to writing  The storyline is very interesting  it shows how war can start from two peoples greed  Paris and Hellens love affair   And brings other factors into the chain of events like how the gods favor people  The story line is very complex to try try and tell in a short paragraph or two but it very easy to follow along while reading  For the most part there is non stop action throughout the book  keeps you entertained the entire time   Grandiosa obra en que se unen dioses y mortales y los valores que presiden son la amistad  el honor y la lealtad  Aca los dioses se enfrentan para defender a los hombres de su preferencia  Por La Iliada entendemos por que en la literatura de todos los tiempos los muertos han de descansar sepultados y no a la intemperie como presa de perros o pasto de aves  Y las tinieblas velaron los ojos del guerrero   I needed to read the Iliad fast  I am giving a course on it starting next week  I could not have hoped for a more accessible translation than Stephen Mitchell s  which was liberal enough to use colloquialisms such as  son of a bitch  on a number of occasions  What can you say about this book  I absolutely loved it     It is a book I have read more than once and each time I have come away with something new   Absolut fantastisch  Offensichtlicher Weise der Vorganger unzahliger anderer Geschichten der vergangenen zwei Jahrtausende  Vorallem die Gesange 16  Patroklos zieht aus und Stirbt  sowie 22  Die Totung Hektors  sind wirklich atemberaubend  aber auch alles andere  The Iliad is a good story about adventure and war  I love war stories  so this book was right up my alley  I found myself cheering on some of the warriors  booing others  and wanting to know what happened  even though I know the story   It s a little hard to digest and I found myself saying  Really   a lot  The way they killed was weird  especially when they stabbed underneath the ear  I didn t find that believable way to kill someone  since that s a hard spot to try to kill  Good war story  but I recommend it to those who seriously want to read it  It is graphic  and it s a classical novel  Those novels are hard to read  or they are to me   I loved this book when I read it  It doesn t go through the whole Trojan war  it starts in the middle of the war and ends after Hector s death  It was really interesting to find that Helen doesn t actually love Paris and that she finds him disgusting and her adultery to be horrible  She feels angry and disgusted with herself for listening to the Gods  most importantly  Aphrodite  This book  for all those who loved the movie Troy  should read this to realize the characters portrayed by the actors are terrible  It really is a good read and  if you want to dedicate your time  has great metaphors and side stories from the Gods  It really was interesting  This is a very accessible translation that includes very good translator s notes and historical footnotes  The many and graphic war scenes set the standard for how fictional combat can be written as exciting and entertaining  The characters are larger than life  and with few exceptions  everyone that dies has a name and a history  The Iliad sets the high water mark for all literature of its kind One note  for those unfamiliar with the text  The Iliad does not tell the entire story of the Trojan War  Don t expect to see the Trojan horse or the sacking of Ilium  The story is about the legendary rage of Achilles  and it begins and ends with his rage  Por tradicion  ensenanzas y por aficion  esta obra sin lugar a dudas  debe estar en cualquier biblioteca publica  privada del mundo entero  Una obra maestra que me eriza la piel   I read the Robert Fitzgerald translation of the Iliad  It s good solid story telling  I say  You can tell why it s been around so long  Doesn t get much better than that  I ve read the book in three different languages  One of my all time favorites  and one of the greatest war stories of all time  Truly an epic   I love  love  love the Iliad  It s war depicted on an epic  beautiful level  I m one of the few people who will boldly say that they prefer the Iliad to the Odyssey  Numerous strong heroes fighting for glory amidst battlefield full of disguised  petty gods    it s just amazing  I m partial to Diomedes  Odysseus  and Hektor  Book V depicting Diomedes enraged to the level of a berserker    just tearing down dozens of men at one time    it s sheer artistry  If you saw the movie Troy and felt like something was missing  you definitely should read the Iliad  Troy pales in comparison  The characterization of Paris alone makes me ill   If you haven t read the Iliad yet  this is the translation to get  It is a remarkable epic poem  2 700 years old and still not dated   One of the books I truly loved reading as a preteen  Through the years I ve retread different versions multiple times and will again  Thoroughly enjoyable and not what I had thought it would be    a story of the Trojan War and the Trojan horse  Instead  this story is about the rage of Achilles  I studied this book with my students in a Joseph Campbell centered class named after his  The Hero With a Thousand Faces  Hector embodies some of the more classic traits we associate with heroes  and the Trojans are thrown into a fairly positive light for  enemies   The gods are the ones who come off really poorly    they remind me of kids making their action figures do battle  They are petty  they bicker  and they don t value humanity beyond entertainment   Comprehensive lectures with deep insights not only into Iliad text  but also into cultural impact and influence of its text   This fantastical story told in a form of poetry is one of my favorites  Greek mythology incorporated into any story is almost always enthralling  The blood and gore only added to the story instead of being considered unnecessary violence  I find the fact that the Greek gods are capable of making mistakes intriguing because it shows that fallibility is not impossible even for so called  gods   Power also has its limits and immortality never lasts forever   This is the single best translation you will find  and his translation of the Odyssey is brilliant  too  So much easier to read   If you read one translation of the Iliad  read this one  The voice of Homer shines clearly through Mr  Verity s translation  I struggled through this in high school but I want to read it again because I did like it maybe now it would be even better  What can I say about the Iliad that hasn t already been passed down through the millenia  Everyone should read it at least once  The Iliad is a genuine classic  sure to please aficionados and students of  poetry  mythology  ancient history  military literature  rhetoric  and epic fiction in general  Be that as it may  I must state that I wasn t entirely pleased with the most recent adaptation  in which  Menelaus was portrayed by Cheney  Agamemnon by Bush  Achilles by Rumsfeld  Ajax by Powell  Priam by Saddam  Paris by the rather abstract  but quite real  blowback from America s  specifically  the Reagan Administration s  foreign policy  Helen by Saddam s delusory and dramatically overstated weapons program  and so on and so forth    The back cover of lombardo s translation of the Iliad boldly states  this is as good as Homer gets in English   I don t doubt it  The language is clearly more modern than other translations I have sampled and its pace is gripping  Obviously  the are tons if ink spilled in reviewing the Iliad  so I will not even attempt to add to it in describing Homer s story  But  I will say it is  at essence a war story and Lombardo has captured it in English incredibly well  The average reader may dread the suggestion of reading Homer as it has a reputation as dense ancient poetry  Not so with Lombardo  Highly recommended   Epic  I m so glad I finished this  The Death of Hector was the best Chapter of any book I can think of  Book 22  What can one say  It simply must be read by anyone who is interested in literature   But the Odyssey is more fun   Lattimore s translation is extremely well done  Every time I opened the book  it felt like I could wrap myself up in his flowing  poetic language like a quilt  Some very touching events that were enhanced by his amazing woodcraft  Read the classic many years ago before this version and was fascinated as I have been with all of the classics   Today  studying for my Classics exam  I fell in love with the Iliad all over again  The shatteringly beautiful similes  the exquisitely descriptive epithets  the passion and pathos of mortal existence contrasted with Olympian capriciousness  the epic hero s pursuit of the honour and glory that will make him immortal in the face of death  and the strange idea of all this pain being put into poetry for pleasure  all make it so incredibly poignant and powerful  No one says it better than Helen Zeus set a vile destiny  so that hereafterwe shall be made into things of song for the men of the future  Fagels s translation of the Iliad and the Odyssey are both magnificent    highly readable  with forceful and direct prose that  I have to imagine  since I have no expertise  are closer to the experience of the original oral texts  For me  the measure if the success of the translation is whether it allows a text this old and culturally removed from the reader to retain its emotional impart  This one does  especially in Achilles  rage in book one  his climactic meeting with Priam  and    my favorite part    Diomedes  battle with the gods in Book 5  Really superb  I m looking forward to re reading it   I planned on reading a Book  chapter  a day starting on my birthday 12 30  But then last Monday  January 9th  I felt ill and stayed home from work  Well to pass the time while I rested up and sipped day all day  I picked up where I left off  I read Books 11   24 in a single sitting with some breaks for tea  The experience bordered in mystical  I got so swept up with the story even though I have read numerous translations of the Iliad  and Odyssey   Mitchell s translation works well for a contemporary reader  but a little too modern  I can see this being out dated in the next generation of readers   In my opinion  even better than the Odyssey  which is hard to beat  One of the best books ever written  not an easy read  but worthwhile this epic tale around the besiegment of the city Troy and of gods and humans I used the Norton anthology translation for this book  it was a little diluted in my opinion  but I loved the story itself  mostly because I am a big fan of Achilles  I would recommend this story to anyone   And so they buried Hector  breaker of horses  This single line from The Iliad is my favorite of the book  and one of 10 top favorites in all of literature  In this single line  the sum of who Hector truly was  and truly wanted to be  echoed pure  Not his heroism or acts of bravery and bravado  but the thing that mattered to him  and his nature  Heroes come in many forms  but ultimately each is human  with the heart and frailties of a flawed soul  This chord  and hero s song is carried forward  the torch is passed  in Kvothe  Patrick Rothfuss s mythical character of The Name of the Wind   Amazing  And this is the translation to read    if when you do  I ll read this book again  soon  Epic  dramatic  awesome  I listened to the Audiobook with a translation by Stanley Lombardo   Amazing classic  New perspective of the Homeric writings after taking a literature course  This is exciting  deep  tragic  hilarious  and generally mind blowing  There is a reason why this has been a classic for a long time  A truly epic and surprisingly touching poem  I was expecting gory battles and elaborate similes  and this delivered on both counts  Yet there are also some fascinating characters here  Hector and Achilles  despite their near unbelievable prowess on the battlefield  are so very human  Hector s final goodbye to his family at the end of Book VI and the confrontation between Priam  Hector s father  and Achilles at the end are the two best scenes in the whole poem  IMHO  because they show the human vulnerability that still exists in both characters  A must read classic from the Ancient World  A Classic  I love the visual imagery  the history behind it alone is fascinating This translation of the Iliad was absolutely readable and relateable for a modern audience  without losing the poetic flow of the original text   I just went back to read this one more time and I still love it as much as ever    Even more  I think this is the best translation I ve seen  Fagle s interpretation are like poetry  do I feel like Homer would approve   Nothing that I can say about The Iliad hasn t been said by other readers already  so I ll keep this short and sweet  I loved The Iliad  even though it really does have a problem with introducing us to lists of characters only at the moment of their deaths  and the treatment of mortal women in the book really does relegate them to a ranking system of choice sexual morsels and nothing much more  Aside from those failings  this is still a great book and is well worth reading and I m glad that I spent the time actually reading it and not just always saying to myself that I would   I read  The Iliad  as a senior in college and was so surprised by how much I liked it  I read the Robert Fitzgerald translation  and it was much less difficult to read than I had originally anticipated  The story is wonderfully heroic and offers much action  but homer also adds in a lot of comedy  The war  the friendship  the rivalry  the heroes and  of course  the gods  After reading  The Iliad   I completely changed my view of the Greek play and am excited to begin reading  The Odyssey   I definitely recommend this book to anyone thinking about extending their list of classics  The Fagles translation certainly met my expectations  I received a bit of heckling for reading the  easy  translation  but it suited my purposes  To read works in translation is always painful  Such is life  Nonetheless  Fagles captured the action and intensity of the story  And whatever translation I d read would still have provided the famous elements whose impact has been felt in literature since  If I read it again in years to come  perhaps I ll try a different translation  For now  I am very well satisfied and looking forward to Fagles  versions of The Odyssey and The Aeneid  A story that stays relevant through the ages  A FANTASTIC story  A must read  I had never read The Iliad before  so after listening to the Fitzgerald translation  I wanted to get more meaning and context from my reading  Professor Vandiver of Northwestern University gave some excellent lectures and enhanced my understanding of this classic of Western Literature  She was very organized and presented the material in an easy to grasp way  Her enthusiasm for the book and ancient Greek literature was evident in her voice  I would love to take one of her classes  I am now reading The Odyssey and intend to purchase her series of lectures on it too   All I can say is that it is a good book  Read it when you have the time  I tried reading the Fagles  translation a few years back  but didn t make it all the way through  I may give it another try  since at the time I was working two jobs  and it s just as likely that that s what made me fall asleep while reading  In any case  there was no falling asleep here  Stephen Mitchell s translation is forceful and vivid  and it was very gratifying to read a work written 2 700 years ago and find the story within to be as poignant and exciting as anything I ve ever read  I think I may turn into an Iliad buff on account of this  I loved this book  This is one of those books that I always thought I should read just because it s a classic blah blah blah  I kept putting it off because I didn t think I d enjoy it very much or be able to make it through  Boy was I wrong  This story is incredible  obviously it has to be or it wouldn t have lasted this long  Despite the fact that it came about almost 3000 years ago I really found the characters easy to relate to  I guess the human traits of anger  love  hatred  jealousy  revenge  forgiveness  etc  haven t changed too much in the past 3 millennia  Thank you Homer  And we think we are smarter today than people from ancient times     Not as good as the Odyssey but still one of the great classics  Maybe I would not appreciate this much through the help of our professor in our Literature because of his help  we learned to appreciate how it was creatively done and that its imaginations inside this book was really magnificent and how there were many underneath of the characters of this people  gods in this book that in the end  they were representing us  It was like they were our mirror to understand our humanity in deeper level  It was not the text but what it made us realized after discussing this whole book in my first semester as first year college  I originally had some problems with the story itself as well as Lattimore s translation   I understand where Homer himself was coming from  but the copy and paste battle scenes seemed pointless after a while  and so much stuff made no sense  Then Lattimore created phrases such as  lying mightily in his might  and  wine blue sea   I prefer  winedark  in such instances  as I ve seen it in other translations   But  then I realised other translations can be pretty terrible  And even more than that   Book 18  Holy crap  That made every problem seem negligible  Me lo lei a los 14 anos y me encanto  Lo encontre en una estanteria de mi casa rodeado de libros que no me decian nada  recuerdo que lo coji y note el tacto rugoso de la tapa tipica de las ediciones de mitad de siglo XX  cuando lo abri me llamo la atencion la densa caligrafia y las paginas anaranjadas por la humedad  Me lo zampe en una semana y sin duda fue el libro que me abrio las puertas a la literatura clasica Lo volvi a leer hace relativamente poco y me confirmo que cada vez que lo coja seguire disfrutando como un enano  Lo guardo como un tesoro  In this case  five stars doesn t mean I loved every second  Reading a six hundred page poem without losing steam a few times would be miraculous  But this is the original war story  the story all the millions of  war is Hell  poems  stories and novels owe their existence to  Some have complained about the avalanche of names Homer gives us  but I think the point is that no death goes unnoticed  and every one of them is a tragedy  And anyone believing in a higher power has to take pause observing the Gods here  whose actions are less divine than the mortals  Hundreds of pages of ancient trash talk  what s not to like   NO WORDS  Yet I have to review this  if only to gather my thoughts on this divine text  Homer  I love you  Hector  I will never forget you  Achillles and Patrocle  you re sexy together and I will one day write a story inspired by you two Hera  Pallas Athena  Themis  Aphrodite  Andromaque  and Hecube  you are so breathtakingly fantastic  I am forever in your debt And Hades  oh  Hades  you are so mysterious  my bad boy   This is FUCKING EPIC  That s it  I m done  Will never read anything better than this Review will follow after I recover  Three things about The Iliad  1  There are quite a few metaphors about lions  who either kill cattle or sheep or are hunted in turn  3 000 years ago Greece was overrun with lions 2  It s interesting that one of the first long narratives in human has no suspense  The sack of Troy is a foregone conclusion  Even Achilles knows his fate  3  I read Fagles  translation  I love it  but I think Fitzgerald is slightly better at conveying the strangeness of this world even if that does lead him astray sometimes  Odd to be finishing this at the same time as reading Spillane s I  the Jury  Achilles would finish off the likes of Mike Hammer with a flick of the wrist  A very vigorous translation that deserved all the praise it got when it came out  Occasionally drifts into lazy cliche  Run for your lives   or even worse  bad cliche  armed to the hilt   but far better than Fagles  much later translation of the Aeneid  And as an added bonus  Bernard Knox s long introduction is the best single thing I ve ever read on Homer  It alone is worth the price of the book  Though I would never have gotten through it by choice  it is one of the best  most thoroughly incredible books I have read regarding human nature and literature probably ever  There were some moments that  in fewer words than imaginably possible  Homer managed to strike the quick of the situation  although at other times it is amazing that there are so many ways to say the smallest thing   Even though I skimmed through many of the lineages and bloody fights  I think I got more out of this book than any other I have yet read in an English class  What is there to say about the Iliad that hasn t been said dozens of times in the past 2500 years  It s a vital piece of literary  cultural  and anthropological history  and you really ought to read it if you haven t  Robert Fagles  translation seems to be the modern standard and I can see why  The language is rich and vivid  with a characteristic lilt that lends a credibly ancient air to the legend  The characters are timeless and  while their motivations are often illogical or barbaric to modern sensibilities  their emotions bleed from every page  I had entirely forgotten how good The Iliad is  What a terrific read  I found this much more approachable than I did when I was 18  Sure there are still all the annoying parts  the catalogue of ships and all of the endless blood and gore  but they seem somehow shorter and more part of a unified awesome story than I ever realized before The language is also gorgeous  particularly in the Lattimore translation  I am so very glad that I read this again  Now I can t wait to read The Odyssey  which promises to be just as beautiful but with less gore  If you live in West   read this book  God  Hector  you broke my heart  That is all   This is the book that truly started it all for me  I read the Iliad when I was 5 or 6  and it set the standard upon which I judge all other fiction  I know that s a hard act to follow  but many authors seem to manage   Shitty things happen to good people  okay  It s just how life works sometimes  And no one knew this better than Homer  or all the ancient Greek poets who passed on the story that eventually became this epic   Hector  sigh  I m just really glad my history class allowed me the chance to read The Iliad  I always  meant to   it was in my  list  but I know I wouldn t have picked it up anytime soon unless I had to  which fortunately I did  I loved it  The Odyssey s definitely going in my  list  too  and what do you know  we re reading Virgil next   Many people prefer the Odyssey to the Iliad  but to me the Iliad is the superior work by far  Through the character of Akhilleus Homer calls into question the whole value of immortality through fame that the warrior culture of Ancient Greece was based on  In the great national epic of Greece none of the Greek heroes come across as anything other than self serving bastards and the gods are worse  Akhilleus returns to the battle and does his duty in the end  but only for personal reasons  not for fame and glory  which he gets anyway  Why does this sound so much better when uttered in ancient Greek My earliest recollections of Agamemnon and Achilles were during Greek translation  so it was pretty labourious for me  When I finally got to read Homer s work as literature  I was knocked out Does it not show that there is  nothing new under the sun  Humans are always fighting and hating and loving and struggling    The futility and hopelessness of war still remains with me after reading this epic tale  Why don t men ever learn Homer at his very best  Fagles  translation is amazingly good  It brings the Iliad to life like no translation I read before  fantastically vivid  almost visual  And the Iliad   is the epic of epics  despite treating a small time period during a war long long past  it s as vast as life and death  love  friendship  loyalty  bravery  ambition  greed  envy  grief  compassion  it s all there  And to my mind  Hector  who fights not out of choice but to protect his family  even knowing he will lose  is as much a hero as Achilles  who rages against death on our behalf   5 stars  See review for  The Odyssey   just like kill bill  a two part story The movie Troy was not as imaginative  though it was a great comparison with lots of parts in the Iliad  A masterwork with impeccable timing   Summary  Achilles gets pissed   But you   with enemy war cries ringing in your ears  you lack the nerve to go up against Great Ajax that fierce heart  to look him straight in the eyeand fight the man head on   he s a better man than you   Glaucus  Trojan ally  to Hector  greatest of all Trojan warriors God I love Telamonian Ajax  Same goes with old Nestor and Patroclus  For anyone reading this  who are your favorite characters throughout the epic poem  who are those least favorite  Always curious to know  really enjoy talking all things Iliad  The story is an epic of course  but this translation is amazing  It is beautifully written and the story itself is one of the best ever created  It s themes are prevelant in modern day and will always be  It is seldom that you feel a book s written words in your heart  or visually see and feel the pain  joys and actions popping out at you  It is a work of art  by far  the best book I ve ever read in great literature  From this translation  one can understand why it is still being read thousands of years later  Kudos Homer and Fagles  I thought this book was amazing  I thought this book was amazing because it described one of the best war stories in the world  This book had a lot of details  excitement  and real life situations  This story is wrote in the Greeks point of view  This book has some fighting involved in it  but of this book is about the love of women and the wanting of Troy  The whole story of the Iliad is written about Achilles  This book also involves the God s and their distractions in the war  This is a very good book and you have to read it   Everyone should read it  This was a very scary  death renting  brave battling book  I loved most of it even though it is a little hard for a rising ninth grader to understand  It was worth it though and now i m very happy that i have accomplish this 700 page poem  U Ilijadi je sva knjizevnost  Read most of it in class   Lo ame  Releer debo    Pero respeta a los dioses  Aquileo  y apiadate de mi  acordandote de tu padre  que yo soy todavia mas digno de piedad  puesto que me atrevi a lo que ningun otro mortal de la tierra  a llevar a mi boca la mano del hombre matador de mis hijos   This book is a great read  Classic of my chilhood English teacher nerd read  The beginning of it all  Best translation available  Homer deserves nothing under five stars  The man  the myth  the legend always lives up to the hype  My translation  the W H D  Rouse translation  was acceptable  but not optimal  The language was too colloquial for my tastes  Although there are some great lines in this translation  I kept thinking that I wasn t getting the noble language Homer is so famous for  I ll be reading the Fagles translation next time   Must read  A classic  There s a reason that Lattimore s translation has been so respected for so many decades  The new edition is a fine reissue of this monument of scholarship  It is true to the Greek and also beautiful  and that makes it a delight  Long but excellent read  I ve read this several times  both in English  and in school in the original classical Latin  I read the Odyssey for the first time in freshman year Latin class in high school  and loved it  Later  when we started the Iliad as juniors  I was equally impressed  Later  I re read it in conjuction with works by Mary Renault and Steven Pressman   That summer between high school and college was completely devoted to the Greek and Roman classics  and any pertinent literature about the two cultures that I could squeeze in   Just read and discussed this with my men s book group  It s a daunting 614 pages but such a page turner  There s a reason why we ve been reading and discussing this for 2500  years  the heroes are petty  foolish and brash  the gods are scheming  foolish  and quite hilarious  esp when Hera seduces Zeus to take his mind off the war  No death is anonymous  everyone has a back story  and the ending is surprising  not the Trojan Horse but with Achilles graciously releasing Hector s body to Priam for a proper burial  An epic read   Besides being one of the longest poems ever composed  the Iliad is also one of the most important  It makes the reader wonder what it means to be human  and also makes us reconsider what a hero truly is  Furthermore  besides the well known cast of characters  the Iliad boasts some of the most beautiful language I ve ever come across  All you have to do is read the chapter about the creation of Achilles  shield and you ll know what I m talking about  Maybe our world leaders could learn something from reading this poem    Michael Reck did the impossible  translating Homer s Iliad into verse  close to the original  retaining the feeling of an epic poem  to be perfomed out loud  At the same time he achieved this using modern and readable english  flowing with great speed And Homer deserved such a modern translation  showing how people of 2 or 3 millennia before our time were quite as human as we are  including the emotions  sensitivities  social conflict  power struggles  and a highly developed way of expressing these in literature  As I read the Iliad  I was constantly surprised at just how readable it was  You might think that Greek epics are just for the tweed jacket types  but it is amazing how much more enjoyable it is to read Homer than to read anything written about him  Okay  maybe not so surprising  Fagles translation is vibrant and energetic  if maybe a bit too colloquial at time  calling pigs  porkers   Jarring a bit    and it was a joy to read through rather than feeling like I was taking my cultural literacy medicine  The Odyssey tends to be Homer s more popular text  but I ve always found The Iliad to be a more dynamic piece  Of course  The Odyssey is fabulous  but I am drawn more to the character dynamics  the action  and the heart behind The Iliad  There is something uniquely intoxicating about how Homer mixes war  sacrifice  betrayal  rituals  gods  demi gods  humans  etc  in this epic that I have never been able to shake even as a modern day reader  I had a professor once say   All roads lead back to The Iliad   He was not wrong  A favourite  So great  everyone needs to read this at least once   Spellbinding    The Classic   Hyperviolent   Best translation Mesmerizing  Epic  Literally  I love mythology Although people in general  I think  not sure  prefer the Odyssey  I like the Iliad  Perhaps the resonance with today is the reason  less to do with men in war  more to do with the unbelievably noble  admirable and downright wonderful Hectory  the man of the state  fighting off the chaos of the whirling dervish Achilles  Civilization vs  the alternative  whatever that may be   Most of this was stolen from Bernard Knox s introduction  which is great  Just don t read it until after you finish the actual Iliad   This is a great version  I studied Lattimore s translation in school   I still like that one  too  but this is livelier  It s fun to read aloud   You can t just sit there quietly reading  it s the Iliad   I read it every few years and it takes forever and annoys my family but wow  it s great  Gripping despite the repetition   Or maybe because of   It s a peek into another culture from which we are very far removed  yet we still share so much in motivations and destinies  And this is a beautiful translation  This is from Grolier The worlds great classic  No ISBN so this was the closest version  I believe it be a bit easier to follow if I was more familiar with Greek Mythology  That being said it is great to be compelled to look up words and ponder what the author has written  There are many reasons this is a classic  I reget I have waited so long to take this journey  The IliadSBN 717200000 I read this just to be able to say to people I d read it and look intelektewal But    OMG    it was amazing  THIS should have been on the Eng Lit syllabus back in 1980  not the Mayor of effing Cadbury  OK  so the  And six pack abbed Fred  son of Joe son of Dave slew moobed Jack  son of the well pecked James son of Pete with a well thrown javelin to the gut  does go on a bit  but you get used to it  This is like Lord Of the rings without the wizards and goblins and orcs and elves and stuff  Just the battles  Reading Iliad and loving it  No novel that I ve read  or war movie I ve seen  has been more thrilling than books XI to XVI of Iliad  It is not only the first Western epic  but also the first and greatest work of all genres  thriller  melodrama  family feuds  erotica  among many other things  I doubt if any book represents its society and culture as completely as Iliad  It is like a poem on war and love  a treatise on existential dread  written by a  or many  sadist physician s  and the greatest s  of all poets  A true classic  it s too bad the movie Troy had no gods in it screwing with everything  If you have the patience it is something everone should read  I m not sure if this is exactly the one I have read  I read both a prose version and the poem version which is a more faithful translation from the Greek  If you read the poetic Greek one  keep an eye out for everyone being stabbed in the liver  and Dawn stretching forth her rosy fingers  And read the name Neoptolemus as Nipple ottomes  it s a lot more fun that way  This book gives the best possible descriptions of battles and has the Gods participate directly in the battles themselves  Paris was a punk  Diomedis rocks  Achillies sat idle for the majority of the work  Agamegnon was a despot  and Hector  the only true hero  dies  Though it surprised me that this work doesn t even cover the fall of Troy  I was enwraped in the story once I set my mind to the language And did you know that there was both an Ajax the Major and Ajax the Minor  though both of them kicked ass  Beautiful testtest This is the story about how so and so stabbed so and so on such and such hill with this and that sword blahblahblahaaajlajsdlfs I missed Greek Mythology   Need to read The Odyssey  I ll probably do it after the BookTube A Thon  D Genius   amazing   Stunning  There is a reason why certain works remain in  the canon   Every aspect of human experience is found in  The Iliad   I loved the reviewer who was spurred to read by the gruff speaker at her college commencement   and learned that he was right   Listened to this one on CD  read by Derek Jacobi  What a treat  This book does an incredible job capturing the Trojan War and displays the emotions of each character beautifully  The way the relationship of Achilles and Patrokles is described is incredible  I recommend this book to any individual who appreciates Greek Mythology or History  The books sets up a great timeline of events  Also the incorporation of the Greek Gods is established in various parts of the story  This is a book that should be read by anyone who appreciates History of Greece  This is the ultimate in Ancient Literature  Homer knew how to maintain the flow of the tale  The translation by Robert Fagles is by far my favourite    I have two copies  one that travels with me  and a copy to keep on my shelves  The introduction is marvellously written and gives the reader a deep insight into and enlightens the reader to customs of Bronze Age that they may be yet unaware of  I say I read this in 2007  though truth be told  I do not think I will ever finish  re reading it  woah best I read Robert Fagles  translation but the few last chapters of the book were misprinted so I had to read the last parts from Samuel Butler s translation  Must say I d prefer the latter  with its poetic and compelling flow of writing compared to the dramatic free verse of Fagles which I found hard to engage with  But I d recommend Fagles  version for those who want a better understanding of Homer s works and their origin  as the essays by Bernard Knox are well worth digging into   There really isn t anything else to say about the Iliad  It is brutal  infuriating  exciting  and tragic  The introduction by Bernard Knox was excellent   This is one of the best books ever written  even though I know that the epic was not originally written down  The Iliad  for those who live in a hole  recounts the story of Achilles  anger at Agamemnon s theft  It pits the honor of two warriors against one another  and substitutes their battle for the second between Hector and Achilles  The story of war  of strategy  of death and honor of rage  pity and sorrow all combine to make this one of the most unforgettable stories ever  Of all the translations I sampled  this was the best  Lattimore captures the poetry of Homer without falling into the trap of altering meanings for the sake of readability  as does Fagle  One gem from Fagles  translation is the phrase   cramping my style   which does not belong in the poetry of Homer The first time I read the book I wasn t too interested and didn t know what to make of it  After rereading it for seminar  I think I could talk about it forever and not get tired If you work with any teams  read the Iliad and examine the genius of Agamemnon in marshaling seemingly innumerable tribes  including one led by the god like Achilles  or as I read the Ancient Greek  the god Achilles   I have read the book   both in the Fagles and in the Lattimore translations   seven times  and I have given away five sets of the audio version of the Fagles translation  which must come as close as we can to giving the story its oral and aural due in today s literature  This is a long story that is both sad and entertaining  I knew that Troy was join to fall but while reading this I found myself rooting for Hector and the Trojans to somehow defy history and win but the ending was the same  as the city fell and Hector dies with it  I am happy to learn that eventually Achilles does die and a little angry at Helen for going back to Menelaus  Overall this is a wonderful story to analyze and to sit down and read  whether it s in school or just for fun  On my very first day of university  Professor Smith walked into my Introduction to Classical Studies class and recited the first 15 lines of The Iliad in Greek  That was it   I was hooked  Despite focusing on Latin literature and Roman language in my degree  I never lost my love for The Iliad  which I ve probably read about 10 times in several different translations  Thrilling  unexpectedly humorous  and surprisingly moving  it sets the bar for any and all novels anywhere  any time  Lattimore s tranlsation of The Iliad is my favorite  He captures the Greek really well without sounding too stodgy or stilted  The Iliad is one of my all time favorite books  It is easy to get bogged down by the battle scenes and the language if you re not used to it  but beyond that is a story of family  friendship  loss  grief  and the consequences of war  wrath  and pride  It would actually make a great movie without any changes at all  Yeah I m looking at you Troy   Personally I loved the Iliad I wasn t trying to understand every part  I m sure I couldn t read the UN Translated version but the translated one I loved  I love how the duels didnt last long I believe that the duels really ended quick  not the usually Hollywood bad ass type battles where there throwing there swords and punching one another  Like I said earlier I wasn t trying understand every detail or analyzing everything he said it wrote  For a dumbass like myself I LOVED it   An epic of myriad words  worthy of reading for readers to come     I read this translation originally in order to understand the allusions in Dante s Inferno  but I soon discovered that it was a masterful work of literature  the type of literature I ve yearned for my entire life  My personal appeal orients on the comic book esque elements of  character interaction   Although I later read one book of the Iliad in Ancient Greek  I intend to read the rest of it in Ancient Greek one of these days  and to make a graphic novel out of it  E  come abbandonare la propria terra  finire di leggere l Iliade  cosi alta e l emozione del racconto  che il cuore e la mente chiedono ancora di estinguere con la lettura  la sete che divampa Ci sono momenti nel poema  dove non si puo evitare  il brivido  addirittura  il pianto  per come le trame vengano legate e descritte  Scene epiche  senza pieta che relazionano l uomo della battaglia al piu semplice essere del mondo  perche comune e il destino di noi tutti  E  come abbandonare la propria terra  finire di leggere l Iliade  cosi alta e l emozione del racconto  che il cuore e la mente chiedono ancora di estinguere con la lettura  la sete che divampa Ci sono momenti nel poema  dove non si puo evitare  il brivido  addirittura  il pianto  per come le trame vengano legate e descritte  Scene epiche  senza pieta che relazionano l uomo della battaglia al piu semplice essere del mondo  perche comune e il destino di noi tutti  Nothing but an epic bloodbath from beginning to end  Definitely not for the faint of heart  many descriptions of people s stomaches being cut open and intestines falling out and what not   Of course  being an absolute degenerate  I loved it Highly recommend for anyone who wants a vivid portrayal of war  Also  even if you don t read the entire book  at least be sure to read the description of the Shield of Achilles  Some of the most vivid description I ve ever read  I can t begin to say how much I loved Lombardo s translation  Now  it s true that the last time I read Homer I was in grade school  Those of you who have invested in earlier translations may find that since it s not the version that you are familiar with that it s not as good  I can relate to that  However  for me  the modern work made the text more accessible  I m not an academic  just a fan  I loved this book  If you haven t read Homer yet  my advice is   start here  The best books are the books that make you cry your heart out  I don t know why I keep doing this to myself How to read The Iliad like Emma  in six steps  1  Read one chapter  2  Cry  3  Read another chapter  4  Cry some more  5  Repeat  6  Cry until your eyes bleed  The only thing that made me feel a bit better was Thetis telling his son that he shouldn t be so sad because it s nice to sleep with women  too  Nice try  Thetis  What am I supposed to do with my life now  I don t know how I just now got around to reading the Iliad  but it was great fun  It s incredibly bloody  but I got the feeling that all of our ideas about what makes a hero come from this book  I also got into the rhythm of what was traditionally a spoken story  If I die young  you d better bet there will be funeral games  My only complaints are that the long lists of names did drag sometimes  and I felt kind of cheated at the end  It seems to end a bit abruptly  Fasten your seatbelts please Allacciare le cinture  prego Teste e braccia mozzate  fegati perforati  aste piantate nella schiena a tradimento  prigionieri che implorano in ginocchio e vengono trafitti  vittime derise nel momento della morte  sacrifici umani  polvere

Achilles  One of the greatest of the ancient heroes of the Mediterranean World  Only Hercules surpasses him strength and the great Odysseus in wit  Wolf proud demigod  Willfully doomed glory hunter  The baddest kid in the Valley of Death  Homer s tale of the end of the Heroic Era in Greece still stands out as the classic it s been for centuries  Forget that mockery with Brad Pitt  Let the Poet sing to you of heroes bold battling on the plains of Ilium again  Once again faintly absurd to be rating a book which contains half the plots and characters which have appeared in fiction and cinema ever since  The latest translations are excellent   Fagles translation pays less attention to the meter of Homer than to the passion of the story  I believe this is now the standard by which all other translations will be judged  If it is true that  there is nothing new since the Greeks   this must include literature as well  Reading Homer is a must endeavor as the starting point of literary criticism  However  I would suggest a reading of  Bullfinch s Mythology  first for anyone not familiar with the story of Troy  The most surprising thing about the Iliad is the very small time frame that it covers  about a month toward the very end of the Trojan War   You do not experience Paris escaping with Helen since it begins in the 10th year of the war  Then it ends with the death of Hector when seemingly even the idea of the Trojan horse has not yet been thought through  Even so  this is an amazing work of literature  and or oration   It is bloody and raw but the gods are hilarious  Hector my poor baby    This book is a treasure  The most bad ass  awesome thing you could read  To read anything that is thousands of years old would be exciting  but to find that it is filled with  and concerned with the same spectrum of humanity as you would find in a contemporary book is amazing  There are few characters in the history of man as cool as Hector  tamer of horses   One of the best translations of this wonderful epic poem  This translation was recommended to us by Wesley Callahan who does a homeschool Great Books video lecture course  My son and I read this selection for his homeschool curriculum  Roman Roads Media   Old Western Culture   The Greeks   A definite must read for any high school literature course  Durante el tiempo que ha existido la obra en su lengua original y el siglo pasado se han intentado hacer traducciones al espanol de esta magnifica obra  Pocas  sin embargo  han tenido el impacto cultural que tuvo y tiene la traduccion fiel de Luis Segala y Estalella La obra en si es digna de recordarse  pues narra la historia epica de los sucesos que llevaron a la caida de Troya asi como detalles que ninguna cinta podria capturar con la minuciosidad de Homero  I had read  The Odyssey  and thought it was okay  but not my cup of tea   The Illiad   however  held my attention and I really liked it  I liked the war  the story  the blood  I remember reading it and being disgusted by the violence  yet loving every second of it  The description was so vivid  I could imagine being in the war  I remember well the spears though bellies  the carts beheading the warriors  If you like dirty  gritty history  this book is for you  This is among the first books I ever bought  Yes I don t think I owned a book until I was almost nineteen  And it was a good one  Homer of course is the author of two great pieces of world literature  the Iliad is one of them  This is a book that requires perspective and patience at times  There are hundreds of characters  many battles  plots by Gods and men  and heart wrenching moments  Its not for nothing that generations have considered this book so highly   Reread the Iliad for a discussion group  after a 30 year hiatus  Still mightily impressed by the power and force of it  Some think it glorifies war    not in the least  One of the discussants came without having read the book  but seen the movie Troy  The movie wasn t all that bad  but it had a bigger canvas  and lots of material from outside the Iliad  It also did glorify Achilles  more than showing how out of control he became once unleashed   I ve read this twice   Three times if you count the adaptation in a Giant Sized Special Issue of Thor comics  What  You don t  Oh  Okay  That s fair   It s great  You root for both sides and want both sides to lose too  The description of death  the cost of war is always so vivid and upsetting  I didn t read this particular translation though and I m ever confused that the end of the war is not told here  The whole Trojan horse thing  not in this book  Weird  huh  V perevode Gnedicha  I tol ko tak   Los griegos lo inventaron todo   dice el dicho en cuanto a la literatura  Y es cierto La Iliada para algunos puede ser tediosa con su referencia a los dioses que desconocen  los dioses intervienen casi de modo molesto en todas las acciones humanas  balanceando las cosas  Los humanos luchan simplemente  Y las inconsistencias  bueno  solo le dan un toque extra a la trama Es maravillosa si se comprende  Fucking Achilles  man  Erm   I am not sure how I am supposed to review this  It s Homer after all  It is like trying to review gold   Uh  gold is great because it is gold    I will say that I love this story just for the story  Regardless of all fame and connotations that coincide with this epic  there is just something that gets me about Hector every time  It is a great story  It is a great many things  but its simple story is what I appreciate about it   Kay  I m done  Hey this one is destined to be a classic  You heard it here first  The Fagles translation is very readable  This is one of the basic books  It intertwines fate and human failings  heroism and petty jealousy  Achilles is dislikable and a hero that towers over the story  Hector is much more likable as he meets his destiny at the hands of the merciless Achilles  The Greeks are heroic but aggressors nonetheless  This book is different every time you read it  My favorite book of all time  Lady  these many things beset my mind no less than yours  But I should die of shame before our Trojan men and noblewomen if like a coward I avoided battle  nor am I moved to  Long ago I learned how to be brave  how to go forward always and contend for honor  Father s and mine  Honor   for in my heart and soul I know a day will come when ancient Ilion falls  when Priam and the folk of Priam shall perish  Book VI Perhaps my favorite book  Fagle made the translation for our times  Electrifying  awe inspiring  beautiful  Maybe it seems relevant because the translation was done for our mind set  maybe it s for the ages  time will tell  of course  At times fatiguing  as endless bloodshed must be  it was also endlessly intriguing  thought provoking  gorgeous  touching and just plain wonderful  This translation is a gift to English speakers or readers everywhere  I love Greek myth and my only real beef with The Iliad is that at certain points the narrative seems to be bogged down with long lists of names  It may not be fair to compare The Iliad with modern day expectations  but it does make you appreciate what I consider the more focused story of The Odyssey If I could change one thing about the Iliad it would be the long discourses that secondary characters have  sometimes even while on the battlefield  I love this classic epic  every time I pick it up  I get downright sentimental and cheesy  and I often skip ahead and read the scene where Hector is killed by Achilles  who mourns the death of his beloved Patroclus This story is called a classic for a reason  It has a great  exciting story  It can be read over and over again  with new insight gained each time  The way in which it is written makes the reader really think about placement and symbolism  Mostly a  who killed whom  account of the Trojan war  Fortune and success in battle is granted mostly by the favor of the gods  They are very much an active part of the battle  granting super powers  saving their favorite warriors  and sons   and trying to counter the other gods that may be interfering  Great way to get a handle on the behavior of the Greek gods  as well as to get some vague idea of what life would have been like in ancient Greece  unbeatable I was surprised there are so few reviews for this work  one of the earliest pieces of literature and such an influence on so many great writers  but now I realise this is a somewhat outdated translation  Even so  the characters spring alive down the centuries  The extended metaphorical passages for which Homer is famous are truly wonderful  Now I need to read some more of the available translations    if only I d learned ancient greek     First of all  a sincere thanks to my more scholarly friends who recommended the Fagles translation  The text is relentless  violent  tender  cinematic  and in many ways  pure  It is extremely readable  And I approached this epic as an innocent  outside the realm of high school or college teacher biases  reliant only on Knox s excellent introduction and very clear explanatory notes  I was in good hands from the opening lines to the last  poetry   nobility   gruesome battles and sneaky goddesses and That Telemonian Aias you know  this book is by far my favourite I have ever read originally for schoolular activities and recommend it to anyone who can read languages  I m also super glad I read this  after  Paradise Lost because Homer makes way more sense than pan lingual Milton alright  10 10 as far as morals go in this century  not that we know the year of course but  Just starting this book but I m already hooked  I willingly admit that I m new to literature  I was the typical American  unfair statement  but the research seems to back me up   With so many cultural references  the flow of this epic poem creates such images  I hate when I have to close this book and move on  I m seriously considering boxing up my TV so my son does not have the same temptations to the boob tube that I had as a child   Really enjoy this translation of the classic   I ve read this in so many editions  including greek  Undoubtedly one of the formative books of my life  The Lombardo version is best for reading aloud  Simone Weil s Illiad a Poem of Force is also a must read  Also  Achilles in Vietnam to understand the impact of combat on soldiers  5 stars for the Iliad itself  which I hope to read one day in the original 4 stars for the Fagles verse ish translation  read in 2005   modern and well informed 4 stars for the Butler prose translation  read in 2015   old fashioned but nobler in style I ve also read bits of other translations  including Barry Powell  with a nice introduction  and Rodney Merrill  who tried to reproduce Homer s dactylic hexameters   A wonderful entrance into classical literature  More than enough action to hold one s interest  all while providing a wonderful view into the lives of war goers from long lost era s of humanity  I don t remember which translation I had to read in my Ancient Greek class  probably Lattimore  We also translated huge stretches of it ourselves  The original Greek has a beauty of its own  if you re able to read even a few passages  Truly one of the best pieces of literature every written  There s action packed gore  tender family scenes  and achingly beautiful examinations of civilizations at war  Hector Andromache OTP  Along with Shakespeare and Dante  Homer is another guy who paints an unflinching portrait of human beings and the beastly urges that drive them  Sure  it s plodding in parts  but it s still magnificent  This is still the story I think about whenever Pantera pops up on the iPod  The Lattimore translation is awesome  and I also found  A Companion to The Iliad  by Malcolm Willcock immensly helpful during my reading   This is yet another of my favorite high school reads  I would get lost in the epic story first written so many centuries ago  The tale of battles fought  subterfuge  jealousies  scheming  flawed anger were all food for thought  I would spend hours thinking of the ancient battles of Troy  Illia   my imagination filled with images of scaling the walls  I think this book first got me learning about arms and armor   Mirip dengan Odyssey  meski sebelumnya sering dengar karena seringnya dikutip penulis lain  pertama kali saya membaca buku ini adalah versi translasi Bahasa Indonesi yang kacau yang memaksa saya untuk membandingkan dengan teks asli Penilaian saya sama persis dengan Odyssey  meski saya lebih antusias membaca ini karena banyak adegan perang  tapi ini buku wajib ain untuk pecinta mitos dan penggemar petualangan  Besides being a lovely and skillfully executed narrative of war and betrayal featuring much swift and keen swordplay  Homer here chronicles by allusion the historical transition of that exact instant the earlier universal gods were subsumed and divided into the Classical Greek pantheon that we are all so familiar with   and the ending   I hate to spoil The final lesson of a warrior is to cherish mercy  This was the first book that really carried a lot weight for me  Delving into human emotion and violence of warfare  the Iliad is a gritty epic that gives readers a deep insight into ancient Greek culture  Though characters such as Achilles and Agamemnon are portrayed as types rather than actual people  the emotions exposed and dealt with in the epic are as pertinent today as they were thousands of years ago  The first time I tried reading this I stopped because it seemed so bizarre  Then for some reason I can t remember  I made myself start again  and with a bit of effort became enthralled with this unique story  So different from your usual book   epic from beginning to end  If you can get over the whole  introduce your lineage back 10 generations every time you meet someone  thing  then I d recommend reading this  Some will scoff that this not a translation but a re imagining  I say that it brings the story alive and will make today s readers  young and old  understand why this story has stood the test of time  I cried as I read  which did not happen with the original text  as much as I enjoyed it  my 11th grade English teacher knew how to teach the original   Still  I d use this if I were teaching high school English  Read this in high school  back when dirt was a feasibility study  and while I was fascinated by the myths  I don t think I really appreciated it then  I recently taught a Humanities course that used a section of the text  the struggle between Achilles and Agamemnon  and I reread the whole thing again  I am struck by the very human nature of the struggles in this epic  and the way they can still resonate today   How could I give this less than 5 stars  It s worth a read  or at least a good skim  just for the historical value  You ll see the beginning of millenia of heroic literature contained in this volume  It s an exercise in reading for the sake of understanding  not for the sake of thrills  This is the original  long book  and might be a challenge for anyone to stick with to the end  But give it a go   Just finished The Illiad  I was under the impression there would be the famed Trojan Horse somewhere within those pages  I was wrong  apparently  As a whole  though  quite enjoyable  I stand by my original thought as I began reading it  however  The gods are dicks Edit  Now I know my error  The Trojan horse is in The Aeneid  Guess I need to read that one before I can comfortably move on to The Odyssey  Yes  it s a prose version  While that fact alone is certain to infuriate purists  I ll mention that it s a  lively  prose version    lively enough to keep my interest and to whet my appetite for classical literature while I was still a squirrely  surly  high school kid Any man who s ever struggled with pride or  anger management  problems  or been screwed over by a superior  should read this one  I ve tried to read other versions but the poetic translation by Fagles is the only one I ve been able to read all the way to the finish  I couldn t put it down  To quote Bernard Knox in his introduction  the Iliad remains a terrifying poem  And this version must retain the stark beauty  violence and terror of the original which is inaccessible to the likes of me  I d give it more stars if I could  I actually read a different translation than this  I read the Penguin Classics translated into prose by Martin Hammond  I would have liked one in verse  but regardless Homer s great story well deserves its reputation as a literary masterpiece  I d feel too silly to write a full review when there are brighter minds than mine that have built their careers around it  but it is a great and wonderful book  Goodreads has lumped my three editions together  annoyingly  Fitzgerald s Oxford World Classics edition is a good verse translation  but I prefer Hammond s prose translation  far closer to the original Greek in terms of content  Penguin Classics   Rieu s version  also Penguin Classics  has a number of irritating translations and  though not without merit  should be passed over in favour of Hammond  This was   well  duh  I m actually glad it had been on my list of  great books I should have read by now  for so long because I feel so lucky to have encountered it first as an audiobook  If you can t hear Homer himself  Derek Jacobi s a damn good runner up Next in my audible queue  The Odyssey  Yes  I ve read that one before  even taught it once a million years ago  but now I want to hear it  The Iliad is definitely one of the most complex and graphic books I have ever read  It has a very diverse set of characters with specific plot twists that change the over all tone of the book  I am in love with Greek mythology and The Iliad is perfect for people who read books like  The lightning thief      Only it s a thousand times better  An amazing piece of literature  I would recommend it to anyone  I have to admit to not knowing anything about this story and didn t realize there was so much blood and guts  A blow by blow account of the war against the Trojans  But also about the personal relationships of the characters and the tragedy of war  I thought the language was amazing  Listened to all 13 DVDs in the car on my way back and forth to Richmond   about 4 hours each way  Loved it   Wonderful  Before starting the book i attended a modern retelling of the Iliad at The Undermain Theater in Dallas  I also listened to Elizabeth Vandiver s excellent series through The Great Courses  Having seen several ancient works of art that reference scenes from the Iliad and Trojan War heightened my enjoyment of the book and an appreciation of its influence on western civilization  A timeless classic  but because the story so so well known  I enjoyed it a lot more when I read it as a kid   The Iliad is a classic epic that will never get old  I try to read this epic at least once a year  It s a classic that everyone should read at least once in their lives  Not really the story of the Trojan War but the story of Achilles  anger  his Achilles heel  which is the story petitioned of the muse  Written from the muses   omniscient  POV where the Myrmidons and other mortals  war looks ant like  The story begins with Achilles anger resulting from hurt pride and ego and ends with his empathy towards Priam s mourning of his lost son  Hector   HEKTOOOOOR  This epic poem is pure genius  The detail is magnificent  if somewhat unnecessarily gory  and is positively glorious  It is heavy reading  so being tired will not help and you willfind yourself reading the samepage over again six times before you grasp what is being said  This poem needs to be read before the other half of the set  The Odyssey of Homer  I read this one over and over  Somehow I missed reading this in college and only just got around to it  Not exactly what I was expecting  First  it s not about the abduction of Helen  And it s not about the Trojan horse and it s not about the fall of Troy  It s about the fates of two heroes  the one who refuses to fight  and the other who literally runs and hides from the first serious combat he faces   Great translation  Reads very well  almost as if the late Bronze Age were still with us  Loved the long Homeric similes  Humane in many ways  if you can say a story with so much testosterone poisoned battle is  humane   Achilles is far from a model of admirable behavior  even for Homer writing almost 3000 years ago  but I guess that was Homer s point  one of his points  that is   Classic from Greek Literature doesnt disappoint  Essential reading  The Illiad in many ways is the key to unlocking European pyschology  religion and even politics  On par with Book of Kings  and biblical writings on warfare  This blood stained graphic book inspired writers for millennium from the ancients to Shakespeare and beyond  An ideal place to start reading Greek literature  Fitzgerald s translation is the best  in my eyes  but I don t want to pretend as if I m an expert on Greek translation  Anyway  this is required reading for Western Civilization that actually deserves to be required reading and is great fun as well  I hate when people characterize books like The Illiad as dusty and unimportant   this book is as timely today as it was centuries back  An epic tale  I personally think that Diomedes  The man who rode a chariot with Athena to spear the God of War through the belly  deserves more recogntion than he recieves  as names the of Hector  Oddyseus  Menelaus and Ajax are much more reknowned despite performing lesser acts of valor  A great read for Greek Myth afficionado s  has definitely encourage me to read  The Odyssey   Awesomeness  Except for the part where all the ships of the Agaeans are listed alongside their captains    And the ridiculously detailed battle sequences  Anyone going into this book  it is much better if you do not read in your values   oh he is a mass murdered  that evil bastard    since the sense of morality of the ancient world was quite different from the values of today  The best epic poem  Another one of my favorite books  Again  a translation  from ancient Greek nonetheless   however this Epic is truly just that  Epic  Don t think of the movie Troy when considering this as your next read  The ancient Greek gods comprise many of the main characters  Almost a historical fantasy  all the more profound given that it s based on factual historical events  Finally checked this one off the list  I first attempted to read the Samuel Butler prose translation of the Iliad but lost momentum three books in  The Fagles verse translation is thoroughly engaging and full of life  which made reading this far less of a challenge than I had anticipated  I m excited to move right on to his translation of the Odyssey and then the Aeneid  March 2005I ve been reading the Iliad  in a brief break from Proust  I ve been teachingArie about the Greek Pantheon  Polytheism is so much cooler than monotheism  I also have been telling her biblical stories too    usually after a good glass of wine    maybe she will grow up to study comparative mythology  She loves old myths and heroic tales  well  what child doesn t  This is a great translation of this classic poem  Instead of translating the Greek into an epic poetry meter  it reads more like a novel  which is great if  like me  the poem itself was difficult to get through  The original language style is retained  giving you a feel for what the ancient Greek poem must have been like  An easy to undertstand adaptation of a great story  This lush  gorgeous book gives a very readable translation of Homer s 2 700 year old Epic  There is grand passion  war  love  drama and a spellbinding story in this sumptuous classic  Helen launches a thousand ships  Hector and Achilles battle in the Trojan War while Zeus  Aphrodite  and Apollo aid their favorites  I am so very pleased with this excellent translation   This book s legacy speaks for itself  A cornerstone of the classical Greek ethos and one of the greatest stories ever told  I read the Robert Fagles translation 4 years ago and I thought I d read Chapman s version  I liked it  but I definitely preferred the modern translation  I don t have any trouble reading Elizabethan literature  it was just that the modern translation was more stark and  classical   I m reading Fagles translation of the Aeneid now so I ll have to see how they compare  Even better than I hoped  with little resemblance to that Brad Pitt movie  Troy   Two wars are simultaneous  Greeks and Trojans battle on earth while the gods choose up sides in Mount Olympus to do battle too  The translation is fascinating  I actually listened to this book  as performed by Derek Jacobi  Can t wait to get The Odyssey from the audio library next  Started mid September  left Seattle for a month  reading it on the long drives     finally finished on my first full day back in Seattle   PS  The Iliad is so rad and fucking intense   PPS  Now I m going to go directly back and reread  Simone Weil s  War and the Iliad  which is what made me want to read this so much in the first place   It s looooong and involved  But bloody and historical and amazing in its examination of humanity  Plus  it s the first piece of western literature to be written down  and  depending on the translation  begins with the word  rage  which I think is incredible  No wonder nations have warred for centuries  And yes  I read the whole thing  It s fascinating  I first had to read from the Iliad in 9th grade  which was surely the height of folly  Of course a bunch of 14 year olds can t grasp the epic poem about war  Lost at that age is both the beauty and tragedy in the work  I am fortunate that college sent it my way again and I had a professor who was able to convey just what it was we had the pleasure of reading  Awesome book  The Iliad tells a story of war from many different perspectives  Hector gets caught up in the pursuit of glory  which ends up being his demise  Achilles is overtaken and transformed by his rage  We also see the war through the eyes of Hector s father  mother  and wife  I ve read this book 3 or 4 times now  and I suggest that everyone reads it   I was fascinated how the Iliad captures the cultural ideals of the Hellenistic world of 700 bc  In his translation  Robert Fagles kept the narrative coherent to a 21st century reader  while preserving its poetic nature  I found the ending satisfying  Being as this is a war story  it is important to know that it is very graphic  but I would call it a  must read   StoicIt s a privilege to read such a classic  The romanticism of love and war  brotherhood and peace is brought from within each page  The thrill of battle and the sorrow of death is felt close to heart as the long haired Greeks and fair Trojans clash shield and spear   Translations of ancient texts can be fraught for the casual reader  There is always a fear that the translator will not strike the right balance between clarity and accuracy  What a relief then to read Dr Fagles  beautiful  modern translation of Homer s epic  As both a poet and a scholar  Fagles  brings the text to vivid life  Up there with Chapmans translation  I ve read this three times now  in three different translations  This was by far the most easily accessible version I ve read and it made it a breeze to get through  Imagine that   The Iliad   a breeze  The professor I had who used this text may have had an influence in my love of this book  but really  the first two times I read it  I felt like I struggled  When you are ready for serious reading a must read and surprisingly exciting for an old and I mean 2700 years old bookPoetry  myths and legends  heros  goddesses all those fabulous things in a great story with blockbuster action  strong violence  romance and so many writers use the material the return for reading keeps multiplying the more intelligent books you read Don t know if troy s war s reason was apple of discord  but everyone knows that Troy s war isn t fictional  I think Someone listened to legends and real facts and wrote Iliad from his view and fantasy  but after years passed  his apprentices kept on writing and  Homer  is name of kinda posterity of writers  Everyone has his her  own opinion  so do i  Seems strange to give The Iliad a  star  rating  This was my first read of Lattimore s translation  Given my fledgling knowledge of Homeric Greek  I appreciated his choice of words and phrases in translation  they seemed very close to the actual Greek  I d say this is the translation to read if you want the closest experience to reading the original  A truly exhaustive  and exhausting  book  Around book 22  of 28  I got rather tired of all the people killed and carved up in this very long book  I can t imagine how people could have performed this as an oral performance  it would have taken days The work saves itself in Book 28 I would only suggest this to someone really interested in the Classics  A fantastic story and a fantastic translation  This translation is poetic without forcing a rhyme  I found it to be very readable  This edition does lack an extensive index or footnotes for readers who might be interested in the context of the events that transpire here  I had to rely on secondary sources to best understand what was going on in the book  I understand why many would find this book tiresome  Where the seemingly trivial lineages might make you feel like wading through mud  the teachings of virtue and passion helps the read effortlessly take flight  With smooth transitions between man s dichotomous desires to be of both vice and virtue  it is no wonder why this Homeric work is a classic  I ve been listening to this one in bits and pieces for a while now  not exactly something I can turn on in the car with small children   so I m really glad I finally finished it  It was incredible  though  It s funny  now that it s done  I want to sit down and actually read it  maybe one of the other translations  I have two copies on the shelf already    So wonderful  I may now understand what the fuss is about the missing part of this translation  but still it is so well worth it  If you ve never fallen in love with the Iliad  stop what you are doing and listening to this audio version right now and marvel at the skill of the narrator  translator  and Homer  I remember struggling through this in Literature of Antiquity in High School  especially on the heels of  The Odyssey   Like it s classical twin  a bewildering display of erudition and linguistic dexterity  Five stars for historical relevance and fundamental importance to the understanding of the Western Cannon  Not exactly a page turner  A book that started many trends  Beyond it s time and still one of the more fascinating reads  The classic Hero vs  Hero story where you don t know who to root for  It appeals to any age and you find your own view change as you grow  From teen to old  the story can reach all  Valor  arrogance  bravery  lust    Homer created a masterpiece  I have read the Penguin version of the Iliad and found it slightly dull  I am incredibly Glad that I picked up Stephen Mitchells Translation  as it breathed some life into the story and restored a lot of the passion and emotion  If you are a fan of Ancient greek writing like I am  then this a definite must read as the translation is fantastic  The Greeks will claim that they invented everything  While this would never be published by today s standards  the Greeks at least had nailed the action flick  and mass murder at a very early stage in theatre The Iliad does not disappoint with copious amounts of shit talking and murder  I recommend this to anybody going through puberty  I read it in some form for class  I can t remember the translation  unfortunately  so I just marked the first result for the title  I enjoyed the story and the fact that reading it for class forced me to read it  for some reason I just kept  never getting to it   I m not terribly fond of the way we deconstructed it  but it was a great read  My student   Achilleus wasn t playing a lyre when they approached his ship  That part of the test is wrong  You told us before that he was making stew  Me   No  no  I said Achilleus was sitting on his ship  stewing  Another student   When is our Homeric Assembly due  Me   Your Homeric Simile is due on Tuesday  P S  Read this book  A thrilling  extremely well written legendary tale  full of honor  glory  courage  noble characters  fierce battles  fate  love  cowards  and bloody gore   A veritable ancient Greek soap opera enshrined within the history of the Trojan war  This is one of the most poetic translations of the Iliad  even though it was in prose  The beauty of the poem and the intricacies of the formulaic language of oral poetry are very much present in this rendition of this epic poem  A must read if you want to be mesmerized by something that was written almost three thousand years ago  I am not sure what edition I read  I read the Illiad and the Odyssey for the first time when I was 10  I reread both at age 12 and 14  I have listened to both on audio since then but have not read again  The fact that when I was 12 I wanted to name my first son Zeus Agamemnon should tell you how much I was impressed by the Iliad  If I had my copy of this book  I would quote my favorite part  When Homer describes Poseidon coming from the depths of the sea to fight in the Trojan War  I almost wept  That happens to me  when language and words are so perfect  my eyes sting with tears  This book is currently my favorite one  but that could change any day   One of those canon books you re supposed to read  Never been into Greek mythology or poetry so thought I wouldn t get through this  I LOVED it  This translation really flows and keeps the sense of the poetry of the work  I m also glad I read this on paper rather than my ebook   it let me stay in the flow  Next up   The Odyssey  None of this was new  I d gotten a lot of through GreeK mythology in college and other books on Greek Mythology I d read  Still in it s original  English  it is beautiful and a very special book  This is just one more reason to learn Ancient Greek  which I am in the process of doing  It s taking some time since I rarely work on it  This has so much in it that it is no wonder people are still fascinated by it  You love the heroes  and then recoil only to realize they are also  the other  when compared to modern mores  A modern reader is more likely to identify with the Trojans than the Greeks  Beautiful prose  classic posturing  and heroic posing  Love it  a six month journey for me     I ve never been affected by a work of literature so deeply  and I m a lifelong bibliomaniac     I do love many other writer   poets  but as far as a story   performance sustained over 600 pages  this is The One     soul rattling  tear jerking  mind melting cinematic storytelling at its fucking finest Others have reviewed this in detail  and there is little I can add  Absolutely absorbing  horribly bloody  and incredible to think it was written so long ago  Surely Lattimore has captured the feel of the original   if not  then this will do for me  I can see why this is the enduring translation  I can t recommend it highly enough  Two things I learned from this   Translation is everything  Fagles isn t perfect  but he moves quickly and easily   not too stilted or weird   and he doesn t skimp on the blood and guts   Introduction is awfully important  Bernard Knox is a new hero of mine  this intro is widely and correctly considered a classic piece on Homer  I really  really liked the Iliad  We had like     3 months only for Iliad at school and I was fascinated by the story  Achilles is my favorite character  because he s both cruel and good  He s got something from all sides of the human feelings  I can t say anything else  but that this is a great book  I really enjoyed reading it  Brilliant book  I d love to find out what the story is behind chapter 10 though  as it doesn t seem to be written by Homer or relevant to the story    This is a series of lectures about the Iliad  I bought them on cassette and listened to it them while commuting  Outstanding  Short of taking the full university course  there is no way you can get more out of this  the ultimate classic  I can t recommend it highly enough  Thank you Dr  Vandiver  No seriously  THANK YOU  This book made me want to smite people  brave in the din of battle   The Fagles translation is the most accessible I ve encountered  I made a number of attempts to read this and had found the style to be an impediment but this translation read wonderfully Note to non scholastic readers  feel free to skip the catalogue in Chapter 3 unless you re Greek and are looking for some family history  I was struck by two things  Achilles is a pouty child  and the gods and goddesses are incredibly meddling  Reading this made me love God even more  because He is Truth and Righteousness  unlike Zeus  And men are the same the world over  throughout history But I do appreciate the nobility and sacrifice of heroes   It took me some time to get through the first time but after reading it two more times I think that I have a grip on this great epic  The themes cover the gamut of literary themes in the western tradition  It paints war as both glorious and horrible  It covers the clash of egos  lovers  warriors  tactics  gods  and fates  They don t call it a classic for nothing  The action is non stop  but it s easy to get mired in the endless stream of combatants and back stories  The genius behind the work  however  is undeniable  A good translation is essential and an audio recording does a great deal for the enjoyment of the book  though it slows you down  The best thing I ever read in my life   This is the perfect Epic and lyric  It beautifully captures you inside it and makes you lost in it s beauty   and wonderful depiction of scenes and feelings   and the great ease it moves from micro narratives that flow to form The macronarrative or the Whole coherent and perfect picture  This epic poem was one of the greatest I have read EVER  The realization of Achilles that his wrath was his fatal flaw  as well as the magnificent scene depicting Patroclus  death  funeral  and the games that followed  the tenderness has never been paralleled since  Definitely a friendship that stood the test of time    Just an awesome story  You really get to see how the people and the gods interacted and how their beliefs played into their lives  The verse can be a little hard getting used to and the fight scenes do get a little repetitive after a while  Also skip the section that just lists off all of the people who came to the battle   Timeless masterpiece that should be viewed in its own context and time period  Each time you read this piece of art  you uncover a new layer of understanding of man  The interpretation of theme and narrative call for depth of thought  critical thinking  and patience  After overcoming these things  you may then begin to enjoy the story that unfolds  and appreciate the message that it brings   Loved the story  Excellent characters  Covers all the aspects of man and all the various desires of man  For example  the deadly desire to be a god  The characters who strive to get god like qualities they get come with a fatal flaw that bring an untimely demise or renders them useless  as in Achilles and Cassandra   I started getting an inkling that I was unbearably pretentious when I started reading Homer in junior high  It was an uphill trudge at first  but stuck with it out of pride  Once I got used to the language  I really got pulled in  I ve read the book twice  once on my own  once for school and enjoyed both times  Well  heck  it s one of the Western world s indisputable masterpieces  no  The first half of the epic is  to me  less enjoyable  more likely to sag a bit in the telling  But once Patroklos goes into battle  the story really gets focused and amazing  And some of the language is quite lovely  and sometimes even funny  I began reading this in translation as a child with an interest in Greco Roman mythology  I made it to the catalogue of ships before realizing that this was not what I was looking for  Later readings in both English translation and excerpts in Homeric Greek have shown me that some books are worth the struggle  What can you say about a story that s been told for thousands of years If you ve seen the movie but not read the book  then you ll be astounded to hear that Homer s tale of the warring Greeks and Trojons was not good enough for Holywood  so they changed it   Unfortunately the change was not for the better            I was actually astounded by just how beautiful this translation came across  Detailed and graphic  even the descriptions of animal sacrifice and feast preparation were poetically conveyed in such a way that the reader could only appreciate having read  or in my case  heard  the graceful diction and structure   What can I say about the Iliad  the fountainhead of Western literature  The story may not be quite as engaging as Homer s Odyssey  but in many respects the Iliad is superior  in terms of narrative structure  imagery  and poetics  in translation of course   Give it a try if you haven t    or if it s been awhile  There isn t enough hubris in the whole wide world for me to rate  The Iliad  less than 5 stars  Would have been a bit funny  eh  Audio book is also terrific and brought the story alive for me in a new  and fresh  way  Too bad Homer didn t think to tell this story orally instead of writing it all down    This translation is simply magnificent  There is a fine and enchanting line between poetry and prose  and Verity manages to convey the best possible use of the unseen rhyme and rhythm of the modern English text    not an easy read for those who prefer somewhat more traditional poetry  but so worth it  How can a book that survived 2 700 years deserve anything less than 5 stars  I love history  and this was the ultimate historical drama  The scandals  manipulation  broken promises  and seduction make this book so fascinating  An intricate plot with plenty of strong characters and motives   Quelqu un qui n  a pas lu l Iliade ne sait rien du sacrifice  rien des souffrances de la guerre  ni du devoir    Lire ce texte en se disant qu il date du huitieme siecle avant notre ere et y retrouver des themes qui sont toujours d  actualites est a la fois fascinant et desesperant   A lire absolument  Awesome book on the relationship between the Greek Gods  Demi Gods and mortals in the Trojan world  Skip  Troy   poor POOOOOR adaptation of this Homeric epic   and READ this   this is a 5 star classic  If so much depth can be revealed in something so secular  so much more can the Holy Scripture reveal    Translator s PrefaceIntroductionThe Spelling and Pronunciation of Homeric NamesMaps  The IliadThe Genealogy of the Royal House of TroyTextual Variants from the Oxford Classical TextNotes on the TranslationSuggestions for Further ReadingPronouncing Glossary I need to update this review  I had read it at a very young age  around 14  and I didn t like it that much back then  Recently I got my hands on it again  and  I ll be damned  I hadn t been this caught up by a book in years  The saddest part  it s over  and the author died millenia ago  Curses  A story that s lasted this long must be great and it is  No two characters are killed the same way and the poetry is awesome  I know everyone reads Fagles these days  but I ve got an old Fitzgerald that s stood me in good stead for a long time  check out both translations if you re a true fan  This is my third time through the Iliad  If there is such a thing as a canon of literature  then this has to be the book of Genesis  Western Literature  in the best sense  begins here and subsequently only occasionally equals or surpasses the high bar set by Homer First read October 2008  I loved this book  The only thing I did not like about it was the names and how many names there were to remember  I just remembered people by calling them fierce knight dude or person that Athena favors  Other than this the Iliad was very interesting and helped fill in the gaps from the Odyssey  I ve read this work three times  There is something about the treatment  the language  that gives me a taste of the war  It doesn t feel like an ancient battle  I know these people  I recognize them  They re like me  Only I have to remind myself that this happened a long time ago   Bearing in mind this is the first large written work in the whole western cannon  it s a work of unparalleled genius  But it s deeply flawed by today s standards  Know that going in and appreciate it and you will be rewarded with a fascinatingly different outlook on life than we have today  The problem with epic texts is they can be so difficult for the casual reader  what Fagles does is deliver an eminently readable and faithful translation consistant with modern literature  This is the text that would be my recommendation for anyone looking to explore or re visit this great classic  I read this book about 5 years ago and the epic tale of battle really stands the test of time  I loved the way the gods and mortals alike suffer from ego conflicts  The imagery and action make this book a definite page turner  Recommended for all readers who love lots of action and excitement  Lombardo lives in my hometown  He s a great guy I like this translation and how it says things like   Get your ragged asses over here  I took this one to Brazil and read it aloud to some monkeys that lived in a tree outside my house  i don t know if they liked it as much as I did  When my daughters were young I commenced to read the Iliad to them  About in the midst of Ajax s first fight with Hector one of my daughters noted to me   Dad  this is a boy story   I thought for a minute  Then put it down and picked up the Odyssey  It was much better received   I looked at this book originally as a challenge  with it s long winding passages it would be easy to get lost and not even register what was going on in the plot  Once you get used to it  the language and style Homer uses actually adds to the story and puts you in the time period  The Fagles translation of Homer s epic is by far the best English rendering of the Greek available   it s faithful to the cadence of the verse  while capturing the spirit of Homer s slang  If you re going to undertake the task of reading this mammoth poem  this is the translation to read  The grief in this book is so timeless simply because it is so real  I read it right after my brother died and no work of literature has ever moved me so much  To me it wasn t a bunch of armies and fighting  but real people torn to shreds by the loss of someone they loved so much  This is one of the finest translations of  The Iliad  I have read thus far   I have read 13 to date It is easier than most to read  without the disadvantage of rhyming  The forward and notes help make this book a memorable experience   one that you will want to read over and again   After having read the Aaeneid in Latin class  and bits and peices of the Iliad  in kids books and literature classes  and after having really enjoyed Mary Lefkowitz s Greek Gods Human Lives  I am really enjoying the Iliad  Plus  with my commute  I have plenty of time to enjoy it  I was moved to read this after the September 11 attacks  because it seemed to me the original book on war  This particular translation by Stanley Lombardo is excellent  Very modern  Brutal  Energetic  Ares Incarnate  But the lesson is so subtle  that I ve forgotten it  Should re read   I ve always liked The Iliad more than The Odyssey for some reason  and I adore Fagles  translation  which I think is just the right compromise between a poetic and a literal translation   I read Pope s translation at a leisurely pace  Great read  Reminds me of the Old Testament  Homer wasn t adverse to making it clear that war is futile  bloody  not honourable      And yet the heroes are brave when they are not sulking  A true classic worth reading many times  I was first familiar with The Odyssey  read and loved that as a kid   but I fell in love with Homer through The Iliad  Some parts are forgettable  when he starts listing their competitions and all the random prizes that people won  I zone out  but ignore that  Enjoy the prose   The version I read is the one translated by Stanley Lombardo and sadly that edition is not listed on this site  however  I highly recommend that if you read this story that you read his translation as it is pure beauty depicted within the horrors of war  grief and destruction  A powerful Epic and the magnus opum of Homer  The Iliad is a great read that keeps you engaged constantly  You ll fall in love with the Trojan prince Hector as he leads the Trojans on a counter attack against the Greek forces abandoned by their greatest warrior  Achilles  This book is a champion in the long list of books I have conquered  It is ingeniously composed and the verses flow together excellently  I provides excellent insight into the world as the Greeks saw it  Full of culture  heroics  and deeper meanings  this book deserves its fame   Really entertaining but also can get a little boring and confusing  All the Greek names in this book are difficult to pronounce  This book is for the more experienced readers  i highly recommend this book to anyone  Tells a great hero story and a downfall of a great city  An eminently readable translation brings the appalling gore  risible gods  tragic heroes and wondrous poetry to life  A great way to reacquaint  or acquaint  yourself with one of the world s great works of literature  My reading partners via readingodyssey org help a lot too  Fantastic translation  I read this with friends during the month GW Bush declared war on Iraq  Amazing how the daily newspapers and the storyline in the Iliad were exactly the same Five thousand years  and the human race has learned nothing about the futility of war  The Iliad is a very educational book about history and Gods  I love the book and the movie  Fantastic translation  You know when people use the slang term  epic  to describe something totally awesome  awe inspiring  and explosive in content  It started with The Iliad  Homer was talking about Diomedes  aristeia and the dudes around him were like     dude     thats fucking epic   RadiciPost Scriptum 1  Leggere l Iliade e come leggere l inizio di tutto  E  come l infinito e mai saziabile racconto intorno al fuoco  con le materie prime del mondo e dell umano sentire  Una storia mitologica  una storia di dei  una storia di eroi e perdenti  The best possible initiation to greek mythology Grand story telling which inspired tales   folklore around the world  Does not lose its charm ever Alexander conquered half the known world with the Illiad as his constant companion   Achilles as his inspiration  This is one of my favorites  and I throughly loved this particular translation  Achilles  Patroclus  Odysseus  and the two Ajax s make the most memorable heroes  I love the way the gods are at war with their favorites   this is a must read for any and everyone  Bellissima traduzione  che rende avvincente un testo che spesso ci capita tra i piedi   e che vorremmo calciare il piu lontano possibile  L obbligo della lettura non sempre fa bene    ai legendi  Lo consiglio a chi deve affontare Omero e non ne ha molta voglia  Easily the thoedest epic I ve read in a good long while  Enjoyed this version for its fluid linguistics and OG Greek proper name spellings In general the story is hecka bomb  tho the chapters about the ships and shield are a bit unwieldy  Totes recommended This is one of the best books of all time  come on  Alexander the Great carried it with him for his 11 year campaign to conquer the known world  while I don t carry it with me on campaigns I still consider it one of my favorite books  It s best read to song  Only the Norse and Celtic appear to have such a strong sense of fate  but the Greeks are much more wanton in pursuit of it  Thank heavens for the Odyssey or the Iliad would leave us with very little meaning other than a healthy disgust for man s infatuation with war  I read the Fagles  and it was utterly irresistible  I ended up reading almost half of the book aloud  unable to stop myself  I d like to read the Lattimore translation and or confer with the Greek  but the Fagles is definitely the way to go for the first time reader   This translation is undoubtedly the best  I read this while teaching Theatre History at Montgomery College because it was a necessary text to have in my mind and spirit if we were to tackle the great playwrights  Thank goodness this translation arrived when it did  Thank Heaven for Freshman Literature and being required to read The Illiad  I loved  loved  loved this and will forever remember Hektor  Breaker of Horses  What can be said that hasn t already  Great war story  excellent modern translation by Robert Fagles  and eminently readable  I think my favorite character was Diomedes  who was clearly insane when he went and attacked the gods  Brute rage is always fun  Not going to review this classic  In short It was epic and I loved it for the 2nd time  It is not going anywhere and you should take the time to find a translation you like and give a it a chance  There is a reason it has been told since 762 B C   It is a great epic   In The Iliad  homer manages to have unity of action but not unity of characters  we see different characters show their strength Hector Diomedes and others The Iliad is an epis that talks about wars and the heroic deeds of the warriors  Its just awe smelling the air of a time passed for 3000 Jears  something like a beginning in Human History to write Stories  Its great to reflect about that Achill is still remembered today  like foretold 3000 Jears ago from a man obscured by history  Ive read a few translations of the Iliad and have to say that Lattimore s is by far my favourite  the poetry he uses to tell the story is absolutely beautiful  and if I were to highlight my favourite passages then at least 80  of the book would be coloured  My favourite tale that I never get tired of hearing  The epic battle of Troy is one that has stirred the imagination of generations with the images of Golden Achilles  The Beautiful Helen and the other characters and heroe s of Homer s timeless tale   Such the fabulous tale  I ve read it several times  Great piece to study as well  it is extraordinarily involved and interesting  not to mention quite funny at times  amidst all of the action and emotion Read it Oh and P S  Achilles was a ginger  yes   I am told that this version best reflects the Greek sound of the Iliad  and it has a certain elegance once you get used to the awkward sentence structures which may have been needed to make the poem scan  This was where I first encountered Homer  Not a light read  Recommend that you read this one more than once  Take it all in the first time  It s poetry so the first read is about the rhythm  During later reads  you will be rewarded for your effort by actually feeling the action  Amazing   I ve read this about 3 times and it remains to be one of my favorite pieces of Literature  I want to read it again this year so I can give a more fresh and in depth review because a book like this demands to be processed fully  Great read   The second chapter is a bit of a struggle  but make it past that and it s fantastic  What strikes me the most is that people always say how violent culture has become today with movies and video games  Clearly they have not read the Illiad   I studied this at college for my classics AS and absolutely loved it  the prose  the characters are all fantastic not to mention the story  I think there is so much in this epic that can be explored and enjoyed and more people should read it  Everyone loves it and I do too  What an exhilarating epic poem  I rather enjoy the adventure and creative wit of Homer or whomever Homer was  While this reads as a hearty novel it carries the wordy tendrils of the poem that it is  Love love love   With a good glossary and lots of patience  I ve managed 2 3 of the Iliad and now I m moving on  I read this in high school and again in college and forgot how the Achaians and Trojans can feel love and hate so intensely  What a fantastical tale  Fitzgerald s translation exceeds the original Ancient Greek where word placement isn t mandated  Instead  his Romantic bent has fun with the language with an eye towards description and humor lost in most high school forced  tweed coated editions  Hands down one of history s greatest works of literature  It s amazing that a spoken word poem first composed more than 700 yrs B C  can still have so many parallels in modern life  and can still offer so much insight into the human condition  Re read this over the late summer and fall as necessary preparation for SONG OF ACHILLES  college nostalgia requires me to rank the Fitzgerald translation first in my affection  but this was a fine second  The poem itself is simply amazing  yn

understanding of honor    It s all there  and just downright compelling  Always a favorite read  I just love Hektor  Everytime I read the book I love the character more  I feel pity and sympathy for Achilles and his need to be remembered throughout history  I m not sure I would have made the same decision   I ve always read pieces and bits of the Iliad  but now it was the first time I read it through  A very beautiful albeit a very sad tale of love  betrayal  honour and pride above all  If you only read two Illiads or Odysseys  read the Robert Fagles translation for the power and poetry  and read Stanley Lombardo for bringing it back to the people  Two great and completely different  yet equally relevant  versions  I read this a few months ago in class it s a great book  Richmond Lattimores translation really captures the style of Greek literature as always  If you enjoy this epic I would reccomend the Odyssey as a book for you to later explore  GDb akhyl mrtyn fdrt lmlHm  klh

translation is fantastic  This story is still as vibrant and thrilling today as it was in ancient Greece And if you think video games are violent  trust me  they don t hold a candle to The Iliad  This was a required text for a Greek mythology class I took at Wayne State University  I was so enthralled by it that I was tempted to write a rock opera about the Trojan War   good thing I didn t as it would have been horrible      Monumental story of human conflict  I remember that the college teacher who introduced me to the full version  I had read an abridged version in high school  told me that this work would take on more meaning as I got older  It s true  When Homer wrote this epic in 8th century BC   i bet he had no idea that he had crafted a legend that would weave itself till time immemorial through the lives of the people   even in the 21st century  Truly   a class of its own    The author who led the foundation of literaturegreat epic which tells the story of great warriors who fought for pride dignity patriotism and Homer has shown his mastery by reflecting the emotions through which these warriors go through Para mi la Iliada es un tebeo  Un tebeo de superheroes griegos  pero uno de esos tebeos divertidos con los que pasas las tardes de domingo cuando tienes 7 anos  Y despues Homero lo hace una de las mejores experiencias lectoras de mi vida  This is the best translation of this book   complete with maps and a fantastic glossary  For anyone who thinks ancient Greek lit is boring   read this book  It s a fantastic  gorey  epic war novel   It s super exciting  I promise  It doesn t get much better than Homer s Iliad  Achilles was right  Agamemnon was a jerk  Rage is a bitter pill for everyone to swallow  Lombardo s translation wasn t my favorite  so far it s still Fagles   but I enjoyed it well enough  Essential reading to say the least  And Lattimore is the Holy Grail translation   staying faithful to the original Greek while maintaining readability  Fitzgerald favors readability way more than he should   Read it now  An incredible accomplishment and one of the greatest stories of all time  An incredible book  It s a classic for a reason and is one of the original stories of heroes and gods  I would say that you re education in literature is not complete until you ve read this  or maybe it hasn t really begun   The Iliad is proof of the vividness of the human spirit It s only unfortunate that the fundamental text of Western Society had to be a war story  glorifying some of the most repulsive elements of the human experience    Oh my good gracious   THIS should be the edition schoolchildren are forced to read  Amazing  glorious  beautiful   I want to start again  Luckily I have his translations of the Odyssey and the Aeneid waiting on the shelf   I know understand why its called a poem  And while it was a whole lotta lists and descriptions of deaths  its truly impressive when you think about it having been written so very long ago  Also  the ending was abrupt  no  Although I had to read this for a class  it was a very interesting read  I m very glad they made the movie Troy by now  because watching that movie first definitely helped me keep up with the characters  lol But loved it   I gave this three stars when I read it first  ten months ago  Reading it again  after some background reading and Teaching Company lectures  and while taking an on line course on Greek Heroes  I am enjoying it tremendously  An excellent classic that is quite easily accessible even to the modern reader  in a good edition  with annotations and notes of course     Possibly the best use of similes in fiction  even if they are laden on quite thick   A true classic  It reveals something new on each reading  Finished the Cowper translation last month during my Goodreads hiatus  I think blank verse is the best medium for translating epic poetry  Rhyming translations feel contrived  Prose doesn t seem to have enough  gravitas   In my opinion  the best epic poem and  for lack of a better term  the manliest classic out there  Rich in lyrical prose  action and suspense  and all centered around a basic lesson that a little common sense goes a long way  I read The Iliad for one of my classics courses in college  A must read for anyone wanting to obtain insight into where so many of our Western archetypes descend from  not to mention eminently enjoyable in its own right   Well deserves its place in the Western Canon  The introduction of epic style  elucidation of arete  and subsequent influence on Western thought and literature make this a true classic  And I much prefer the Fagles translation  The best translation around of this great work  Wonderful  rewarding  enriching  Should be read by anyone interested in literature  as this is where it all began for the West  And still nearly 3 000 years on  Homer has few peers  Fagles is the pre emirate translator of ancient classic works  Reading this classic because I wanted to   I knew there must be more than being forced to read for school   was truly an adventure of epic proportions  This is epic proem is dearest to my heart  If you like a good solid folk lore   story telling type of book  I would recommend this   A must read  even if you think you won t like it  Get a good translation  as in the World Classics Series   and you WILL  Besides  you can t claim to be literate if you haven t read the Iliad and the Odyssey  this book is the best and raw book about war  If anyone who is interested in wars and self discipline then I would recommend you this book  Iliad is truly the best books I have read about the Greeks and Trojans   Best war story ever  great character development  great story telling  great portrayal of the action on the battlefield and the conflicts between both countries whose men loved each other  but were dishonoured greatly  Robert Fagles rejuvenates this familiar tale and keeps you captivated  If you think you don t like Homer  you should give this version a try  I am sad that he has passed away and will not be contributing more   DON T BE PUT OFF BY THE POETIC NATURE OF THE WRITING   You will get used to it  i promise  and it s really worth it  the film   Troy  really let me down as the interplay between the gods and man was tantalising  The classic tale of Hector and Achilles and a lot of guys who live to die fighting  Not only did this book give an excellent  although iconic  portrayal of bronze age warfare  it contained touching moments of love  The story of the Iliad beats the movie Troy any time  The gods taking part of this great war really changes the story  The Iliad is a great book for people who love adventure and action books  Very Highly recommended  Such a wonderful story and great read     but it is a story of war and a story of death  The sadness of these mortals running around and killing one another while the Immortals watch from above is to me  very real   Another Newberry find  We had to read excerpts of Fagles  Iliad in high school  but I got the cliffs notes in the interest of not failing physics  I really like it  it  might  be better than the Odyssey  Might  Yes  it s the Iliad  and yes  it s Alexander Pope  and yes  it is grand and epic and beautiful and very nice  but that is more 18th century rhymed iambic pentameter than I plan to read for a very  very long time   Esta es otra de esas obras que casi todos nos sentimos comprometidos a leer  Viendo en retrospectiva toda mi experiencia como lector  es claro que el mayor regocijo estetico lo alcance con esta obra  Es bellisima  O book that must not miss from any good reader s library  Necessary for your evolution in understanding  it will capture your attention and you ll end up wanting to know more and more about the stories  A must read   the book that made me fall in love with apollo  i think this book is better than the odyssey  much more attuned to core human elements  even in the struggle among the gods to control for fate and destiny of mankind  This book is my favorite from the deep past   so much so that I m currently reading it in origional Homeric Greek  This lengthy story is a dim reflection of the Mycenean culture from which it ultimately    originates   Ok  so am I a freak for admitting that parts of The Iliad make me tear up  The language gets me EVERY time  Fagles is arguably the best Homeric translator out there  maybe he and Robert Fitzgerald could duke it out    One day  Also  why isn t this on the 1001 Books list  I m generally not one to whine about all of the omissions from the list  1001 is enough  thank you    but to choose Aesop and Ovid  but not Homer  Ridiculous  I m leaving the  date read  section blank  because I don t remember when the first time I read this book was  I ve been reading it my whole life  Like the Odyssey  it s one of the few books I read over and over again  I am reeling from the effects of listening to this translation of the Iliad  The pain and rage and pathos  the gory battle scenes  the perfect details  that left me shuddering    I want to start all over again  I read an earlier translation in scholl and found it tedious  This translater of Homer s epic is very readable abd I loved it enough to but his trans of The Odyssey before I finished The Iliad  Also great I really enjoyed reading this book for my English class  This book was very well written and I love the conflict between the gods  My favorite character is Diomedes  I would recommend this book to anyone  What to say  Homer has created an exploration of war and human nature that has moved  inspired  and educated people for several hundreds of years  Mitchell s translation is just right for modern ears I think   Second read through  this time the E V Rieu translation  simpler than Hammond s text it misses out on some of Homer s poetic brilliance but makes up for this in readability  a worthy translation of the epic    DELUGE ALL YOUR CHANNELSFROM ALL YOUR GUSHING SPRINGS  MUSTER ALL YOUR TORRENTSRAISE UP A TREMENDOUS WAVE  RUMBLINGBOOMING WITH TIMBERBOULDERS CRASHING  WE LL ALL STOP THIS WILDMAN ACHILLES    Con este libro inicio la literatura occidental  y ya estaba en su maxima expresion  La plasticidad literaria de Homero no tiene precendentes y  quien lo ha igualado Pricipe de los poetas diria Dante  The first  and one of the best  though what strikes me on re reading it 25 years later is how strange so much of it is  Fitzgerald s translation is fine  but I think I prefer more the greekness of Lattimore  Robert Fagles translation is best  There s another popular translation by Lattimore which really seems to lack the heart and passion of Fagles  version  However  exactly reverse that for the Odyssey  For any Greek mythology enthusiast  the Odydssy and the Iliad are a must read  Two of the best books I have ever read  Sure  the prose and poetry take some getting used to  But the stories are awesome  This classic is much more than a doorstopper you read at a coffeeshop to show people how smart you are  Great action and tension as we wait for Achilles to rage  A lyrical tale about men  war  and glory  This story  and this particular translation  is what made me decide to be a Classics Major  I was reading this book in my dorm room and could feel  as if through a tunnel of time  ancient sunshine on my face  I love how the Gods walked among the hero and mortals  They move with power and emotion through the story in a way that only the pagans ever appreciated  Great storytelling   incites the imagination  An outstanding translation  So much blood and gore  I m surprised Tarantino hasn t adapted it  You ve never read such a poetic description of the sound that severed eyeballs make when they hit a sandy beach  Oh Homer  how I love you  Third time reading the Iliad and it only gets better  Death  life  control  gods  humanity  humility  pride  rage   it s all there  And keeps delivering over and over again  Brad Pitt has a Woody Allen esque feud with Agamemnon over a slave girl  then gruesomely murders the shit out of everyone before chasing Hector around the walls of Troy Benny Hill style  Classic Homer  Robert Fagle s translation of the Iliad is amazing   very accessible but still lyrical  And how can you not appreciate the story  Come on   it s the Trojan War  It s Greek mythology  It s epic poetry  It was awesome and the fact it is responsible for Henry Purcell s Dido and Aeneis  Dido s Lament actually and only when dido s part is sung by Emma Kirkby    It was awesome  is a really bad review   Fagles s Iliad and Odyssey are singular triumphs of translation  Fagles has managed to preserve the urgency  rhythm  and structure of Homeric Greek in English  Read them over and again  Love it  The only multi hundred pages of verse I have any interest in reading again and again  sorry  Bible   Great characters  storyline  and face it  you feel good about yourself to finish such a tome  Outstanding  I ve reread the Iliad and read a half dozen books about the poem and the Trojan War within the last couple of years  and still I learned something from every lecture  Highly recommended  Awesome translation  Pope uses rhythms very well to set the tone through each book and does a good job of giving unique voices to the innumerable characters  A pleasant re read of a true epic  More Old Testament  This dude begat that dude who begat that other guy whose roommate once visited this other cat  than The Odyssey  it s still a fantastic story and well worth a read or a re read  Fagles translation or nothing at all  I m not usually picky about this sort of thing  but it really matters and makes a difference in this case  Besides that    it s the Iliad  Classic for a reason   It had an amazing storyline  great character development  and I actually liked it even though the school assigned it to me   Its suprising that such a great story was made more than 1000 years ago    The fitzgerald translation of Illiad is simply beautiful  I can t say more about this story then has already been written over the ages  It was amazing and struck the soul of my warrior spirit  3 000 years after it was first assembled  The Iliad by Homer remains the greatest war story ever told  A testament to the ancient Greeks  it will continue to stand the test of time for aeons to come  The first time I read this  as a student  I identified with Helen and Paris  The second time  as an adult  I realized that Hector was the true hero and his wife s speech to him is unforgettable   Great book  enjoy reading   The Ancient Greek stories are always such a great read and the Iliad is no exception   Though this did take me quite a lot longer than I anticipated   but hey  at least I enjoyed it   Of all translators of Homer  ancient and modern  I like Lattimore the best  His method was  he said  to let the words speak to him from the pages  His work is inspired and compelling  I won t pretend that I can adequately review this book  It is powerful  moving  complex  and tenaciously readable  It deals with some very universal and fundamental human experiences  I read this book in high school and in college and just absolutely LOVE mythology  The idea of gods   goddesses getting upset at someone and punishing them ridiculously is hilarious  300 fans  unite  The clash of Gods and men alike  Achilles  proud rampage and the fall of Troy  A wonderful read for the fans of war  of adventure  Pick up your sword and grab a copy today  Very great to read and lets you know about the events that happened during the Trojan War even though it was written out of fantasy or exaggeration but it was still an amazing novel   This is one of my fav books of all time  I read it in college for my lit class and went back to it a few years ago  The storyline is just wonderful  I don t know how else to describe it  Absolutely fabulous translation   Though I should have read this long ago  it was the first time for me to read from cover to cover  This thing has just got to be an anti war satire   This book is one of the most important books I have ever read  I read it in a Representative Masterpiece class when I was 19  I had a brilliant professor  It opened a new world for me  Not half so intimidating as I initially thought  and doubly rewarding  Tip  read an illustrated children s version first  then a good translation of the real thing  poetry not prose form   This is the book that made me love to read  There really is nothing else quite like  The Illiad   I still get goosebumps just thinking of the reading experiences I ve had with this book  Read it when I was in third grade  Didn t care for it Read it in middle school  Loved it  Fighting  love  family  heroism  what else can you ask for Spoiler Achilles is a spoiled jerk  This book is astounding  I love it and hope you do too  The rage and fury by achilles is only matched by the Homeric writing of The Iliad  This book is about strength and nothing else  Everyone should read the Iliad  it is one of the foundations of western literature  and one of the most famous work of fiction  It does not need to be reviewed  it just needs to be read  Lattimore is the quintessential translation  Fitzgerald is definitely second  I d have to say    without reservation    that THE ILIAD was  and still is  the greatest story ever told  This is worth your time  Fun stuff about men at war killing each other endlessly  I learned SO much from this book  The  truest  most perfect mirror  of violence  as Simone Weil said  read the Lattimore translation but this Goodreads won t let me use  Goodreads has a problem with classical works or works that appear in substantively different versions   I loved it  I loved everything about it  from the story to the language  It s amazing and definitely a good read for anyone with even a remote interest in classical antiquity  In a list of the top ten characters of all time   The Iliad  would hold the top nine  This story has survived the ages for a reason  It s the greatest thing man has written  I first read it at school in modern Greek on 1984  and later in ancient Greek in 1986 I really appreciated it when I read it again later in my life on my own time and tempo   The weird thing about this book  and all great poetic tales  is that it s sometimes difficult to read the actual language  but always incredibly easy to visualize  Go figure  I m one of those perverse souls who prefers this to the Odyssey  although it s not as if you have to choose one  Fagles does an amazing job  I need to re read this one soon  BIG book     really  I suspect it will be wonderful  and I have no idea why but i am obsessed with wars and I already know the story  but will read it anyway  all the time   I love both the Fitzgerald and the Lattimore translations  This work is everything  My desert island book  if I were given the desperate situation of only having one book  I was lucky enough to get to spend time dissecting the Iliad for my lit  class last semester  I loved it  It was so different and interesting  Not at all what I was expecting  dr lynkh zyr yddsht mn drbrh y ylyd r bkhwnyd lSf http   profiles yahoo com blog OMYJYT    I have decided that Homer is so cool  Plus  so many of our works today you can see their essence from The Iliad  Even The Hunger Games  Will now be moving on to The Odyssey  I ve heard lots of people find this epic boring   I suppose some brief moments lack thrill   but I stayed up nights reading it on the window seat of Boppell 307 and even wept  I don t read ancient Greek  yet    so I can not speak to the faithfulness of Fagles  translation  but this is version is lively  bloody  profane and sacred at the same moment  This is too great for me to review  I found it so deep  more so that the Odyssey  though perhaps I was more invested  This is just amazing  I was not expecting that  Incredible  The physicality of the story rarely moves  but that is not important at all  The story is full of what humanity is and is capable of  good and ill   This is much better in Audio than trying to read it  but it does get better and better with time  One time through is definately not enough to appreciate it fully  Really enjoyed this translation  I hadn t read this since high school  and it was really worth a reread  So much in here to think about  and surprisingly gripping  Superior production with Stanley Lombardo reading and Susan Sarandon providing introductions to each section  Audio is probably the best way to experience the epic  Tough at first but you get used to it  I read the prose version by Samuel Butler and it was pretty easy to follow  Now here in a few months I m on to the Oddyssey  A book that I should have read long before I did  Everyone should read it once    to call it only a book about war is to call  Moby Dick  only a book about a whale   Great story   I adore Greek mythology and the Iliad was wonderful Obviously it isn t perfect  but there s a reason its story continues to be told to this day     Read this book for class and loved it  I think that I would like to read the Robert Fagles translation as well  Hopefully I will be picking up The Odyssey soon   Timeless masterpiece   richly illustrated  poignant and a tragedy in the true sense of the word  Definitely one of the books to read and re read before you die  Despite what my boss said  the age of Iliad is not yet passed  Well not for me  anyway  I pity those who cannot still find excitement and pleasure in this book   I didn t just read it  I took a class on it and I listened to an audio college course on it  All of this added to my understanding  and pleasure  reading this book   Blood  rage  petulance  gods in disguise  It begins our literature  it plays out fast and hard  This translation is wonderful  I come back to it again and again  The Fitzgerald translation is so far superior to the other three versions I ve come across  it s almost like a different book  Just wanted to put that out there  I m actually reading the Richmond Lattimore translation  I m getting much  much more out of this book than when I read it back when I first started my studies  For some reason GoodReads won t let me put the Lattimore translation on my shelves  So  though I m currently reading Lattimore  I am putting Fagles  Iliad up here   I ve read this at least three full times now  and enjoyed it each  While many classics are overrated in my opinion  this one deserves its spot at the base of the canon   I really liked this even if it was written forever and ever ago  It is full of excitement intrigue killing fantasy and evil  Everything you need for the perfect book   Along with my thoughts to the Odyssey  this book is a must have for anyone who claims themselves a reader  Another heroic epic that is a piece of history and literature The Lattimore translation  I think it s the best  other than reading it in Greek  and that probably shows my age  I don t think anyone should read a prose translation  Excellent short series on the Iliad  Dr  Vandiver does an excellent job of bringing the the story to life and covering the themes  Highly recommended  Robert Fagels translation is the best I have read  really captures the brilliance and soul and visceral drama of one of the greatest stories in history  Fagles translation  The best book in the western world  All western literature stems from this  in my opinion  A must read about the futility of war  How do you review something like this  I mainly dipped into this as I was about to read  The Song of Achilles  and it was a sort of background reading     I finally got around the reading the Iliad  it was NOT at all what I expected  Check out my full review  The Iliad by Homer I read the translation by Robert Fagles  Very good    and the violence was VERY graphic  Quite a bit different from the version I read in high school   It has been so long since I read the Iliad that I am preparing to pick it up again  I only remember reading it for junior high English and I loved it  I highly recommend the unabridged audiobook over the written text for this one too  Derek Jacobi s narration of Homer s classic is simply captivating  Wow  a great read  It was hard going at first  but once I got past the first couple of chapters I was captivated by the story  I highly recommend it  I must say that the Odysee is more my cup of tea  but this is very  very good too  A must read  even if you hate it  because everyone knows this work  Phenomenal book  The exaggerations and everything were all appreciated  Interesting character development  leaves you not really attached to any of them   Everything is in this book   there s nothing left to say about humanity  Sorry world  Just reading more bits for an article   every word is perfect  I loved Richard Lattimore s translation  His language is clear  vivid  and beautiful  And  of course  as far as literary epics go  you can t beat The Iliad  How can one rate the Iliad  It is well above any ranking  It s myth  a foundational narrative  I chose to read it when I was a teenager  It marked me for life The Iliad is the best epic  If you like the Iliad  read the Oresteia by Aeschylus  It ties up the loose ends and Agamemnon gets some serious comeuppance   Till Fagles translation  The Iliad was something I read only as a preface to The Odyssey  But his remarkable work completely opened the work for me   This is an absolutely gorgeous translation from the Greek   it s not the most popular opinion  but I like it better than the Fagles translation  The goddesses and the golden apple  Helen and Paris  Achilles  Odysseus  Hector  Menelaos  the ten year war  the wooden horse  Loooooove it  I highly recommend reading Richard Lattimore s translation  I have read this story three times by three different translators  His is the best   Pope s translation is in the eighteenth century style  and when you re dealing with a plot so wonderful  the result is aesthetic perfection  Achilles and Hector are two of my favorite characters of all time  If you re really into mythology  the Iliad will not disappoint  I loved it  An excellent story  and I highly recommend the Fagles translation for anyone who isn t learned in their Ancient Greek  so  basically everyone   The word epic is definitely appropriate  Great translation  I first read this in three days while my family was driving back from a vacation out west Gloriosa ed eterna opera  Nonostante la complessita di alcuni passaggi la trama resta sempre appassionante  Inevitabile per una cultura letteraria  I think the Fagles translation is great   although his Odyssey is more successful   and worth reading even if you re a diehard Lattimore fan  The glories of the Trojan War  It pains me that this work is passed over so often in favor of The Odyssey  especially in high schools  I have read MANY variations of this book since fourth grade Thank You Mr  Chavez   This is by far the best one and yes I have read it many times  Homer has written the worlds greatest epic  A must read for cultural literacy and share entertainment value  The charactor of Hector is amazing  I loved this book  i would only reccamend it for people who enjoy thinking alot about text and poetry  i would think this as a high school book  My favorite memory was reading about Hector s battle with Achilles at a cafe beneath the acropolis  I also had a roommate who called it  The Lilad  The Iliad and The Odyssey  why The Classics are the classics of literature  I many ways  all that you ever read are derivative of these two works  I must have read about ten different translations of this classic  There really is nothing one can say that would do justice to its Timeless majesty  I was introduced to the wonderful world of Greek mythology by my Grandpa s small library collection  I never get tired of reading this book   This whole genre is getting old  Saving Private Ryan  Letters From Iwo Jima  Black Hawk Down  This Homer fellow  whoever he is  is just a hack  This isn t the translation that I read    I read the one by Fitzgerald  but couldn t find it on this list  See my comments on the Odyssey  Si on aime la mythologie grecque  ce livre est un must  Des heros  des Dieux et une bataille legendaire  Hollywood peut pas faire mieux    An essential work of Art  Homer is perfect at conveying the ethics of Man  People have not changed much over the history of mankind  The Loeb edition is of course still my favorite  but if you can t get Lattimore or don t like his style  this is a good third choice  This is an amazing classic that everyone should read  I read it in one of my classics studies classes in college and really enjoyed it  After picking it up twice and stalling early on  I listened to it on tape and really got into it  A must read must listen to  for sure  I simply love this book  Read it in my early 20 s  then I was left to ponder why my teachers never made me read this masterpiece before   Another enjoyable epic poem about the clash of mortals and the Gods and the war with Troy  A lengthy read  but worth it  A true classic  There is a reason that this book has been around for more than two thousand years  No other book better explores the complexities of war   Robert Graves  Anger of Achilles is a pretty good modern translation   For some reason Good Reads redirects that version to this version   I feel stupid rating this book  What I learned from this book is that reading is not all about figuring out what s going to happen   Not always easy to read  but important to read if one is going to have a rounded education in lit across the many years and cultures  It almost seems disrespectful to give star ratings to The Iliad  It deserves five stars for its literary and cultural significance alone   The edition I own was my Dad s with illustrations by Flaxman  It is a beloved favorite of mine  I think I was 13 when I read it first  A book of magnificent and vivid proseShowcase of anger s throesHektor gloriousAchaians victoriousAchilleus still suffers the most 10ILYADAHomeros1994 Kasim ayinda devretmisim hem Ilyada yi hem Odise yi   Not vermeye kalkarsam ayip olurdu  diye eklemisim    Excelente  Melhor que a Odisseia  As descricoes sao fabulosas  assim como os recursos estilisticos  Nao obstante  o canto II e uma seca  Fagles brings Homer to life in a way that could only be reached if the tradition of oral storytelling still existed  An exceptional book  I read the french version of this book during my two years in Preparatory classes  Math Sup Math Spe  I bough this book in OUJDA MOROCCO  The most easily read read translation of Homer I ve come across  It s now easy to see how these works form the backbone of Western Culture  It s as though an alien version of Shakespeare came down from the Cosmos to impart epic brilliance  poetry and metaphor for all ages  This is one of the best books not written  It was part of an oral tradition like much of the Hebrew Christian Bible  but more entertaining  Stands as a classic on its own merits  not just for the fact that its  old   This particular translations seemed veryfluid as well  When I was younger I read this and probably would have given it two stars  What a revelation age is to help us so appreciate art   great reading on the trojan war  have read the book once and listened to the audiobook twice  Homer  I believe is to be listened too   I love Lattimore s translation  We used it in a couple of classics classes I took in college  and it is the one that rings in my head   I read this my first semester in college and it was critical for understanding almost any art or literature I came in contact with later  The original narrative of universal human experience  struggle and heroism   To read the Iliad is to appreciate that there is no progress in art   Roberto Calasso in The Marriage of Cadmus and Harmony Lombardo s seems like a great translation  I never thought I d read the entire Iliad  but I finished this in less than a week   Achilles the badass doing work gotta love itMenin aeide  thea  Peleiadeo  Akhileosoulomenin  e muri Akhaiois alge etheke    The Iliad is the single best work of literature ever penned down by the hand of a mortal man  If you disagree  we will fight  Just on the introduction  now  It describes the history of the Iliad from a linguistic etc   point of view among other things  I read a different translation  but I have read Butler s as well and find it to be easier compared to the other one I read   I love Greek mythology and was excited to read The Iliad for the first time  I enjoyed it although I do prefer The Odyssey  Like his Odyssey  Fagles seems to have a direct line to the ancient bard s epic muse  creating the Iliad of the century  Much more important than the Odyssey  though most modern readers would prefer the latter  Greatest anti war work of all time  I read this first in college   LOVED it  I often go back and reread sections just for fun  It s such a good adventure  I am a huge fan of ancient literature  so automatically biased  The ancient attacks me  I am attracted to long lost wisdom   Beautiful  moving  poignant  unmatched  It s like nothing else you have or will ever read  A book that will change your life  One of the most difficult books I ve ever read  took a lot longer but it was well worth it once you got past the translations    The most epic story of all time  It s got war  sex  power  betrayal  The characters are so dynamic  What an awesome story  I truly love mythology so I honestly thought this was a fantastic book  This will definitely be a re read  It was excellent  Everyone literate needs to read this Greek classic which combines mythology  character study  war narrative  and moral dilemma  One of the best books in the last 3 000 years  I didn t read this translation  however  I read the one by Richard Lattimore   So far  this is the best translation of the Iliad that I have read  I read about half of Fitzgerald s translation  What a hack  Timeless story in a translation of unbelievable beauty  Fagles  name will share book covers with Homer for generations to come  This edition of the Iliad makes you feel as though you are in the middle of the epic battle between the Achians and the Trojans  There is a reason why this is required reading at just about every school in the Western Hemisphere  It really that great  the pope version is my favorite of all the translations for the iliad  although  i have to say  i am just a big pope fan  Me dispongo a leer por diosabraquenesima vez Iliada y Odisea  Esta vez para la Iliada sera la version de Antonio Lopez Eire   Just a goos read  It s surprisingly comical and it s a great glimpse into the thought pattern of the ancient Greek way of life  I love Dr  Vandiver  I really enjoy all of her lectures  I wish I could take classes from her  Highly recommended  Woo  My father s line by line translation  put into iambic pentameter  Beautiful and  relatively  easy to read  Robert Fagles does an excellent translation of this ancient classic  A well told story of the great fall of Troy  Read this before  several times  Just re reading it again  for that clarity of sight  that fearlessness of language  A brilliant translation  grippingly readable  an action movie in fluid language  A book to be savored again and again   Most people don t care much for the Iliad  in my experience  anyway  but I am a sucker for the stilted poetry  My ratings for both this book and Odyssey are based on both the story by Homer and Lattimore s excellent translations   Loved the translation  Wept at the end  Hated Achilles and Paris and Helen  She should have just offed herself  I wasn t impressed by Martin Hammond s rather dry translation  but it is the Iliad  Of course it is brilliant  Spoiler alert  this book contains spoilers  It s also a bit repetitive but I still couldn t get enough of it   This is definately a nerdy book and a hard read  but if you like Greek mythology then go for it  because it s amazing  I have read this numerous times  but Fagles  amazing translation really made it seem new and exciting all over again  I really enjoyed this prose version  The goddess  clear eyed Athene  is one of my favorite characters in literature  The beauty of homer relived so vividly and i was like a famished wild beast  i  ate  the book  It is undescriable I became Achilles after this   such wonderful and magic pages  started my love about Zeus  Achilles and others    This is the translation I recommend to my students  They all agreed that it s the most approachable and vivid   Going to give the Robert Fagles translation a go here  As recommended by Thomas Cahill   see Wes  there he is again  Many stanza ed poem that remains relevant throughout the long and bloodied eons  Everyone should give it a shoot  I enjoyed this translation  I also had the Lattimore  but ended up opting for Fagles  Both are worth having   A classic of brutality  humanity  mercy and beauty   half of the great epic and beautiful in its prose  Fantastic    and now going on at least a one year quest to read study supporting documents texts  etc     I cannot get enough of this book  It speaks to me  For real  Some wors are prescient no matter how decayed Fagles is the best translator   straightforward  concise  but losing non of the power  Highly recommended  Homer the greatest again  It brought the Trojan war to life for me  and all those involved  A must read  This book was actually pretty cool  The beginning was slow but it was definitely an epic battle haha This is one of the classics of all literature  If you haven t read it before  I would highly recommend it  Read this at school a hundred years ago    but I remember enjoying it very much  Will read it again sometime  You know what  I have read this book since a kid and still love it now    That s it         D XXXXXD      In my top 100  The Iliad is  1  and of all its translations into English  Chapman s is still my favorite  This book doesn t end with the Trojan Horse                         SO pissed  But the book is awesome The Fagles translation is particularly majestic for what is arguably  one of the most majestic books ever  This is THE best version of The Iliad in English  Robert Fagles translates into beautiful rhythmic verse  Please   with all the Percy Jackson hype  give the kids the book that started it all  Amazing novel  TYGOR FINKS IZ VURWY GUD  DA ORIGINAL GAME OF THRONES WIFF ALL DA CHARACTERS AND COLORFUL DEESCWIPSHUNS  Took me 2 1 2 months  but totally worth the time and late fines Would make a very good graphic novel  Wonderful book  repetitive but beautifully written with intense and violent battle scenes  I always read the Fitzgerald translation  This was my third time  and it was better than ever   When i read it i kept thinking about it being one of Alexander s the great favorite books  Good book to learn  to strengthen understanding of myths  origins  contributing to paganism It s obviously an amazing story  and this translation is tightly and accessibly written   I read this when I was very young  it taught me to finish what I start  and to enjoy reading  Okay  Wow  Listening to an awesome narrator really changed my opinion  Love it  love it  love it  One of my all time favorites  7th or 8th time reading it in the last 10 years  Never gets old  If you re gonna read the classics  read the classics  man  Don t waste your time with translations  Reading this book was like listening to music  a single haunting solo joined by a beautiful chorus  Much easier read than expected   and full of action Definitely recommend Fagles translation   Bloodier by the day  Wiser by the hour  Hammered and fired armor  Achilles ready to attack  Perhaps the greatest translation ever made   certainly the greatest that I ve come across  Amazing translation  I read this book several years ago and don t remember enjoying it this much  So glad that my book club decided to tackle this  It was worth every minute spent reading it   This is just about my favorite story of all time  Great Homer tells it in exquisite detail   One of the reasons I became a Classics major  An amazing take with great adventures and characters  Reread

literature  I name my pets out of it  Hector  Troy  Andromache  This is an excellent piece of both mythology and wartime drama  I truly love evrything about it  The trojan war  Betrayal  deceit  heroes  heroines and villains  Something for everyone  I like this Samuel Butler translation  This is part of a ten volume Classic s Club set that I own  One of my absolute favorite epic poems   The battle between Achilles and Hector is remarkable  Richmond Lattimore s translation is wonderful  The catalogue of ships was my favorite part  Of all the hunchbacks who ve translated the Iliad  Alexander Pope is far and away my favorite  Copy signed by the author at the  Homerathon  at GVSU last spring  Yes  I am a Classics geek  Took a while  but it was totally worth it  I really enjoyed it  and it was a great translation  It s a struggle for me to read  but it still covers all the human emotions and most of the foibles  Robert Fagles has managed by far the best translation of this work ever  Move over  Fitzgerald  You have to start with the classics  A great long book about egotism and death  Right on  A monument to Pope s poetic style  and a worthy translation of Homer   Nuff said  Read it  Umm    It s The Illiad  the celebration of passions as the Odyssey is the celebration of the mind   No work since strikes the Iliad s balance of beauty and horror  triumph and tragedy    Hateful to me is that man who hides one thing in his heart and speaks another    Entre felonias y heroismos  varios parrafos tenian algo guardado para un servidor  My boyfriend and I read this aloud to each other while traveling in Greece  Amazing   Read in Humanities class in High School  This story made a profound impression on me   It was a thousand times better than the Odyssey despite

heart for all works from Ancient Greece   Best use of adjectives in any written work throughout history  even better than Gibbon  As a young guy  I read a lot of fantasy novels  I should have been reading this  Wow  Really wow  one of the best books there is and  now  one of my top favorites Read for a class  Essential reading for insights into the Malazan Book of the Fallen   D Definitely a must for those who love adventure  epic poetry  and greek mythology   Believe I was 12 or 13 when read this  at the time I LOVED greek and roman myths  Very entertaining  I don t know of another book with as much action as Homer s Iliad   Glad I finally got to read this classic  Wonderful story of how much nobody likes war  This translation is great for the entertainment  but not as accurate as others  This is the first translation of Homer s work I have ever read  I find it to the best   Since I m a history fan  I fell in love with one of the ancient gold poems of all times  So far I love this book  The characters are wonderful and the insults are hilarious   A favorite every year  9 times so far  I think  so much more satisfying than The Odyssey  Richmond Lattimore is my favorfite

Greek Hero for walking through this text  Cannot praise this book enough  A must read  Riveting  real  transcendent   Reading the Iliad  Go with the Lattimore translation  No doubt about it  I love greek mythology and it doesn t get bigger or better than this one  Great way to round out the classical education you always wish you had gotten  Fagles translation is breath taking  and this truly is a tale for the ages  This translation by Robert Fagles is gorgeous and transparently modern  It is still on bookshelves after all these years because it is truly that good My humanities prof in

reason   so glad I had to read it for school yeah uh the iliad gets a solid five stars on goodreadsbetter than the bible I believe I ve read all of the major western classical epics  This is the best
