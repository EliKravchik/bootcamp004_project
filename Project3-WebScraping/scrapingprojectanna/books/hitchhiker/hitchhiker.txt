Don t panic and just read this book    Prior to reading The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy I don t think I could have said that there was good comedy books  but after having read through it in like a weekend I can say that I now long for more  Its witty remarks that are both silly and intelligent will make you laugh but also ponder about life and it s meaning  but then life it s just life and 42 is more than just a number  OMG IT WAS SOOOO COOL  My dad listened to the original radio series with his dad  his favourite memory of him  and tried to get me and my brother to read it  but as my brother would not read  he bought the audio book  we listened to them  then for my birthday he bought the restaurant at the end of the universe  I loved them  he bought the TV series  then I read all the books  then my librarian told me of a show with the original radio cast that was touring and coming near us we went to see it and it was AWESOME we saw the film when it came out and bought the collectors edition DVD  etc     I now want to join zz9     goes off to do that  Como explicar o que e o Guia do Mochileiro das Galaxias  E simplesmente o livro mais engracado que eu ja li na minha vida inteira Quando eu li  eu nunca tinha dado risada efetivamente com nenhum livro antes  era sempre uma risadinha simpatica quando alguma piada aparecia  Com o GMG  eu finalmente descobri as maravilhas de se cagar de tanto rir lendo um livro Ele e sarcastico  ironico  engracado  cativante e nos faz pensar  no meio de tantas risadas e situacoes estranhas  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is awesome  It s absolutely hilarious  and all of the characters are quirky and interesting  That includes a depressed robot  and a bulldozer operator who ended up lying in the mud  However  it contains practically no plot structure rising action  climax  etc   I had always meant to read this book  ever since hearing about it in high school  The title  alone  appealed to me  even though I had no clue what it was about  For some reason  or another  I never got around to reading it  I enjoyed the movie immensely  and decided  resolutely  that I would read the book    and a year or two after that  here I am finally to say  wow  this book lives up to the hype  It s incredibly imaginative  laugh out loud funny  and plot is paced so well that the book sort of  whooshes  by  and it over just as you were really enjoying it  Fortunately  there are four sequels to continue the story  I highly recommend reading this book to anyone with a rich sense of humor and a taste of the whimsey  Dane Cook fans need not apply  excellent Hilarious and thought provoking  I don t think this book is for everyone  but it was so refreshing and interesting to me   This is such a weird book  It s fascinating and discusses some interesting topics  but in all honesty it s just a collection of strange thoughts from the author s brain and I sort of love that It also helps that Douglas Adams wrote some of the episodes of the first Dr  Who series  and I love the new version of Doctor Who which is based on the old one  Movie was better than the book  at least I think so  Well I never fully finished the BBC version  but the one with Martin Freeman and Mos Def was great  I m not taking anything away from the book  If it weren t for the book  I wouldn t have the movie  so thank you book  Hilarious and fun to read  One of my favorites  Enough cannot be said about this book  This has to be  hands down  one of my favourites ever  DON T PANIC The story begins one murky  thursday afternoon when Arthur Dent finds out that his house is being demolished to make way for a new bypass  As he is lying down in the mud in front of the bulldozers  protesting that he was not made aware of this until yesterday when he went down to the planning office  where the plans were on display  in the bottom of a locked filing cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying  Beware of the Leopard    his friend Ford Prefect drops by and tells him that he  Ford  is not exactly from this planet and warns Arthur that the world will be ending soon and he d be wise to leave with Ford right away  Oh  and also bring his towel with him Arthur eventually finds out that Ford comes from a small planet somewhere in the vicinity of Betelguese and had come down to Earth about fifteen years ago to do some research about the planet for the most comphrehensive encyclopedia in the galaxy   The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  which has the friendly words  Don t Panic   in bold on the cover  and got stuck here  He and Arthur then hitch a lift on a Vogon spaceship  seconds before the Vogons obliterate Earth  where they are promptly discovered and treated to a reading of Vogon poetry  the third worst kind of poetry in the universe  which  at one point  literally caused internal hemorrhaging in four people and the fifth survived by gnawing one of his own legs off  Elsewhere in the universe  Zaphod Beeblebrox  the two headed President of the Galaxy and Ford s semi cousin  steals the  Heart of Gold   a ship powered by an infinite improbabilty drive  along with his friend Trillian and a clinically depressed robot named Marvin  the Paranoid Android  and goes in search of the legendary planet Magrathea  which makes customised planets for people with a whole lot of money  On their way they pick up Arthur and Ford  after they ve been kicked out of the Vogon ship  and eventually land on Magrathea where they run into a man named Slartiblartfast  who is an expert on creating coastlines when it comes to designing planets From him  they learn a shocking secret about the planet Earth and also  surprisingly  mice  A sudden turn of events sees Arthur  and the others  on the run  while trying to avoid his brain from being bought and dissected by certain beings intent on finding out the ultimate answer to  Life  the Universe and Everything  Do they escape  Does Arthur get to keep his brain  What secrets are Zaphod s two heads hiding  Why is Marvin so depressed  What is the answer to  Life  the Universe and Everything   Wait  what is the question to  Life  the Universe and Everything   And  how ever do the mice fit into all of this  The entire book is a laugh riot from start to finish  For a story that seems to have been made up as it went along  Adams has nailed it  This is one book that keeps you bursting out in laughter randomly  long after you are done reading it  This is the first in a series  Following this are    The Restaurant at the End of the Universe    Life  the Universe and Everything    So Long And Thanks for All the Fish  and  Mostly Harmless   The first three in the series are very good but the last two just didn t cut it for me Marvin the robot  quite possibly my favourite character in the entire series  is depressing to the point of being funny  Here are some of his quips  Marvin   I am at a rough estimate thirty billion times more intelligent than you  Let me give you an example  Think of a number  any number  Zem   Er  five  Marvin   Wrong  You see   My capacity for happiness   Marvin added   you could fit into a matchbox without taking out the matches first  I think you ought to know I m feeling very depressed   I got very bored and depressed  so I went and plugged myself in to the ship s external computer feed  I talked to the computer at great length and explained my view of the Universe to it   said Marvin  And what happened   pressed Ford  It committed suicide   said Marvin Life   said Marvin dolefully   loathe it or ignore it  you can t like it  The Hitchhiker s guide to the Galaxy   Must have  must read  Don t read it at you own peril  i cant read More years ago than I care to admit  my high school physics teacher took the class to the library and made us read a science fiction book for the class period  I picked up Hitchhiker s and was hooked  I read the then four book trilogy  and doesn t that just say it all  in a weekend Since that time I ve probably re read the book every few years  Each time is as refreshingly funny as the first time  Though I understand the humor is not everyone s cup of tea  or cup of almost but not quite entirely unlike tea  Some humor is lost in translation  For the unintiated a Ford Prefect is the British version of the Ford Escort   42 is the answer It probably has to be your type of humor to like this book  but it definitely was mine  5 stars The first of Addams   Hitchhiker  series  I didn t expect to like the book  let alone the series  Occasionally Addams tends to ramble about his make believe pseudo science jargon  which can make the even the most devoted fan cross their eyes in confusion  But if you stick with it  the humor and unique  and sometimes lovable characters will prove to be worth the headache   I loved the whole series  All five books fo the trilogy just rock  One of my favourite books  First heard the radio drama on NPR  in the States  I m now in the UK  A friend brought back a copy from England  On my first visit to the UK I bought a copy of the current  trilogy  so I could have it in the  original  English  Unfortunately it was the day Douglas Adams died  What captured me was the humour  So many quotable lines  always have your towel  safe  this must be a use of the word of which I am not familiar  Marvin the depressed robot  Talking doors  and our hero Arthur Dent  an Englishman unable throughout the entire series unable to get a proper cup of tea  having lived here awhile I understand and the scenes of Arthur trying to get tea  are more poignant and funny  BRB my teacup is empty  This book i had to read  I had originally rented the movie  because my sister told me it was supposed to be one of the greatest books of all times  So  i watched the movie  and all in all  i hated it  Therefore i read the book  to see if they just screwed it up in production  I loved it  In the beginning  it shows a  somewhat  relate able character  Then  it throws all that out and takes you into a completely alien world  I read this so many years ago that  even though I hate re reading novels and never do it even with favorites  I felt compelled to listen again with my ten year old  who had no Douglas Adams previously  I caught so much I hadn t when I was fourteen  Also  it was the best introduction possible for my kid  Stephen Fry is pretty much perfect  Don t panic and always bring your towel  Two things Mr  Adams taught me  This book is probably one of my favorites  It s effortlessly witty and smart with a sarcasm that I thoroughly enjoyed  Arthur  Ford  and Zaphod are such incredible characters  And one must not forget Marvin   the perpetually depressed robot  I hope everyone reads this book  I m definitely going to read the rest of the books in the series  Adams  words are fun to digest as they re never dull or boring  This story did NOT disappoint  The book s creativity about space was extremely interesting and the dialogue between characters and their actions are funny  This is a great book if you just want to laugh and read about a story that would great for almost anyone  This book is hilarious  I saw the movie years ago  but this book is way better  Look forward to the rest of the series  This book was originally read to me by my first boyfriend  He did all the voices and made it quite entertaining  Over ten years later I decided to read it myself  just before the movie came out   I was not disappointed  It was as funny and witty as I remember it   Wish the movie had been a bit better  though  One of the books that defined me  having it read in the tender age of 14  Perfect one liners  outrageous reasoning  deightful side stories and all of this  on a quest to find the answer to the question of Life  Universe and Everything  REview for The ILLUSTRATED guide collector s edition ONLY   goodreads you should group reviews not for only the book but the different incarnations of that book  I expected this to have the original text PLUS illustrations going along as you read  which would have been soooo COOL  what it IS  is cool  but not what I expected  A big beginning part before the actual book original text  filled with cool photos  history  etc  all about the history and details of how this book and series CAME TO BE  ie it was FIRST a radio show  next was a TV show  then a book THIRD  then finally many eons later sadly after Douglas Adams died  the MOVIE  sorry but ford Prefect is NOT black  nothing against those with black heritage  maybe another character but NOT ford  SO  the actual text is 100  the same  but published in the nice smooth big magazine type of a book rather than ikky paperback which gets dusty  my orig  copy makes me sneeze   and disappointing  there are NO illustraions just a background of various obscure images behind and around the text  OH WELL  due to this book version laying around and me mentioning how great HGTTG is  I did finally convince my just turned 9yo son to finally read it     although he is reading not this one but the normal paperback from his 4th grade classroom library  KUDOS to his 4th grade teacher for having this book on her bookshelves for her kids in her class to read  I was pleasantly surprised    Don t panic  Douglas Adams Hitch Hiker s Guide to the Galaxy is a fun  funny and simple read for everyone   It gets an amazing 5 star rating because I am rereading it and any book that moves you to immediately reread it has to be amazing  The opening scene is brilliant and any leanings to a 4 star rating I have are simply because it is impossible to top the perfection of that start  I enjoyed reading it and found it really well written  I believe I read this book in German as well  but I m not too sure anymore  It s definitely one of the books most worth reading nowadays  This was the funniest book I ve ever read  I think I had to stop reading a few times ebcause I could not stop laughing  For those who went to go see the movie  the book is 10000 times better  The movie did absolutely no justice to the characters and the robot to boot  I really want to read the rest of the series soon  I recal this book being such a great treat      The best comedy sci fi I ve eve read  I haven t read many comedy sci fi thought  Nevertheless  this is a great book  Even if Adams doesn t make you laugh at least a dozen time in the book  it is insanely entertaining  if have absolutately no idea of what is going to happen 2 paragraphs forward  It is simpl full of gems  random things and seem completely normal  The conversations just before almost dying are just priceless  The randomness in which Douglas explained everything  Oh  there is a spaceship that works by impossibility  Faster than light  Easy  it just needs to create a random whale in the middle of nowhere  and then I will describe the whale s though before it dies  Any other author would make this extremely stupid and slap the reader in the face for daring to do such a thing Douglas makes it seem so normal  Like  yeah  whatever  Just a whale  Just Amazing  And I finally know why the number 42 is the number 42   Well  that was very british  And I liked it This is exactly how I like my space and sci fi to be  filled with many odd  incredible and insane things  where all our finely polished and established conceptions about everything are just thrown out of the window and the truth about the universe proves to be more chaotic  Organic  Crazy  All wibbly wobbly  timey wimey and spacey wacey  quirky and fabulous  as always   I ve read this series before and am revisiting it again because I loved it so much  Just as good the second time around  Great British humor satire  Adams is able to laugh at us humans in a creative way  Who wouldn t want to tour the galaxy  Will blog more later this week  Check back for a link http   norabpeevy blogspot com 2011 0    What can I say about this book that hasn t already been said  Simply the single funniest book I have ever read  However I hate to blow it up too big  because I think of someone is told  read this  it s the funniest tihng ever   then reads it  they will be strangely disappointed  Strange how humor works that way   One of the best  funniest books I have ever read  I read this book back in high school which was a long time ago and I forgotten just how much I loved this book The irreverent humour  the fun of it all  And to make this re read even better I listening to it on audio read by the incomparable Stephen Fry he did a Fantastic job as narrator There are hundreds of reviews of this book out there so I will wrap it up by saying this series has once again hooked me and now I have to read them all and fast  5 Stars awsome Just brilliant  This was sooo much fun as an audiobook and an adventure  Stephen Fry is an excellent actor and narrator and he brought the characters to life so perfectly for me  Aside from the audiobook  the writing is clever  hilarious  and portrays its improbable situations so perfectly  plus the ensemble cast is great fun  Now I see why this book is considered such a beloved classic  Possibly the best book ever written  I would recommend it to anyone and everyone  you simply MUST read it    Adams was a genius  This  his most famous book  was just his way of proving it The first thing one notices about Adams  books is his amazing way with words  His sense of humour is very original  and had made me unable to put the thing down the first time I was reading it  I was never a fan of science fiction  but this book    For some inexplicable reason it all seems so real to me  The characters he has created are superbly eccentric  I loved Marvin the most   and the events are  almost  over the top SF  yet they come so close to everyday life in a way so special to Adams If you re unsure about reading it don t waste your time thinking about it  just do it  Even if you are one of the people who end up hating his work  he s a bit like Marmite  which  incidentally  I hate  P    that book is so unique on so many levels  that you ll finish it a richer man  or woman   Awesome book  Ever since reading this book Douglas Adams has become my favorite author  I loved all of these in the series  Beneath the shear entertainment factor  there are so many nuggets of truth contained in these pages  They are truly the answer to life  the universe and everything  A modern classic of its genre  Truly a memorable work with many elements of the story entering popular culture  To this day I can quote passages     D  I could never do Thursdays   Bring a towel   Don t panic   42   How many roads must a man walk   All the coincidesThe miceThe whale and the scene I laughed out loud at   Curiously enough  the only thing that went through the mind of the bowl of petunias as it fell was Oh no  not again  Many people have speculated that if we knew exactly why the bowl of petunias had thought that we would know a lot more about the nature of the Universe than we do now  This book is incredibly written and memorable  loved it   For instance  on the planet Earth  man had always assumed that he was more intelligent than dolphins because he had achieved so much  the wheel  New York  wars and so on  whilst all the dolphins had ever done was muck about in the water having a good time  But conversely  the dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent than man  for precisely the same reasons  WOW    this book is too good    I enjoyed every moment of reading this book  Douglas Adams s writing is simply great  His humorous attempts to explain the things that we take for granted or don t really think about in our daily lives keeps us occupied throughout the book  There was never a dull moment in the book  Considering this book was written in 1979 I am amazed by the advanced technologies mentioned in the book that have only now become popular  I know that most people might find this book absurd and silly but for me this book was really good and underlying all the comedy is the discussion of serious topics One book is enough to turn you into a fan of Adams s works  Looking forward to read the rest of this series  The Hitchhiker s Guide To The Galaxy is just as funny and relevant today as it was when it was released over 30 years ago  Highly recommended   This is such a fun and brilliant book  Adam s writing is intelligent  humble and insane  Just as his universe is boundless  his writing seems to have no perimeters  I was so surprised at how witty this book was   A laugh out loud  quirky  off beat novel that must be read  Made into a movie  the book is far  far better than the screen adaption  Douglas Adams is either a genius or demented  hard to differentiate between because the story is so off the wall insane starting first with the Earth s complete annihilation by a group of unpleasant aliens and an unlikely bunch of  heroes  that flit about the universe on various useless quests for knowledge and power  Don t look for hidden meaning  deep theological discourse  or moral in this one  just stick out your thumb and go along for a wild ride   The Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy is a science fiction novel that was written quite a while ago and is still very popular today  This novel has a very interesting way of story telling that definitely shows the authors country of origin  The British style of writing is very elegant  but also can be extremely hilarious at times  The book was written in 1979 and it is amazing to see how much it holds up to this day  Douglas Adams was an amazing author and he will always be missed  I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes the charm of the British style of writing  and anyone who enjoys non stop action and none of that sappy stuff  The 2005 movie adaptation is pretty good too  I am almost 50 years old  and the Hitchhiker books are still at the top of my favorite reads  I even read them aloud  every one  as bedtime stories to my daughter  When she could read on her own   she read them herself  Still have them on my bookshelves and still crack o e open when I have a lazy afternoon   I watched the movie before reading the book I feel guilty for doing so   I loved the book so much more than the movie  Although while reading it I pictured the characters from the movie  It was amazing to say the least  It flowed nicely and now I can t wait to read the next one The Restaurant at the End of the Universe   I realize that I am very behind on the series at it was published in the late 70 s  but there is never a better time than now to get involved with the series  I stopped about halfway through as it got a little boring  but the book overall has been very enjoyable   It s been difficult to say exactly what the people on the surface of the planet were doing now  because they didn t really know what they were doing themselves   I ve been reading this book whole commuting and I had to bite my lip countless of times just to stop myself from laughing  I love the characters and their quirks and I love how challengingly fun it was to imagine planets beyond our own     Number 42  the answer to life and universe  Enough said  Must read  Un libro de ciencia ficcion que se sale de los tipicos planteamientos  Con un toque de humor algo afilado perfila las respuestas al  Que somos  y  De donde venimos  omnipresentes en toda filosofia  y como el universo esta comandado por alienigenas  no sin dejarnos alguna sonrisa y algun que otro golpe en a nuestra inteligencia desde lo mas absurdo de sus teorias Muy recomendable  I was quite afraid I wouldn t take to the book considering how many people close to me    as well as at parties    would rage  rage  RAGE at my never having read Hitchhiker s Guide  What would the fallout be  Would I be shanked at the next party I went to if  when asked about my liking of the book  I were to shrug  Oh  the anxiety  But I m happy to report I did like it  A lot  too  once the sperm whale and petunia chapter came up  and then all the more when the old world builder  or award winning fjord artist  wandered in  And then I felt as if I might come to possibly have a crush on the book after Zaphod gave his monologue about how he thinks  The absurdity in the story and its world was of the specific kind I care about    an absurdity that manages to parallel this world s absurdity but tinged with mystery  whimsy  and wonder  of course  It s the kind of absurdity that exists in the stupendous Doctor Who  which makes sense  and exists somewhat in Dead Like Me  I don t find much purpose for the other kind of absurdity  You know the kind  that ragged  empty  cold  fraught  and menacing absurdity that lives in the Batman s Joker and performance art projects by people with bold  asymmetrical hair cuts  Shudder  It s all right  I ve found my way back  I ll now take joy in reading Chris s hefty and timeworn Ultimate Hitchhiker s Guide  rather than approach it with the dread of potentially being shanked  Which is a good thing  no  It s all a joke  everything  And it s deliciously ridiculous Adams is an amazing rationalist  His humor comes from simple thoughts and actions we take for granted   What s so unpleasant about being drunk  By laughing and sympathising with this book  we are agreeing with our own natural human state  Just like in the book  nothing makes sense   not life  not the universe  not even Marvin   and the characters constantly question it Oh Marvin  I ve never loved something I also loathed   Pues me he divertido leyendo este libro como solo me pasa con los libros de Terry Pratchett  Es un humor con trasfondo  de los que te hacen parar a pensar y con un punto de humor absurdo y de reirse de uno mismo  en este caso la humanidad  que siempre viene bien  Este libro es un clasico de la ciencia ficcion y tiene motivos para serlo  A masterclass in how to write a first chapter  Drove my parents nuts after reading this by obnoxiously quoting long extended bits of it randomly  Loved it so much that I had a teeshirt made with the quote    Look Zaphod s just this guy you know      Needless to say I got a lot of odd looks    Love its quirky orginality and the way it satirises and plays with ideas  I d write a review  but I can t stop laughing Enough said   I love Adams s wit  Definitely one of the best books of all time  So much nonsense  and yet it all makes sense at the same time  It cannot be said that Douglas Adams leaves plotholes in his novels  because somehow he fixes them with an explanation that has nothing to do with anything  And it makes total sense  Sort of All of the characters are splendid  Arthur is probably the best person to go on an intergalactic adventure  and Ford and Zaphod are the best people to take him on it  Trillian is the best voice of reason possible  And Marvin    well  Marvin s just the best at everything  He is my absolute favorite How does one even explain how brilliant this book is  Great for every ageWas recommended this book by my co workers  One of the best books I have read in a while  I read many parts to my niece and nephew and they enjoyed the heck out of it  Great book  Hilarious  keeps you entertained to the end  The series kind of gets worse and worse but this is the best book of them all  Never feel the same after reading this book  I love the name Ford Prefect  Just saying Funny classic  Worth reading lots of times   I laughed out loud to this book so many times  I enjoyed that I did not realize when I d already been sucked into the plot  It seemed that I was suddenly well into the story  The characters in this book are all so unique  I loved it   FINALLY got around to this book  and I really really understand what all the love is about  Hilarious  clever  and so imaginative  Again  mind blown with foretelling of technology that didn t exist yet   namely the tablet ebook reader and touch screens  I would be surprised if I don t return to this books at least a couple of more times  I m definitely sold on reading the rest of the series    This book is about an average  ordinary human being  He befriends an alien named Ford Prefect and goes on some crazy wacky adventures  and meets some crazy wacky life beings  For example  he meets a guy who has two heads and three arms  He meets an alien race who s poetry is the third worst in the galaxy  He even meets a mechanically depressed robot  The setting is the galaxy  The entire galaxy  It is a sci fi book  and it is like Star Trek  but with a Monte Python humor twist  The main character s name is Arthur Dent  and he faces challenges like surviving the earth being blown up  somehow living for about a minute in space with no suit  and tolerating a depressed robot  This books humor is off worldly  hilariously funny  and it will be the best comrdy sci fi book you will ever read  If you are interested in sci fi  comedy  or both  you must read this book  It s the first in a series  by the way   Jack   mind boggingly  creative  and funny  haha   I gave this such a high rating because it was just a good break  It was funny and refreshing in how unusual it is  Lines like   The ships hung in the air in exactly the same way that bricks don t   left me scratching my head for a few moments  but then smiling  It s a very quick read  you could easily do it in a day  I m interested to read more from this series just to taste again his writing style  I read one of the 5 Hitchhiker books every year and I still snort and giggle out loud and make moderately serious mental notes to get entire paragraphs tattooed on me eventually Edit  My 2012 re read was actually the audio book  narrated by Stephen Fry  H2G2 and Stephen Fry  Perfection can be improved upon  it seems   I still love this book in all forms  Yes  partially because all forms are different  It s the whole parallel universe multiverse thing  Also  it s hilarious  Seldom in life do you ever come across a book with so many bizarre and wonderful ideas it spawns one of the most eccentric fan bases in the history of literature  Anyone who s ever gone to a science fiction convention in their dressing gown will know what I mean  The Hitch Hiker s Guide to the Galaxy is one of the most brilliant pieces of science fiction I ve ever read  I first read it when I was 14 after inheriting the primary phase of the original radio series on vinyl and I ve yet to find a book that rivals its cleverness and surrealism  Era 42  One of my all time favorite reads  I still laugh out loud very time I reread it  This remarkable book must have a category of its own  It combines an awesome sense of humor characeristic of this series with science fiction teetering on the boundary between scince and fantasy to answer some of life s biggest questions  But couched at the core is wonderful social commentary that will echo through to the gnab gib  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  Review Max Lopez p 6 7 The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy tells the tale of Arthur Doyle  the only survivor of the explosion of Earth  Earth is blown up to build a space bypass for aliens  and the humans have no warning  Arthur is saved by his friend  who is a n alien  and they hitchhike around the galaxy until they get to a acent planet  that makes planets The book appeared to raise the concept of karma  In the first chapter or two  there was a man trying to bulldoze Arthur s house  to build a bypass  About half an hour later  aliens tell the world that they are blowing up Earth  Just to build a bypass  I think that the author is really good at describing the setting just enough  not to much boring detail  but enough to imagine it  I think that the book affects the world  because it leaves a message based of the beginning   Do unto others  as you want them to do  or else it will happen to you  This is because the man learned quickly after he was a jerk to Arthur  he got payback  Finally  the author could work on his clarity  Sometimes  I was a little confused about what was going on  what point in time it was  and from what perspective If you want to read this book for yourself  I recommend that you should be able to read a lot all at once  and be able to comprehend it quickly  You should probably be in middle school or the end of elementary school  Absolutely love the book   why did I not read it before  Hilarious  a tale of how an Earthman survived earth destruction and went on intergalactic journey on a stolen spaceship  The sort of book i d want my kids to read  a comedic introduction to space  science and Infinite Improbability  Glad to know there s a Restaurant at the End of the Universe  A great book to end 2015  Don t panic    I love Douglas Adams  humor    LOVELOVELOVE       So witty i enjoyed it so much i finished it the same day i started it I found the book took a few chapters to get going but once it got going  I couldn t put it down   I literally read about 90  of the book in a day  It s light sci fi but if you re not into sci fi I reckon you ll still find this pretty accessible  although I m a big lover of sci fi so I could be a little bit biased  I thought it was very humorous as well  and I loved Marvin just as much as I did in the film  He really reminded me of Morrissey and of myself which I loved  I definitely want to go on and read the sequels  Ho sempre amato la fantascienza  e un genere che mi ha appassionato fin da bambino insieme al fantasy  oggi e difficile trovare dei buoni libri di Science Finction  Asimov rimarra per sempre un maestro insuperato e un po  come il fantasy dopo aver letto Tolkien sembra tutto stantio Questo libro pero  badate bene  non e solo fantascienza  filosofia  teologia e tantissima comicita mescolate insieme  con un ritmo da grandissimo romanziere  Decisamente   un capolavoro  Personaggi come Zaphod Beeblebrox rimangono scolpiti nella mente per anni e forse non ce ne dimenticheremo mai nella nostra vita da lettore  Adams riesce  attraverso situazioni paradossali ed assurde  a trattare i grandi temi della scienza e soprattutto della filosofia  con una freschezza ed un umorismo unico nel suo genere  possiamo sicuramente accostargli Pratchett per quello che e il fantasy  Questo e un libro  che attraverso le sue trovate paradossali e demenziali riuscira a mettere in dubbio perfino la vostra stessa esistenza Il linguaggio semplice e scorrevole  leggero e mai banale che non si dilunga in inutili quanto pesanti descrizioni  fanno arrivare i temi affrontati direttamente al lettore in maniera fresca e leggera  nonostante sia filosofia allo stato puro Mi ha fatto ridere  mi ha fatto riflettere e anche commuovere  penso che sia il massimo che puo dare un libro  Decisamente  stupendo http   kelanthsblog blogspot com  I loved this book  I can t believe I haven t read it before  Very funny and zany  Much better than the movie   An instant classic  some may say  A large amount of people believe that Douglas Adams  Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy is a must read  It is one of the most comical books out there it makes jokes from ever where from poetry to religion  It also has some great question about life such as what is the answer to the ultimate question of life the universe and everything  This is also a great read for people who enjoy science fiction will also enjoy this for the concepts like the hart of gold and infinite improbability  If all these things sound like something you would enjoy this is a must read  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy Douglas AdamsI wouldn t call myself a  reader   by that I mean I don t read at a lot  at all  But I have always been intrigued by this book  a friend growing up really enjoyed it and I kept hearing positive things about it on the internet  So I ve always wanted to read it at some point in my life  So when I was asked to review a book for my English class this seemed a good as time as any to finally buckle down and read it This book is slightly hard to summarize shortly  but I ll do my best  I would say this book is about Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent stumbling through the galaxy after Arthur s home  and planet earth  is destroyed My favorite thing about this book is the pacing  This book is paced perfectly from front to back  After about the first page this book does not stop  At no point was I even slightly bored  Just the way Adams writes sentence to sentence  flows perfectly  It s almost like sci fi poetry  And I really doubt any doesn t know this book is hilarious  It s just that perfect British humor delivered through science fiction  On a quick note Adams is amazing at building tension  I was on the edge of my seat  you could say  at some points I have no complaints with this book  It s probably because I m not that experienced with books  but I just thought this book was perfect  Although I guess some people might not like the very short chapters and the exposition segments  but I enjoyed them a whole lot There are 2 things that might offend some people  First  there is very  very occasional strong language  And secondly  there are some opinions on religion that might offend some that  really  cannot accept different opinions I would 100 percent recommend this book to anyone who enjoys sci fi  or just great humor  If I had to identify an audience for this book I think it would be a young adult audience to middle ages  but mostly people that enjoy or have grown up with sci fi  So if you enjoy British humor  tension  science fiction  or just a quality novel  pick The Hitchhiker s Guide To The Galaxy up  totally making a WoW toon named Majikthise   This book quite frankly has changed my life  It has made me look on the brighter side of life  And enjoy tea a lot more  Even with the world destroyed the har actress still keep there heads up high  Adams is quite frankly a geinius  At first he was difficult to read but as you realised that there would be jokes all the time and that they would sneak up on you you would read it with a new sense of delight  Must read  Warning sequals Hitchhiker s guide to the galaxy is the epitome of humor  It will cast you away into the depths of the unknown with dangers such as massive rocket missiles  torture including poetry  and incredibly depressed robots  It will take you on an adventure of extraordinary measures  and will keep you on the edge of your seat until every page is turned  The book enters the world of Arthur Dent  an ordinary man with ordinary issues who is thrown into a world of uncertainty  adventure  and chaos  The story takes place on plain old Earth     until it is destroyed by a race called the Vogons  Luckily he is saved my his comrade  Ford Prefect but he did not come from Earth  no  he came from a planet in the vicinity of Betelguese 5 as the book states countless times  Ford was a researcher for the book Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy but was stranded there for 15 years  When the Earth was destroyed the pair escaped into the Vogon spaceship where Arthur watched everything he had ever known and loved disintegrate into nothingness  While on the spaceship  the two were captured and tortured  Not by whip or suffocation but much worse    poetry  After the traumatic experience  the two are set out into space where the real adventure begins  Zaphod Beeblebrox was an alien  not too crazy with five heads and four arms but only two heads and three arms  He was announced President of the Universe a few days ago and was on his way to a conference  Once he reached the conference  the one thing that he spent 10 years of his life for sat in front of him  the Heart of Gold  The Heart of Gold was the fastest way of transport in the universe powered by none other than the Improbability Drive  At maximum power  the Improbability Drive zips through every point in the universe  Zaphod worked all those years just to steal it and he did along side his friend and companion Trillian At the exact moment that Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent were flying through space  the Heart of Gold saves them  Once aboard the Heart of Gold  we meet the incredibly depressed robot  Marvin and discover that Zaphod is Ford s semi cousin  Zaphod and Trillian are searching for the legendary planet Magraethea  known for making luxury planets  The seemingly impossible to find planet was found through their efforts  After finding the planet  the self defense mechanism activates launching missiles leaving them barely alive  Once on the planet  an old native takes Arthur into the planet while the others are seemingly kidnapped  The old native shows him that he actually built the Earth and is making plans for Earth Mk 11  The native tells him a story  long ago  a super computer was created on Earth roughly the size of a small city  The purpose of it was to find the Answer to Life  The Universe  and Everything and after 7 million years of calculation  it gave the answer as 42  Unsatisfied with the answer  the people created a new supercomputer to find the Question so that the Answer would have relevance  A few minutes before the computer would find the answer  the Vogons destroyed planet Earth  So they must re create the computer  Mice were the masterminds of the operation eating the wrong cheese and dying abruptly to conceal their identities and protect the Deep Thought  the supercomputer  The mice believed that an uncompleted version of the question could be located inside Arthur s brain  as he is apparently a biological product of a computer  After discovering this  they offer to buy his brain to no avail  The tension grows  as mice are about to cut into Arthur s brain  Horns across the planet blow as a result  allowing the gang to escape in the chaos  They then go to the Restaurant at the End of the Universe for lunch as the adventure continues  As you can see from my summary review of the book  it will keep you at the edge of your seat and the suspense will keep you there wanting more  It tests friendship  trust  and loyalty in this action packed thriller and hilarious comedy  The fact that truly blows my mind is that the book was written in 1979  and included ideas such as touch  sensitive screens  which we now use in our everyday lives  The amount of visual description and imagery truly caught me off guard and the surprisingly accurate predictions that Adams created still keep me wondering  This book has kept me on the edge of my seat combining action  adventure  and comedy  A concern I have is in the ending of the book  I found that the book ended a little abruptly and could have had more depth around the ending  Another concern is the beginning  it seemed to start slow even though the slow start was necessary for a full understanding later in the novel  The rest of the novel was indeed superb and entertaining  leaving the reader itching for more  All in all  an amazing book and a must read  This was always my all time favorite book  Ever since my dad read it to me in 3rd grade  I never loved another book so much  It is a little confusing at first  but soon enough you get a hang of how Douglas Adams writes and it just becomes amazing  Though the story jumps around a little bit  it s still fairly easily to follow  I would highly recommend this book to anyone  Douglas Adams s satirical novel is one of few books that has caused me to actually laugh out loud  Adams is successful in bringing together deep philosophical questions and satirical elements that complement each other well  It will leave you questioning Western forces in politics  law enforcement and capitalism  It would be quite depressing if not for the dead pan humor Adams employs   I first read this book when I was in high school  back when dinosaurs walked the earth  people still thought digital watches were a pretty cool idea  and mobile phones were the size of a suitcase I enjoyed it at least as much this time  Humor is subjective  and I still find it bloody hilarious  If you don t enjoy Monty Python esque British humor it may not be your cup of Earl Grey  but it still works for me  I do a lot of my reading on the train  in coffee shops   and while waiting in doctors  offices  I kept getting funny looks because I couldn t help snorting and giggling as I read I mean  seriously  A character named Slartibartfast  Come on  say it with me and smile  On a serious note  I am amazed by the writer s accurate vision of the future  Reality is  indeed getting more and more like science fiction every day  Adams wrote this book in an age when few of us had even used a computer  never mind carrying one around in our pocket  and yet The Hitchhiker s Guide of the title is an electronic book which is basically a Smartphone  I can t recommend this highly enough  and remember  the ultimate answer to life  the universe  and everything is     42 Read the book  and its sequels  and maybe you ll figure out what the question is  Sometimes I read a book that gives me true anxiety to rate  I wonder if it would actually be better if I just drank a bottle of wine before rating or writing a review for these books because everything is so easy to me when I m drinking wine   laughing  joking  eating  falling  Everything  But I can t do that because I rarely drink to excess  and by unlucky happenstance  those rare moments have never coincided with the completion of a book  Go figure  So  here I am in a quandary   what do I think about this book  Well  I thought it was clever and irreverent  I was entertained and amused and generally liked all of the major players and I want to see the movie  which is indeed an endorsement  no But I wondered  what the point of it all was  Was there anything resolved  What was the conflict to begin with  How the heck did Trillion know to grab the mice  Is she actually from Earth and why is her name Trillian instead of Trisia McMillan   Are they gonna float a new Earth out there or what  And can someone  please  fry Marvin s motherboard  But really  what was the point  Then  suddenly and slowly I hear echoes of  42  in answer  laugh and give it 5 stars  Well played  book    This book is adorably comedic in so many ways  In a nutshell  this book includes  a galactic hitchhiker  a horrified human  the president of the universe  a lost planet  and a depressed robot  I find Adams  slapstick comedic aura to be intriguing and to leave me wanting more   Adams starts off by throwing you  the reader  into the life of a man whose only major dilemma is that his house is being demolished  even if Earth s impending demolition is hours away  The hitchhiker and the man have become friends over the 5 years the hitchhiker has been stuck on Earth  This causes the hitchhiker to save his friend  From there  Adams paints a gorgeous picture that leaves you laughing with every brush stroke  Possibly my favourite book ever  Adams  completely unique style  tone  plots  and logic make this one of the most interesting reads   and the entire series of books follows suit  The twisted logic messes with you in ways you would never expect  and the most annoying characters become your favourites  A definite must read for anyone who loves comedy or sci fi  Very entertaining if quirky  E  incredibile      ma veramente incredibile  Se penso che  stato scritto 31 anni fa non ci credo  Ho riso due giorni  Ma non riso come si ride leggendo un libro  riso alle lacrime  da contorsioni      assolutamente geniale  e non  superficiale  le risposte le ha  eccome      Fantastico  Un delitto aver aspettati 31 anni a leggerlo       This book    every single time I read this it makes me laugh  It is so absurd and witty and fun    so fun  Adams has woven a bunch of crazy complicated jokes and ideas throughout the story  and it is exciting to catch them each time they resurface  I have read this book at least once a year since 1998 and I still love it  That was the most ridiculous thing I have ever read     I loved it  Hilarious  satirical  and brilliant  Douglas Adams is extremely creative and takes the most random ideas and weaves them together to make a story that s so ridiculous it just has to stand for something deeper  What I got out of the book was to not take things so seriously  and however improbable something is  it isn t impossible   Story about earthling who is rescued from Earth destruction and set to unlikely trip in space and new worlds The best thing about this book  in addition of it being funny  is that you never know what happens next  Full of brilliant ideas and concepts  This does contain spoilers  but the story is less of a part of the book than the humor in my opinion   the plot is still good though  Arthur Dent wakes up to the vague sense that something is wrong  After some time  he realizes there are bulldozers on his front lawn  getting ready to knock his house down to make way for a highway  Soon afterwards  His friend Ford Prefect reveals he s an alien from a small planet in the vicinity of Betelgeuse  He has come to update the Hitchhikers guide to the galaxy and got stranded  Ford comes to Arthur and tells him the earth is going to be destroyed to create a hyperspace bypass Ford and Arthur hitchhike on one of the Vogon ships sent to demolish earth  The captain on the ship isn t happy  and he throws them out into space to almost certain death   Meanwhile  Zaphod Beeblebrox  The president of the galaxy and Fords childhood friend  He also happens to have two heads and three arms   steals a space ship called the heart of gold with Trillian  Zaphod s human girlfriend  and Marvin a permanently miserable robot   It is run by something called the infinite improbability drive  This engine is on the cutting edge of space ship propulsion  As Zaphod hurtles through space  he inadvertently picks up Ford and Arthur  This is unfathomably improbable  but  because the infinite probability drive being on at full throttle  it is almost infinitely probable for this to happen comparatively   On their journey through the galaxy  they find the great legendary planet of Magrathea  The planet is considered to be deserted 5 million years ago  No one has ever found this planet before but Zaphod  with the help of his miraculous ship and strange signals from a closed off part of his brain  somehow managed to  Before they land on the planet  two missiles are fired at them  They turn into a sperm whale and a bowl of petunias   Again  the improbability drive   Once they land on Magrathea  Arthur and the others split up into groups  Ford  Trillian and Zaphod go down a crater into the interior of the planet  while Arthur is picked up by an old fellow who calls himself Slartibartfast  He tells Arthur that the planet earth was commissioned  paid for and run by mice to try to find the question to the ultimate answer  After building a computer to find out  What Is The Answer To Life  The Universe  And Everything    42 by the way   They need to find out what the question actually means  The earth was supposed to do this  Sadly  It was destroyed five minutes before the completion of the purpose it was built for  Slartibartfast takes arthur to the mice and they want to take his brain to find the data about the question in it  They say they sill pay him generously and give him a mechanical brain programed so he wouldn t know the difference  He politely declines  and they politely try to bash his brains out  Arthur makes his escape with the others and the book ends with them hurtling away from Margrathea I loved the humor of this book  There are short chapters of irony and philosophical debate that almost makes sense  but not quite  If you like a kind of matter of fact humor  then this is the book for you  Here is one of many examples Now it is such a bizarrely improbable coincidence that anything so mindbogglingly useful as the babel fish could have evolved purely by chance that some thinkers have chosen to see it as the final and clinching proof of the non existence of God  The argument goes something like this   I refuse to prove that I exist   says God   for proof denies faith  and without faith I am nothing    But   says Man   The Babel fish is a dead giveaway  isn t it  It could not have evolved by chance  It proves you exist  and so therefore  by your own arguments  you don t  QED    Oh dear   says God   I hadn t thought of that   and promptly vanished in a puff of logic  Oh  that was easy   says Man  and for an encore goes on to prove that black is white and gets himself killed on the next zebra crossing  I remember getting this book hot off the press through the Science Fiction Book Club  I loved it so much that I anxiously awaited each of the next four books in the trilogy  The weird humor is irresistible  I highly recommend reading all of the books in this trilogy  I now have my daughter hooked on the series as well  It doesn t matter how many time you read this book you still look like the crazy person giggling away on the bus  This is one of my all time favorite books  Clever  funny  entertaining  not a dull moment  top of top A quick fun read that has me wanting to read more of this series  A great book to read in between serious novels   The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams was a really enjoyable book  It follows the adventure of Arthur Trent  a most ordinary Earthling from England  and how he is whisked out of his planet by his friend  Ford Prefect  who happens to be an extra  terrestrial   when evil Vogons come to demolish Earth to make way for a hyper  space bypass  Arthur  Ford  Ford s cousin and ex  President of the Galaxy  Zaphod Beeblebrox  and another Earthling Tricia McMillan  who decides to change her name to Trillian in order to fit in  embark on a journey to find the Ultimate Ruler of the Universe  The book is overall comic  using satire to mask some of the darker events  An example of this is how abruptly and simply Adams describes the end of Earth  He does it in three sentences   There was a terrible ghastly silence  Then there was a terrible ghastly noise  There was a terrible ghastly silence   Doing this  it doesn t make the reader uncomfortable or slightly put off from reading the rest of the book  Otherwise  Adams combines irony and humour to make the reader laugh out loud at some parts  such as when Marvin  a despondent robot  tries to have a chat with the main computer of the enemy s ship  causing the computer to commit suicide and the ship to be destroyed  Finally  Adams describes the Galaxy in a warped  exaggerated but yet hilarious way  I thoroughly enjoyed the book  and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good science  fiction  humour book  Effing brilliant  It is unfortunate that I waited so long to read this book  but better late than never  I won t list my favorite quotes from it as that would take too long and it might just be the entire book  So  don t panic  hold onto your towel  and read  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy   But don t start it on a Thursday  Many people just can t get the hang of Thursdays   SciFi   Comedy is unquestionably one of the craziest and most entertaining combinations in the world Even then  this shit happens to be ridiculously absurd In its own words  more or less   this is the story of a terrible stupid catastrophe and some of its consequences It is also the story of a book  a book called  The Hitch Hiker s Guide to the Galaxy    not an Earth book never published on Earth  and until the terrible catastrophe occurred  never seen or heard of by any Earthman Not only is it a wholly remarkable book  it is also a highly successful one  I have to agree with that  Here s an excerpt  The Hitch Hiker s Guide to the Galaxy has a few things to say on the subject of towels A towel  it says  is about the most massively useful thing an interstellar hitch hiker can have Partly it has great practical value   you can wrap it around you for warmth as you bound across the cold moons of Jaglan Beta you can lie on it on the brilliant marble sanded beaches of Santraginus V  inhaling the heady sea vapours you can sleep under it beneath the stars which shine so redly on the desert world of Kakrafoon use it to sail a mini raft down the slow heavy river Moth wet it for use in hand to hand combat wrap it round your head to ward off noxious fumes or to avoid the gaze of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal  a mindboggingly stupid animal  it assumes that if you can t see it  it can t see you   daft as a bush  but very ravenous  you can wave your towel in emergencies as a distress signal and of course dry yourself off with it if it still seems to be clean enough More importantly  a towel has immense psychological value  For some reason  if a strag  strag  non hitch hiker  discovers that a hitch hiker has his towel with him  he will automatically assume that he is also in possession of a toothbrush  face flannel  soap  tin of biscuits  flask  compass  map  ball of string  gnat spray  wet weather gear  space suit etc   etc  Furthermore  the strag will then happily lend the hitch hiker any of these or a dozen other items that the hitch hiker might accidentally have  lost   What the strag will think is that any man who can hitch the length and breadth of the galaxy  rough it  slum it  struggle against terrible odds  win through  and still knows where his towel is is clearly a man to be reckoned with  Alright then  armed with a copy of the guide  my polka dots towel  and a sasta yet tikau spacesuit  I think I m all set for my hitchhike  B   This sci fi comedic adventure story is not meant to be taken seriously  This is clearly communicated in the destruction of the earth in the beginning chapters to make way for an intergalactic bypass  an event that satirizes the bureaucratic method of transparent communication  really the  public  notices are shoved into an inconvenient corner and never discussed with anyone   Arthur Dent is our unlikely hero who never does anything heroic as alien Ford Prefect drags him around the universe and teaches him all sorts of important things  such as the essential nature of towels and the answer to life  the universe  and everything Basically  if you consider yourself a geek in any sense of the word  you need to read this book  really the entire series  If you want something witty and honest  but at the same time completely silly  then you need to read this book  Just read the book  Or have Stephen Fry read you the audiobook I admit  I m biased  I just love this book  Douglas Adams has a brilliant sense of humor and I m a sucker for his unconventional use of language   The ships hung in the sky in much the same way that bricks don t   Who writes sentences like that   In the beginning the Universe was created  This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move   Poking fun at our existence in general  Sign me up He s created an everyman character in Arthur Dent who I relate to on a number of levels  ordinary life  don t want to deal with the drudgery  dealing with it anyway  insecurities  etc  He addresses the results of good intentioned technology gone wrong  touches upon the nature of humanity  and boggles the mind with one in a zillion coincidences that are nothing short of a sure thing Adams never gets very deep  but he touches on issues that could very well get someone thinking more deeply  In my world  that is satire done right  Just read it  Then share and enjoy   Mild language  No sexual issues  Violence includes the destruction of earth and all humanity  though this takes place off scene  Alcohol consumption is discussed  Adams touches upon religious and political issues using a foundation of well known philosophical ideas  This could be offensive to some readers  but honestly  this book isn t for those who take themselves so seriously   This review can also be found at   http   loadedshelves blogspot co uk 2   LOVED this book  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy has been on my to read list for a long time now and recently I was fortunate enough to get my hands on the  trilogy  of five for my kindle  thanks to a friend  Because i d waited so long to actually read it  I was worried that my expectations would be too high  but there was no need From the first few pages  Adams had me laughing out loud and I immediately fell in love with Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect  The interaction between them was pure genius and it just got better as the book progressed Originally  I had planned to read these books physically and not electronically  but after the description of the Hitchhiker s Guide  I felt more happier about it and it added to the experience in a way that would be hard to explain  The concept of this book and  with little spoilers  the events involving the mice and computers especially were brilliant  I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a fun read with fantastic characters and an absolute crazy plot  It feels like you are trying to do mental back flips while trying to read this  The story although slightly bizarre makes as much sense as any other explanation for the world   mn Hly ktb lthys lly qrth One major internal conflict in this book was in Arthur  He couldn t stop thinking about how Earth was completely destroyed  and how he was probably the human left  Because of this  he was often sad throughout the story  Regardless of this conflict  I believe this book was extremely funny and imaginative  earning a permanent spot on my favorite books of all time  An excellent work which has a wit about it that i have rarely encountered anywhere else The book can be read by anybody and still be considered wonderful because of the many levels of depth that reside within one single passage  I loved the writing in The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy  I could not love the writing more  sure I could go through the book and provide you with classic quotes but I won t  I will tell you that I understand the hype and subculture surrounding this collection  I am at peace now   It s Adams  With Fry  Of course I give it five stars   The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is a science fiction novel by Douglas Adams  After Earth is destroyed  Arthur Dent finds himself on a space ship with his Alien friend Ford Prefect  the president of the Galaxy Zaphod Beezlebub  and former Earthling Trillian  They set out to find the mythical planet of Magrathea and have some fun adventures This book is really amusing  There isn t really much of a plot  but the writing is very clever and humorous  As a science fiction nerd  I found a lot of it hilarious  and the characters are interesting and funny  The plot is interspersed with excerpts from The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  a literal how to guide  which give the reader amusement and an idea of the universe they ve been thrown in to  I think this is the first book of four  which explains why there isn t really any resolution and many questions are left unanswered The book spends much of the time focusing on why the universe exists  The second smartest computer in the world decides the answer is 42  but what really is the question  Adams says that humans are actually the third smartest species on Earth  after mice and dolphins  The whole book seems to be saying that you have to find out your reason for existing yourself  Go out there and hitchhike and find something to do with your life  The answer isn t the problem  it s the question  You have to find the right question  and then the answer will make sense  This book is basically Doctor Who mixed with Monty Python  I m not a huge scifi novel fan and I devoured this book  If you want to slowly make your way into the scifi novel genre  this is a great start  It is extremely funny and I got many strange looks in my chemistry class for literally laughing out loud  What s great about this book is it s one of the books teachers won t mind you reading in class  because most of them have read it  I ve only read the first book in this series  but I m anxiously awaiting to read the next novel  this book was hilarious  it had me laughing out loud  the very idea of it was   ridiculous  in a good way that being said  there were one or two things i did not like  i did not like the amount of time spent trying to convince the reader God does not exist  it is a sci fi  not a philosophical work excepting that  i really enjoyed this book and am looking forward to the sequel  As you may have guessed if you have read the book that my last review was about  one of the reasons I chose to read Hitchhiker s was because it is mentioned as an entertaining read in Among Others  I also figured since it is one of the most well known science fiction novels of all time  it would be a good thing to read  even though I don t usually read science fiction I am so glad I finally decided to read it  The entertainment value    wow  There are a LOT of good things about this book  it is not a factory of emotional ruin that steals your soul and permanently taints it with tears   cough TheChaos WalkingTrilogy cough TheHungerGames cough    The events which could be heart wrenching  like  you know  the destruction of Earth within the first 50 pages or so  are not  because it s simply not written that way  Though it s not written in such a way as to be aiming for comedy either  It s incredibly clever and kind of obliviously witty and    I can t really think of any other way to describe it  The number of  oh    moments I had while reading this book is slightly ridiculous    oh   at the writing   oh   at a plot development   oh   at a funny line said by a character   oh   at a sudden realization I love the characters  I like Arthur Dent  the protagonist  how he doesn t seem like much and then he surprises you with his intelligence and quick thinking  and how well he takes the end of the world  but still in a relatively realistic way  I mean he still freaks out a little   I also really like Ford Prefect  I love the conversations between them and I look forward to more laughs in the subsequent books  And Trillian seems like she could be an interesting character if she is developed more in said subsequent books  As for Zaphod  I find him very difficult to imagine  While I find it easy to envision countless random made up magical creatures while reading fantasy books  apparently it is more difficult when it is simply a human being with a second head and a third arm   It is now Dalia s Quote Time  Here are the passages I bookmarked as I read The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy   Ford beckoned to Prosser who sadly  awkwardly  sat down in the mud  He felt as if his whole life was some kind of dream and he sometimes wondered whose it was and whether they were enjoying it     pg  15Oh  yes  an excellent example of the bizarre conversations that take place between Arthur and Ford    Good God   said Arthur   it looks just like the sea front at Southend   Hell  I m relieved to hear you say that   said Ford  Because I thought I must be going mad   Perhaps you are  Perhaps you only thought I said it  Ford thought about this   Well  did you say it or didn t you   he asked  I think so   said Arthur  Well  perhaps we re both going mad   Yes   said Arthur   we d be mad  all things considered  to think this was Southend   Well  do you think this is Southend   Oh yes   So do I   Therefore we must be mad   Nice day for it   Yes   said a passing maniac  Who was that   asked Arthur  Who  the man with the five heads and the elderberry bush full of kippers   Yes   I don t know  Just someone   Ah      pg  70 It kind of ends with an example of the randomness of this book too    anyway  moving on  Oh  this is a line that made me laugh out loud  it s still when Ford and Arthur are first in the Infinite Improbability Drive thing  so just after the above conversation  and Arthur s arms and legs start falling off and then    Ford   he said   you re turning into a penguin  Stop it      pg  72I think it just made me laugh because of how matter of fact ly he says it  in fact they re both amazingly matter of fact throughout this entire sequence of events  it s one of the things that is so entertaining  Anyway    Isn t it enough to see that a garden is beautiful without having to believe that there are fairies at the bottom of it too      pg  101That was an  Oh   moment but mainly because I disagree with the suggestion and it gave me a rather excellent idea for incorporating that quote into one of my story ideas  But you don t need to know about that yet Ah  yes  I m at my  that moment when  moment  THAT MOMENT WHEN YOU REALIZE THAT THIS BOOK IS THE ORIGIN OF OUR SOCIETY S UNRECOGNIZED INFATUATION WITH THE NUMBER 42  You know how people like to say that the answer to everything is 42  Well yeah  but I didn t know that that originally came from Hitchhiker s     And you re ready to give it to us   urged Loonquawl  I am   Now   Now   said Deep Thought They both licked their dry lips  Though I don t think   added Deep Thought   that you re going to like it   Doesn t matter   said Phouchg   We must know it  Now   Now   enquired Deep Thought  Yes  Now     All right   said the computer and settled into silence again  The two men fidgeted  The tension was unbearable  You re really not going to like it   observed Deep Thought  Tell us   All right   said Deep Thought   The Answer to the Great Question     Yes      Of Life  the Universe and Everything     said Deep Thought  Yes      Is     said Deep Thought  and paused  Yes      Is     Yes            Forty two   said Deep Thought  with infinite majesty and calm     pg  152That was probably my biggest  Oh   moment  Now      Maybe  Who cares   said Slartibartfast before Arthur got too excited   Perhaps I m old and tired   he continued   but I always think that the chances of finding out what really is going on are so absurdly remote that the only thing to do is to say hang the sense of it and just keep yourself occupied  Look at me  I design coastlines  I got an award for Norway      pg  161   Science has achieved some wonderful things  of course  but I d rather be happy than right any day   And are you   No  That s where it falls down  of course   Pity   said Arthur with sympathy   It sounded like quite a good lifestyle otherwise      also pg  161Oh  my last bookmark seems to be about poor Marvin  the manically depressed robot   Ford stayed  and went to examine the Blagulon ship  As he walked  he nearly tripped over an inert steel figure lying face down in the cold dust   Marvin   he exclaimed   What are you doing   Don t feel you have to take any notice of me  please   came a muffled drone  But how are you  metalman   said Ford  Very depressed   What s up   I don t know   said Marvin   I ve never been there   Why   said Ford squatting down beside him and shivering   are you lying face down in the dirt   It s a very effective way of being wretched   said Marvin   Don t pretend you want to talk to me  I know you hate me   No I don t   Yes you do  everybody does  It s part of the shape of the Universe  I only have to talk to somebody and they begin to hate me  Even robots hate me  If you just ignore me I expect I shall probably go away      pg  179How pitifully sad is that  Is it weird that I nearly shed tears for this poor fictional robot  Well I m not going to dny it  He s adorable and sad and his life  or lack of it   quite frankly  sucks Anyway  that s the last of my bookmarks  One of the things that astonished me about this book  and I m sure I ve talked about this before with other amazingly surreal books  was how relatively comprehensible the story was considering that approximately 0  of it makes any sort of logical sense  Yes  I realize that that sentence was essentially an oxymoron  but that does not change the fact that it is true I keep wanting to end the review but then I think of more things I want to say  I don t want to forget anything  Okay  I think the only other thing I wanted to say was that I love how much foreshadowing there is in the book  foreshadowing without spoilers  By that  of course  I mean the references to the titles of the other books  the last reference being to the title of the second book  The Restaurant at the End of the Universe I didn t realize when I first decided to read The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy that it was actually a part of a series  or as the back of the book says   volume one in a trilogy of five   And yes I realize that is illogical  As I ve pointed out  most of this book is based entirely on illogical fragments of brilliance  And for this reason  among others  I am entirely excited to begin making my way through the rest of the series  I recommend this book to everyone  I call these  Oh   moments because I don t really know how else to describe the feeling  That s basically what my mind brain feels like it s doing when I come across a particularly beautiful phrase or a revelation or an amazingly clever pun  The term is fairly versatile  but I hope you can somewhat understand what I mean by it     I have no idea how Douglas Adams can weave such extremely crazy thought patterns  but I really enjoyed this book  D It was funny  exciting  adventurous and still had some hidden deeper thoughts    I honestly can think of no greater work of genius to grace the Earth than the work of Douglas Adams  This book should be required reading for students  And not students  There should be a mandatory reading of this book for every human  so no one has to miss it  My bible  This came up in topic the other day  and it occurred to me that it had been a few years  so this is either a 3rd or 4th rereading  Honestly  this is one of the few books I know I can reread and it is still awesome  This book stands the test of time  I still love it   One of my favorite books ever  I have the complete series compiled into one book  and I absolutely love how one book flows into the next  making all one big  comedy soaked adventure  This is one of the only books I have obsessively read  I m in the middle of the third book  Life  The Universe  and Everything  currently   It s a British Sci Fi classic for a reason  I found it very hard to put it down and found it both series let light hearted at the same time  Marvin makes me laugh but it is a kind of pitiful laughter  It s a must read  During the summer I read The Hitchhiker s guide to the galaxy  a comedy science fiction by Douglas Adams  The book is about Arthur Dent who is taken out of Earth right before it is demolished to make room for a galactic free way  Arthur travels the galaxy with his alien friend who was exploring earth and pretending to be human in order to revise the book  The Hitchhiker s guide to the galaxy   Together the two travel the galaxy following the guide  I really enjoyed the book and would recommend it to anyone who likes a good story and to laugh as well  Infinite Improbability  So interesting  So I m cheating a little on my goodreads goal for 2014 since I actually listened to the BBC radio production and technically not the book  but it s close enough and the radio show came first   What can I tell about the book  Other than that one has to read to experience the kinky hilarity  the improbability which almost seems probable  especially the fact that mice are a more evolved species than homo sapiens  the crash course to the galaxy offered by the Hitchhikers guide and the various hilarious strangely named characters  Arthur Dent  the only earthling being the sanest amongst them all  I found my soul mate in Marvin  the permanently depressed robot  We both have the same favourite sentence   I hate        This is one of my favorite books  I love the simple way to see life in this hilarious way  Dont panic  changed my life  Douglas Adams s Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is the satirical response to humanities  big questions     what s the meaning of life  why am I here  how does the imbalance of global wealth affect everyone  is there meaning within the scope of the universe  and is answered with another question  should we have bothered coming down from the trees in the first place It is suggested that once you know the correct question  you will know what the answer is  To figure this out  always bring your towel  Accept that nothing is what it seems  Develop a higher regard for lab rats as they are at the helm  of everything  And that s that  The only book my husband has ever read  It s fast paced and clever  If you like science  especially physics  you will find this book hilarious  if you don t  it may not be for you unless you just like reading very funny books  Our story begins on a Thursday with a very hungover Arthur Dent who  unbeknownst to him is about to have his house destroyed in order to make way for a new bypass  Little did he know that there were bigger things afoot  Enter Ford Prefect  Arthur s best friend  After a bit of clever wordplay  Arthur and Ford head to the pub  and then  the entire Earth is destroyed by a Vogon constructor fleet in order to make way for an intergalactic hyper expressway  Luckily for Arthur  Ford just happened to be an alien  who was able hitch a ride on one of the Vogon ships thanks to the ships cooks  who hated the Vogons  Ford explains that he is a field researcher for an intergalactic encyclopedia known simply as  The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy   After having a translating fish shoved into his ear  Arthur and Ford began their wacky adventures across the galaxy  That is  after they are thrown out of the Vogon ship and into the massive vacuum of space  But  thanks to the infinite improbability drive  they are picked up by the starship Heart of Gold  Then they meet an assortment of strange characters  including a chronically depressed robot  the two headed  three armed president of the universe  a man who built planets and whose name is not important  a pair of pan dimensional beings disguised as mice  and most importantly  a woman   This book was originally a radio series on BBC Radio written and produced by Douglas Adams  who also wrote episodes of the hit BBC television show Doctor Who  The book and its sequels would later be adapted to a BBC television mini series and a feature film  The description in this book is just phenomenal  It really makes you feel like you are traveling amongst the stars  Often  the  Guide  will chime in and give a bit of useful information on a subject or event  Some might say this interrupts the flow of the story  but I think it makes it better  It adds to the immersion factor  As you read you really relate with Arthur  He is just this normal  run of the mill guy  who is thrown into this bizarre situation which he can t decide if he wants to be a part of or not  The plot is all over the place  and yet the entire story is fairly cohesive and whole  Overall this is a fantastic read  and I encourage you to read the other books in the series as well  You will probably enjoy this book if you like Doctor Who and other science fiction  I think you will also enjoy this book if you enjoy Monty Python  or any kind of British humor  Till next time  know where your towel and don t panic  Hilarious  light  and extremely odd    what s not to love   For instance  on the planet Earth  man had always assumed that he was more intelligent than dolphins because he had achieved so much  the wheel  New York  wars and so on  whilst all the dolphins had ever done was muck about in the water having a good time  But conversely  the dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent than man  for precisely the same reasons  You ll either love it  to an extent that you ll find it hard to put it down for some mundane humanly businesses  or you ll simply hate it and find it extremely tedious to go beyond first 20 pages of mindless action  but there is no way you can finish the book without experiencing one of the either emotions  I tried reading this book some three  or maybe four  years back  on the persistent insistence of my best friend Afshan Majid  a staunch loyalist of Hitchhiker s Guide     Then  I couldn t even reach 20 pages and gave it up somewhere at third page  or so i guess  And  of course  declared it unreadable  But  now  having lived three  or yeah  maybe four  more years of mostly harmless live on this mostly harmless planet  I have come close to beliving that dolphins are indeed far more intellegent than man for exactly the same reason that s mentioned above Creative  mindless  whacky and an unstoppable joyride is what Hitchhiker s Guide    is all about  Thanks Afshan Majid for introducing me to this cosmic treat before Earth could possibly be demolished to make way for a new hyperspace bypass     There s really nothing I can say that hasn t been said about this book  It s great  It s funny  it s witty  and it makes you think  It s more philosophical than most give it credit for This should be on your to read list if you haven t given this one the time yet   It s one of those books you simply have to read to believe  A good book makes you want to read it again and again  This is one of those books  Happy birthday  Douglas Adams     This is a personal favorite of mine  Mostly because when I was a kid  we had an Apple IIc  computer  and the text based game version of this book on floppy disk  And I played it relentlessly  Then in college  the movie came out and I loved it  Then i read the book and discovered that the romantic element in the movie is not in the book at all  But I loved the book too  And the movie  And the game  Loved it  My absolute  all time favorite book is the very product featured on this page  It captures the imagination with its silliness almost too well  The book follows Arthur Dent  newly homeless  as he travels the galaxy with his best friend Ford Prefect in search for a new planet to call home  all done while heeding the guidelines   Don t Panic  and  Bring a Towel   Earth has been destroyed  and some crazy computer answers  42  as the  Answer to Life  the Universe  and Everything   The story s infinitely improbable plot only adds to the fun  Where other Science Fiction books and stories are usually serious  often gritty  the Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy offers a drastic change of pace for many sci fi lovers  like myself  The novel is only one of six in the  appropriately misnamed   trilogy   five of these books written by Douglas Adams  It is a short read  less than two hundred pages  especially because you may find yourself unable to put it down  I know that was my encounter  Originally a broadcast radio series from 1978  the story still holds relevance as one of the most beloved British comedies to ever grace the  Mostly Harmless  planet Earth  I would highly recommend this book  almost to the point of saying this is the only  must read  book ever    of all time    seriously   as well as the other five of the trilogy  to anyone looking for a chuckle  If you want something dark  gritty  non fictional  or boring OR if you have no sense of humor  this book is not for you  What mind Douglas Adams must ve had  For anyone else  it could have been terrifying traipsing around upstairs inside his head  but lucky for us  he took his elite  creative intelligence and mixed it up with a wonderful sense of humor to create an extremely entertaining cocktail of a story Through the eyes of Ford Prefect  Galaxy Hitchhiker  and Arthur Dent  Earthling sans planet  we re off on a series of adventures that leave the reader raising an eyebrow  pondering the possibilities  and often in stitches  You ll never look at mice the same again  V pervyi raz chitala let 7 nazad  seichas rzhala bol she   One of the cleverest  funniest and loopy series I ve read to date  Possibly a bit on the nerdy side  but it widened my imagination and reminded me to never forget a towel   The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy is a humorous and exciting novel by Douglas Adams  I enjoyed the book thoroughly and it obtained my attention throughout  I applaud the author s ability to have complete ludicracy and an interesting plot at the same time  The Literature continues at a fast pace from beginning to end and was definitely worth every minute of my time  Though at times it is hard to follow I would definitely recommend this witty novel to a friend as it can be enjoyed by near everyone  4 5 out of 5 Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  by Douglas Adams  is a cleverly written comedy and science fiction story  It follows the small life of a man named Arthur Dent and his alien friend  Ford Prefect  hitchhiking off of about to be destroyed Earth and facing challenges that they were completely unprepared for  One foggy Earth day  somewhere in Britain  Arthur Dent finds out that both his house and his planet are going to be destroyed for the same thing  a road  Quickly  Ford Prefect takes Arthur out to get a drink at his favorite pub when Ford asks  Do you have a towel   And off Arthur and Ford went  teleported onto the Vogons mothership  the Vogons are the aliens destroying Earth for a giant space road   facing obstacles unknown to any human being  and doing all of that with their towels  This book was an amazing book because of how funny  creative  and outright random it is  The names are outrageous  the scenarios are dangerous  and the characters reactions are hilarious  But  the real reason for this book being so great  towels  In nearly every situation Ford  Arthur  Trillian  Arthur Dent s beautiful human acquaintance and Zaphod Beeblebrox s brilliant human companion    Zaphod Beeblebrox  President of the Universe   and Marvin  a severely depressed robot servant  get into  towels save the day  Or more accurately  the universe In conclusion  Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy was a hilarious and crazy book that made me laugh nearly every second I read it  Adams created an unimaginably sassy world full of thrillers and excitement  like towels saving the universe  robots with attitude and emotion  ahem  depression   Earth being destroyed for universal public transportation  and a President of the Universe  All in all  I feel that the message Douglas Adams was getting at in this book is  don t go anywhere without a towel  You need to like Monty python to like this book  but you ll love it just as much if you do  Who doesn t like super intelligent mice   Life  ignore it or loathe it  you cannot like it   and God vanished in a puff of logic   The words that come out of Douglas Adams are pure magic  The book gives you so many perspectives about life  universe and everything  It literally made me laugh at many points which i didn t know a book could do  This book is sheer excellence  if you have the taste for it  It drew me in with the one liners and British humor  but I stayed for the implications about coincidence  probability  and the meaning of life  There are some big  important social issues and life lessons in this book  and Adams skates right through them  nailing the message that life should not be taken too seriously  but if you get caught without a towel  that s your own fault   One of my favorite books of all time  My review wouldn t even do it justice  I would just like to say that it helped influence not only my writing  but my thinking as well  I now carry a towel everywhere I go  and do my best not to panic    ever  Read this book   I thought I had written this up when I read it before  was that the third time I read it   We have read the book  played the video game  heard the radio series  and watched the tv version  We enjoyed them all  but you really have to pay attention to the radio   tv because it is so easy to miss details and it is difficult to read fast enough on the tv version to get the entire H G  quotes before the story resumes  There is no way that you can do the book justice by describing the plot because it just sounds lame   a travel guide writer  trapped on earth for 15 years hitches a ride on an interstellar construction ship and takes along an acquaintance whose house is about to be demolished  They escape just as the construction ship demolishes earth and are rescued by an old friend s space ship when the construction ship captain doesn t like their reviews of his poetry  You see  It is tremendously funny and by the end you will know how important the number 42 is  although you won t know why  I love this book so much    This book has been a favorite of mine for quite some time  The storyline is wonderfully absurd and is definitely more on the humorous side of science fiction  Douglas Adam s wit is impeccable and this novel is only the first in a very hilarious series of a misfits stumbling through the galaxy   This is an amazing book  I ll start by saying that  I love the book  I own the whole series  and this is what I go to when I feel sad  People I know have asked me before to explain why I like it  but I ve never been able to  It has a mediocre plot  It does not make much sense  But it is brilliantly written  and makes me laugh every time  This book is hilarious    I literally cracked up in the middle of the night laughing so hard  The whole idea is absolutely ridiculous  but is my favorite book ever I love how Douglas Adams inserts random tidbits from the Guide in the story  Very short chapters  so good for a on and off reader One more thing to add is that if you are afraid of aliens  read this  It is all about these aliens who are exactly like humans  I got over a big fear this way   Hilarious Inserts From the Guide  Short Chapters  Defeats Fear of Aliens  42     I can t tell you what this means or it will spoil the whole book  All in all  5 stars  Very amusing read and full of clever perspectives on the big questions  I listened to the audiobook version read by Stephen Fry  No one could have done a better job reading this book Oddly  the quirky  matter of fact style of humorous writing throughout this book reminded me several times of Winnie the Pooh books  Mindbogglingly brilliant  That is all I can say about the extent of imagination and creativity to which this book goes and the humor which unlike anything that I ve read so far  This book made me literally laugh out loud  The punch lines hit you out of nowhere  This is the kind of book one needs on a gloomy Sunday afternoon and by the time you finish  and you will finish the book because you simply won t be able to put it down   the day won t seem so gloomy afterwards  Now  got to read the next 4 books in the series  time to move on to  The Ultimate Hitchhiker s Guide To The Galaxy   If you have a sense of humour or ever find yourself staring into space trying to find one  you should probably just read Hitchhiker s and something might dawn on you Adam s style of writing is hilarious  completely British  with a hearty amount of nonsense thrown in for good measure  This book and the entire series wont fail to impress and surprise you When Earth is about to be demolished  we ll know where our towel is and most importantly be able to remember  Don t panic   Will you  Soy una mujer que no sabe donde esta su toalla     The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  es un libro divertido y con una vision sobre la vida en la Tierra sumamente extrana Despues de que una raza de extraterrestres destruyera nuestro planeta  Arthur Dent  unico terraqueo sobreviviente a la catastrofe  se embarca con Ford Perfect en una aventura a lo largo y ancho del Universo  para descubrir que la Tierra quizas no era lo que siempre creyo  3 words  it was awesome sause takular super advance adventure 2000 edition It is also quite amazing the amount of tangents Douglas manages to fit in  simply because it s so funny That is all  I absolutely adored this book  This was a present from my father for Christmas when I was thirteen and it is what got me started reading science fiction  I am so glad I read this  It is so good  What i loved about the book is the hilarious comedy in it  Another thing is the way the main character Arthur Dent is thrown in too a space and time adventure with his friend ford prefect who is the lead author publisher of book called the Hitchhiker s guide to the galaxy  the only bad think about the book is that the weird plot that Adams uses is hard to follow   I recently reread this book while camping and annoyed my fellow campers by breaking out in chuckles and chortles  This is still my favorite of all the hitchhiker books  probably because it introduces you to the whole crazy galaxy  Douglas Adams was the king of comedy  his manner of writing and surprising can t be topped  La prima volta che lessi  La guida galattica  fu con una copia presa in prestito in biblioteca    quindi intorno agli anni  80 Ricordavo poco della storia  solo alcuni dettagli sparsi    42 incluso Per la rilettura ho deciso di passare direttamente alla versione audio  letta da Stephen Fry e  se non fosse bastata la storia  la sua interpretazione avrebbe regalato comunque 5 stelle al volume Senza che molti se ne rendano conto  i personaggi e le situazioni della Guida Galattica fanno parte della nostra vita di lettori di fantascienza e non solo Consigliarne la lettura e d obbligo    ma non e assicurato il gradimento Adams e la sua trilogia in cinque volumi piace o si odia    non ci sono mezze misure  This is one of my all time favorite book series  I have worn my copy out  and the audio book  There is humor and adventure on every page  The names  the places  the characters  everything about this series is amazing  There are so many details that you don t notice at first but with every reread you catch more and more little things  Very intelligent books  with things that can be seen as utterly ridiculous but in fact are very subtle observations on life as it was when it was written and still holds true today   I have read this book in the past  quite a few years ago  but I decided to pick it up again for the fun of it The one thing I really enjoy about this book is its spontaneity  It can be really random at times  such as this description of a whale falling towards the ground and exploding later   but at the same time  hilarious  For those with a sense of humor  this is the book for you Here are some of my favorite moments 1  The introduction of Marvin  He is this extremely paranoid and pessimistic robot  I love this guy  I remember there was a scene in which the characters were up against these enemies with weapons  and this guy  Marvin  talked to the system that managed the suits the enemies wore  and the system ended up committing suicide because Marvin was being too depressing  Of course  the enemies died as well  the suits were their life support  2  The explanation of how Earth was going to be destroyed  A notice was put up in some unfrequented place  so no one really knew  Because no one did anything to protest  the Earth will be inevitably destroyed 3  The main characters suffer by listening to poetry 4  The answer to the universe is 42  Hilarious   Wow  there are so many pathetic attempts at funny sci fi  but Adams amnages to really pull it off  With perfection  I love tem all  Arthur  Ford  Zaphod  Trillian  even Marvin   It commited suicide   I really laughed at that one  as I did with 42 and the mice and the demolition of Earth  I laughed so much my mouth hurt from grinning  The only reason I wanted to read this book is that is one of the main characters fav book in a TV show that I like called the Big Bang Theory  I am glad I dug around and found this book If you are on the fence about reading this book do it  I love how Adams sees space and you will love the characters that he brings to life  Its a short but awesome book  I can t really say anything about this book with out giving to much away  You will enjoy it if you like sarcastic and dry humor  Check it out   A classic book and it s easy to see why  The characters are all vivid  if particular  and simple fun passages often speak to deeper thoughts without making the reader feel like they just walked in on a philosophical debate  While asking philosophical questions  it never gives its own answers but allows and even encourages the reader to ask themselves  This was my first read and I can t wait to see what I pick up the second time   One of the most quoted and stolen from books out there  I saw the movie a couple of years ago and got hooked  This is not a case of book better than  the movie  but a great read nonetheless  Douglass Adams was a true genius  you rarely see such strong characters in a sci fi  if that s what it is  book  Arthur Dent is the everyman  if it happened to him  it can happen to you  Ford Prefect and just about every other character are anything BUT the everyman  they are off the wall galactic nuts The book is as weird as the movie if not more so  but  weird  with Adams  genius behind it is pure delight  Not a dull moment in this romp as the earth is demolished by the Vogons  with Arthur being saved by Ford in the very last second  From that point on  it s all about hitchhiking through Space  on their way to find the President of the Galaxy Hilarious read   don t miss  Loved the irreverent tone and sci fi setting  The sequels were all weaker than the initial entry but still maintained what I loved of the series  What s interesting is how analogous this book is to Asimovs Foundation  Where I read and loved Guide in high school I wouldn t discover and love Foundation till much later  Two sides of the same coin it s interesting to look at them both and see just how wildly different a similar idea can go  I first saw the older movie  then I read the book  Again this was years ago  It s still on my shelf  Many things to like  Great reading  My favorite book   I LOVED this book  I have never read a true comedy book before  but if any  this is the one  It is one of the best books I have ever read  Its concepts whacked  its characters insane  and the improbability drive  with the totally out of place Arthur and the two faced Zaphoid  literally  on a strange ship that no one can control  well  What can go wrong  In the beginning of the book  the earth explodes  Apparently we were a bit of an inconvenience for the Vogons  who were building a galactic bypass lane  Once he and a friend  Ford had managed to hitchhike a ride with them  Ford told Arthur that he was an alien  He then promptly stuffed a fish in his ear  Thrown off the ship by the vogons  the find themselves as couches in the room of a spacecraft  They have a rather uneventful voyage with Zaphoid and his assistant  who owns mice   The are almost murdered by the old setup of Margaretha  when two nuclear missiles are launched at them  Improbability drive turns the rockets into a sperm whale and a bowl of petunias  If you have a sense of humor then read this book  If you don t  GET ONE  This book is hysterical and ill get you to LOL and G2G and MRK is minutes   last ones my initials    The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy was a life changing read for me in high school  It would affect how I looked at writing for the next 22 years and will probably continue to do so for the rest of my life  The book was incredibly funny  the dialogue was great and it was all absolutely ridiculous  However  it was never a parody of itself and Adams made sure you cared about what happened to the characters and the story Great book  A must read for any sci fi fan  Oh  and the rest of the books are pretty darn excellent  as well      The biggest  funniest poke at pomposity  bureaucracy  humanity  science and the state of the world in 1976 ever  The most ordinary human being you could imagine survives the destruction of planet earth  in his pyjamas   dressing gown  because his best friend of many years turns out to be from a planet somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse  Luckily the friend has a guidebook with the words  DON T PANIC  in large friendly letters on the cover I listened to the original radio series  and bought the book as soon as it was published  and they are the best versions  This was hands down the funniest book I ve ever read  I would highly recommend it  it s short and totally engrossing  It will make you laugh out loud and make a fool of yourself in public  I also loved how intelligent it was as well as being comical  I will definitely be reading more from Douglas Adams  The only thing I could think of to improve this book is maybe some more background or depth to certain characters  Other than this  it was a perfect read   The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  by Douglas Adams is about an English man named Arthur Dent  He awoke one morning to find that his house was about to be demolished in order to make way for a bypass  Arthur refused to move out of the way of the bulldozer s but his alien friend Ford Prefect took him to a pub to discuss future occurrences and his house was demolished anyway  In a strange coincidence the entire Earth is going to be destroyed for an interstellar bypass  Discovering the Earth is going to be destroyed Ford takes Arthur and hitchhikes off the planet in order to survive the Earth s destruction  The story follows the two men as they travel across the galaxy trying to complete the new edition of the Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  They both meet characters that  help  them along the way and even people who they ve already met before  Ford introduces new technologies  aliens  and experiences that Arthur s feeble human brain could sometimes barely handle without cracking  I think the author s ideas were very well put together in his writing  Douglas Adams includes a sensible amount of comedy  surprise  action  and fulfillment in this story  He touches on an idealism on the meaning of life  the universe  and everything without going too deep into the subject and keeps it distant and unrelated with religion and the general ideals of others which I thought to be respectful to others  A good bit of comedy was integrated throughout the book with Arthur  Arguing with ship AI s  trying to make nonsensical explanations for things he doesn t understand  some personal experiences from him that serve as amusing anecdotes  and other characters  sarcasm and interaction with Arthur in his adventure through the galaxy  This book is mostly entertaining but requires some higher thinking levels and more a sophisticated vocabulary in order to understand some of the messages Douglas Adams conveys  I recommend this book for mature young adults for reasons previously stated  I personally enjoyed this book a great deal due to it s humor and intriguing plot and story progression  The character development is also quite admirable as Douglas Adams explains the personality of each character through previous and current experiences throughout the book  Each character interacts with one another not always as you d expect and you are always finding out new things about them  Overall this book is very excellent and I strongly recommend you pick up this book and read it for yourself   C est une joie de lire ce roman de science fiction  Il fait parti de la culture geek depuis longtemps   Trillian

orasi yalnizca dort isik yili uzaklikta  Kusura bakmayin  ama cevrenizde olanlarla ilgilenmeye zahmet etmiyorsaniz  bu sizin sorununuz   I loved this book  I read it in two days  if I remember correctly   I know  I know  it s not one sitting  but I haven t read a book in one sitting middle school  My attention span has suffered since   Anyways  this book and its characters are perfectly wacky  and it is my all time favorite non dystopian science fiction  Loved it  Loved it Could not stand the movie  It was painful  Going to miss the crazy crew  look forward to the next in the series  Loved this  interesting to read this for the first time nearing age 40  but i saw much in it to enjoy  Pythonesque and thought provoking    The first book of one of my favorite series of all time  This book is a BLAST  I couldn t stop reading it from the second I picked it up  I love the author s word play  and the plot is amazing too  I laughed at every joke  was surprised at every plot twist and was generally amazed by the book in general  This is a must read  Very fun  I ve read this book before back in 7th grade but that was 13 years ago  Reading it now I remembered some things and rediscovered others  I loved the writing style and the English humor  Marvin is probably my favorite character  After reading this I will put all the other books in the series on my to read list  If you are looking for something fun  will make you laugh and is different  this book is for you   This book is insanely creative and fun to read  From the beginning you appreciate the quirkyness and the writing style  It s not boring at all  and throughout this series of books I can t believe how creative Douglas Adams is in not only the concepts and story  but also his writing style  These are really unique books to read   Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the Western Spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun  Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety eight million miles is an utterly insignificant little blue green planet whose ape descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea    Thus begins the utterly hilarious and spectacular The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy  Why it s taken me this long to pick up Douglas Adams s genius book is beyond me  I ve had folks recommend it to me  my interests in the cosmos is never ending  and I m a sucker for sarcastic wit and humor  So  shame on me for being late to the party A quick and smooth read  Adams takes us on a most improbable journey through the galaxy after the unfortunate destruction of planet Earth to make way for an intergalactic express lane  What I love about the idea of this book begins very simply with the impending destruction of Arthur s  our main character  home  His home is his world and  as we find out  he has not strayed far from it  It is  in a sense  his galaxy fraught with all of the average problems you and I face on a daily basis However  as Arthur is pulled from his tiny world and into these interstellar adventures with his pal  and long time  intergalactic hitchhiker Ford Prefect  our perspective is blown to enormous proportions  Or  as Adams puts it very very very big   The same mundane  bureaucratic  personal  and every day happenings of Earth  Arthur learns  are not so unique  True  they take on a new  grand proportion and the physics may be a bit more wonky  watch out for falling sperm whales   but even aliens  and robots  have their problems  their poetry  however horrible   and their poor economy Adams does satire correctly  He explores our relationships with ourselves  the world  and philosophy in such a way that you re genuinely laughing throughout the book  but thinking deeply about the journey Arthur is going through  Applying the ideas and experiences to yourself  At least I was Now that the book is over  I must procure the rest of the series  And I hope they re all as incredible as this first book  A definite recommendation to anyone  really  You don t need to be a space nerd to enjoy this  So fantastically strange   Don t forget your towel     Disclaimer   this is not a review  This is a note to my future self  My memory is fading and in few years months days I will not remember that I read this book  I hope this will remind me that I did  I am not sure why I have avoided Mr  Adams like a plague for so long  I had so much fun reading it  I do not like sci fi but this one didn t feel like it  This is what reminds me of discussions I have with J over few pints or I want to believe that two of us are hilarious as that  What is the meaning of life   how   why   where   you ll get your answers just keep busy  as J said  Paranoid Android  Towel  You only need a cup of hot tea and so on  I d give it 4 3 4 stars but just because I fell in love with paranoid android I am giving five stars to this witty explanation of our existence   Just when you think it would be absolutely ridiculous to possibly take the joke any further  Adams proves you right  And it is so  so right  It s a wonder I have any salt left in my body after practically crying with laughter several times while reading this book  Truly one of my all time favorites  I think this is the eighth time or so that I ve read it  I ve tried to read it once a year or so  ever since the first time in high school  I m amazed that  even after having gone through it so many times  I still laugh at certain parts  or at least smile   I love the dry British sense of humor  so different from an American style  Definitely one I ll still pull off the shelf  or download to my CranioCube  in fifty years or so Read again in May 2008 Read again in January 2011  Arthur Dent  a normal British man whose life is starting to starting to fall apart all of the sudden  His house is going to be torn down to build an expressway  but that is the least of his worries  Little does he know that is best friend Ford Prefect is an alien  from somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse  Ford Prefect knows that the Earth is going to be torn down to make an interstellar expressway  so he hitchhikes on to one of the alien destroyer  with Arthur  Arthur thinks he is the only human left in existence  but there is one left and she hooked up with the president of the galaxy I think this book was amazing  I loved the story with the bunches of humor mixed in there as well  I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who loves comedy and science fiction  Anyone who loves humor and science fiction won t be disappointed  I would give this book 5 stars  I would read this book many more times   What can I say  I think it s well established that Douglas Adams was a genius  and reading this has only confirmed that in my mind  It s clever  it s funny  the characters are important to you I read the movie tie in edition  and the interviews in the back with cast and crew were very interesting  I have one word for this book  awesome And to those who want a bigger review  really awesome  Absolutely hilarious  One of the few books I actually bothered to finish and boy was I surprised to actually see how much I like it  This book is actually really amusing and the way it tells its story is humorous  This is by far the most interesting book as there are characters that are interesting and the story in between is good  With characters from an Englishman  Arthur Dent  to some depressed android  Marvin  The Earth was demolished but the characters go through interesting events to some other place that s apparently hidden away from the galaxy  never to be heard from again  When they do find it  there are more characters to introduce how to galaxy had a variety of planets  Overall  the book s good  go read it  Douglas Adams was an incredible minded man  The Hitch Hiker s Guide to the Galaxy has a distinctively British quality whilst making the reader uncontrollably giggle at the decidedly barmy shenanigans of Arthur Dent and company  Every single character  from Frankie and Benjy the mice  to Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz  is as quirky and memorable as the main protagonists  forming a comedic tale that will last until the Earth is destroyed to make way for a hyperspace bypass  If you like science fiction and absurd humour  this is the perfect book for you  Lucky for me  those are two of my most favourite things in life  which made me enjoy this book very much  I do however have still some questions as to where this story will go from here  but I guess I ll find out in the next books in the series  Very good comedy  so funny  AMAZING  Funny  silly  unexpected  and everything  I loved the combination of dry British wit and just random silliness that I associate with Monty Python  The book kept taking turns that I didn t expect  the plot moved along marvelously  and the characters were a riot  I also just loved the different aspect to it  Similar to Terry Pratchett  if anyone likes his stuff   A joy ride with Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent  The eccentric President of the universe Zaphod Beeblebrox really keeps you expecting for more of him  It is a fun packed novel from 1st page to the last  Marvin the paranoid android serves with good funny quotes  The ultimate answer to the universe life and everything will keep you going for the next novel for sure  The requirements for reading this novel is to have tolerance towards humor and satire with a towel in your satchel  And finally DON T PANIC  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is a classic  and as such  is very hard to write a review for  What can I possibly say that hasn t been said before  Add to that the fact that it s awesome  in a way that I can t really put my finger on  and you ve got a terrible case of Reviewer s Block So  I ve sat around pretending to be writing this review for a long time  when all I really want to say is   This book is awesome  Go read it     There it is  I ve said it The story follows Arthur Dent  who is quite annoyed because his house is going to be demolished to make way for an overpass  Of course that should be the least of his problems because Earth is going to be demolished to make way for an overpass  What follows is a parade of nonsense  surreal moments  funny stories and much wackiness  To elaborate more on the awesomeness of the book  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is extremely funny  described by the author as  a story with a long beginning and then an ending   which is true  but causes no problem for the reader  You just want to keep on reading more and more  It is filled with so much nonsense  that it ends up making perfect sense  More than a story  it a Universe  one that is most fun to be in  Sometimes is not so much about the characters and their plight  but where they are and how they got there  That being said  I loved the characters  all of them  If there is any down side to this book is that it feels terribly short  I want more  Now    but that s is easily rectified as there are four more books in this trilogy  written by Douglas Adams  that is   there is a sixth one by Eoin Colfer   I will be getting my hands on them as soon as I can Now  go read this book Also at Spoilers and Nuts I first read these books in high school  and in them  I recognized a kindred spirit So  early on in a new relationship  after making the shocking discovering that my new sweetie was unfamiliar with Douglas Adams  I read him the first few pages of  Hitchhiker s Guide  He didn t laugh  Not even once  He just looked confused Let s just say the relationship didn t last very long  Because Douglas Adams is funny  Sometimes in a slapstick way  sometimes in a clever way  and sometimes in a disturbing way  but funny  No  the plots don t always hold together and reading every book in the series one right after the other can lead to something akin to an ice cream hangover  but that s not the point  The point is that this is the kind of humor that moves you and shapes and causes you to look at the world just a little bit differently  If  of course  you re game  BackgroundThe story revolves around Arthur Dent  a human who has one awful day when his house gets demolished and only 10 minutes later  his whole planet is vaporized  Luckily he has a friend on earth  Ford Prefect  who actually is an alien and knows how to hitch a ride on a spaceship  And so their journey through the galaxy begins   OpinionTo my own surprise  I liked it  When I just started the book  the story seemed irrational  complicated and illogical  But when I got further  the story developed and I had to admit that it wasn t the case  I do have to admit that the characters are a little to underdeveloped  I couldn t really get a good picture of them in my head  But since they are so original and comical  it kind of compensates   Look   said Arthur   would it save you a lot of time if I just gave up and went mad now   I first read this book in middle school  and while I found it enjoyable then  I m really loving it a lot more after rereading it a decade later  To me this book is hilarious and inventive without trying too hard  and contains a lot of random and enjoyable science fiction references while also providing engaging  original characters and storylines  While I can certainly see some people dismissing this book as being too over the top or goofy  it s just as purposeful and enjoyable as more  serious  science fiction in my eyes  Picked this book up on a friends recommendation and loved it  A must read for all science fiction fans  Must read   GENIALE  Mi sto ancora chiedendo perche ho aspettato 24 anni per leggerlo  Un miscuglio perfettamente equilibrato di fantascienza  umorismo  non sense  satira irriverente in poco piu di 200 pagine dallo stile brillante  Non mancano infatti  per chi sa leggere tra le righe ma nemmeno poi tanto  numerose  riflessioni  sulla nostra societa che  anche a piu di trent anni di distanza  risultano attuali Per la cronaca  ho riso tantissimo  E io in genere non rido mentre leggo  Anzi  per la precisione non esterno quasi mai delle reazioni ad alcuno stimolo bisogno fisiologico quando leggo  Quindi  traete le dovuto conclusioni e non aspettate oltre se ancora non avete iniziato questa saga  Bonkers  Some of the parts were absolutely hilarious  The poor sperm whale   it has the worst luck  The characters are also great and very easy to get attached to  But so far the story has been lackluster for me  I bought the entire trilogy  of five  and I know it was written to be a seriesso I m hopeful that the plot will get better in the next book   http   scottslifeinmotion wordpress c    Douglas Adam s book is absolutely amazing  It is hilarious and filled with ideas that are so far from everything that you could call normal  I loved it from the first page to the last and it was never boring This book really is a must read   Especially for everybody who wants to find out why nerds and geeks like me always joke about the number 42     Just a chapter into it  this book was added to my mental list of all time favorites  What an amazingly clever and witty novel  Love it  Love it  Love it  The second I finished reading it  I picked up the next installment in this  5 book trilogy   So far the second book does not disappoint either  READ THIS BOOK  I just finished reading the fifth book of the series Mostly Harmless  and I must say  the first is by far the best in the series They all have those fun scientific  impossible and bizarre situations but the first is the best Everyone should read these books  of course it helps to know a little something about physics but anyone can have fun reading them  Also  the definitions of things like flying that are given during the story can make you have a different perspective on life  the universe and everything  20 years later and it is still one of the funniest things I read  Story is nothing in particular  but that is not the point   dialogues are great  English humour unsurpassed and some funny views on life  universe and everything else presented in just right way for book with such a tone I am ashamed I never actually continued with other books from the series  but  Restaurant  is now on my  priority  short list  This was a really enjoyable book and I m sorry I waited so long to read it  The characters and storyline were extremely unique and entertaining  The writing style was captivating  witty and compelling  The book really grabbed me right from the start and I couldn t put it down until I was done  It s a shame it was so short but there are plenty other books in the series so I hope those will be just as good  Overall  I really loved this one and would recommend it to anybody who is looking for a book that s really very different   The book The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams is a masterpiece of science fiction and fantasy  I m not quite sure how the author came up with the ideas for the story and characters  because they are genial  The protagonist  Arthur Dent  is an eccentric British man who enjoys clubbing and relaxing in his home  However  when he travels into space  it takes him quite some time to get used to the lifestyle  I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys science fiction because it is an excellent read and has a good usage of alien invasions  It is the first book in the series and I am trying hard to find its sequels  What can I say  this book cracks me up and I could read it a hundred times  THIS IS MY FAVORITE BOOK EVER    Funny  quirky  and all in all a great book  My one complaint is that it seemed that there was hardly any plot  problem or character development anywhere in the book  I m giving it 5 stars simply because it was incredibly entertaining and I didn t really start to think about any of those above points until I finished the book  Now  though  I m mostly through the second book in the series and the lack of real substance is starting to get to me  Sharp  It has always been forty two  What was that    So weird  Extraordinary funny  Superb   ONE OF THE MOST AMZINGEST BOOKS I HAVE READ IN A LONG TIME Confession  The only reason I wanted to read it in the first place was because I watched the movie first  Martin Freeman was in it    So I got it even though it was insanely expensive  and I was definitely not disappointed   subtely writing this in school time  Very nice book  I was impressed how it made my mind travel interstellar distances    The Galaxy s original e book  Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect set off to find the answer to life  the universe and everything and funnily enough   SPOILER ALERT  it s 42  But you already knew that I must have first read this sometime in the 1980 s and it still stands up  It s funny  intelligent and concise  ridiculing the human condition perfectly   mostly harmless The tv series was part of my childhood and I couldn t bring myself to watch the film version with Martin Freeman  It s sacrilege  How can you improve upon perfection  Douglas Adams  Such a huge loss  Loved the randomness and comedic timing of Adams  Highly recommended  Douglas Adams should be one crazy person  Very rightly so An absolute joyride  I guess Arthur should have listened to his mother after all It has got a Monty Python feel to it A must read  It s crazy  insane and improbable Arthur Dent finds out at the last minute that his house is set to be knocked down  His best friend is an alien from somewhere near betelgeuse and the earth is being destroyed  It s filled with humour and is guaranteed to make you laugh  It s part one in a trilogy of four  Read this years ago  and remembered it was the perfect book for me as a 20 something  Definitely recommend for lost souls   although probably resonates better with high schoolers now    Sai  riprese Arthur  e in momenti come questi  in cui mi trovo intrappolato in un compartimento stagno vogon in compagnia di uno di Betelgeuse in attesa come me di morire asfissiato nello spazio  che mi pento amaramente di non avere dato retta a mia madre   Perche  cosa ti diceva tua madre   Non lo so  non la ascoltavo   After knowing every reference by heart  having people tell me about it and or the movie s   and seeing excerpts  this had a lot more of a plot than I had expected it to  Other than that  there isn t much I have to say about the plotline  But the plot isn t the part that I love  It s the writing  Things like  An expression of deep worry and concern failed to cross either of Zaphod s faces  or  For a moment  nothing happened  A second or two later  nothing continued to happen  crack me up  It s brilliant  This had been on my to read pile for a very long time  and I m glad that I finally got to it  Even if you don t think you ll like it  I d suggest reading it  You may like it better than you think  And even if you don t  there are pop culture references you ll be privy to and it s super short  so it won t waste too much time  The book made me chuckle many times  Good times  This is a re read for me  I ve actually read this a good ten or fifteen times in my life and enjoyed it while getting something new out of it everytime  The jokes never get old for me  I don t think I have to tell you how good this occult classic is  If you ve just seen the movie and not read the book then you re in for a treat because the book is sooooo much better  Nachdem ich nun das Vergnugen hatte den original Text zu lesen  wurde ich die deutsche Ubersetzung auf eine drei Sterne Wertung herabstufen  Das nicht um zu sagen dass die Ubersetzung schlecht ist  es zeigt sich nur einfach wieder einmal das die  Humoristische  Eleganz der englischen Sprache sich nicht ganzlich adaquat Ubertragen lasst Zur annotierten Reclam Ausgabe  welche neben original Text  Pan Books  79  und Vokabeln  auch noch Hinweise auf Wortkontext fur Adams  Eigenschopfungen enthalt  sowie einem informativen Anhang und einem erklarenden Nachwort  und nicht zuletzt Adams Vorwort zu The Ultimativ Hitchhiker s Guide  US Ausgabe   lasst sich eigentlich jedem interessierten nur eine unbedingte Empfehlung aussprechen  This was just as clever and irreverent and insightful and laugh out loud funny and bitingly perceptive and unexpectedly poignant as I remembered  There s no way I can find not to adore this brilliant tongue in cheek science fiction yarn  no matter how many times I read it  It should  of course  be considered a  must read  for anyone interested in the genre I ll let one of my favorite passages speak for itself  Yes   said the old man  pausing to gaze hopelessly round the room   Ten million years of planning and work gone just like that  Ten million years  Earthman    can you conceive of that kind of time span  A galactic civilization could grow from a single worm five times over in that time  Gone   He paused   Well that s bureaucracy for you   he added   You know   said Arthur thoughtfully   all this explains a lot of things  All through my life I ve had this strange unaccountable feeling that something was going on in the world  something big  even sinister  and no one would tell me what it was    No   said the old man   that s just perfectly normal paranoia  Everyone in the Universe has that   Everyone   said Arthur   Well  if everyone has that perhaps it means something  Perhaps somewhere outside the Universe we know      Maybe  Who cares   said Slartibartfast before Arthur got too excited   Perhaps I m old and tired   he continued   but I always think that the chances of finding out what really is going on are so absurdly remote that the only thing to do is to say hang the sense of it and just keep yourself occupied  Look at me  I design coastlines  I got an award for Norway   He rummaged around in a pile of debris and pulled out a large perspex block with his name on it and a model of Norway moulded into it   Where s the sense in that   he said   None that I ve been able to make out  I ve been doing fjords in all my life  For a fleeting moment they become fashionable and I get a major award   He turned it over in his hands with a shrug and tossed it aside carelessly  but not so carelessly that it didn t land on something soft   In this replacement Earth we re building they ve given me Africa to do and of course I m doing it with all fjords again because I happen to like them  and I m old fashioned enough to think that they give a lovely baroque feel to a continent  And they tell me it s not equatorial enough  Equatorial   He gave a hollow laugh   What does it matter  Science has achieved some wonderful things of course  but I d far rather be happy than right any day    And are you    No  That s where it all falls down of course   I think this is the first time I read listened to a book that made me laugh so much I nearly started crying  Stephen Fry  who reads the UK editions of the Harry Potter audibooks  reads this one as well and enhanced the experience and my enjoyment of this silly book  An utterly ridiculous tale and I will definitely be continuing with the series COYER  Read a book with water or the ocean on the cover   3 points  Bizarre  Brilliant  Loved it  The Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy is a fun and quirky adventure that starts on Earth and goes to the stars  Arthur Dent s house is about to be bulldozed  for a bypass  little does he know that the whole Earth will be demolished  Taken off of Earth shortly before its destruction  Arthur Dent goes on an adventure across the galaxy with Ford Prefect an alien who has been stranded on Earth and a galactic hitchhiker  This book penned by the late Douglas Adams  is a different twist on the Sci Fi genre  Details that seem insignificant  tend to have a much more important meaning  and are done in comical manner  The differences of this book make it stand out as a truly memorable read  Douglas Adams touches topics such as the nature of our being  through completely unrelated topics  Who would think that a chronically depressed robot could express human traits that are almost more human than the other characters  Our that a sperm whale could ask questions about it s being  The Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy actually leaves you with more questions than answers  but the book is oddly satisfying in this way  This was Douglas Adams purpose  He leaves you wanting more  while answering questions presented at earlier times in the novel  The ending of the story eludes to a new adventure to follow  The Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy is definitely a must read for anyone who loves books   Non ho mai letto nessun romanzo di fantascienza  anche se il mio film preferito in assoluto e la trilogia di  Back to the future   una pellicola senza dubbio del filone fantascientifico  Ebbene  ho sempre pensato che la fantascienza fosse un genere che non mi apparteneva  questo finche non ho messo le mani su  Guida galattica per gli autostoppisti   L ho comprato in formato ebook e trovo molto grazioso che nel romanzo di Adams il volume  Guida galattica per gli autostoppisti  sia quello che posso definire un libro elettronico a tutti gli effetti  Il mio voto e assolutamente 5 5 perche la storia e simpatica  avvincente e soprattutto fa sorridere spesso Arthur Dent  ragazzo inglese un po  sfigato  una mattina si sveglia con delle ruspe nel giardino di casa  pronte a buttargli giu l alloggio per costruire una nuova  super tangenziale  L amico strampalato di Arthur  Ford Prefect  arriva all improvviso per dargli una notizia sconcertante  entro pochi minuti  il mondo finira  meglio farsi l ultima birra prima che sia troppo tardi  Come profetizzato da Ford  che in realta non e un umano ma e un alieno umanoide in esilio sulla Terra da 15 schifosissimi e lunghi anni  ecco scendere dal cielo i primi dischi volanti dei Vogon  i Vogon devono costruire una tangenziale galattica e la Terra si trova proprio in mezzo  quindi deve essere distrutta Ford salva l amico Arthur e assieme si ritrovano su un disco volante Vogon  pochi minuti prima che gli alieni facciano saltare in aria la Terra  Nascosti nei meandri dell astronave Vogon  vengono pero scoperti  e buttati nello spazio interstellare  Hanno solo 30 secondi di vita  prima di morire nel vuoto  e per una fottutissima coincidenza  al 29esimo secondo vengono raccattati da un altra astronave Cuore d Oro  appena inaugurata come un astronave super accessoriata  e stata da poco rubata dal Presidente Galattico Zaphon e dai suoi assistenti Trillian e Marvin  Arthur e Ford sono ora ospiti  o ostaggi   di Zaphon  che fugge inseguito dalla polizia  Si ritroveranno in un pianeta che 5milioni di anni prima era ricco e fiorente  una sorta di Eldorado  e laggiu riceveranno delle rivelazioni inaspettate quando ironiche e divertenti per bocca di un vecchio e    di due topolini bianchi  Fodaaaaaastico  I own a first edition of this supreme book  It is very funny indeed  has a lot of interesting characters  rips along at a splendid page and finishes far too soon  Luckily there were four more in the series Arthur Dent being an earthman has no idea that there is any other life in the universe than on Earth  When his friend Ford Prefect  who he had thought to be from Guildford disabuses Arthur of this and takes Arthur away from the destruction of the Earth by the Vogons  Arthur with wide eyed wonder follows him around various parts of the Universe  Trisha McMillan and Zaphod Beeblebrox feature in a larger than life way   particularly in the case of Zaphod  The best of all  however  is Marvin the paranoid android who is  and remains  my all time favourite character in fiction In the unlikely event that you haven t read this  do so immediately  What an absurdly  confusing mess of a wonderful book it is  After all how can I understand it all being only 3rd most intelligent species not the most  But now I know the answer of Everything it s 42 but what s the question  I love the writing  humor and everything to do with this book  I am already 1 4th way through the 2nd part of the 5 part trilogy  I have already seen the movie a very long time ago so knew some parts but it was still lovely to read through all the perils of Arthur Dent s life  Dear old Earth gone forever   But as Dolphins said  So Long  and Thanks for All the Fish   a fun read  Gonna wait a while to finish the trilogy  of 5 books  WTF   Read by Steven Fry  this is a wonderful audio  It was easy to follow along  and Mr  Fry did a wonderfull job with the voices  He  himself  had a very nice vice  There was a couple of nights that I fell asleep to his smooth tones reading the book to me  I really enjoyed it  I was able to listen while I washed my sheets  cooked and other chores  And  laughing all the way  The Guide is a very silly  yet serious book  that is multi layered  There are many clues to the ending of the book and  if you go back  one is able to find them  I ve read this book before but it was so long ago and I never put it into goodreads  I remember I loved it so I took the time to re read it  it was awesome  so I could get a refresher and read the other books in the series  I ll admit I only read this because everyone else was  I liked it  A lot  I don t ever recommend it to anyone  not because I personally didn t enjoy it  but because feel it takes a certain kind of reader to appreciate  comprehend  Douglas Adam s imaginative story telling   First read February 2013Reread May 2015I had been wanting to read The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy for years and years and FINALLY I found myself walking out of a bookstore with it in my hands and I can tell you just how angry I am that I waited so damn long to read it Even though it is a fairly short book I found myself reading it even faster then I thought I would because I really just couldn t put it down and when I did finally finish it I just wanted to turn it over and start all over again  A bit post modern for my taste  but lots of good funny things that make you appreciate the English language and the confusion it brings  To put it simply this book is brilliant  The hitchhiker s guide is a surprisingly deep and philosophical novel with tons of snarky wit to fuel it s thoughtful fire  Adam s imagination fills the book with some highly original stuff that makes a joke out of the purpose of the universe through Arthur Dent s misadventures  One of my family s favorites when I was young  We all loved it and could never understand when people said the humor got  dumb  in parts  But then we were also all Monty Python fans and would argue the genius of Rowan Atkinson at the drop of a hat Important read for sci fi fans and British humor fans   The Readers Guide to the Hitchhikers Guide to the GalaxyHitchhikers guide to the galaxy is a sarcastic  silly take on life  the universe  and everything  It follows Arthur Dent  a simple human who had his home planet  Earth  destroyed by the bureaucratic Vogons  His pal from another planet  Ford Prefect  takes Arthur and himself onto the Vogon ship via hitchhiking  After the Vogons threaten to throw them off the ship  Arthur and Ford get a ride on the Heart of Gold  a ship stolen by the zany Zaphod Beetlebrox  The Heart of Gold is powered by the Improbability Drive  which uses near impossible events to power the engines  Along with Trillian  another human and Zaphod s girlfriend  Marvin  a manic depressive robot  Zaphod  Arthur  and Ford travel the Galaxy searching for the long lost planet  Magrithea  and discover the answer to life  the universe  and everything  I thought this book was amazing  It broke the conventional format of a science fiction novel by presenting it with a weird  obscure twist  The excerpts from the actual guide add to the value of the novel even more  It presents something usually thought of as scary  like space aliens  in a light hearted  fun tone  Along with the additional of funny characters  like Zaphod  bring a huge humorous element to the story  For example   You know   said Arthur   it s at times like this  when I m trapped in a Vogon airlock with a man from Betelgeuse  and about to die of asphyxiation in deep space that I really wish I d listened to what my mother told me when I was young    Why  what did she tell you    I don t know  I didn t listen     Douglas 122 The story originally was incarnated as a radio show  Once its popularity grew it became a stage play  Later the radio show was put on records  After that the story was written into a book form  that of which this is  It was filmed as a Television show after that  There was a point and click computer game made based on the story  Finally it was made into a movie in 2005  The author  Douglas Adams  was born March 11  1952  He is commemorated in the Radio Academy s Hall of Fame  Adams also wrote Dirk Gently s Holistic Detective Agency  1987  and The Long Dark Tea Time of the Soul  1988   and co wrote The Meaning of Liff  1983   The Deeper Meaning of Liff  1990   Last Chance to See  1990   and three stories for the television series Doctor Who  He died in 2001 from cancer   It s been a long time coming and I should have read it ages ago  When so many people proclaim a story so great it makes me nervous to read it  The hype is usually too much  So if you haven t read it yet  sit back  lower your expectations to  just another comedic scifi book on a shelf  and dig in  It s a great random adventure for when you re tired of books that take themselves too seriously  One of the best books I ve ever read  Ps  Coldplay fans will love it  The answer is 42 but nobody knows the question Oh ye gods  where has this book been all my life      So I was originally supposed to read this book back in August but I must be the slowest potato in the universe because I just now got around to reading it  And wow  I wish I would ve read it in August  I wish I would ve read it back in high school when a guy at my school started talking about how much he loved the movie  I wish I would ve read this book long  long ago so it could be with me always  I would ve loved and quoting it so much throughout the years But  well  here we are  Late to the party as usual Well  first off  This book was hilarious  So many bits seriously had me in stitches  I loved almost every single character and I just couldn t believe how hilarious they all were  Everything  absolutely everything  was brilliant I loved the story and I couldn t wait to see where it would take me  I loved the voice with which Adams wrote this story  Stories that are narrated by a voice who seems to be experiencing the story right there with you are always my favorite  It reminds me of the Grandfather in the Princess Bride who can see your distressed but wants to reassure you that everything will turn out just fine So  honestly  I don t think I can even form coherent thoughts about how much I love this book or why I love it  It s one of those I just want to envelop in a giant hug because I have so many feelings for it  I can t even begin to express them I honestly and totally can t wait to read the rest of this series  If it s anything like this one  I m completely and totally sure this is going to be one of my favorites ever  I know this book has already joined the ranks of my favorites  It s seriously that good  I highly recommend it  You ll laugh and learn and love and  hey  what else do you need in a book  Douglas Adams   the greatest  Love this whole series  In every decade of my life  I ve read and enjoyed different types of books  As I got older  my tastes changed  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is the one book I have loved in every decade of my life  I ve read other books that matched its humor or its creativity or its readability  but nothing that matched it for all three I don t believe there is a perfect book  but this is the perfect book for me  I don t believe I will ever read anything I love as much  whatever the decade  was actually laughing outloud at many parts  entertaining and insightful   Welcome  the voice said  to the Starship Heart of Gold  In preparation for my 42nd birthday  42 being the answer to the Ultimate Question of Life  the Universe and Everything   I reread the marvelous hilarious book  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  by Douglas Adams  and it was even funnier than the first time around   partly because I had read it  only once  unlike its myriad rabid fans  when I was a fresh teenager off the boat  and many of the witticisms entirely escaped me  which didn t stop me from thinking it was awesome even back then    The ships hung in the sky in much the same way that bricks don t  Our hapless humanoid hero  Arthur  wakes up one day to find his house  and Earth  about to be demolished  note  I played the  all text  HGttG video game in 1987 before reading the book and it must have taken me days to figure out that he has to lie down in front of the bulldozer to stop said house demolition    Arthur lay in the mud and squelched at him  His friend Ford  who is a  seasoned space tramp  and undercover alien hitchhiker  whisks him off Earth just in time  and therein ensues a series of madcap adventures  near escapes  pitch perfect bureaucracies  mouse overlords  and of course  a love story   Reason was in fact out to lunch  There were so many funny inventive characters  These are just a few  the Dentrassis   an unruly tribe of gourmands  a wild but pleasant bunch    the Hooloovoo   a super intelligent shade of the color blue    the commander of the Vl hurgs  strange and warlike beings   who was resplendent in black jeweled battle shorts    and let s not forget Marvin the Paranoid Android  a clinically and comically depressed robot   The highest prime number coalesced quietly in a corner and hid itself away for ever  I was so taken with how prescient a book written in 1979 was about what we almost take for granted now  or haven t figured out yet  The eponymous Hitchhiker s Guide  for example  is of course  an e book  And here s this perfect bit about radios  i e  technology    For years  radios had been operated by means of pressing buttons and turning dials  then as the technology become more sophisticated  the controls were made touch sensitive   you merely had to brush the panels with your fingers  now all you had to do was wave your hand in the general direction of the components and hope  It saved a lot of muscular expenditure  of course  but meant that you had to sit infuriatingly still if you wanted to keep listening to the same program  Or this off hand line about  the Googleplex Star Thinker in the Seventh Galaxy of Light and Ingenuity  which sounds like a scifi movie and Burning Man rolled into one  There were dozens of clever and quippy one off asides and remarks  as well as a goodly number of flat out beautiful lines   At that moment  the bottom fell out of Arthur s mind    The moment carried itself    mountains of archaic thought   What s so unpleasant about being drunk  You ask a glass of water  If you ve never read the book or seen the movie  you re in for a treat  Or pick it up again if it s been a while  And remember   I d far rather be happy than right any day   Mouse like man Arthur Dent awakens one morning to find that his home has been scheduled for demolition so that a interstate bypass can be built  If this isn t bad enough  he soon learns that his planet has also be scheduled for destruction  also for a bypass  though on a somewhat larger scale  Fortunately for him it turns out that his friend Ford Prefect is in fact a shipwrecked alien hitchhiker who escapes with him and travels with him on a series of bizarre and somewhat unlikely adventures through time and space  Fun fun fun  Witty and sharp  Humor with a bite Dent Arthur Dent s  everyman  character is the perfect foil for this off beat slam of the improbable universe we inhabit  The larger than life happenings perfectly mirror the absurd things we humans do to each other without a second thought   Ford   he said   you re turning into a penguin  stop it  This book is hilarious and subliminally meaningful when read in depth  Adams is a master of satire and comedy making this book a great read I would recommend this to anyone with love of satire  sci fi or comedy  Great book  Been a long time since I read this and I appreciate it more for it  How can yo not like a book that gives you the meaning to life and the answer to the ultimate question      42    But what was the ultimate question   Reading this with some cold meds on board enhanced certain portions I m sure   These are probably the funniest books I ve ever read  Ever  I laughed so hard someone thought I was crying       and that wasn t even the first time I d read them  People who see the film are missing the point   what makes these books brilliant is Adams s writing  not the story itself  You just can t duplicate that on film  I randomly picked that book from my mother s bookshelf and I most definitely don t regret it For starters  it is not the kind of book that you would read in one night because it is so captivating but it is still wonderful in so many ways The story is very simple and is kind of just slowly flowing within ridiculous moments and brilliant jokes  Even though I have a bit of a different sense of humour I still found it very funny  So  even if you re not a particular fan of these kind of jokes  I would still recommend it  Can t explain why  42 I personally liked it because it was Incredibly creative  very well thought through and wonderfully absurd  and I have never read a fictional book like that  If you re questioning life and the universe and you think you re going crazy  pick up this book and you will see that there are many other crazy answers to your questions that you wouldn t have fathomed in a thousand years  And then you ll realise that the actual answer to the meaning of life maybe isn t even the problem     I enjoyed some parts so much that I had to tell other people to talk about these certain things  I was like  WOW  how could have possibly come up with that  Because of that I don t actually know why it took me so long to finish it  I didn t know that so many movies  tv shows etc  borrowed  certain concepts or jokes  I only realised  but I can understand why  I mean they re just brilliant Also  isn t that book kind of relevant again  I mean  a computer that came up with the idea of earth Oh yeah and the characters are just lovely although most of them seem so miserable  poor Marvin haha  I haven t seen the movie but I want to watch it  although everyone says it s really bad  That kind of makes me want to watch it more  And I want to read the sequels   I don t know  this review is rubbish  probably because it is SO LATE AND I SHOULD BE ASLEEP  but there is only so much to say about a good book  It is way easier to complain about a bad one  but I tried my best  A classic for a reason I was wary of it  having seen the movie and being like ehh  and having so many people recommend it but not understanding the idea But now that I ve read it  the idea is at the same time both obviously many very important ideas together  and nothing really at all other than humour and wit  depending on how you read it Either way  it s a must read  Penso che per commentare un simile libro basti una frase  il problema e scegliere quale     Arthur saggio nervosamente il materasso  poi vi si sedette sopra anche lui  in realta  non aveva alcuna ragione di essere nervoso  perche tutti i materassi cresciuti nelle paludi di Sconchiglioso Zeta vengono uccisi ed essiccati prima di essere usati  Sono pochissimi quelli che si sono risvegliati   Revisited the classic to appreciate the sheer genius of Douglas Adams    No wonder  Doctor Who  is as witty as it is   after all Douglas Adams was involved in the scripting of the original  When I think of it now  there is so much of Hitchhiker s Guide in Doctor Who  Now to finish the rest of the seriesHow many roads must a man walk down        DThis is probably the only book I ve read thrice  other than Tintin  Archies  etc  P  and it just gets better each time    genius  Sarcastic  funny  I love the parody of many familiar situations  Many politics are lika Zaphod  I really want to read the next book Divertente e irriverente  Acuto e spiritoso  Veramente un toccasana per lo spirito  This book was an absolute masterpiece  from cover to cover I was laughing my butt off  I was really moved by how logical it was and if there was a scientific object or tool  Adams would always try and back it up with real life theory of how they could do it  If there wasn t any feasible way  he would just make up a really funny explanation  like with the babel fish  At first he gives a logical explanation of how it works but when presented with the question why is it like that he made up the whole proof of god theory and i just found that absolutely hilarious  Now I was one of the few that watched the movie first and then read the book so I m a little chumped as to where a lot of the movie came from but I ve had friends tell me that they come from the sequels so I ll have to read those next  You say you like  British Humour    whatever that is   I ll give you British Humour  Amongst the ranks of the great Sir Terry Pratchett  I present to you  Douglas Adams and the absolutely insane world of  Hitchhiker s Giude to the Galaxy  The humour of this book is very much exactly what I was raised on  being an English girl  Therefore I spent most of this book in fits of laughter  Adam s writing style is a little bit strange and it does take some getting used to  You are not introduced to the world or the stories within it  you are instead pushed full force with the subtlety of the train wreck  But you know  once Earth has been blown to pieces and Arthur and Ford are being read literally mind numbing poetry by an alien race whilst hitchhiking on their spaceship  you can t stop laughing and can t put this book down Arthur dent is a homebody who would like nothing better than to stay in his little house  quietly drinking tea in his dressing gown and being left alone by annoying people  see  anybody else   No way in hell is that going to happen  since not only is the council out to destroy his house so they can build a new motorway right through it  but aliens have also decided today is a good day to wipe out the earth   so they can build a road through where it is as well  The world and the universe is against Arthur Dent today  Where is a cup of tea when you need it  Arthur is the quintessentially English man  who hates change and thrives on things like queueing  I must say the only character I really liked  personally  was Marvin the depressed robot  Absolutely brilliant One scene I absolutely loved was the Whale contemplating what good friends it would become with the ground once it  met  it  Also the entire opening passage is fantastic  One of the first things you read is  Curiously enough  the dolphins had long known of the impending destruction of the planet Earth and had made attempts to alert mankind to the danger  but most of their communications were misinterpreted as amusing attempts to punch footballs or whistle for titbits  so they eventually gave up and left the Earth by their own means shortly before the Vogons arrived  Definitely recommend this to any lovers of fantasy Sci fi and British humour all around For more of my reviews  please visit thebookheaphttp   thebookheap wordpress com  Hilarious  doesn t even begin to express how ironic and fantastic H2G2 is Coupled with great humor that goes against the cliche  H2G2 a high intelligence and understanding of how the Universe works  And instead of presenting it as a puzzle  or a gift  Adams presents the Universe as a colossal joke  It s funny  it s smart  and it s life changing You won t be disappointed   It is very rare to find a book that will really make you laugh out loud  The book The HItchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is one of rare books  It is a very popular book that was written by the recently deceased Douglas Adams in 1979  It was meant to be a science fiction comedy that is so mind boggling in every way it makes you think  WOW  The Protagonist  Arthur Dent  Is a Englishmen about to be one of two survivors of an Alien race blowing up the earth  Yes  blowing up the Earth  In the first 30 pages of the book a Vogan spaceship attacks the earth and blows it up  simply because it was in the way of a highway construction site  As you read the book  Arthur s friend  Ford Prefect  slowly tells him all about the galaxy and how Earth was one of the very few unevolved planets in that Galaxy  Ford also says how he got stuck on earth and was unable to leave the dreadful planet as his ship broke down  Arthur and Ford explore the Galaxy together meeting races such as Vogans  Belegeniaians  and Magnarthians  in hope to make a new earth and find the meaning of life   This book s setting is pretty much all over the galaxy  The plot  or problem  in this book is very hard to wrap your head around  It seems like it is such a big group of miscellaneous things  that you start to wonder   what are they even doing   It later becomes clear that the plot of the story was to find the meaning of life  However in steps the antagonist  This antagonist isn t a person however  it is what stops them from finding the meaning of life    the universe and everything in it  A very different kind of antagonist  but makes sense in the given circumstance  The climax of the story takes place when they find creators of the universe on the plant of markarth  and along with that the rulers of our planet     not humans      but mice  MICE  Yes the rulers of our planet our mice  and you thought the book couldn t get any weirder   Although the book may sound stupid it actually has some good themes  The conflict is man versus science which is very hard to come by  One of its themes is found in the end is to not strive for perfection  A planet in the book make a supercomputer to answer  Great Question   They wait seven million years to find the answer but all they get is this    42  After a wait of SEVEN MILLION YEARS they get no closer to perfection  One of the main problems is that they never knew the real question  Another theme is to look on the bright side of things  Through the story you hear countless excerpts from an older copy of The Hitchhiker s guide to the galaxy which explains everything in the galaxy like an encyclopedia  But on every definition there is a addition of humor  even on the terrible things  For example for Vogans it states  They are very stubborn but soak up flattery like butter on a hot pancake  Even if you get on there bad side and are executed it is better then them reading you their poetry   The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is a hysterical novel full of action and tons of jokes  I would rate it a 5 5 star book  I loved it beginning to end and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a laugh  The writing style is smooth and calming with lot of fun  To sum it up  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is a roller coaster and fun for the whole ride  This book is possibly the most random  hilarious  and delightful book I ve ever read  If you re looking for something chronological  that follows a straight and completely unwavering line  you should drop this book immediately  If you completely dislike humor or wit of any kind  you should try Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe  And  lastly  if you are a Vogon  I d like to know why you seem to be showing any interest in what my opinion is The story swerves this way and that like a  insert random parallel here   but always in the best taste  humor  and followed by a speedy return to those whom you might actually care about  There s little character development  but the characters and the plot are so quick that there s little time to really care Arthur Dent  though arguably the protagonist of this tale  is sort of thrown here and there with little regard for his opinion  He questions things now and again  but with the entirety of the Galaxy suddenly thrust into his cognizance  there s little he can do but learn to just go with the flow   which happens to be quite fast You might be a tad confused at times  but as the cover of the book says  Don t Panic  Things are usually explained fairly well  and those that aren t usually don t matter very much The book ends  If you d like  you can stop reading the series now  Granted  it s not over  like   and they all lived happily ever after   or anything like that  It s more of a   we have a sense of resolution  there aren t any huge cliffhangers or dangling plotlines to deal with  you can rest easy having finished this book   but if you d like to find out more about these characters  we do have another book following this  if you re interested On a side note  if you re having trouble getting into the book   I found the first chapter pretty dull  actually  subtle British humor and whatnot   I d advise checking out the audiobook from the library  or finding a public domain recording of it online somewhere  I found that the British accent  my version was actually done by Douglas Adams  himself   conveyed the subtlety of the humor and helped get me into the mood of the work  It also helped get past names like  Zaphod Beeblebrox  Approximate Reading Time  5 hours J ai vu la bande annonce du film  J ai ri  J ai vu le film  J ai ri  J ai lu le livre a l origine et j ai encore ri Un gros gros delire et une enorme parodie des romans de SF qui semble etre un n importe quoi fini mais on se prend au jeu et on passe un tres bon moment Decidement l humour anglais est le meilleur    The Hitchhiker s guide to the galaxy has been on my reading list for far too long and now that I ve finally read it  I think I should slap myself for waiting this long The book was written in the year I was born   1979   and I can t help but feeling mesmerized by Adams imaginary  The hitchhiker s guide to the galaxy  the book within the book  is an e book  read on a touch screen  In 1979  Also  the book is amusing  with a lot of sarcastic and ironic lines  I loved Marvin s character and the part he had on the book s ending  really funny Remember  Currently listening to a great audio book version of this at night before bed  Very  very good to send me off to a peaceful slumber  and amazing dreams   The book really grew on me towards the final third  In the beginning it was a bit here there and everywhere  but things started to fall into place and take shape  Many scenes are very dream like  and I look forward to making paintings inspired from the scenes in here  I d hate the planet of Magrathea so much  Now  this is more like it from Douglas Adams  Some time ago  I had read Dirk Gently s Holistic Detective Agency by the same author  and I didn t enjoy it  if not loathed it entirely  But The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy works on every level that Dirk Gently s Holistic Detective Agency doesn t First off  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is funny  Unlike Dirk Gently  where I laughed nary once  several scenes in The Hitchhiker s Guide made me laugh out loud  I believe the difference lies in that in Dirk Gently  Adams was trying too hard to make the overall experience match the content  such that How You Got There was at least as important as the plot and characters  a somewhat meta experiment that failed for me  Adams spent too much time in Dirk Gently throwing in stuff without payoff  making the reader work toward the overall goal  But The Hitchhiker s Guide  by comparison  is relatively straightforward  and the themes that transcend the plot and characters themselves work on their own What are those themes  First and foremost  The Hitchhiker s Guide is a humorous science fiction romp  sometimes to the point of absurdism  to list gag after gag sort of defeats the purpose of fellow readers  discovery of them for themselves  It really gets rollicking with commentary on Vogon poetry  have you ever encountered a lurgid bee     and lines like   It s unpleasantly like being drunk    What s so unpleasant about being drunk    You ask a glass of water    Add to that concepts like a chronically  severely depressed helper robot named  of all things  Marvin  and names like Slartibartfast  the artistic geo engineer of the second half of the book   and you have an experience that is       unique But the best science fiction also comments on aspects of mundane life as well  and The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy chooses as its focus of commentary the absurdity of everyday life in the modern era  whether mind numbing bureaucracy  or Homo sapiens  dogged insistence that it must be the highest form of life in the known universe  or the fascination in the late 1970s and early 1980s with digital watches despite their clunkiness  or people s consistency in repeating and restating  ad nauseam  the obvious  such as  It s raining out  or  You re very tall    As Adams himself stood six foot five  he was perhaps accustomed and resigned to such commentary on a regular basis   Yet Adams also comments on the joys of everyday life as well  Who can argue with Slartibartfast s reverence for the elegance and beauty of fjords  for example If there is a qualm with this book  it s that the rather abrupt end  even down to the final words of the book  telegraphs that Adams had plans for a sequel  The Restaurant at the End of the Universe  But as it is also clear that Adams had this planned from the get go  this is a minor quibble  All around  a fun  pleasant read  And incidentally  even though I put The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy on the  Book Is Better Than the Movie  shelf  the movie  while perhaps facing the impossibility of an exact translation of Adams  work  is not without its charms  The opening song   So Long  And Thanks for All the Fish   is hysterical  and I simply cannot shake Sam Rockwell as main character Zaphod Beeblebrox  even if I think Lenny Henry more than Mos Def for Ford Prefect   Regret the end of imagination with onset of high tech gizmos  Classic from the old daze  By far the funniest book I have ever read  The earth blows up and Arthur Dents world is turned upside down as he finds out his best friend is not really human at all  but an alien who saves Arthur s life by hitching a ride with the same ship that annihilated the earth  Good thing they have the guide  now isn t it  Como entusiastamente diria Zaphod Beeblebrox  es realmente maravilloso  Es real y verdaderamente maravilloso  Es tan maravillosamente maravilloso que me dan ganas de robarlo El senor Adams me ha hecho pasar un muy buen rato filosofico por el espacio ademas de haberme sacado unas cuantas carcajadas ingeniosas  Una lectura maravillosa y divertida   A couple of guys hitchhike across the galaxy  It s a good ol  English comedy time    Falls flat occasionally    Davis  Spring  15       4 A guy named Arthur who lives in London is told he is blocking a bike path  He goes on a crazy adventure    If you like adventure  you will like this     Jackie  Spring  15       The world ends  a guy turns into an alien and has an adventure  If you like adventures and or comedies  you might like it     Martin  Spring  16        A wonderful novel that was quite humorous  mind boggling and creative  I ll be certain to look into more of his other novels  as I really enjoyed the novel that this was  My favorite character is still Zaphod  with Arthur coming in at a close second  due to their humor and the creative way Adams uses them  It all started with a house    No  wait  it all started with a Deep Thought computer  No  it all started with    Never mind  Strap yourself in and partake in the journey of this brilliant British sarcasm on life  universe  and everything  Starting with a house   This book is great and pointless at the same time  Each page is spontaneous and completely unpredictable and funny  Even with 5 pages left in this pleasantly short book I had no clue how it would end  If you are okay with somewhat erratic and unconventional flow you may get as many laughs as I did from this book  Enjoy with light heartedness  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is a wholly remarkable book because it has the words DON T PANIC inscribed in large friendly letters on its cover A classic science fiction cliche plotline so simplistic and expected that it became surreal and complex  the Guide surprises everyone who ever picked it up with its shear impossibility in plot twists  names and concepts that either whirls your head round and round until you have to chuck it away in the darkest corner of the trash can and scream in frustration because  damn it  you want to read it again  or you plunged right in between the swirls and started spinning along with it  Whichever way you took  you would not escape the mystifying pull of Douglas Adams  pen Full of hysterical lame jokes  puns and the craziest unpredictability  Adam crudely ridiculed and used humor as his weapon the failures and narcissism of mankind  Wit and wisdom combined into one  this book made you howl with laughter not only of the less than intelligent protagonists  but also at yourself now and again to believe that you are the most intelligent life form on Earth when  in reality  the honor goes to the dolphins and the little white mice Below was one of the best sections of the book that I love  not explaining the reason why  Oh    and er    interesting rhythmic devices too   continued Arthur   which seemed to counterpoint the    er    er     he floundered  Ford leaped to his rescue  hazarding     counterpoint the surrealism of the underlying metaphor of the    er     He floundered too  but Arthur was ready again      humanity of the      Vogonity   Ford hissed at him   Ah yes  Vogonity   sorry   of the poet s compassionate soul    Aurthur felt he was on a homestretch now    which contrived through the medium of the verse structure to sublimate this  transcend that  and come to terms with the fundamental dichotomies of the other    he was reaching a triumphant crescendo    and one is left with a profound and vivid insight    into    er    For me  the lesson learned here is to be silly  to be infinite  to be impossible  to accept that anything can happen even with the most impossibility account and that there is nothing to do about it  I learned to live for the present rather than to mourn for the past or worry for the future  and to solve the problems at hand even in the most impossible way possible So absurd  so random  so whimsical  the Hitchhiker s Guide affected the Earth  described only as Mostly Harmless   the galaxy and the universe for the eternity ahead  But don t forget to bring a towel  Great Read  Its science fiction with a sense of humor  I don t know why I ve waited so long to read it  Its basically about an earthling who is rescued from earth right before the earth is destroyed who learns how to hitchhike around the galaxy  I ll probably re read this one every now and then  An insightful book   a change in perception   funny  yet very deep  A whole new humorist view of our place in the vast universe  Amazing read  Always a classic Must read I first heard This as a serial on bbc radio 4 back in the 1980 s  It s an old favourite that still rings true after so many years  This was probably the 4th or 5th time I ve read this book  It s amazing  It s hilarious  and a great intro for people who usually shy away from sci fi   It doesn t get any better than this  A masterpiece  This is not my typical book to read  so its my first of this type  and to tell you the truth its really amazing  i will probably read the second part and see how it goes  i would really recommend for everyone to read  everyone who likes a bit sarcastic and witty novel along with a whole different point of view  and with interesting characters  I really liked the book   loved it all the time  I want to read all over again and again A small  strange  magnificent  absurd  revolutionary book  Arthur Dent is an Earthman who knows there s stuff he doesn t know about the universe  He s not exactly sure what it is  but one day when the Earth is abruptly destroyed by an alien race building a new road through the Galaxy  and is only just saved by his friend who is actually an alien Ford Prefect  he s whacked over the face by all those things at once I m of opinion that this is a book for literary types  Or rather  a book at least best enjoyed by literary types  Certainly anyone can pick it up and be amused by the comedy employed  but Adams loves words  he crafts words with beautiful complication  and he employs vast stores of irony and satire of the genre  sci fi   along with healthy doses of poignancy and universal questions  raised  not answered  as good books do   I think that the only case that can be made against this book is for so called  undeveloped  characters  The story is much more driven by the themes behind it than by character development  so I would argue that the characters don t necessarily need to go through the same development process as in many other books  That s not the point of this book  It gets to its own point very finely   As a side note  satire is heavily used in naming of things  so be prepared to slog through goofy  exaggerated sci if names  I would encourage everyone to read this book  if you re open minded about reading something completely unlike anything you ve ever read before   Loved it  A great story with large amounts of sarcasm and humor sprinkled on it  Makes it perfect  On to the next part of the  trilogy in five parts    Beyond doubt one of the most brilliant novel in the comedy sci fi genre that Adams almost single handedly created  Well written  funny  and as epic the first in a trilogy of five can be  Certainly not the best written of the series  as it was his first major work ever published  but it ranks so highly because of what it initiated   This book had me laughing in the first five pages  I can t wait to watch the movie  I just needed a good laugh   This is one of my favorite book series  its comedy is relevant and hilarious and no matter how many times I read it I laugh at the same jokes and it is just a great book  Je to vtipne a svizne  konec urcite lepsi nez ve filmu  Takze za me dobry a rozhodne si prectu i ostatni stoparovky   I was so freaked out when I got to the end  What type of awful cliffhanger is that  And then Goodreads kindly assures me that is a series  and all is well  Dang  but is this book just fabulous  Totally in my top 3 to recommend to anybody  even if you re not all about that alien jazz  It s hilarious  and I m buying it as soon as I go to the bookstore  My physics teacher from 1980 still owes me my copy of HG2G   I don t know it was confiscated  it seemed relevant to our studies to me  perhaps I should have waited until after class though   I got another copy and was more careful about where I read it and have been an avid fan of Douglas Adams since    Douglas Adams just has a way of writing that most authors do not  He is quirky  funny and you can tell beyond the words that this is not just a crazy man putting down weird sentences and never heard before words  that he is actually a intelligent writer  Everything from the characters  to the adventures they have  the many aliens and worlds  even just getting a cup of tea is a must read in this book  I would say its a must read at least once  Very inventive  I loved the delightful irreverence for all reigning wisdom  right down to the  four book trilogy  concept I especially loved the descriptions of the solar flair surfers and the scientists who  never got invited to those sorts of parties  And the mother of all surprises was that the ending to this geeky cult classic was   well  sweet     This book is nothing for a reader without an odd sense of humour  The film made from it is nothing like the book  The entire story is quite wierd  but I found it hilaruous  I do not think no other book can be compared to this one  it is really one of the kind  And I expect the other books in the series are unique as well  Some day I going to find time to read them all  This month  I read  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy   a science fiction book by Douglas Adams  Arthur Dent  a completely normal  regular  person of Earth  is having a pretty bad day  It starts when his house is being torn down so a road can be built  Soon after that  the Earth is destroyed by Vogons  a disgusting  ugly  and unpleasant alien species  because they want to build a hyperspatial express route through Earth  Also  he finds out that his friend  Ford Prefect  is an alien from Betelgeuse  However  this news may be the only good news he will hear that day  because Ford had known about the Earth s destruction for a long time  and had hitched a ride with the Vogon ship s cooks  Unfortunately  the Vogons are not that stupid  and find Ford and Arthur and throw them out of the ship s airlock  leaving them for dead in the lonely void of interstellar space  Meanwhile  in another part of the vast universe  Ford s semi cousin Zaphod Beeblebrox  who is the President of the Galaxy  is stealing the amazing Heart of Gold spaceship  He is also accompanied by his human companion Trillian  The engine on the Heart of Gold  called the Infinite Improbability drive  is unexplainable yet extraordinary  because it lets the ship do improbable things such as travel the length of the universe in a second  turn incoming rockets into a sperm whale and a bowl of petunias  etc  This ship picks up Ford and Arthur right before they die because of lack of air  against the odds  If it wasn t for the amazing engine on the ship  they would ve died  Zaphod and Trillian were on their way to the mythical planet of Magrathea  which long ago  made luxury planets for rich people  However it disappeared a while ago  Zaphod isn t sure why he wants to find it  because his brain is messed up  When the group finds the planet  it seems cold  and dead  However  it isn t and Zaphod  Ford  and Trillian go exploring inside the planet  Arthur  and the ship s clinically depressed robot  Marvin  stay on the surface  However  a man from Magrathea named Slartibartfast finds Arthur  and tells him the truth about Earth  Long ago  the second best computer in the universe  was given the task to find the answer to life  the universe  and everything  After 7 and a half million years  it found the answer  The answer was 42  So  the Earth  the best computer in the universe  was created for one task  to find the question to life  the universe  and everything  However  the Vogons destroyed Earth 5 minutes before the 10 million year program was complete  Unfortunately for Arthur  Slartibartfast thinks that Arthur s brain may hold the answer  because he was a part of the Earth computer  and was present at the Earth s final moments  Alarmed  Arthur and his friends escape  What will happen next  Why is Zaphod s brain messed up  How did he steal the Heart of Gold  This hilarious  incredibly detailed  and will written science fiction story is definitely an amazing read  and I recommend it to anyone who wants to laugh and be fascinated at the same time  In my opinion  this book was hilarious  and well written  I love how Douglas Adams writes  because he uses a wide array of vocabulary and made up words to keep a science fiction feel  Every character progresses throughout the story  and has a unique personality  Also  the details he uses really lets you picture the universe and worlds he creates through writing  My favorite part of the book was when Slartibartfast described how the answer to life  the universe  and everything was found  The story was fascinating  and I finally understood all the references to the number  42   I couldn t put this book down for 3 days  which was not beneficial to my hours of sleep  but still worth it  It s a good book for people for every age  but it may be hard to understand keep track of for younger people  Overall  I would rate this book a 42 out of 42  4 5 This is probably the funniest book I ve read all year  It is certainly the funniest book I ve read since I finished the Princess Bride  I loved every word of the wild space trip  from the very first minute when Arthur Dent s house is pitted against a team of bright yellow bulldozers  to the very last when our hero s manage to escape from the many perils they ve entered  I hope that s not too much of a spoiler    Adams humor is clever  and creative  His colorful dialogue and narrative commentary are perfectly balanced  His characters are interesting  His story is engaging  I would recommend this story over and over   I never laughed before while reading  This book was different  I read it  I laughed  like it was a secret joke between me and the book  I am so glad I read this  If you get it  this is one of the greatest satires of all time  If you don t  well  then you don t  It s certainly not for everyone The absurdity of modern life is captured in this novel  and its sequels  From the destruction of Earth to make way for a galactic bypass  to the revelation that our existence was dictated by a supercomputer to learn the Ultimate Question  to the joys of Vogon Poetry  to the simple need for a Guide and a towel  this book is full of ridiculous vignettes and silly one liners  and is essential reading for the modern cynic  With all the variations out there of this story  I m always surprised when I meet someone who hasn t heard it  Just last week  a woman seriously asked me why her state senators had closed door meetings and made legislation so hard to track down  When I started quoting the whole  Beware of the Leopard  speech  she just looked at me like I was the crazy person  C mon people  It s one thing to not understand the process of how a bill becomes law  but not knowing about the Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  That s just inexcusable  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy was one of the first book I ever read voluntarily in English  Danish being my L1   and at the time this took my quite a while  However  it was completely worth it  By now I have read the entire trilogy  a trilogy in five parts  multiple times  and so far Douglas Adams hasn t managed to disappoint  The Guide is by far one of the most entertaining  humorous and quite frankly insane books i have ever read  I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good laugh  What a hilariously good read  This novel puts life in perspective  with a dollop of laughs along the way  Earth blowing up seems like not such a bad prospective  Just stick out your thumb and catch a ride to the next place  Just remember to bring your trusty towel   Simply put  one of the best books in existence  I thought this was a great book  it is a parody of traditional Science Fiction packed with humor  Starring the human survivor  1 Arthur Dent  a man from the star  Beetleguise  named Ford Prefect  a three armed two headed alien  Zaphod Beeblebrox  a smart but depressed robot  Marvin  and human survivor  2 Trillian  uno de mis libros de cabecera es de las pocas sagas que puedo leer una y otra vez THIS BOOK IS HILARIOUS  You know those moments where you read something so funny that you can t help but laugh out loud and you look like a crazy person to everyone else  Yeah  I had about 300 of those moments when reading this book  It s just plain funny  And honestly  a little profound   One word review  ExtraordinarySlightly longer review  Extra extra extra ordinary a must read  definitely my favorite science fiction book  It is also extremely witty and amusing from the first page to the last  Highly enjoyable Additional comment  The most significant quote  which in my opinion is hid by all the other hilarious quotes  is  I d far rather be happy than right any day     When Arthur Dent s house is going to be demolished unbeknown to him to build a Hyperspatial express route his life is instantly turned upside down as its not only his house that is going to be destroyed but the whole of planet Earth His friend Ford saves him at the critical moment and they both embark on a journey famously known as  the hitchhiker s guide to the galaxy   Along the way picking up the rather insane Zaphod Beeblebrox and his sort of girlfriend Trillian and their depressed Robot Marvin hilarity and mayhem ensue A crazy sci fi trip with a difference  This is a great book for sci fi  It was funny  mainly had British humor  which was fun too  The book  I think  is a good way to introduce Science Fiction novels   Not sure why I waited so long to read this book  It s my kind of humour  and cleverly constructed  Will have to continue with the series now     This book has been recommended to me multiple times over the years but it has always sat at the back of my reading list  I should not have waiting  I alternated between laughing and thinking about human insignificance  There was no time to get depressed though because I was quickly laughing again  If it is sitting on your list  wait not longer  Probably my all time favourite book growing up  So wonderful and original  While I really liked the others in his The Hitch Hiker s Guide to the Galaxy  A Trilogy in Five Parts  the first one was the best by far  For people who like this book I would highly recommend anything by Terry Pratchett  who also has a wonderful and random British sense of humor  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy by Douglad AdamsThey rereleased this in paperback to coincide with the movie release and my Mum bought it for me for a gift  She s a massive fan of the books and the original TV series  Adams  world is completely crazy and that is why it s so brilliant  particularly Marvin  the depressed robot  This book is extremely clever and has so many little jokes woven throughout that the reader should just plan on immediately rereading once finished  It s sort of like watching a Monty Python movie   the great British wittiness  flying out as fast as humanly possible  That is this book    from my 14 yr old  This is easily my favorite book  I rate other books by comparing them to this one  Ford is one of my favorite characters from any book  He is  essentially  the worst guide in the universe  with little empathy  no grasp of sarcasm  and an absurd answer to any question Arthur throws at him  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is action packed  hysterically funny  and surprisingly deep  delving into the end of the world  the British obsession with tea  and the answer to life  the universe  and everythingThis book made me laugh more than any book I ve ever read  but it also made me think about how I would respond to the chaos of having my home  and shortly thereafter  my planet  destroyed  then being shot across the galaxy on a quest for ultimate answer to the ultimate question Don t panic  42 This book  while not on the same level as  Naked Lunch   is still plenty trippy  it s full of wonderful nonsense about aliens  space travel and all the wonders of the universe  It s a book that will make you laugh with every page turn  Classic for a reason     Absolutely hilarious    No wonder it s on top of almost all best books list     I discovered this book when I was about 16  I started reading it one evening when I was babysitting and just laughed and laughed and laughed  Douglas Adams was a contemporary of the Monty Pythonites and wrote for their TV show  He has that wonderful subversive British humour from that era  This book  of course  quickly became a cult favourite and many of the phrases have entered our language  most notably the Babelfish which is now the name of a translation website   So I found out that I was supposed to have read this book in Middle School or something  Apparently it s something all people know they re supposed to read  And now I know why This book makes no sense  But it does  It s about this  Arthur Dent  Ford Prefect  Zaphod Beeblebrox  Trillian  a highway bypass  another highway bypass  some Vogons  the End of the Earth  a book  a babelfish  a supercomputer  some mice  some terrible poetry  some dolphins  and probability It isn t super character focused  it s more plot focused  But then again  the plot jumps from revelation to revelation  There isn t really a single aspect that is emphasized  It s all weird  but good weird  There is lots of alien stuff and space stuff  Rocket ships and super computers plus weird alien species  It s not uber complicated so everyone can understand it    or not understand it  I challenge someone to come forward and claim that they know the exact point to this book  And don t tell me 42 It s very strange  But it s also very hilarious in a twisted sort of way  Many ironies that just pile up make it dark  but funny at the same time If you don t like very pure  unadulterated science fiction  this book probably isn t your best choice  But to the rest of the sane world  read this and it will undoubtedly make you insane  It is  after all  a wholly remarkable book  Finally  I would suggest reading it anyway so you can understand the weird references people make to it in the world  The Number 42   So long  and thanks for all the fish   etc  etc  It s worth it just for that reason alone  you can finally understand that crazy person always mumbling obscure references to this book   I have a problem  If everyone raves about a book  I find it very difficult to read  I guess it s some weird streak inside me that rebels against  mainstream preferences   I did the same thing to the Harry Potter series  and it was well worth the read when I finally took the plunge The same is true for this book  Funny as hell and filled with simple yet sophisticated wit that you wish you thought up first  If you didn t really enjoy the movie  read the book   Sooooooooooo good This book is glorious  From the tone of the narrator to their wittingly amusing comments and observations  and to the delightful plot and lovable characters  I loved it all  I don t know what took me so long to pick up this book  but when finally I did  I could hardly put it down  Anyone who has yet to read this book is really missing out  It all begins with an introduction of the Earth resident Arthur Dent  Arthur is upset because he has just recently discovered that his house is about to be demolished in order to make room to build a bypass  That doesn t end up mattering  because a few seconds after an unsuspecting Arthur and his extraterrestrial friend Ford Prefect are beamed up by a Vogon spaceship  Earth is destroyed to make room for a hyperspatial express route   view spoiler   After being kicked off the ship that destroyed Arthur s planet  the two are remarkably picked up by a passing ship that the president of the galaxy  Zaphod Beeblebrox  was absconding with  The crew  which included Zaphod s girlfriend Trillian  and a chronically depressed robot named Marvin as well as a pair of white mice  eventually find themselves on the long lost planet Magrathea  While Zaphod  Ford  and Trillian explore the interior of the planet  Arthur discovers that Earth was actually an organic computer running a ten million year research program  which would have been completed just five minutes after it was destroyed  He s bemused to find out that mice are actually hyperintelligent pandimensional beings who commissioned the Margratheans to build the planet in order to find out The Ultimate Question  which the answer to was previously determined by the second greatest computer of all time  Meanwhile  the rest of the crew manages to get caught by the newly awoken Magratheans  and Zaphod begins to realize that he hid secrets from himself  and apparently set himself up to become President of the Galaxy only to steal the Heart of Gold  the revolutionary ship he s absconding with   The crew reunites when the mice  who had escaped the ship and also made their way into the planet s interior  invite them to lunch  They leave shortly after  partly because the mice had expressed a desire to remove Arthur s brain in order to find out The Ultimate Question without building a new earth  and partly beause a pair of cops have arrived to arrest Zaphod  The book leaves off the crew distancing themselves from Margrathea and making new plans for lunch    hide spoiler  Like I said  amazing book  I loved the author s casual  witty  voice  and their countless shenanigans  10 10  Finalmente la fantascienza che si prende gioco di seMi sono divertita tantissimo a leggerlo e sono contenta di averlo fatto  tant e che lo consiglio a chiunque voglia farsi una sana  veloce e spensierata lettura  Under the Sci Fi category this is 5 stars  I read this in high school so it s difficult to come back to review  However  the fact that I am able to distinctly recall parts of the book  10 years later  as comedic genius  can only be a testament to the excellence of this author  I cannot say that I remember many other books  storyline  specific sections or otherwise  as vividly  Adams certainly has a way with humor writing  not to even comment on the creativity the tale exudes  It seems like every chapter is an analogy for some aspect of the sad state of our society  and the utter absurdity of these analogies highlights that of our situation  but at the same time keeps the novel from ever taking itself too seriously  or seriously at all   Still  through these stories  Adams paints a convincing picture of how our world works  with what I saw as a particular focus on our selfishness  and  to an extent  how effectively we hide it from ourselves   And yet  as heavy as this all sounds  the book never ceases  even for a second  to be incredibly fun and adventurous and hilarious  the plot is entertaining and fast paced  and every paragraph is a silly  yet many layered  and perfectly British joke  I don t know what that means  but I mean it   Plus  Adams throws in tons of great references for math and science nerds  and his descriptions of advanced sci fi technologies are simultaneously ridiculous  creative and  in a weird way  kind of plausible  more so than many of those in serious sci fi stories Easily one of the best books I ve ever read  YA  Science Fiction  Ages

Description  Arthur Dent is taken from Earth moments before it s destruction by his friend to go on a series of out of this world adventures using the Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy to aid their way Characteristics 1  Science fiction speculates on a world that one day might be possible  When this book was published we knew only a little about space  but now with science and technology  and modern film  it takes on a whole new likeliness making it fit even more comfortably into the genre  2  Science fiction also has the ability to develop children s imaginations  Who hasn t dreamed of space travel  This book certainly expands on the fantasy to include some fantastic adventures leaving the reader with ideas and inquiries to last a lifetime How does this book serve its intended audience   This story serves to open the minds of young readers to the possibility of life in outer space and the destruction of Earth  It captures the reader almost instantly with the unimaginable  Reviews  Amazon  Most books that people read typically have a well set plot  setting  and characters  The Hitchhiker s Guide To The Galaxy takes anything and everything that most people know about book structure and just throws it right out the window  The book revolves around the unfortunate events of Arthur Dent s life after he woke up with a hangover one morning  He soon finds out that his house is to be destroyed for the creation of a highway  however his friend from outer space  Ford Prefect  took him out to go get drunk instead of protect his house  Upon getting drunk  The earth is soon destroyed by an alien race known as the Vogons  Ford was an author for The Hitchhiker s Guide To The Galaxy and was on Earth to help finish  but now that Earth has been destroyed he and Arthur need to find out how to survive in space after quickly being ejected into space by the hyper aggressive Vogon aliens  There are a plethora of things in this book that appealed to me while I read it  but some of the main things I liked turned out to be some things I also disliked and that was the plot of the story and the length of the book  While the summary I wrote seemed coherent enough  that s not how it is in the book  The plot of the story seemed to just be that whatever the author felt like writing at the time  which could be good or bad depending on if it was funny or not  Nothing really made any sense as to why something was happening until the end of the book abruptly came  The length of the book was an additional like and dislike because it was short enough that I felt confident in getting it done in a timely manner  but I enjoyed the book so much that I was completely disappointed when it did end  Most of the book  however  I felt more positively about including the humor  the writing style  and the characters  The humor in this book would confuse most people that aren t into very cheek in tongue and with an above average intelligence because it all revolves around science  sarcasm  and just acting stupid  Most people would get confused at the science humor and try to understand the stupid humor that doesn t make sense like a spaceship engine that can summon a massive sperm whale into space only to die by a rocket a second later  The writing style of this book is perhaps my favorite style of writing and that s just sarcasm so intelligently made that it is actually just incredibly stupid  Multiple times throughout the book I felt my IQ raise and drop within the same sentence  Lastly the characters in the book were my favorite because they were purely made out of stupidity  One of the characters had cauterized his own brain and added a second head to his body so you can guess how interesting they are in this book  The Hitchhiker s Guide To The Galaxy might be the best book I have ever read  It appeals to every little nerd part in me and the sarcasm kept me laughing the whole time  Any and all flaws that I found in this book were so minute that I felt like they didn t even affect the book terribly  In fact  the short length of this book makes me want to read the sequel even more than normal  This book was a near perfect book to me  Always strive to ask the right questions Otherwise  you might just waste 10 million years of precious time   P This book will change your life  Douglas Adams creates a light hearted science fiction that spans the whole of the universe in  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy   The book is an absolute adventure filled with comedic grandeur adventures that can last the entire book or end within an instant  This is a book that may seem like a jumbled mess to read but  with a little effort  can be enjoyed to the fullest  Wonderful narration for a wonderful story  I do hope you ve got your bathroom towel firmly in hand  And remember   whatever happens   DON T PANIC It s been too long since I read Adams  Hitchhiker series to review them individually  so please kindly assume this review covers the other 4 installments as well The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is nihilist existentialism made positively hilarious in a rip roaring  edge of your seat science fiction tall tale  The Guide is to science fiction what Discworld is to fantasy  and Adams  Hitchhiker books are just what we would have gotten if Terry Pratchett had been asked to write Doctor Who in the absurdist philosophic tradition of Albert Camus While Adams owes many of his sci fi concepts to Doctor Who  writing most of the Guide just prior to the Whovian Dark Ages when that great and classic show was taken off the air  1990 2005   his storylines are delightfully unexpected  his characterizations are unforgettable  and his narrative voice will make you laugh aloud over and over  If you ve not done yourself the favor of browsing through the Guide yet  I suggest you use your Electronic Thumb to hitch a ride to the nearest intergalactic bookstore as soon as can be  Loved It  every single word on every page was just perfection  This hilarious book is about a man who gets taken from his home and is forced to watch his home planet die and has to learn about what new world is out there for him  This book is hilarious  It tends to compare the oddities of Earth with the cultures in the book  and that maybe we aren t so different  We do things that might be considered weird to others  but we think it is normal because it is different to them  It s humorous and tells an interesting story  My favorite character  and one of my favorites out of all the books I ve read  is still Marvin the Paranoid Android  I also think the movie adaptation still remains more or less true to the story and I think it was able to still retain the humor  This is the third time I ve read this one  The first two readings took place about a year apart in high school  when I read the entire series  However  seeing as though I hadn t read them again as an adult  I figured it was high time  Spurned on by an excellent deal on Amazon for Douglas Adams  birthday  I swore that I would retake the journey So what makes Adam s incorrectly named trilogy so successful  Speaking to the success of the first in the series  Douglas succeeds where so many other contemporary writers fall short  writing an engrossing world that feels complete  a world that a reader can live inside of  Each of the characters feels full  complete  entertaining So  with this universe  Adams passes the time with sarcastic mathematics and memorable quotes  so memorable that we can look at our culture and see where they ve carried on  It s this genius that makes the book so successful  and the absolute absurdity of the story that makes it so endearing But Adams backs it up with enough pseudo future history to make it all believable  One of the greatest strengths of the books is the way Adams uses every element to support every other element  though not in a house of cards fashion  No  Adams has constructed a fort that bridges the gap between humor readers and  I just don t like humor novels  I find myself amongst the latter But Adams has and will go down amongst the great science fiction and humor writers  bringing Christopher Moore and Isaac Asimov together in great harmony  A hoot  Just so funny  Adams has a refreshing voice that is quirky and sarcastically funny  The book follows two hitchhikers  Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect  who board a spaceship just as planet Earth is destroyed  I think the reason I like this book so well is because it is unlike anything I have read before  Strange situations  stranger people and a depressed robot cause the reader to never lose interest Favorite quote   Well   said Trillian in a bright compassionate tone   here s something to occupy and keep your mind off things   It won t work   droned Marvin   I have an exceptionally large mind   I thought this book was fantastic  On the back there is a quote that describes the book as     inspired lunacy      That could not describe it better  This was absolutely crazy  hilarious  and has what I would call  organized psychosis   There are slightly and completely sense making pages upon pages  I loved the witty and sarcastic humor so much that I actually laughed out loud  even when not reading  I lost sleep being devoured in its amazingness  I  with all my heart  suggest this  The most hilarious book I have ever read  Just brilliant British humour   Funny book  it uses comedy to explore the bureaucracy we have nowadays to do very simple things  Provides an alternative explanation of how the earth  and humans  were created and a civilization s quest to answer the Ultimate Question of Life  the Universe  and Everything  Should be a mandatory reading at school  Hilarious  Douglas Adams takes you on an amazing adventure  with  Vogons and all the other aliens  you will laugh till you cry  An absolute must read   It d been four years since I last picked up this book  This second read was much more paced  letting content and ideas sink in more thoroughly  Which might have been a mistake because now I can t get these out of my head  From Chapter 1 Douglas Adams  unique writing style caught on to my liking  He twists common sense and uses it against you  And being successful at that  sentence after sentence  each of which is  in turn  even more hilarious than its predecessor is probably one of the reasons he s turned into my idol  The book is short  only 218 odd pages  but filled with content to paint your imagination for a while  And with consideration  I must say that reading this book in public might be hazardous to your reputation  Unless you re the sort that doesn t really care  Then you wouldn t be reading this book   far the review   anyways  There were many times that I found myself inflated with hysterical laughter  While some reviews accuse Douglas Adams  writings to be  nonsensical  and point fingers at him for  building up an entire BS story just to sneak in one catchy line   I have to disagree  They make perfect sense  The improbability of anyone misunderstanding the actual content or context might be as high as two to the power of some random phone number  or as low as chances of hitting one of Zaphod s heads when you throw a paper ball at him  Whether you re a bowl of petunias or a sperm whale  it doesn t matter  because in the end you will only want more of whats lurking around in Adam s crazy head  Hilarious classic   I read all five in the   trilogy   after listening to tapes of the radio series  Though I found the books got weaker and weaker   or was it just reader fatigue    it worked better than on radio  though  obviously  the radio characterisations and voices helped  The TV series wasn t as good as either  and the movie  which followed much later  was an utter travesty  In an ideal  possibly parallel  universe  we would have been happiest just to have been given this one version Imaginative and funny  simultaneously the perfect sci fi and sci fi parody  Excellent sense of humour  Highly recommend  so intelligent and funny   it s amazing in how small a novel such a force of brilliance is packed The universe he creates is fantastic  Throughout my childhood by Dad and brother would quote Marvin  then whilst a teenager I babysat for two boys who would play the TV series over and over again  It all seemed a bit silly to me and I thought that the book would be the same and somewhat dated As I read this  I was surprised that the words just came back to me   the TV series obviously followed the book closely and although still a bit on the  silly  side I now realise how clever it all is  Absolutely loved it   and actually instead being dated works better now than 20yrs ago MUST read the others    Hilarious wit and gentle wisdom combine to make this a book whose lines I continue to chuckle about  There is another level in which this book works for me too involving being able to laugh one s own species in a non bitter way  and a survivor s ability to accept whatever it is that comes next in a particularly British manner  involving humor and resilience that I admire  There were not passages of mesmerizing description but there was a lot of that rarest of writer s gifts  the right words  Humor especially  I would argue  requires just the right words  There is a scene in the great movie  The Sunshine Boys  in which the point is made that some words are funny   works with a  K  sound are funny   explains the old vaudeville comic to his nephew who replies  I ll get you a taxi    Taxi is not funny  cab is funny   One of my favorite scenes in Don Adams  book is when the supercomputer is asked to solve the meaning of life  why we are here  everything  After a long pause the computer replies   Tricky   I love that  and it has a  k  in it   A group of alien demolishes Earth to make way for a galactic freeway  one instant before two people leave the Earth jumping on a space ship  One is Arthur  a very calm and routine man  and the other is Ford Prefect  an alien who works for the The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  the most incredible book in the universe  Here start a crazy adventure through the galaxy  with a two head alien  a depressed robot  a ship with an improbable engine   in search of the meaning of life Adams create a lot of absurd situations  with his fresh style full of amusing dialogues  in a book that seems crazy but is full of intelligence and caustic questions about the human nature and the human society This is an author who succeeds in hide serious reflections in a light and enjoyable context  and  don t underestimate this   his tells you the Answer to Life  the Universe  and Everything   A causa di un gruppo di alieni che vuole demolire

interrogativi pungenti sulla natura dell uomo e della societa Adams e un autore che riesce perfettamente a inserire profonde riflessioni in un contesto leggero e piacevole  e inoltre  non sottovalutate questa cosa   vi rivelera la Risposta alla Vita  l Universo e Tutto Quanto    And then  one Thursday  nearly two thousand years after one man had been nailed to a tree for saying how great it would be to be nice to people for a change  I borrowed Hitch Hikers from the library and changed my outlook on reading forever  At school they told us what and when to read and as a consequence I d never read anything except for  Winnie the Pooh  and  The House at Pooh Corner   then they sent us home to revise for our  O  levels and I needed a silent occupation to keep me entertained whilst my Mother thought I was revising  Early on I was caught with my walkman on  I hadn t heard my mum coming up the steps  and so reading seemed like the ideal solution I d enjoyed the TV series of Hitch Hikers and so got this from the library and changed overnight from a non reader to a prolific reader  I didn t so much read as consume this and the remainder of the then four Hitch Hikers books over the next couple of days  Douglas Adams prose was so entertaining that it not only made him instantly my favourite but also introduced me to reading for pleasure  Before my revision leave was over I d not only read the four part Hitch Hikers trilogy three times but I had also read the entire output of Tom Sharpe as well as all the James Bond and Phillip Marlowe books Twenty five years later Adams is still my favourite author and I can t help but think if I d not discovered these books then I would never have read and would have missed out on all the hundreds of great books I ve read since  Mind you I might have done better in my  O  levels  I could have been a contender     A smorgasbord of science  philosophy and superb comedy  THE HITCHHIKER S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY is one of those rare books that heaps tons of science  philosophy and spirituality at the reader  hidden under layers of absurdist humor  It presents a unique and original outlook to Life the Universe and Everything and even seeks to quanify it  only to suggest that to quantify such a thing one needs to know the actual question one wants to pose  Brilliance wrapped in humor is something I highly respect  Douglas Adams was a man who knew how to present his beliefs in such a way that one never felt that he was ever too preachy  They shook their heads and said initially  that s just so mental   before realizing just how subversive such beliefs were First in an equally brilliant and absurdist trilogy  THE HITCHHIKER S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY offers an enduring vision of how an author can play with the reader while weaving a delicately intricate story of deeper meaning and purpose  When I first got this book it was with its sequel  THE RESTAURANT AT THE END OF THE UNIVERSE  It was a birthday present  I never laughed so hard while reading a book or felt so satisfed when I was finished  I devoured both books in one evening and reread them several times over the years  Reading these books is like being initiated into a special club  in much th same way as seeing MONTY PYTHON S FLYING CIRCUS for the first time  and getting the humor  makes one feel like they have just been initiated into a special club  THE HITCHHIKER S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY is well written and just plain fun all the way around  It is whip smart and unapologetically speculative about practically everything  For this reason alone  no other series of books receive as high a recommendation from me to friends and other readers than THE HITCHHIKER S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY and its four sequels  To be truly thought provoking while being completely bonkers in equal measures is a hard thing  a difficult tightrope for anyone to walk  No one managed the task better  or easier  than Douglas Adams  Absurd  hilarious  very British humor  stick a babel fish in my ear and hold on for dear life and a great ride   You either love this book or you hate it  It took me a while to start liking the story because it didn t make any sense and I don t think it did for Arthur Dent too Ford Prefect turns out to be an alien humanoid from another planet and has known about the earths destruction for a while and when the time comes for the earth to go he tells Arthur Dent everything  Unexpectedly  the alien cooks on the ship  that exterminated earth  beams them aboard starting their wild adventure  I was required to read this in English class and had already heard a lot about it from friends but even that didn t prepare me for the book  The plot twists and turns and throws me off  I also didn t like many of the characters but overall I really liked how weird it was   will enlarge your vision and boost your creaitivity  Okay so I added the wrong book  I was unaware there was an ULTIMATE Hitchiker s Guide to the Galaxy  So anyways  read it a long time ago and don t remember any of it and needed another book to read because I am lazy and left my copy of Dexter upstairs   and stair climbing required to omuch energy  Joprojam tikpat laba ka pirmaja reize   _  This book is the perfect dose of whimsical cynicism  If you ve seen the movie and liked it  you ll love the book  Now I have to read all the others in the  trilogy   I actually didn t read this until after I saw the movie a few years ago  But  I quickly became a fan of the series  It s quirky and offbeat  The storyline is complex and I really like that it doesn t dumb down the  science  theories that are presented  It reads more like a lesson plan in many areas but the dialog is entertaining  All the characters are intriguing and though the plot is kind of typical for sci fi  the twists make this book just plain fun  READ IN ENGLISHJust grab a towel and relax because this review has  Don t Panic  written on it I believe that the Hitchhiker s Guide has been a very famous and well known SF classic for years now  Among my friends there are multiple running jokes concerning The Question of Life  Universe and Everything  dolphins and a sperm whale I remember that  as a kid  I used to translate stuff into English with a translate machine called Babelfish  It was a shitty translator  even compared with Google Translate meagre translations   I never knew why it was called like this  until I read this book So many things became clear  Just in order to  get  the jokes I would recommend this book  But it is so much more  Some things have become funny  even though they weren t meant to be  like all this stuff over   OMG so state of the art   Digital watches  no  they didn t have a WIFI connection or anything fancy   This  and so much more  When I was reading it  there were many scenes I had to read multiple times  because people wanted to know just why I was laughing so hard Note  There used to be a Dutch radio show of The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  Dutch readers may find it interesting to know that Ford was called Amro Bank     6 5 stars  because babel fish  Awesome  hilarious read  Gotta give it to the witty Adams  Full review   https   thebooksconfetti wordpress com   Mr  Adams approaches the universe at large with the nonchalant wit of a man on a casual Sunday drive  Each new character and species introduced is a razor sharp jab at governmental agents  bureaucrats  and celebrity personalities  from the innefectual and aloof Vogons to the idiotic and painfully ignorant President of the Galaxy  Zaphod Beeblebrox  The writing is literally a laugh a minute  every page holding some new witticism or metaphor that is sure to bring a smile to your face  Read it before you die  This is one of the greatest book I have ever read  It is humorous  comical and highly improbable  I would love to read it over and over again  Deeply fascinating  It is not a work a genius  it is genius   I thoroughly enjoyed Hitchhiker s Guide  I can see it s influence in many of my favorite Sci Fi shows  movies and games  If you like Red Dwarf  Futurama  Rick and Morty or British Humor then this should be right up your alley  So DON T PANIC and read the Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  Then you too will be one hoopy frood  Funny  funny  funny  Clever  witty  hilariously satirical  The sequels aren t worth anything  but the radio series and movie are great  What is the answer to life   I love that question and the answer that come s along with the book just makes you smile and laugh  I will admit if it wasn t for the movie I probably would have never read this book  I am so happy I did  I will admit after reading this you can tell that for this book you will either hate it or love it  Who doesn t love a wacky book with weird characters  I definitely need to read the other books with this series  I could read this over and over again  awesome  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is one of those classic science fiction books that one either gets or not   somewhat like quantum physics  only with more references to drinking  It is difficult to pinpoint the exact reasons behind the charm and allure of this series  but allow me an honest attempt  Douglas Adams  sense of humor is as dry as vermouth  but as inherently amusing as a top notch stand up comic  His writing is filled with clever phrases  amusing anecdotes  and outrageous tangents  At times the point of his tangents seems simply to befuddle his audience  yet the random style of humor also brings many readers back time and again  The characters are mostly lovable  and as a reader I became extremely attached to the entire crew  From Zaphod s extra head  Marvin s incredible bouts of andriod depression to Trillian s icy heart  the characters kept me entertained throughout the story   I found it pretty good and very insightful and entertaining  Zaphod wasn t exactly what he seemed  he was a bit more or less  He turned out to be more than what most expected  he just decided to not show it as much  His pick up line  even though how simple and stupid it seems turned out to be true  I honestly didn t like Trillian much  but the fact is  she was a decent person  Marvin  however  I found to be quite amusing  He was a depressed robot  stuck in the company of people who didn t even care about his intelligence so they used him as a doorman  Overall the book was pretty good  When I was in the middle of the book my teacher saw me reading it and pulled me on the side  She said   I m the perfect age  Do you know how old I am   In unison we said  forty two   My new job  sitting in front of a computer clicking numbers  allows me to listen to my iPod all day  Most people there have earbuds in their ears all day long  as stare at their computers  It s all very Fahrenheit 451  BUT it is awesome because now  although I have much less reading time  I can consume more literature than usual thanks to the wonders of audio books  I started and finished  Hitchhiker s Guide  today  It was so dang good  I kept laughing out loud  the writing is so witty   The version I listened to was narrated by the author and he did such an amazing job with the voice expression  joke inflection  and sound effects  I just loved it   I love this book  and I love this style of writing  Another author who reminds me of Douglas Adams is Terry Pratchett  They both have the same wacky  off the wall  and slightly odd sense of humour  They both sometimes go off on tangents that perhaps at first don t appear to make sense  but in the end it all comes together I love Adams  take on the sci fi genre  It really makes me want to read more sci fi books  He has some brilliant ideas  like the Infinite Probability Drive  and Marvin the Paranoid Android I would definitely recommend this book to  well  pretty much anyone with a sense of humour  I really LOved this book  It took me years to read it  mostly because Mom wouldn t stop talking about it      I m among those who s first introduction to Hitchhiker was the movie  and going from the movie and then reading the book years later  i felt it was great I had an image already of how the characters looked and an impression on how they were from the movie  however the book goes beyond it and you get an even better image of the characters and their thought process  I love the quirks about politics and i love the little bits of philosophy intertwined here and there and i love how it all just spells wherever you go  things like this remain the same I d have to say  i like both the way the movie ends it and i love how the book ends this story  they re very different If i had to pick a favorite character in the book  i d have to say Marvin  this always depressed robot and how he interacts with both the crew and everything else he meets is just fantasticly funny  One read is just not enough to grasp the brilliance of the brilliantly though out  yet completely meaningless plot  42 I have read this book so many times and I never get tired of it  This is a world I want to experience day in and day out  The BBC radio series makes it all the better   Ah man  this was hilarious  I m sure I missed out on a lot of the satire  but what I did pick up was great  and some of it was just plain old humor  The next books weren t as good  but I m sure I ll reread this many times  Esilarante  scorrevole   ai limiti dell assurdo e della genialita  Un cult da non perdere  If you are looking to enter the comedy writing world or simply want a good laugh  pick this up right away   In anticipation of the film rendition of this book several years ago  my friend advised me to read Doug Adams  Hitchhiker series  I was blown away  I had read The Lord of The Rings series and Frank Herbert s Dune  but I had never paid attention to the way authors crafted their own universe around their stories  Adams took the time to shine a light on every facet of the world he created  and helped me to look for the same quality in other writing  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is one of those books you ll not only remember for years to come but be quoting for years to come  Douglas Adams  humor drips from every sentence and is the sort of thing that deserves to be read aloud  The satire throughout this tale of being taken into space on an unexpected  and very much unwanted  adventure reminds us of how glad we should be that our universe isn t as insane as it very well could be  If I need to explain why this is a MUST READ book then you just aren t going to get it and should probably return to the life of the single cell amoeba that you evolved from Needless to say it is a ripping yarn that I was first introduced to via the BBC radio show  While travelling around Australia with my olds in a little Mazda at 7 years of age   Soon after we saw the BBC TV adaptation and from there it was the entire collection of novels  Douglas Adams is for Science Fiction as Terry Pratchett is to fantasy If you know neither of these two authors  then refer to the first sentence of this review The series consists of The Hitchhiker s Guide to the GalaxyThe Restaurant at the End of the UniverseLife  the Universe and EverythingSo Long  and Thanks for All the FishMostly HarmlessAnd Another Thing   Plot    Spoilers   The Hitchhiker s Guide to the GalaxyThe book begins with contractors arriving at Arthur Dent s house  in order to demolish it to make way for a bypass  His friend  Ford Prefect  arrives while Arthur is lying in front of the bulldozers  to keep them from demolishing it  He tries to explain to Arthur that he is actually from a planet somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse and that the Earth is about to be demolished  The Vogons  an alien race  intend to destroy Earth to make way for a hyperspace bypass The two escape by hitching a lift on one of the Vogon demolition ships  This is  however  against Vogon regulations  and when the pair are discovered  they are tortured with a reading of Vogon poetry  the third worst in the known Universe  and then thrown into space  They are  very improbably  picked up by the Heart of Gold  a ship powered by an infinite improbability drive  which has been stolen by Ford s semi cousin and President of the Galaxy  Zaphod Beeblebrox  Zaphod  accompanied by Trillian and the chronically depressed robot Marvin  is searching for the legendary planet of Magrathea  which is rumoured to have manufactured luxury planets  Ford is initially skeptical  but they do  in fact  find Magrathea There  Arthur  after being separated from the rest of the group  is taken into the interior of the planet by a native  Slartibartfast  The others are kidnapped  Slartibartfast explains to Arthur that the Earth was actually a supercomputer commissioned and paid for by a race of  hyper intelligent    pan dimensional  beings  These creatures had earlier built a supercomputer called Deep Thought to calculate the Answer to Life  the Universe  and Everything  This computer  after seven and a half million years of calculation  had announced that the Answer is in fact 42  Being unsatisfied with the Answer  they set about finding the Question which would give the Answer meaning  whereupon Deep Thought designed the Earth  to calculate it  However  ten million years later  and just five minutes before the completion of the program Earth was designed to execute  the Earth is demolished by the Vogons  Two of these beings  Frankie Mouse and Benjy Mouse  had arrived on Magrathea on the Heart of Gold  in the form of Trillian s pet mice The mice realize that a latent version of the question  or something very like it  must exist in Arthur s brain since he is a late generation organic product of the computer  and offer to buy his brain from him  Arthur declines  and a fight ensues  The mice are about to cut Arthur s head open when klaxons all over the planet are activated  creating a diversion during which Arthur  Ford  Zaphod and Trillian are able to escape  The galactic police arrive on the planet to arrest Zaphod and the group is attacked by two officers who abruptly die when the life support systems in their spacesuits fail  Marvin had been talking to their ship  which was linked to their suits  and as a result it had become so depressed that it committed suicide The group decides to go to The Restaurant at the End of the Universe for lunch The Restaurant at the End of the UniverseThe Restaurant at the End of the Universe begins just as The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy ended  Arthur Dent  Ford Prefect  Trillian  and Zaphod Beeblebrox have just left the planet Magrathea when they are attacked by a Vogon ship  They find they are unable to use the Improbability Drive to escape  as Arthur has accidentally jammed the computer with a simple request for a cup of tea which proved a rather difficult problem  Luckily  an ancestor of Zaphod s  Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth saves them Zaphod and Marvin vanish  and reappear at the offices of the Guide on Ursa Minor Beta  They are looking for Zarniwoop  who has gone on an intergalactic cruise in his office via his virtual universe  Arthur  Trillian and Ford are unaware of any of this  knowing only that the computer has been shut down  and only having received a message from a stalling Nutrimatic that says  Wait  When Zaphod and Marvin reach the fifteenth floor of the Guide s office  half of the building is lifted off the ground by Frogstar Fighters  A mysterious man named Roosta brings Zaphod to Zarniwoop s office  where they wait until the building lands on Frogstar World B  Roosta gives Zaphod final instructions before he leaves  Go through the window on his way out  not the door  Zaphod then meets Gargravarr who informs Zaphod that he is to be sent through the Total Perspective Vortex  a torture device which annihilates you by showing you just how infinitesimally small you are compared to the Universe  However when Zaphod enters it  the Vortex shows him that he is the most important thing in the Universe  Zaphod escapes  and finds Zarniwoop in the first class cabin of a spaceliner in an abandoned spaceport Zarniwoop explains that the Total Perspective Vortex has not malfunctioned    this is a virtual universe created by Zarniwoop for the sole benefit of Zaphod  who is the most important creature in this universe  It turns out that Zaphod had the shrunk Heart of Gold in his jacket pocket the whole time  It is reconstituted  and Zaphod is reunited with Trillian  Arthur and Ford  They escape from Zarniwoop by asking to be transported to the nearest restaurant  Milliways  the Restaurant at the End of the Universe  is the nearest restaurant in space but not time  They are transported there  five hundred and seventy six thousand million years  into the future  Marvin is left stranded here for this incredibly vast amount of time parking diners  spaceships while waiting for the humans to return  After the meal  Zaphod and Ford steal a spaceship  which turns out to be a stuntship belonging to the rock band Disaster Area  programmed to dive into a star to provide backing effects for a rock concert  There is a teleporter on the ship for which the guidance system was never built  as it was never intended to be used  and it also requires somebody to stay on the ship in order to operate it  Marvin is chosen to stay behind and teleport the others  who have no choice but to go wherever it takes them Zaphod and Trillian are returned to the Heart of Gold  which is commandeered by Zarniwoop to complete his mission  to discover who really rules the Universe  As it turns out  the Ruler of the Universe is entirely skeptical that he holds this position  as he is entirely skeptical of everything  including whether his cat  The Lord  really exists  or whether there is even a universe at all outside of his small isolated home  While Zarniwoop attempts to impress upon the Ruler of the Universe the reality and the weight of his position  Trillian and Zaphod sneak out and fly the Heart of Gold away The teleporter has meanwhile sent Arthur and Ford to the Golgafrinchan Ark Fleet Ship B  a ship of fools which crash lands on prehistoric Earth  They realize that the bumbling travellers are the real ancestors of modern humans  not the Neanderthals originally inhabiting the planet  Arthur attempts to determine the Question to the Ultimate Answer of Life  the Universe and Everything by reaching into a Scrabble bag made from Ford s towel and pulling out letters randomly  hoping Deep Thought s computational matrix in Earth would have rubbed off on his subconscious  The letters spell  What do you get when you multiply six by nine  2  before running out  although the Neanderthals manage to spell  forty two  with the tiles  implying that it is they  rather than the Golgafrinchans  who were intended to be part of Earth s computer matrix  After some brief contemplation  Ford and Arthur realize that this is  in fact  a detrimental  cock up   and that the Earth will never produce the proper Question  thus destroying all hope of ever finding out what it is As Ford convinces Arthur that there is nothing that can be done to improve the inevitable history of the Earth  Arthur decides that he should make the best of his situation and settles for a life on prehistoric Earth Life  the Universe and EverythingAfter being stranded on pre historic Earth after the events in The Restaurant at the End of the Universe  Arthur Dent is met by his old friend Ford Prefect  who drags him into a space time eddy  represented by an anachronistic sofa  The two end up at Lord s Cricket Ground two days before the Earth s destruction by the Vogons  Shortly after they arrive  a squad of robots land in a spaceship in the middle of the field and attack the assembled crowd  stealing The Ashes before departing  Another spaceship  the Starship Bistromath  arrives  helmed by Slartibartfast  who discovers he is too late and requests Arthur and Ford s help As they travel to their next destination  Slartibartfast explains that he is trying to stop the robots from collecting all the components of the Wikkit Gate  Long ago  the peaceful population of the planet of Krikkit  unaware of the rest of the Universe due to a dust cloud that surrounded its solar system  were surprised to find the wreckage of a spacecraft on their planet  Reverse engineering their own vessel  they explored past the dust cloud and saw the rest of the Universe  immediately taking a disliking to it and determining it must go  They built a fleet of ships and robots to attack the rest of the Universe in a brutal onslaught known as the Krikkit Wars  but were eventually defeated  Realising that the Krikkit population would not be satisfied alongside the existence of the rest of the Universe  it was decided to envelop the system in a Slo Time envelope  allowing Krikkit to survive long after the rest of the universe has ended  the Wikkit Gate was the key to the envelope  However  just before it was activated  one ship carrying a troop of robots escaped the envelope  and began to retrieve the pieces of the Gate after they were dispersed about space and time The three transport to a party that has lasted numerous generations where another Gate component  the Silver Bail  is to be found  but Arthur finds himself separated from the others and ends up at a Cathedral of Hate created by a being called Agrajag  Agrajag reveals that Arthur has killed him countless times before  each time reincarnating into a new form that is soon killed by Arthur  and now plans to kill Arthur in revenge  However  when he realises that Arthur has yet to cause his death at a place called Stavromula Beta  Agrajag discovered he took Arthur out of his relative timeline too soon  and that killing him now would cause a paradox but attempts to kill Arthur anyway  In his insanity  Agrajag brings the Cathedral down around them  Arthur manages to escape unharmed  partially due to learning how to fly after falling and missing the ground while catching sight of a piece of luggage he had lost at a Greek airport years before  After collecting the suitcase  Arthur inadvertently comes across the flying party and rejoins his friends  Inside  they find Trillian  but they are too late to stop the robots from stealing the Bail  Arthur  Ford  Trillian  and Slartibartfast return to the Bistromath and try to head off the robots activating the Wikkit Gate Meanwhile  the Krikkit robots steal the last piece  the Infinite Improbability Drive core from the spaceship Heart of Gold  capturing Zaphod Beeblebrox and Marvin the Paranoid Android at the same time The Bistromath arrives too late at the gate to stop the robots  and transport to the planet to attempt to negotiate with the Krikkit people  To their surprise  they find that the people seem to lack any desire to continue the war  and are directed to the robot and spaceship facilities in orbit about the planet  With Zaphod and Marvin s help  the group is able to infiltrate the facilities and discover that the true force behind the war has been the supercomputer Hactar  Due to the obvious flaw in the idea that the people of Krikkit are simultaneously smart enough to develop their ultimate weapon  a bomb that could destroy every star in the universe  while also being stupid enough not to realise that this weapon would destroy them too   Previously built to serve a war faring species  he was tasked to build a supernova bomb that would link the cores of every sun in the Universe together at the press of a button and cause the end of the Universe  Hactar purposely created a dud version of the weapon instead  causing his creators to pulverise him into dust  which thus became the dust cloud around Krikkit  still able to function but at a much weaker level  Trillian and Arthur speak to Hactar in a virtual space that he creates for them to explain himself  Hactar reveals that he spent eons creating the spaceship that crashed on Krikkit in order to inspire their xenophobia and incite them to go to war  also influencing their thoughts  However  when the Slo Time envelope was activated  his control on the population waned  As he struggles to remain functional  Hactar apologises to Trillian and Arthur for his actions before they leave for their ship With the war over  the group collects the core of the Heart of Gold and the Ashes  the only two components of the Wikkit Gate not destroyed by the robots  and returns Zaphod and Marvin to the Heart of Gold  Returning only moments after the robots  attack at the Lord s Cricket Grounds  Arthur attempts to return the Ashes  but is suddenly inspired to bowl one shot at a wicket that is being defended using a cricket ball in his bag  However  in mid throw  Arthur suddenly realises that the ball he had was created and placed in his bag by Hactar and is actually the working version of the cosmic supernova bomb  and that the defender of the wicket is one of the Krikkit robots  ready to detonate the bomb once thrown  all this causing him to trip  miss the ground  and allow him to fly  Arthur is able to throw the ball aside and disable the robot in mid throw In the end Arthur goes to live on the planet Krikkit where he becomes a more skillful flier and learns bird language So Long  and Thanks for All the FishArthur Dent has hitch hiked through the galaxy and is dropped off on a planet in a rainstorm  He realises that he appears to be in England on Earth  even though he saw it destroyed by the Vogons  While he has been gone for several years  it appears only a few months have passed on Earth  He manages to hitch a ride with a man named Russell  who is driving home his sister Fenchurch  Fenny for short   Russell explains that she had become delusional after worldwide mass hysteria over the  hallucinations with the big yellow spaceships   Vogon Ships   Arthur also learns that all the dolphins disappeared shortly after that event  Arthur becomes curious about Fenchurch  but they reach his home before he can ask more questions  Inside his still standing home  Arthur finds a gift wrapped bowl inscribed with the words  So Long and Thanks     which he then uses for his Babel Fish  Arthur considers that Fenchurch is somehow connected to him and to the Earth s destruction  and finds that he still has the ability to fly whenever he lets his thoughts wander After putting his life in order  Arthur tries to find out more about Fenchurch  He catches her hitchhiking and he learns more about her  He obtains her phone number but loses it  He finds her home when he locates the cave he had lived in after crashing onto prehistoric Earth with the Golgafrinchans  her flat is built on the same spot  As they talk they find more circumstances connecting them  Fenchurch reveals that  moments before her hallucinations  she had an epiphany while sitting in a cafe about how to make everything right  but then blacked out  Ever since  she has not been able to recall it  After seeing that Fenchurch s feet do not touch the ground  Arthur teaches her how to fly and together they make love over London They travel to California to see John Watson  a scientist who purports to know the cause of the dolphins  disappearance  Watson shows them a bowl with the words  So long and thanks for all the fish  inscribed on it that they all own and encourages them to listen to it  They learn from the bowl s audio message that the dolphins  aware of the Vogons  left Earth for an alternate dimension but not before replacing the destroyed Earth with a new version and transporting everything to it as a way of saving humans  Arthur explains to Fenchurch about hitchhiking across the galaxy  after which she insists that she wants to see it as well  They plan to hitchhike on the next passing spaceship Concurrent to these events  Ford Prefect discovers that during an update of the  Hitchhiker s Guide   his previous entry for Earth   Mostly harmless   has been replaced with the volumes of text he wrote during his research  Recognising that something is strange  Ford begins to hitchhike across the galaxy to reach Earth  eventually using the ship of a giant robot to land in the centre of London and causing a panic  In the chaos  Ford meets up with Arthur and Fenchurch and together they commandeer the robot s ship  Arthur takes Fenchurch to the planet where God s Final Message to His Creation is written  and they happen across Marvin  who  because of previous events  is now approximately 37 times older than the known age of the universe and is barely able to continue  Marvin  with Arthur and Fenchurch s help  reads the Message   We apologise for the inconvenience    smiles  utters the final words  I think    I feel good about it   and dies happily Mostly HarmlessAfter the events in So Long  and Thanks for All the Fish  Arthur Dent and his love interest Fenchurch attempt to sightsee across the Galaxy  but when Fenchurch disappears during a hyperspace jump due to being from an unstable sector of the Galaxy  Arthur becomes depressed and travels the Galaxy alone  raising money to pay his passage by donating his biological material to DNA banks  Mostly sperm  due to it having the highest payout   He is aware that he cannot die until he visits Stavromula Beta  as was revealed in Life  the Universe and Everything  by the insane Agrajag  During one journey  his ship crash lands on the planet Lamuella  Arthur survives and finds a simple life  becoming the sandwich maker for the local population Meanwhile  Ford Prefect has returned to the offices of the Hitchhikers  Guide  and is annoyed to find out the original publishing company  Megadodo Publications  has been taken over by InfiniDim Enterprises  Ford discovers that Vogons are part of the Guide s employ  and attempts to escape the building  During this attempt  he finds the Hitchhiker s Guide Mk  II  which he steals and sends to Arthur for safekeeping  Arthur  as Ford had expected  stores the package away without even opening it and forgets about it One day  Trillian arrives on Lamuella  and presents Arthur with Random Dent  a teenage girl she claims is his daughter  conceived by Trillian via artificial insemination using the only human sperm samples available  those given by Arthur to pay for his space travels  Trillian leaves Random with Arthur so that she can better pursue her new career as    damn  no space  Review to come    I  personally  am in a constant search for intriguing books  and the Hitchhiker s Guide Series was truly one of the most enjoyable and addictive I have ever read  Douglas Adams does an incredible job of combining off the wall science ficton with an amazing sense of humor  I recommend this book to anybody and everybody I come in contact with  The Hitchhiker s Guide series begins with an amazing twist  The main character  Arthur  comes in contact with an old friend of his  Ford Prefect  really an alien form the vicinity of Betelgeuse  who hitchhikes him off the planet right before a race of Vogons   cruel aliens who write bad poetry  blows up the earth to build an

Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  The funniest SF novel of all timeOriginally posted at Fantasy LiteratureI can t think of any other SF book which is this incredibly funny  in that droll British way that Americans can never emulate  In 5th grade I first read The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy and three of its sequels  but it s this book that stays most in memory  I ve always wanted to revisit Douglas Adams  story  even though I was a bit worried it might not be quite as brilliant as I remembered  but I can report that the audiobook narrated by English comedian and actor Stephen Fry is the perfect comic voice to capture the spirit of the book  Since the audiobook clocks in at just under six hours  I decided it would be a good companion for a day hike in the mountains an hour from Tokyo  Hopefully none of the other hikers were disturbed by the strange tall gaijin chuckling to himself on the trail The story  as most of us know  though perhaps some younger readers won t  begins with everyman Arthur Dent waking up one morning to discover a huge yellow bulldozer parked on his lawn  preparing to demolish his house to make way for a bypass  The local bureaucrat  Mr  Prosser  explains that the plans were on display at the local government office  but down in the basement  with the lights and stairs missing  in a locked filing cabinet in a bathroom with a sign on the door saying  Beware of the Leopard  Arthur Dent s best friend is Ford Prefect  who turns out to be a galaxy hopping humanoid alien who has been stranded on Earth for the last 15 years  Ford takes Arthur to the local pub and informs him that the Earth is about to be destroyed in a few minutes because it is scheduled for demolition to make way for a galactic bypass through local space  And of course this information has been posted for years in the local planning office in Alpha Centauri  Ford is a researcher for the Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  an electronic book that compiles the wisdom of the galaxy and is actually more popular than the Encyclopedia Galactica  Think of it as an early conceptual version of Wikipedia Ford manages to get Arthur and himself picked up on a passing spaceship  but it turns out the ship is piloted by Vogons  perhaps the most vile  obnoxious  and charmless race in the galaxy  Worse yet  they have a perverse love of poetry  which is so dreadful that listeners need to be strapped down to prevent self injury The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy also involves Zaphod Beeblebrox  the Galactic President   his female companion Trillian  Marvin the Paranoid Robot  perhaps the greatest creation in all SF   the Deep Thought supercomputer  and finally the answer to Life  The Universe  and Everything  not what you might expect   There isn t much point in describing further details of the book  which actually started as a BBC radio play in 1978  Suffice to say that the story is filled with more iconic humorous creations than any other book I can think of  including the Pangalactic Gargle Blaster  Vogon poetry  the Babel Fish  the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal  the Heart of Gold starship powered by the Infinite Improbability Drive  etc The book is so fun and creative that I think it would appeal to readers of any age or taste  I have yet to encounter anyone who didn t like it  and it spawned a number of sequels and a Hollywood film version starring Martin Freeman  It ranks in the same category as Monty Python as one of the great achievements of British humor  and hasn t aged much at all I ll leave you with some quotes from Marvin  and an exhortation to immediately go out and read this book and the next three in the series if you haven t  and to revisit them  perhaps by audiobook  pronto if you have  Come on   he droned   I ve been ordered to take you down to the bridge  Here I am  brain the size of a planet and they ask me to take you down to the bridge  Call that job satisfaction   Cos I don t   Sorry  did I say something wrong   said Marvin  dragging himself on regardless   Pardon me for breathing  which I never do anyway so I don t know why I bother to say it  oh God I m so depressed  Here s another one of those self satisfied doors  Life  Don t talk to me about life   I got very bored and depressed  so I went and plugged myself in to its external computer feed  I talked to the computer at great length and explained my view of the Universe to it   said Marvin  And what happened   pressed Ford  It committed suicide   said Marvin   The story  plot  settings  and everything is just    amazing The whole book is a classic  and is just unimaginable  except for him  on how he could come up with such a book with a great plot and setting Can t wait to read the next books soon  I read this book for the first time in the spring of 1993  I have reread it many  many times since  I just love Douglas Adams and am so sad he died  It is embarrassing to admit that it took me until the final book in the series to realize that he was describing a philosophy in his books  I don t agree with that philosophy  but I really do enjoy reading his take on life  the universe and everything  They are fun and easy books with lots of escapist qualities and humor  I would caution that they are all clean except for one bad word and suggestive scene in the 3rd  i think   book inthe series  Delightfully humorous  universally interesting  and a page turner to boot  this british classic tops the list of my favorites for it s sheer cleverness and ability to bring happiness with every chapter passed   42  If you re looking for a Monty Pythonesque humored novel stop your search  You ve found what you ve been looking for  Easily in my top 5 list for an infinite number of reasons  There are enough descriptions on the why  but it s one of those stories that is brilliant that it s entirely possible that ones head could explode just from the sheer level of joy one gets from reading it  If you can follow it  you will love it   LOVED IT  Humor y ciencia ficcion de alguien que parece dominar ambos con elegancia e inteligencia  Como me habia perdido de esta joya  Thought provoking and entertaining  this book provides nothing but answers without questions  Absolutely Bonkers  I loved it Review is also on my blog  https   thedustindreams wordpress com I know  I know  everyone should read this book at some point in their lives  It just happens that I read it in high school  and I wanted to read it more thoroughly so that I could  ya know  actually read the sequel  since I bought  The Restaurant At The End of the Universe  and the next two at a book sale back in September and I hadn t got around to them yet  I have assigned texts  okay  So  Hitchhiker s I wound up borrowing the very gorgeous hardcover version from my friend and rereading it I m not sure whether it s because I ve been so keen to read a ton of other books in my shelf  or whether it s because the last time I read it was in 2011  or because my boyfriend and friends have built it up to such expectations  but   I actually found it a little hard to get through at first Don t get me wrong  Plot was amazing  the hit over the head irony of Arthur protesting his house s demolition when in reality his whole planet is about to be demolished is still something that stays with me   and the world was incredible  The sheer amount of effort that clearly went into creating the Galaxy is incredible  I would kill to be able to create as vivid a world as Douglas Adams did  It s intricate  it s believable  don t look at me and say you think that in the whole universe  there d be only one sort of alien  because you re wrong  and it s just the right amount of whimsy coupled with realism The style of the writing is brilliant  too  It s accessible  it s humorous  it s dry and sardonic   in short  it s very English  While many people probably immediately think English means serious  upper class accents  for me  Douglas Adams  style is what embodies the English I mean  come on   You know   said Arthur   it s at times like this  when I m trapped in a Vogon airlock with a man from Betelgeuse  and about to die of asphyxiation in deep space that I really wish I d listened to what my mother told me when I was young   Why  what did she tell you   I don t know  I didn t listen    That s very English While I adore this style  it can take a little getting used to   especially if you ve been reading a lot of books that don t have the same style  I mean  I was reading The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss  and that s miles away from the style of Hitchhiker s  which is probably why it took me a bit of time to get used to the style  I do wonder  though  how much of that is due to genre  Adams  Hitchhiker s is very much comparable to the TV show Doctor Who  particularly the more recent series  in tone  and indeed  Douglas Adams actually wrote a couple of episodes for Classic era Doctor Who  Both works have the obvious science fiction basis  Both works are very approachable  and easy to understand  okay  unless Moffat s writing   Both works are quintessentially British in reputation  and Doctor Who likes to reference Arthur Dent on occasion   Both works have darker elements  Additionally  I would say that they re arguably targeted at families  While Doctor Who was intended as a children s programme  and has slowly widened its target audience   Hitchhiker s feels as though its target audience is pretty much anyone who can read  While I read it first as a 15 year old  friends of mine have read it much younger  In fact  in doing a bit of research on the subject  plenty of people are introducing their kids to it  one concerned mother asked if it was appropriate for her 10 year old son  and in response  a father informed her that his 8 year old daughter was happily listening to the radio version   Ostensibly  I would say this is partially a product of parents wanting to pass stories down to their children  but I also think that the nature of Hitchhiker s contributes to the comfort people have about letting their children read it The fact is  it s supremely easy to understand what s going on in Hitchhiker s  because we are essentially playing the role of Arthur Dent  Similar to Rose Tyler in  Rose   Arthur Dent is our surrogate  however reluctant he might be  Arthur is how most of us would behave when thrust unwillingly into a new world  well  he s how I would probably behave   It s a clever technique for introducing concepts   which is why we so often see young adult novels utilising it in order to draw the reader in  for example  The Chronicler in The Name of the Wind  Mare Barrow in Red Queen  Kelsea Glynn in The Queen of the Tearling  Ultimately  I d give it five out of five  because its accessibility and tone are enough to enthral absolutely anyone who picks it up  and even if it took me a while to get into it again  I m pretty sure that I probably just had a bad run Food Drink that sums up this book  Tea  Earl Grey tea  Although  I do have to say   the idea of a Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster does appeal   Song I listened to most while reading this book  A Rush of Blood to the Head by Coldplay  It felt right Weather  You know those days when it starts out grey and cloudy  and then slowly  bit by bit  the sun starts peeking through the clouds and you end up with a really lovely afternoon  Then out of nowhere  it starts raining again  And hailing  And then you get sun through the rain  and it s all a bit bizarre  but ultimately pretty cool  That about sums up Hitchhiker s  This is a old book but a wonderlful book  It is about Aurthor Dent and Ford Perfect   he is an alein from a non existing planet There is also Zaphod and Tillian  There is also a depresed robot named Marvin Author is having the wost day ever  The council is going to bulldoze his house  Just as it couldn t get any worse  Ford apperes  ford was his friend when he was on earth to learn about stuff for the hitchhickers guide to the glaxy   Ford told him that the Earht would explode  So they hitched hiked on the Vongo ship  They were discovered and thrown out into the galaxy  They would have survived 30 sec  but the Heart of Gold picked them up  Thats were Zaphod and trillian and marvin come in  They are lookking for The myth planet  I could tell you the hole story but I wont This has lots of funny parts  I LOVED this book  My dad recomended it to me  So sometimes if you are having trouble finding a book ask your parents  Title  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the GalaxyAuthor  Douglas AdamsCopyright date  1979Publisher  PanHow many pages  220 pgsHow long it took me to read  5 daysCategory  FictionI learned about this book from  Seeing

nutshell  One Thursday lunchtime the Earth gets unexpectedly demolished to make way for a new hyperspace bypass  Arthur Dent  who has only just had his house demolished that morning  this seems already to be more than he can cope with Sadly  however  the weekend has only just begun  and the galaxy is a very strange and startling place Main characters  Arthur Dent  Ford Prefect  Trillian  Zaphod Beeblebrox and Marvin the paranoid android What I liked best  Oh my God  What s not to like   This book had me laughing out loud in public What I liked least  Zaphod was kind of annoying   like  Jarjar Binks annoying Overall rating  I had no idea how good this book was  No wonder why everyone was so angry at the movie   it s a completely different story that is very loosely based on the book  I don t think there s anything left to say about this book  Yes  I read it  too   more than once   and yes  I loved it  and yes  I can quote huge parts of it And no  I wasn t in the chess club ETA  Actually  I was in the chess club  Damn  I had forgotten all about it  Now I outed myself as a geek  albeit a really cool  pretty one  makes puppy face to convince people   by making a joke about being able to quote Hitchhiker s Guide  when in fact  quoting Hitchhiker s Guide is probably way less geeky than having been in the chess club  I don t think those two even play in the same league  Total fail on my part  I apologise Now that I m writing this  I m not even sure if being able to quote Douglas Adams makes you a geek at all  Please discuss in comments Thank you  It s been a fairly long time since I first read this book  I remember doing it when I was 15 years younger when I was supposed to be doing my homework instead  I was so engrossed  I read it in one morning   That was harder to do 15 years ago  This is still one of the funniest books I ve ever read   Funny  usually isn t my cup of tea  but occasionally I have to read a funny book or I start driving people crazy The first installment of Adams  epic series about a very crazy galaxy is a classic  It s full of ridiculous amounts of imagination and philosophy and a little something for everyone  Poor Author Dent s home is being demolished  which seems pretty major to the reader of course  until Adams reveals the larger scale of the destruction of Dent s home   the entire Earth The subsequent adventure of Arthur Dent  his alien formerly in disguise friend Ford  and a charming cast of characters is a combination of improbable  coincidences  that ultimately show us the whole purpose of life for humanity as we know it  Or it seemingly does and eventually will  Wish I read this a long time ago  So much pop culture stems out from this book  iPhones  Paranoid Android  theory of improbability  computers with a sense of humor  what hasn t been imitated here  One night listening to the radio  I came across the radio version of this book and was hooked Douglas Adams might be my favorite author of all time and this is the book that got me started It s funny  He has an amazing use of the language  He describes completely bizarre situations and you can almost see human nature following into them There have been two attempts to make a movie from this book  that I remember   Neither were very good in my opinion  which is odd since Adams was a writer for Dr  Who and wrote some of my favorite Dr  Who episodes  While the radio version is very good  I just think Adams characters and situations are just to bizarre for our eyes to accept while the mind can create them from the pure words I think this book is a must read for anyone who like science fiction  You can read it if you don t like science fiction too  it s hilarious  This one is pretty perfect  the laugh out loud kind   So funny  I mean Slartibartfarst is an actual name of a character  This is a wonderfully imaginative story that has all the scientific elements to give the illusion of reality  The depth with which Adams goes is truly amazing and quite extraordinary  Awesome read for all ages and all genre likers  the ease with which this can be read and the humor make this unbelievably good    sequels  The wacky and unpredictable space that is Douglas Adams  head never ceases to amaze me  I have yet to read something he wrote  be it fiction or his accounts on near extinct species of animals  that I wouldn t read or listen to again  He made me laugh out loud so many times he deserves a straight A raiting This book is one of science fiction s greatest achievements  As great as some sci fi books are for their vision and scale   Hitchiker s  is something so very different  Filled with irony on every possible scale  it is impossible not to fall in love with the quirky humour that makes this book a classic of it s genre  If it has one fault  it is that the humour becomes dry by the fifth book of the trilogy  and that is hardly an issue with this book  I would recommend this to anyone  Best comedy I ve ever read  This review was first posted on Northern Plunder  if you want to see more reviews please click here I don t think there are that many people who haven t read this book  and if you haven t read it then I m pretty sure it s on your wishlist  If its not then I am taken back in surprise  The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy is easily one of the funniest books I have ever had the pleasure to read and is the definition of random  I m not sure how to physically explain my love for this book without giving away too much because lets be honest if you have read it then you know full well I literally can t explain the basics of the story line because it s far from basic  This was the second time that I ve read this book and I hope this year I ll get through the full series  I highly recommend this book and I m assuming the rest of the series is just as good  Never seen the movie  and frankly I don t think I want to as it would only take away from the charming and witty way in which this book was written  The British wit and humor is incredibly dry and awesome  Not sure why it s taken me this long to read this book  Definitely one of the best works of fiction I ve read all year   If you like science fiction  this book is a great read  Plenty of intergalactic hardware  inhabitants of other planets and star systems  worm holes  warp speeds and a steady stream of ideas  A brainy funny ride through the universe  A breezy episodic space opera    and this is only the first book    Douglas Adams  book was a massive success and it s easy to see why    fun stuff     Loved this  Can t wait to read the others in the series  Favorite line   He felt that his whole life was some kind of dream and he sometimes wondered whose it was and whether they were enjoying it   Now that was a fun read  Arthur Dent is a regular  middle aged man who isn t excited with life anymore  He wakes up one morning to discover that his house is to be demolished  Arthur s friend  Ford  warns him of Earth s impending doom and they escape on a spaceship  The two buddies proceed to go on an adventure through the universe accompanied by a plethora of colorful characters  Arthur s adventures create satirical insight on the ridiculousness of life PROS  This book is famous for it s satire and dry humor  Douglas Adams  the author of the book  does a wonderful job of presenting the world  better yet  the universe around us with an odd sense of priority  Regular earth issues become minute which leaves the reader to feel a sense of freedom from the real world  The book manages to maintain a wonderful story while never failing to deliver some brilliantly witty comedy  The main character  Arthur  is a totally relatable  middle of the road man who happens to gain the experience of a lifetime  Another strength of the book is its strong metaphoric tone  Men in space created a machine to discover the meaning of life  42  After this disappointing realization they created Earth to compute the actual question  Earth is then destroyed seconds before the computations are complete  This is representative of how man tries to figure out why we are alive as opposed to just living  The insightful views on life featured in this book are a pleasant surprise for a piece revered for it s comedic value CONS  As stated before  this book is renowned for it s lack of a serious tone  This book isn t really suitable for someone who is looking for an intense read  Even for a comedy  it does contain a relatively low level of aesthetic maturity  though it is a rather contextually mature book  It s also a somewhat short read  It is part of a six part series making the book too short for some  while the series is too long for others  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is a brilliant satirical piece with a high level of wit and a low level of sense  The lack of a serious tone may turn some off but it appeals to many others I give The Hitchhiker s Guide to The Galaxy a 5 out of 5 Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is all kinds of fun  You ll find yourself laughing  wondering  and even potentially learning as you follow the wacky antics of Arthur Dent  Ford Prefect  Trillian  and the rest of the gang on their adventures through time and space  P S  If audio books are more your thing  make sure you pick up the versions read by Martin Freeman  It s like listening to a well done radio broadcast  The story follows the misadventures of Arthur Dent  In the beginning  Arthur loses his house and his world in the same day  The Earth is destroyed by a fleet of bureaucratic Vogons  making way for a galactic freeway  Fortunately for him  Arthur is rescued by his alien friend  Ford Prefect  The two of them then fall into a variety of improbable situations  eventually learning the ultimate answer to life  the universe  and everything The writing is very witty  with sharp  clever dialog  and fun  well developed characters  But even more memorable than the book s humor is the prevalent  if not overt  social  political  and religious commentary throughout  It becomes clear Adams has written this novel as a means of showing us ourselves  so as we laugh at the silliness of the plot and characters  the joke is truly on us  In many way this is  my  book  in the sense that it was published just at that right point in my life when I could buy it with my own money  by my own choice  and understand it fully  It was the first title that I can remember filling those criteria  the other major influences on my reading being The Hobbit  which was my mum s copy and The LOTR  which was a gift   I was 10 years old and this was my kind of thing  The brilliant BBC tv adaptation that followed in 1981 cemented my love of the book and I ve tried to read it every few years since I think I know it by heart now  after more than a few re reads and by watching the six episodes of the tv show about a hundred times a piece  but still the jokes make me laugh every time  I think  now that I m getting older  that the comfort value is what draws me back   this book  and series  feels as close to a warm memory of childhood as I m ever likely to achieve My favorite quote now  as then  is  The ships hung in the sky in much the same way that bricks don t     this sentence construction either makes you fall on the floor laughing  in which case this book is for you  or it doesn t  in which case it isn t  Love this book  A quick  quirky  hilarious read  i rate this 42 10 Unconventional and consistently funny  Loved it  I can t believe I waited until now to read this  I ve heard snippets of information about this book  though I had no idea that it was so very much ingrained in Britain s collective mind  The comparison with  Doctor Who  sort of brought it home to me  as did the fact that this story has lived in the form of radio plays  comics  tv series  a film  and  of course  a bath towel  There is a reason for this   the book is bloody brilliant It s hard to explain the exact reason for this  and a proper text analysis review or something of that sort wouldn t do the book any justice  because it is just as ridiculous as the universe itself and so very English that I was constantly smiling while reading it  luckily  it s not particularly long  otherwise my face muscles would have hurt by the end of it   An infinite amount of quotes can be found in there that would last me for a lifetime  and I was laughing out loud so often and trying to translate the best quotes so regularly that my family became quite annoyed with me  The dialogues  monologues and polilogues are witty  and the characters are fascinatingly stupid and clever at the same time  my personal favourite is the robot equivalent of Eeyore  Marvin   but whatever I say could not express the ridiculousness of the whole book  so I m just going to finish with a quote  What  are you crazy  It s a possibility I haven t ruled out yet Side note  My electronic copy happened to have 30  percent of  after word  on the development of the film  which included general information  interviews and many other bits of stuff  While I love films and certainly would be interested in reading those interviews after I ve seen the film  I see absolutely no sense in putting all that information after the actual book  If you don t want the book being compared to the film  and most producers directors writers don t  and those who do want that  in my opinion  are not in their right mind   then stop linking them together    Basterebbe programmarlo a dire  Cosa   e  Non capisco  e  Dov e il te    Chi mai potrebbe notare la differenza      Cosa    Avete presente quando desiderate immensamente  ma proprio immensamente  di avere il cervello di qualcuno  Di barattare il vostro   con l aggiunta di tutti i vostri averi   per avere quel cervello Beh  io vorrei il cervello di Douglas Adams  O  perlomeno  quello che aveva quando ha scritto questa saga  I topi  invece  vorrebbero il cervello di Arthur Dent    Ma questa e tutta un altra storia  Stiamo parlando di un libro dentro un libro  c e Arthur Dent  un umano  e c e il suo migliore amico  Ford  un alieno che proviene da una stella vicina a Betelgeuse  Fortunatamente  quando l inimmaginabile   non cosi tanto  poi  se foste stati cosi attenti da andare fino ad Alpha Centauri   accade 5 minuti prima di quando sarebbe stato accettabile che accadesse  Ford ha con se la Guida Galattica per gli autostoppisti  Guida Galattica che a me ricorda un po  gli ebook   Ho convinto mia nonna a comprare questo libro e lei  dopo qualche pagina  me l ha dato dicendo che a lei non faceva assolutamente ridere  Io l ho ripreso in mano ed iniziato a leggerlo  e per tutte quelle duecento pagine non ho mai smesso di ridacchiare  Intendiamoci  mia nonna legge qualunque cosa le capiti a tiro  non e una novellina  Il problema e che ora guardo questo libretto  ma vogliamo parlare della pessima stampa     e saprei gia a chi consigliarlo  quali persone lo troverebbero divertente e quali lo considererebbero come un libro che tenta di essere divertente  Ci sono le persone che sanno raccontare barzellette e persone che non le sanno raccontare  Eppure  quando anche le persone che le sanno raccontare finiscono di raccontarne una  ci sono sempre quelle persone che dicono  Non l ho capita   quelle che dicono  L ho capita  ma non mi ha fatto ridere  e quelle che non dicono nulla perche sono impegnate a prendere fiato tra una risata e l altra  Allo stesso modo puo succedere con la Guida galattica per gli autostoppisti  Ma non potete non darle una chance  insomma  come potete sapere se vi piacera o meno  Poi  oltre a farvi sganasciare dalle risate  la Guida da anche utilissime informazioni  innanzitutto  sempre portarsi dietro un asciugamano  Inoltre  Bob Dylan trova anche un ottima risposta alla sua domanda  il che non e da sottovalutare  I loved it so so much  I know I don t have to say anything about it because this book is a classic of its genre  It was so original and unique at least for me because I hadn t read anything like that before  It is the most funny and clever book I have ever read  Definetely will continue with these series as soon as I have the second book in my hands  I ll admit it  this isn t the first time I ve read this book  But I do love it  And despite its discrepancies  I love the new movie version as well  However  I have not read the entire series  and it s high time that problem was solved  This requires starting at the beginning to reacquaint myself with the plot and also just because I really enjoy reading it  Nowhere can you find such random humor and plot twists  I mean really    This is my favorite book ever  I loved it from the first line  I have handed this book to so many people and I still have the rattered tattered copy of it from my very first read  I have read this book more times than any other book I own   What is the question we are all trying to find out  No  it s not what s for dinner  it is the Ultimate Question to Life  the Universe  and Everything  Douglas Adams sends readers on the ride of their lives following the crew of the Heart of Gold  Arthur  a normal human  Zaphod Beeblebrox  the president of the galaxy  Ford Prefect  a researcher for the Guide  Trillian  Zaphod s human girlfriend  and Marvin  the chronically depressed robot  Using humor at almost every turn  Adams creates a space age setting with very well developed characters  The first book in the series answers some questions  but leaves the reader with more than they had going in  Overall  the book has many humorous elements to it  while keeping the story moving  I would recommend it to any science fiction fan who enjoys a good laugh  capolavoro Ecco il solo e sintetico giudizio che io do ad un romanzo che piu rileggo e piu mi piace senza mezzi termini Le avventure di Arthur Dent e Ford Prefect ti coinvolgono ti trascinano in in universo a volte assurdo ma che sotto sotto rivela una arguta ed intelligente critica al nostro mondo modo di vedere alla nostra filosofia religione Ma io non sono bravo a scrivere recensioni quindi vi do un consiglio andate alla piu vicina libreria e compratelo subito  Amazing book  I wanted to read it for so long and now that I finally did  the wait was worth it  I only wish I hadn t watched the movie before because it kind of diminished the experience The story is amazing  the prose are excellent  humorous and witty and the characters are loveable  This book is funny as well as philosophical  I don t know if it can be called a satire but it makes you think a lot about life  Universe and everything Can t wait to read the next one in the series  After rereading this for like the fourth time  I have to say that this book never disappoints  I still find it hilarious and incredibly entertaining  Absolutely brilliant  If there was ever a book that defines comedic science fiction  this is it  Based on his own radio scripts  which are also available to read  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is the first of six books that tell the story of Arthur Dent  a mild mannered  somewhat helpless Earthling who gets swept up into a space adventure with his best friend Ford  who happens to be an alien  when the Earth is unceremoniously destroyed  Adams keeps the pace brisk in this short novel  introducing a variety of wacky characters as Arthur and Ford hitchhike across the galaxy  Although the science fiction is much more fiction than science  the dialogue is crisp  and the laugh out loud moments are frequent  And  while the rest of the series never captures the brilliance of this first book  you ll be eager to find out what happens to Arthur s motley crew   if only to discover why all your friends think the number 42 is so hysterical    Mr  Silk  Harker teacher Proof that the  Befuddled Englishmen  archetype is always delightfully charming  even in space  Favorite Quote  I always think that the chances of finding out what really is going on are so absurdly remote that the only thing to do is to say hang the sense of it and just keep yourself occupied  How have I not read this book before   This is an absolutely hilarious story  with the perfect combination of wacky  insane humour mixed with very dry and deadpan jokes  It is so well written that it had me bursting out laughing on many occasions  Even when you spot a joke coming  the delivery on the page just makes it priceless Arthur Dent is a fantastic protagonist  A careless  lazy English man  it was perfect to experience the insanity of space through his eyes  Learning the  big answer  to life  the universe and everything was amazing  Experiencing the Vogons  visiting Magrathea  and everything in between made for such a fun ride  The characters were unbelievable  from Zaphod Beeblebrox  to Marvin the  paranoid android   and of course Ford Prefect  These are all hilarious personalities  whose ridiculous outlooks on life and the universe made them so fun to follow I am so pumped that I ve read this book and can t wait to get into the rest of the  trilogy   I think this is the best book I ve read this year  I will be rereading it over and over again for years to come  I feel so STUPID for not having read this earlier  I bought the ultimate guide something like 8 years ago and just   let it sit I really loved this book  Really really  Every sentence was funny  Every word was funny  I started thinking it would be a good gauge of determining who to be friends with  You like it  We re friends  You hate it  I hate you But then I realized my mom s husband likes this book and he is one of the sleaziest  worst human beings I ve ever met  and that theory went out the window Still  it is a very good book  2 very enthusiastic thumbs way  way up    Travis Birkenstock  The Hitchiker s Guide to the Galaxy is a humorous  sometimes nonsensical story revolving around a human named Arthur Dent  The book begins with the Earth s destruction  Arthur barely escaping in time  thanks to a longtime friend of his named Ford Prefect  Ford was actually an alien from a far off planet in a far off galaxy  hitch hiking his way across the universe  Why  Because he was contributing to one of the most famous novels in the galaxy  The Hitchiker s Guide to the Galaxy  Arthur joins Ford as they go on the  galactic  road  encountering lethal poetry  depressed robots  and a roomful of monkeys with a typewriter As far as critique goes  I have mostly good things to say about it  It was a very pleasant read  as the vernacular was easily understood and not particularly advanced  Douglas Adams is very inventive  and he has some really out there concepts ideas in The Hitchhiker s Guide  THG   The only cool feedback I have is the fact that the book is obviously part of a series  The ending feels as if it s just another page in the middle of a story  and gives the novel a very open ended feel Overall  I would definetly recommend it  It s a humorous novel with some good wit  and anybody who can get past the nonsensical talk encountered in the book will likely enjoy it  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams is a sci fi comedy book that follows Arthur Dent throughout his adventures across the galaxy  along with other characters like an alien with two heads and a depressed robot named Marvin  The story is good  however the ending feels rushed  But other than that  there are no major plot holes or anything else that ruins the story The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is written in third person  It is a great sci fi book  but it also is very funny  I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys sci fi or comedy books  Even if you dislike sci fi  you will enjoy this book because of how funny it is  I rate this a 5 5  because this is an amazing book  and there was only one flaw  Hilarious  Interesting  Wacky  Weird  Wibbly Wobbly Timey Wimey nonsense of awesomeness  If you re a fan of Dr  Who  you will love this  Be sure to listen to the audiobook version with the British accent   Here s where it all started  The radio play  followed by the BBC television series  followed eventually by the book  None of them are really consistent  although the basic players and the outline of the plot stays the same  The hapless Arthur Dent  swept from his home and his planet in a bathrobe continues to provide bemused and somewhat outraged commentary on the unfairness of the galaxy in general  and his life in particular  There are many particularly choice English turns of phrase   it floated in the air  exactly like a brick doesn t  for example  that bear repeating  Highly recommended   To enjoy the late Douglas Adams  one must have an appreciation for droll British style humor  It is full of both subtle word play and outrageous characters and situations  If you can suspend your disbelief of disbelief  it s a good read  While funny on the surface  it does delve into interesting thoughts about how people think and react using extreme situations and characters  It is one of the most imaginative science fiction books around  Audiobook read by Stephen FryWhen I was in elementary school  this book was recommended to me by my Sunday School teacher at church  Because of that  it has been on my radar for years  I ve always been interested in checking it out  and finally decided to pull the trigger Sometimes I really appreciate English humor  and sometimes I don t get it at all  In the case of this book  I thought it was hilarious  Non stop laugh out loud moments  Concerning my personal reading habits  I had the realization that while I enjoy comedic films and television shows  I haven t purposely sought out comedic books  I have read books that have funny parts  but not books that are comedies  This book is definitely a comedy  I loved it  At one point towards the end of the book  as I was laughing at something that was happening  I thought to myself   This book gets me   Douglas Adams gets me  His humor is extremely in line with my own humor  People don t always find me funny in America  but maybe I d be hilarious in England   Great and entertaining read  Funny and thoughtful   This book was so much fun  It actually a really special book to literally make me laugh out loud and this book managed to do just that   multiple times  The book was full of outrageous circumstances being treated as if this could happen to the average person on a bad day  which added to the hilarity of the situation Basically  the story begins with Arthur Dent  an average man just wanting to live his life in peace  finding out that his house needed to be demolished in order to put in a bypass  As he fights to keep his house  he believes that his day can t get much worse until his friend  Ford Prefect  comes along and convinces him to leave the site  Ford then explains  in a pub  that the world is about to be destroyed  as it is in the path of a new hyperspace bypass  and from then on  Dent s life becomes a science fiction tale The greatest part of this book what how everything paralleled  Den ts house is destroyed for a bypass in which Dent was not properly made aware of due to poor government planning  Later  the world is destroyed for the same exact reason and the galactic government gives the same reasons for their actions as the Earth government gave about Dent s house  The poor man can t seem to escape badly run government planning This book is the definition of schadenfreude  a German word for getting pleasure from someone else s pain   Poor Dent looses his house and becomes the last human in existence all in the same hour but yet we laugh If you re looking for a laugh riot of a book  this is definitely it  It is extremely quotable and on top of all this you get to learn the answer to the Ultimate Question of Life  the Universe and Everything  Loved every minute of this book  It had been on my  to read  list for quite a while  Wildly creative  extremely funny  yet also thought provoking  I had to put it down a few times because I was laughing too hard while reading it on a plane  For some readers it may be too disjointed and bizarre  but I would highly recommend it to anybody who loves a good dose of humor mixed in with some great Sci Fi   Wanna have some fun   Wanna go for a ride all over the universe    Wanna step into a world of chaos where the spin of the spaceship is nothing compared to the spin you are getting into  Then this is it     Phewwwww  Best Freakinn book ever  and yes Dont Panic   This is truly one of the funniest books I ve read  Its interesting sci fi setting  it s hilarious jokes  well developed characters and absurd plotline make it a very memorable and original book  None of the jokes ever failed to make me laugh  and every single character is memorable  even the construction worker in the first few chapters  who happened to be related to Genghis Khan   This is a book I would recommend any fan of science fiction to read  Let me start out by saying that I found this book mind bendingly hilarious  There are those who will disagree  some who found it silly  pointless  or even unreadable and all I can think of is that they just didn t get it   Just check out some of the reviews on Amazon   Of course as with music  art  and food  not every book will appeal to everyone  This one appealed to me though and this is why I think it ranks as a notable work of speculative fiction  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy forces readers to see the world from a different perspective and it drags them to this new vantage point laughing all the way if they allow it to  if they can suspend their disbelief long enough to let it  It begins with Arthur Dent doing the mundane things all of us do in our mundane world  shaving  brushing his teeth  and then he suddenly realizes that his house is about to be knocked down to build a bypass  Shift perspective  His normal routine is disrupted by a new  bigger picture  He is trying to stop the bulldozers when his friend Ford Prefect shows up  He has something important to say to him and he wants to say it at the local pub  The Earth is going to be destroyed to make way for a hyperspace bypass  Shift perspective again  His world has gone from being  well  the whole world to a minor nuisance so much so that the only reference to Earth in the Encyclopedia Galactica is that it is  mostly harmless   And then as the book progresses it continues to challenge some very fundamental assumptions  Is the universe really as orderly and logical as we assume it to be or are do the laws of nature we understand amount to just one of an infinite number of possibilities  What really is the meaning of life  the universe  and everything  and does the question really make any sense  But whatever infinitely improbable circumstance you may find yourself in  the Hitchhiker s Guide provides one bit of sagely advice  DON T PANIC   I was a little skeptical at first  picking this up  I was drawn to it in the charity shop  and never having really heard anything about it before  I wondered if it was just going to be something that would sit around for years  waiting to be read  But it wasn t  After finishing The Help  I felt I needed something entirely different from it afterwards  not knocking The Help  I love it   and this seemed just about right for something in completely the opposite direction And Blimey   I loved it     I love being surprised by books  I admit to reading all the interviews in the back  as mine is the film tie in edition  and those were cool to  I also watched the film the same day as finishing the book   I now also understand some of the things my statistics teacher used to say  This book isn t one of my normal type of choices for reading material    but I m glad I did   recommending to me by my bf   he did good it had me cracking g up the whole time    It s true what they say    You pick up  The Hitchhiker s Guide To The Galaxy  and either chuck it away when your head starts to whirl OR you totally appreciate the head whirling sensation  plunge right in and don t surface till you have reached the Restaurant at the End of The Universe It is with great delight and spots before my eyes that I can proclaim that I belong to the latter breed  You need a wee bit of whimsy  a lot of quirky and a love for all things whacky  all three which I possess in abundance  to appreciate the magnificence of this space odyssey The plot is fairly simple  Seconds before planet Earth is completely demolished to make way for a galactic bypass  bemused Englishman Arthur Dent is whisked away to safety by his friend  Ford Prefect  Ford is not an out of work actor as he has led everyone to believe  He is in fact  the resident of a small planet in the vicinity of Betelgeuse and a researcher for the revised edition of  The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy   Together  the bursting with enthusiasm Ford and the bursting with disbelief Arthur get set to cruise around the galaxy  Adding to the comedy of errors are Zaphod Beeblebrox  the two headed  three armed galactican president  Trillian  a lady who by some bizarre coincidence had once given Arthur the ditch at an earth party and Marvin  the oppressively depressed robot who could drive even a spaceship to suicide  Along the way  they have many a hit and fly situation with various warped creatures who inhabit the universe   they listen to some truly terrible poetry   they land on the legendary planet  Magrathea   and even learn about the super intelligent computer  DEEP THOUGHT  and it s mission to answer the question to Life  The Universe and everything  All this while trying to find a decent cup of tea   Douglas Adams was the king of one liners and whip smart dialogue  He took human flaws  failings and reams of red tape and converted it into a seriously funny tale  Many argue that the written work is just a reflection of Adams thoughts   well hell  which book isn t   I have hemmed and hawed over the years wondering whether I should pick up the book or not   always inhaling it in bits and pieces  All I can say to the still wary is this  grab the spaceship by it s tail lights and get geared for a mad trip of a lifetime  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is random  so random  You might drop it if you re not patient enough  It starts with the Earth being destroyed to make way for a hyper spatial expressway  The main character  Arthur Dent  and his friend  Ford Prefect  escape annihilation by hitchhiking their way on board one of the Vogon ships that were in the process demolishing the Earth  and so much more  It is preposterous  ridiculous  and just so   unreal  If you want to just not have to think too seriously about anything and just want to escape for awhile   take a chance on this and find yourself somewhere else  It s a mix of nerdy cleverness and a little intrigue on every chapter  A funny read for sure  Just finishing the book for a second time after over a decade away  It is still brilliant and hilarious  The funniest book I have ever read  I can recite the first page of the book The book is absurd  random  and brilliantly crafted  The movie is awful  Do not even bother  Remember to keep your towel with you at all times and Don t Panic If you do not laugh quickly  drop the book and try it again several months years later  Or work in a group  Do not ruin the experience by taking it on too early  What can I say  Fascinating book  It has the best of the Science Fiction but with the just quantity of humour  I ve enjoyed very much reading it and I wouldn t discard reading it again before the end of the year as It s a book easy to read It also leaves probably some of the best quotes of the SF  and also finally I can now understand the famous Towel Day I really recommend this book even if you re not a SF lover  A book full of intergalactic hilarity and ridiculousnessnessnessness perfect in anyone who wants to know almost all of the most well known quotes in the world  I ve loved this book ever since I was a teenager  Like Tolkien  every time you come back to it there s a joke you just weren t old enough or experienced enough to understand the first time  This book is simply a must read for any egghead or sci fi culturist as almost everything that has followed references or steals from it in some way or another   I felt the two best lines were  The function of the President is to divert your attention from where the real power lies   And his description of the three levels of diplomacy  retaliatory  preemptive and insanity  I ve been putting off reading the Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy trilogy by Douglas Adams for quite a while now  I can only justify my procrastination by saying that I had no idea what I was missing out on  From what I could gather readers either fall in love with these books or toss them in the back of their closets  I happen to fall in the first category  Adams was a witty writer with a great sense of humour that really came through in his work  The series is bizarre  satirical  funny  imaginative and a great read overall  It s an excellent blend of comedy and sci fi and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in these genres and also to anyone who d like a good laugh  A story told with all the right amounts of dark humour  dry wit and Sci fi content that will make any geek squeal with excitement  Through the variety of ridiculous characters and unique locations in Outer Space  Adams weaves a tale that is both charmingly absurd and bitterly ironic Adams is the sort of chap who believes that life is too short to be taken seriously  and HHGG is the ultimate embodiment of that philosophy  full of bizarre twists and weird commentaries that will delight anyone who enjoys the hilarious  charming  sometimes depressing wit of British humour  Of course this one is a re read  but it was so very long ago that I d forgotten large pieces of this very small book What a fun book It certainly is timely to reread with the movie being made and all  But it s not the kind of book that you really want to spend a lot of time talking about afterwards  It seems to me that the delight of the book lies in the individual experience of reading it and  getting  the jokes  allusions  parallelisms  and just plain outrageousness of it  This is an excellent  what if   kind of book in that it gets you thinking about the most improbable things  But what is interesting about that process is the way they are presented  It gets you thinking that there s no reason why the universe doesn t act in such a wacky way  and that in turn gets you questioning why it is that the universe acts the way that it indeed does  including asking why humans act the way they do   always a good thing to question  But even this bit of philosophical musing is too heavy for this book  If White Teeth is like eating vegetables   good for you but hard to enjoy  not my words  I loved it    then The Hitchhiker s Guide is like a favorite comfort food that you pull out when you re feeling low  This was my first audiobook ever and certainly not the last  Stephen Fry does a really good job  A Reader s Guide to The Hitchhiker s Guide to the GalaxyStep One  Don t PanicWithin the first 30 or so pages of this book  the planet will be blown to smithereens and you  gentle reader  will be hurtling through space alongside the zaniest group of characters this side of Alpha Centauri  The plot is not exactly fueled by logic and reason so it can be a bit disconcerting for newcomers  The important thing is to relax and enjoy the ride  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy isn t beloved for its intricate plotting anyway  but for its constant  nonstop hilarity  So take a tip from the most remarkable book ever to come out of the great publishing corporations of Ursa Minor and remain calm if you find yourself wondering just what the hell is going on at any given time  Step Two  Prepare Yourself to Learn the Ultimate Answer to Life  the Universe  and EverythingThis book provides the ultimate answer to life  the universe  and everything which is pretty great  Note that you may not love this answer but what can you do Step Three  Don t Forget Your TowelIf you find this book as funny as I do  you ll need this to mop up the tears of laughter that will be streaming down your face  Comedy is more subjective than drama  and I begrudgingly accept that not everyone will love this book  I myself have been head over heels for it since I was a kid and decided to write this review mostly as an excuse to read it again  I think Adams  writing style is hysterical and my only complaint with this book is its brevity  This is one of my all time favorites and gets a big fat 6 stars from me Reread in January  2004 and April  2012  Fantastic  It s true that in the comedy freeze enduced by monty python at the time  Douglas Adams was a visionary in comedic science fiction  I can t say enough good things about the book  The comedic value is fresh and we ll integrated into a mainly science fiction storyline  The science fiction elements itself have actually been given good care  and thus neither the comedic or the sci fi really takes over  There is a balance between them that seems impossible constructed  Yet it works What Adams did for the genre ranks him as one of the best in his field  I haven t had a chance to complete the series but in regards to the first installment  this book  I am very impressed  Blown away  Highly recommend  Always fun for a laugh   or more accurately  a lot of laughs  in a short space of time  Occasionally it almost feels a little dated  or possibly tame  and then you realise that that s probably because it was the first of a style of writing that is amazingly pervasive these days  at least if you read the sort of things that I read   They all  i think  owe themselves to this book  This has been one of those books that I ve been told  demanded  threatened  chastised  and tongue lashed for never having read  I remedied my error and I admit that I was in error for having not read this book sooner  There are no excuses for why this wasn t read  consumed  bathed in  or experienced sooner  I am a deficient human being and that is all Now that the hyperbole is out of the way it s time to be honest about the measure and quality of the book  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy deserves its place as one of the most perfect pieces of literature I ve ever read  I don t say that to pander to anyone but as an honest appraisal of the humor  the depth  and the quality that are inherent in Adams s writing  The first 30 pages of the book have enough material in them to teach at least 4 different types of language in a classroom  a thing which also merits the high praise that I give to this book  It s teachable  as all books are teachable in some fashion but this one requires little stretching of the imagination to make it work   I can t continue my review without praising too much or turning this into one  long graphic metaphor  I d rather this remain simple and say it should be read If you don t enjoy  well  personal opinions aside  there is something deficient within you as a human being  Absolutely one of the best books I have ever read  Read it for the first time when I was like 12 or 13  I have no idea how many times I ve read it since   zillions  Zany  fun  lots of dry humor  Add in the world ending  Vogon poetry and the Restaurant at the End of the Universe  and you have one hell of a book  A must read  Endlich habe ich es geschafft  dieses herrliche Buch nach vielen Jahren erneut zu lesen  Dieses Mal hatte ich sogar noch einiges viel mehr an Spass daran als Kind  weil ich erst jetzt die vielen Wortwitze richtig verstehen konnte Eine tolle Komposition aus urkomischen Situationen  abwegigen Gedankengangen und einer Handlung  die so unwahrscheinlich ist  dass es zum Denken anregt   uber das Leben  das Universum und den ganzen Rest     This book defies description  it s just that weird  But it makes me laugh out loud  it s one of those books I read every once in a while because it s just so silly   do read the whole series   dont try to think and enter this wonderfl wacky world  Fantastic  Possibly my favorite book of all time  Finally read this  And it was very rewarding  a witty well written book  I understand why it s a cult classic   Hilarious book  My favorite part was the talking cow who was asking how he should be eaten   This might be my absolute favorite sci fi book of all time  I found myself laughing at it out loud and really appreciating the intentional cliche of it all  It is a book that doesn t take itself too seriously but instead is a sort of parody of the entire sci fi genre  With talk of improbability  the intelligence of creatures  why we are all here  and what we should eat next  this is the ultimate book for nerds and sci fi lovers alike  I highly recommend it even if you don t usually enjoy sci fi  I remember soaking in the sunlight next to my best friend  Katie  at a local park  It was the perfect summer  everything fresh and green  As I melted into Summer s warmth  Katie burst into a thunderous  Boom Clap   gut busting    rip roaring laugh  She was reading a strange book titled  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy Thanks to her influence   whenever someone makes me mad  I picture them turning into a flower pot and other oddities   This book  and its Sequel  The Restaurant at the End of the Universe  are ultimately a story about how ludicrous we tiny little creatures actually are  How we fill our lives with bullshit trivialities that are nobody else s business  with institutions and bureaucracies  and how the pattern repeats in micro and macro scale  How ultimately  people really are very silly  that we search for meaning in an existence where there probably is none beyond being  you know  nice to each other  that we re always looking for the  will be  and never savoring the  now   How everyone needs to just fucking take it easy But most importantly  this book is funny  Laugh out loud funny  And it probably contains the greatest narrative device I ve ever read to pass exposition along to the reader  Shall we have paragraphs of info dump  Shall we have long and tedious conversations amongst each other to explain to the reader what s going on  No  let s build ourselves a n00b named Arthur  and hand him a tiny electronic book that will not only explain everything the reader needs to know  but make them giggle like five years olds to boot Mr Adams  sir  you are missed  Maybe I m being generous with the 5 star review  but I read this as a young geek and I can t help but be sentimental  The funny comes at you in rapid fire  The story gets hijacked by so many random acts and larger than life characters that the reader feels helpless against the resulting side splitting  out loud laughter I still haven t seen the movie though    This book is completely ridiculous and that s what makes it great  Prepare to annoy others with snickering as Douglas Adams blasts you with subtle  and not so subtle  humor  I don t think I ve ever read a book that s made me think this much  not that it s a bad thing  This is one classic everyone should read  On my  top five novels  shelf Hilarious and unexpected journey  Almost every line is a joke  but in a good way  The book was shorter than I expected  but I feel like rereading it already  That undefinable feeling when the writing is just way too much relatable with your state of mind     __   Gate book to Adams addiction  Epic Douglas Adams s prose style used in  The Hitchhiker s Guide  creates a great flowing style for his narrator  A lot of information about the universe created within this series is constantly being thrown at the reader  and the voice of the narrator sets the comedic tone needed to allow the reader to soak it all in  Also  in comedy timing is everything  and with this style a good rhythm is found and this allows for the punchlines to hit perfectly while keeping up the frantic pacing of the novel  Odd  Nah  Weird  not even close  Surreal  that s an understatement  Completely  censored up beyond all recognition  well  that s pushing it slightly but CLOSE ENOUGH This book is beyond strange  beyond weird  snd yet    it is pretty cool  i m    not sure how much more i can say that hasn t been said a thousand times  I love this book  I read it in German a long time ago and reading it again in English was great  I did remeber that  The Hitchhiker s Guide  is a great book  but I didn t remember how great it is  This annotated version is great for people whose mothertongue is not English and it provides useful and interesting background information  His futuristic fiction is wonderful  Truly groundbreaking and entertaining  He invented characters that are unforgettable like Arthur Dent on Earth and Slartibartfast from who knows where  an irritable immortal robot  several pretty girls  and many others  and wove them into stories that evoked everyday life in galaxies full of absurdities  including this one  His nonfiction   like Last Chance to See on disappearing species   was good too  I was so sad to hear he d died  I was wondering at the time when his next book would come out      A classic   what I truly love about this book is the complete imagination of it all  There is so much that is completely fabricated from the mind fo the author  Fabulous imagination  I have read this before and will most probably read it many more times in my life  It is a great story to read when you are looking for nonsense that makes sense  This is probably the funniest thing I have ever read or listened to  In fact  it may very well rank among the top 10 funniest entertainment experiences of my life  The absurd humor may not be for everyone  but if you relish a bit of absurdity  in the words of the great Zohan  it doesn t get any better than this   In honor of Towel Day  celebrated annually on the 25th of May  I thought I would write a review of this glorious piece of science fiction  which can be summarized  firstly as this  DON T PANIC  JUST READ THIS BOOK  Have said that  some details  Quirky  perfect  odd  perfect  and hilariously critical of the entirety of the world  Hitchhiker s Guide is probably the best piece of humorous science fiction any earth author has ever produced  Our scale of comparison is sadly limited to the earth  or I would dare to claim that it was at least the best in the solar system   but I ll wait until we find out if martian bacteria or life forms in the freezing seas of outer planetary moons beat Mr  Adams to the punch   I still doubt it   The adventures of Arthur Dent are the adventures of Everyman in Space  and they re amazing just for that reason  The universe is improbable and impossible to understand just when seen from Earth  after all  In the wider universe  a space about which we know nothing  any single might be doomed to be Arthur  Of course  I might be a little more proactive about my intrepid adventures through space  time  and other forms of improbability  but Arthur s accidental destiny is most of the fun  I love it when I m surprised by a story  I thought this book was a lot more serious  but found the Monty Python Princess Bride type humor HILARIOUS  I enjoyed it so much i bought the 5 book set not only for me to read  but also so I can pass it down to my sons in a couple of years  I have read a great many classic books  and there are very few that have managed to make me laugh the way that this book has  The characters are entirely lovable and well developed  The style is quirky  but the book is a lot of fun and an amazing story of a man  an alien  and the importance of carrying a towel  This book has a rare quality of a book in a series  it can stand alone   Fantastic piece of sci fy  It was great having seen the movie first  which was almost an exact parallel   as it played in my head while reading    making the book come alive even more  This book is amazing  The book is so out there you just have to find the right person to read this  am so sad that there are only 7 of the hitchhikers guide books in the trilogy  I really love the fact it has everything anyone could want in it  It has robots  guys with two heads  party s  and best of all you are just as lost in the galaxy as the main character Arthur Dent  This has to be the best syfy book i have read  The only bad thing in the book is the fact Earth blows up  but only in one demention and it s really easy to go between reality s   The answer to life  the universe  and everything  Everything about this book was fantastic   SPOILERS   except for the very end  I seriously thought I missed something   What  Was that seriously the ending  I know the storyline was never as important as the way it was written   which was fantastic   but it was just too abrupt for me  I loved the characters  names  their stories  the observations  and everything else  I kept waiting for there to be a little more umph to everything  but I guess that wasn t the point  What happened with Zaphod s brain  Why was there a character mentioned on the back cover who only showed up for one page in the book  Do they end up recreating the earth  Why was so much missing   Still 5 stars for the sheer Britishness of everything   Divertente  allucinante  geniale  un libro che ti prende dalla prima all ultima parola  Un avventura fantastica con dei personaggi incredibili  Consogliatissimo a tutti    While I read this book my boyfriend would often comment on my glowing smiles and my frequent laughter  This book was damn funny and had me entertained to the very last word   I can t believe it took me so long to read this  My parents love love loved these books and I swear to God would tell me about the importance of towels and answer my questions by saying  42  for as long as I can remember  Then my husband got into every film   radio version of it ever created and then I saw the Big Hollywood Version of it and really really liked it  Like TWO YEARS LATER I finally read the whole series and thought it was hilarious and awesome  I think this one is my favorite  This book is about a kid named Arthur Dent who travels with his friend Ford Prefect the writer of Hitchhiker s guide to the galaxy going on many quests to write the new edition of Hitchhiker s guide to the galaxy  The go on many adventure and having fun with each other  I really liked this book because of its funniness and its great story line  I gave it five stars because how great funny the book is such as how you need these words to translate certain languages and how you need to destroy Earth for a highway  I would recommend this book for anyone who wants to get a laugh or wants to read about future space travel  Hadn t read it since middle school  I remember being introduced to it by Jarrett Holmes in Mr  Casey s reading lab that would later become Mrs  Forgeron s health room  Oh yeah  it s really funny  Absurdism to a lovely extreme  deconstructing its way back to the same limited perspectives and conclusions  no matter the place time size of the universe  Specific moments truly brought Stoppard  Pinter  and Beckett back to me   The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  is a humorous twist on a science fiction story full of wacky aliens  hilarious ways of communication  and the overall story line and  space life lessons  that can be learned by reading this book Have you ever heard someone say   The answer to Life is 42   Well  this book is where it comes from  Has a friend ever made a joke about putting a fish in you re ear  That s in the book too  The hilarious Babel Fish that can translate everything and the Deep Thought make this book a terrific creation of everything you want to know that is alien  Along the way with Author and Ford  small excerpts from the actual  Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  are included  that teach you all about the Babel Fish  and how to not panic in situations where you are about to be thrown out of a space ship   Keep it in mind  you can hold your breathe for 30 seconds after being ejected from a Vogon space ship  Also  who can forget the prototype for robots with emotions  Marvin the paranoid android is definitely my favorite character in the whole book  His depressed attitude is so real it is humorous   Tipica fa atrasada  estou lendo o segundo livro da serie e babando pela genialidade do Douglas Adams  Fantastico  hilario  confuso e divertido  As vezes eu relia os paragrafos so para me deleitar novamente com o que estava escrito  Eu vi o filme e achei meio chato  mas agora quero ver de novo entendendo tudo o que esta la      This book is the funniest and the most insane shit I ve read in such a long time xD I did not expect that and it was such a quick read  It s a classic and I ve been meaning to read it for a while  I m kinda dissapointed it was so short  I wanted more Characters were completely insane  I expected at least Ford to be more serious but NOPE  My favourite was the little depressed robot called Marvin  Sis and I also saw the movie yesterday and he was absolutely adorable  I didn t like the movie version of the president Zaphod  he was completely nuts  In the books he was crazy but not that much lol  Arthur is a cutie  especially in the movie played by Marting Freeman I loved the fast paced rhythm but I had to face palm a few times especially when the whale appeared  D I absolutely loved the plot twist with mice being the most intelligent on Earth  And the whole thing with Earth being the one big computer searching for the meaning of life  And mice ordering it and Margathea creating planets on commission  Wow just wow The best thing in the movie were the dolphins singing xD And the last thing I m gonna mention is the importance they gave to Marvin in the movie were he uses this gun to stun the enemies and makes them feel the way he feels and saves the day   All through my life I ve had this strange unaccountable feeling that something was going on in the world  something big  even sinister  and no one would tell me what it was   No   said the old man   that s just perfectly normal paranoia  Everyone in the Universe has that   Such statements in the book really take you back into those times when you were in these situation  Replete with comedy  philosophy  satire and action  this is probably the greatest science fiction work I have read until now  DO NO MISS READING  I first read this as a 20 year old and loved it  I am not a sci fi fan at all  but this book is different  It s really more humor comedy satire wit  dark comey a la Monty Python  but it s not a complete farce  Adams is a good writer   he can turn a phrase so that you love it  And the book also has a moralistic social commentary feel to it   yeah  this was a re read  But the first time i read it  goodreads  and the internet  didn t exist  I enjoyed it as much as I remembered  and it turns out that I had forgotten much of it   great book its funny  One of the best written books I ve read  Maluco   Genial   This was a delightful book  I was entertained from beginning to end   Laugh out loud hilarious  I couldn t put it down  Goofy yet serious  Witty and nonsensical  Definitely would recommend to anyone who loves lighthearted tales of science fiction and hilarity  I m very picky about the sci fi I read and I loved this    you do need to appreciate Bristish humor and helps if you like shows like Red Dwarf  Doctor Who  which Adams wrote episodes for   and Kilgore Trouts antics via Kurt Vonnegut  This book  summed up briefly  lampoons humanity through the use of a manic depressive robot  brain damaged president  pretend out of work actor alien  a clueless human who just wants to go home  and brilliantly clever and frustrated mice  I do think the ending is a bit abrupt but there other books in this series so  following the wise advice of The Hitchiker s Guide to the Galaxy  don t panic  Hello there   Yes you  human  the third most intelligent species on the planet What are you looking for  a review for this book   or  the meaning of life   well  it doesn t matter You can find the answers in this book  As a matter of fact you can find answers to gazillion questions in the  Hitchhiker s Guide   however there is not much about you planet Well  DON T PANIC Thing with this book series is that it is one of a kind  comic sci fi adventure   and that makes it  A MUST READ   I had my share of doubts whilst deciding whether to read it or not  as it was originally a radio comedy broadcast later adapted as a series  but the size of the book was an encouragement  so I embarked on the journey across galaxy  reluctantly at first  and got dazzled by this ludicrously ingenious and absurdly smart piece of literature  There is nothing much one can write about this book  for there is nothing really to write  that doesn t mean book isn t well written  it is sharp  sarcastic  witty and uncannily rational   yet surprisingly this is one of those books that you can read again and again  laugh each time just as heartily   Indeed a TIMELESS CULT CLASSIC You can try the first book it is a small book for that matter  and decide for yourself  Non c  nulla che io abbia mai letto che gli si avvicini  Uno stile particolare  Douglas Adams  con pacato eclettismo sfoggia un umorismo english sul bilico del nonsense  scritto con apparente nonchalance e naturalezza  Denso di simpaticissime trovate non ti lascia mai andare via il sorriso dalla bocca Frankly  I wasn t hooked in the beginning  It felt a bit goofy and I was a bit disappointed that it didn t live up to the hype  After a few chapters  though  I couldn t put it down  Some of the transitions are a little rough  but by the end I found the whole thing to be thoroughly charming  Douglas Adams  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy   a trilogy in heaven only knows how many books  Interesting that the Guide itself would now be played by some species of tablet computer  I came across this by accident by catching a radio rebroadcast  It goes beyond anything on screen because one did not need to get special effects approval and the odd ball creatures and things look exactly as you think they should  But Adams makes it funny in all its versions and sequels  Wonderful take on the people who complain about  well  everything  the people who just ignore the rest of the world and the people who just blink and get along  Ford Prefect taught me to never travel without a towel and Dent  Arthur Dent  taught me patience As to catch phrases that enter the vernacular  it gave us  42   Try it after you decide you like the book  Ask a large group  What is the meaning of life  the universe and everything   If someone answers  42   you know you have someone you can talk to  If they answer in chorus  you are in for a pleasant time FYI   I entered by title  not ISBN  If anyone cares  I own the paperback ISBN 0 671 66496 4  Slightly different cover illustration  Can t find a place to change the number Read somewhere in the late 1970 s  early 1980 s  One of the most humorous books I have ever read   huzzah for Britain and all it s stupid quirks One rather surrealist part was the improbability drive sequence   very funny  The best book ever  period  Do not even begin to argue  you are just wrong  Lord of the Rings  pah A break from the norm of a bunch of misfits thrown together to save the world  here a bunch of misfits are thrown together after the world is destroyed right at the start  The first of the five books that make up the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy trilogy  I know  I know  sets the tone for the genius that was Douglas Adams and the books that were to follow  Based upon the BBC radio series of the same name  this quirky science fiction comedy fantasy mix is a fantastic read that I have never tired of  I have read this book at least once every year since I first bought a copy way back in 1985 If you can never get the hang of Thursdays  wished you had listened to your mother s advice and always know where you towel is  then this   and the four others from the rest of the trilogy   is the book for you Whatever you are reading at the moment and whatever is your favourite book of all time  put it down and change your mind and welcome the all time great into your library  During the past couple years  I had decided not to reread any books  I wanted to at times  but when I look at my shelves of books not yet read  and my Kindle full of unread items  I thought I had best keep to things new to me But this year  I changed my mind  I decided I need to reread some of my favorites  I first read Hitchhiker s Guide when I was in the eighth grade  1984  to be precise   Our school system had combined some middle schools  and a new friend introduced me to this book  Thanks  Spencer  I probably read it once a year from then through college  and maybe even beyond  But now I have not read it in at least 10 years  This is just a delightful book  But more than that  it has been a part of me since that first reading so many years ago  This has been a pleasant trip down memory lane  and of course an enjoyable read  It is a book I hope my kids read and enjoy   A very funny science fiction book about Arthur Dent  a man on earth  who finds out moments before it happens  that the earth will cease to exist because of an intergalactic highway being built  Arthur goes on a crazy mission with his friend Ford on how to stop the highway and the destruction of earth  There are many colorful and interesting characters in this book all along the way  If you love science fiction with a very strange twist of humor this is the book for you  One of my favorite books of all time  I think this is the worst of the Hitchikers Guide books  and it s still one of the best books ever written  how could anyone not like this  is it because they hate good writing  well fleshed out characters  whimsey  an interesting plot  if you know someone who doesn t like Douglas Adams  take that person out of your life  you deserve better  Hilarious  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is both profound and silly at the same time  Instant favorite  Hilariously EPIC   as well as epically hilarious  and wildly entertaining until the last sentence  This is one of those books that I will DEFINITELY read to my kids  when I   produce   some  before bedtime  They may ask me a lot of questions along the way  but that is the point isn t it    The hitchikkers guide to the galaxy was a very entertaining book  Some parts of the book did not link in eith the main plot and that is why it is very entertaining  This is a book for people who enjoy a book eith sci  fi and comedy mixed in with confusion the main character  Arthur  depicts a normal human being meaning anyone could gomthrough what he went through  All of the important characters play a major role in the story and without them the story would be very  This book would deffinetly be worth the money if you enjoy science fiction and confusion   This might be a review of more than just  1  as I can t remember where I read the things I did  But when certain images stick with you for the rest of your life  particularly why everyone should always  bring a towel   well  that is something great  Sometimes I also recall the restaurant at the end of the universe and the cow that was bred to want to be eaten  And the answer is 42  This was my first exposure to the writing of Doug Adams  I went on to read the full Hitchhiker series with great enjoyment  The perfect tongue in cheek humor and a plot that pulls you along combination  I thought this was hilarious  I d seen the movie a long time ago but figured it was finally time to read the books  I ended up listening to the audiobook   ready by Stephen Fry   and it was awesome  I can t wait to get the next one  Wow  I knew I would be reading this book one day  as friends had been talking about it since I was in middle school  but I didn t know it would be so great  Written in a very unique tone    The ships hung in the sky in precisely the way a brick doesn t    this book is full of laughs  headscratchers  and unique ruminations on the human condition  I will definitely be moving on to the next books in the series  Enjoyable  witty  and very  very  different  Good one  Almost comical in some ways  The universe  even though consisting of super advanced beings  does not base its decisions on logic or reason  Things don t exist to make sense  Things just happen without any sense of purpose A gripping storyline  wonderfully thought out characters  and subtle  and not so subtle  comedy make A Hitchhiker s Guide    a must read I hope the remaining ones live up to this one  This is a wonderful romp through the universe just don t forget your towel  This book is brilliantly awesome  Funny and easy to read for someone who is new to sci fi like me Not a single boring day dreamish metaphor I had to read through  But instead  I loved the way he would use similes in unconventional ways  like  It floated above the surface much the same way that bricks don t    This book was hysterical  One the best books I ever read and recommend it to any one else who like lots of comedy in their reading  I am not your typical Sci Fi reader  I don t normally enjoy the genre  But  this book is great  It s funny  has great characters that make you care about them  a gripping plot  interesting subplots  did I mention it s laugh out loud on the bus funny  I can t tell you how many times I ve read this book  and now I m thinking its been too long Author of The Jessica Hart JennBrink com I very much enjoy reading this book  Which is a big deal for me  Every book I pick up  I put down after the first chapter  But not this book  You see The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy isn t like most books  The books plot has a way of getting the reader thinking in a philosophical twist about the world  life  and why we exist  The plot consists of the main character being a human from Earth named Arthur Dent and his journey through the galaxy with his friend Ford Perfect  who is actually from a small planet somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse  Ford saved Arthur from Earth just before Earth was blown up  Now Arthur is on this journey through the galaxy discovering that there is much more to life than just planet Earth  answering some of the biggest unanswered questions we only dream of answering  And getting the reader involved mentally  making the reader think about what truly does ley beyond plant Earth with a whole new outlook  perspective  I was recommended this book by someone that I think very highly of  and I will not put it down until I finish it  More reviews soon to come   Bizarrely entertaining and an easy read  although a little confusing at times  Everyone should read this at least once  I love it so much that I had a line tattooed on my arm  I ve read this book multiple times  and I never seem to get tired of it   I can still read this and laugh  Contains one of the best scenes ever written  the one of the tea house with the biscuits  if you haven t read it  read it just for that  What am I saying  if you haven t read it  One of the most entertaining books ever written  A delight to the gray matter and darn you Douglas Adams  you are one of the reasons my laugh lines are so deep  No  I forgive you and miss you  Oltre ad essere un libro culto  l ho trovato brillante  assurdo  umoristico  paradossale  soprendente  surreale  delirante Una specie di recensione su http   www jhack it blog 2006 10 25 t    Oh my  it has been too  too long since I last read this book  I love the craziness of it all and how in not making sense it makes complete sense One of my favourite quotes is   The ships hung in the sky in much the same way that bricks don t Incredibly smart and funny and I want to read all of them right now  This is still my all time favorite book ever  I won t go into the plotline  because it s pretty easy to know it already even without reading it  or even talk about specifics as to why I liked it so much  because either you get it or you don t      I think it was the first book I completely and utterly enjoyed  and I just never stopped loving it  I must admit I might not rave so highly of the entire series  as I do feel the later books    especially the fifth    just aren t quite as entirely fabulous  but I do think of Douglas Adams as my favourite author and consume anything and everything I can about him and his work  I was deeply saddened when he died  and kept the  Get Fuzzy  comic strip that was in the newspaper just after his passing  And yes  I also like his other funny  sci fi ish books  Dirk Gently s Holistic Detective Agency and The Long Dark Tea Time of the Soul  The second time around was as great as the first  Love Douglas Adams   NEPROPADEJTE PANICE Stale jsou tu jeste dalsi ctyri dily Chvilku mi trvalo procist se pres prvnich tricet stranek  ale pak se Douglas Adams pravdepodobne zblaznil  protoze to  co slatal dohromady je tak prehnany az genialni  Obcas jsem se dokonce chytala za hlavu z hlasek  ktere dokazal vyplodit  ale tohle dobrodruzstvi si rozhodne nenecham ujit  protoze jsem se bavila celou dobu  Kdybych mohla  dala bych 42 hvezdicek  A ted me omluvte  musim si sbalit rucnik a vyrazit do knihkupectvi pro dalsi dil   Sir   I said to the universe   I exist    That   said the universe   creates no sense of obligation in me whatsoever    It s actually very amazing  I didn t have any expectations at all and now I find myself with every single book in the series  reading them in between other books  I am so glad I gave this book a go  it was hilariously confusing and I did go back a few chapters or two because I missed something that became hugely important later on  This was my first real lesson on foreshadowing and how to pay attention to everything  I d never read anything quite like this and it was exciting to see science fiction that wasn t just a load of either info dumps or science fantasy  Every event was simply unexpected  the twists surprising  mostly because it was absolutely batshit crazy most of the time and yet  in the end  it made for a very interesting and hilarious book  Do you know where your towel is  Arthur Dent  who lived in the West Country side of London  now must grasp onto his beloved bath towel as he Hitchhikes through the galaxy with his best friend Ford Prefect  who seemly has an nonalcoholic obsession with going to the local pub one dreary Thursday morning  After Arthur s attempts to save his overly normal looking house are proven unsuccessful  an adventure of ironic situations  mysterious side stories and unfathomable statistics now make up Arthur s new life  While we fallow his friends  the possibility of new love  and the explanation of life  the universe and everything through the Hitchhikers s Guide To The Galaxy  embrace the possibility that there is more out there than just the human race  In The Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy  Douglas Adams kept me guessing the whole time   not because the plot was overly complected and full of unforeseeable twists  but because it was the oddest book I have read  While the book uniquely opened my eyes to how insignificant our existence may or may not be  The Guide also constantly left me smiling  Although this book is not for everyone  those it does appeal to will enjoy the witty humor and  for the lack of a better word  lightness of plot  To say the least  this book is one I plan to read again in the future My suggestion is this book be considered 16 up   A very interesting scifi book that I know many would enjoy reading  The movie is pretty bad but the book is actually very interesting  El primer libro de la mejor saga de ciencia ficcion jamas escrita  Me cae  Perfect  Well no  but it s as near as I d want to comer across  I absolutely LOVED this book  It had great descriptions and also stated things that didn t need to be stated  Wonderful for people from about 11 111 years old  It was sad that poor Arthur had a hard time  but it was still awesome  I aim to read the next 2 in the Trilogy Of FIIIIIIIIIIIIIVE  42  Hilarious  in a British way  Very imaginative  Science fiction for the sci fi illiterate  Easily enjoyed and worth re reading  My 12 year old self loooved this book  I suspect that like Monty Python it might not be as funny now  I ll just leave that 5 star there unexamined  That said  I look forward to my sons reading this  I do think that it prompts you to examine the world around you and play with language  I miss Douglas Adams Update  I did end up re reading this with my kids  It s still great  LOVED THIS BOOK   The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy may not have any historical or even necessary insight to life  but the entertainment this book provides is enough to satisfy me  The insane characters the reader meets throughout this completely nonsensical journey are brilliant and the science fiction that Adam creates in this novel is absolutely hilarious  Being the first of six books in the Hitchhiker s series  this one set the standards of craziness at an all time high  In terms of my writing  I was able to understand that it s okay to create weird characters and throw them in unnatural situations as long as the rest of the writing backs it up  Oh yeah and in case you were wondering  the answer to life  the universe  and everything is 42  never forget that  A really quick and enjoyable read  Great details and subtle humor that I didn t always pick up on in the movie  I really liked the pacing and the short explanatory chapters interspersed with the story  It was also interesting to see what they changed plot wise for the movie    If you liked the movie then definitely read the book  If you haven t seen the movie read the book anyway  The first book that made me genuinely laugh out loud  Brilliant   Honestly  this is one of my all time favorite books  I cannot recommend it highly enough  Adams is a thought provoking and hilarious writer  This is short  too  It only took me about 3 hours to read  Hitchiker s Guide to the Galaxy is funny  witty  and sometimes nonsensical  But that s what makes it wonderful  It makes you wonder about what s out there  It makes you feel small and insignificant but part of a bigger picture  I would absolutely recommend this to everyone  This is a crazy book  You pretty much have to not try to understand it  just go along and watch  I can t remember all the names of the other books  so I can t search for them  but after this book it got not too interesting  The whole not finishing anything thing is even more prominent then in A Series of Unfortunate Events  At least there the Baudelaires have a goal the whole time  although it changes  The books after this one really don t have a point  However  this is hilarious   This book is about the one earthling who survives when earth is destroyed to form a new inter galactic bypass  The other one who actually saves his life is from a small planet in the area of Betelguise  Anyway  they meat up with the president of the Galaxy  Zaphod Beeblebrox or something very close to that With Zaphod and the ship that he stole they find the planet that used to manufacture planets  until they went out of business at least  Now it is going to re build earth  Oh  and they also find the answer to the Ultimate Question of Life  the Universe  and Everything In this book the main characters name is Arthur Dent  Mr  Dents main external conflicts are trying to stay alive and finding some tea  Both Ford  who saved his life  and president Zaphod  who has two heads and three arms  make it difficult to stay alive  As for the tea  I believe he nearly crashes the computer that drives the ship trying to make some I would rate this book 5 stars because it is very funny and well written  This was a great book  definitely worth reading  probably worth reading more than once  It s very short  which can be seen as good or bad  doesn t have a particularly interesting plot  and is filled exclusively with characters for whom  two dimensional  would be a great compliment    and yet  none of this bothered me in the slightest  In fact  I hardly noticed until I started thinking about how I would review it  This is because the book is almost unceasingly clever  funny  and interesting  with fantastic and quotable lines every couple of pages  If one is looking for a quick  fun  read  I can t think of many books better suited to the purpose 5 5 A very interesting and very unlike any other books i ve read  too bad on the later books it became to convoluted and hard to understand  still  a very interesting read  NOT for everyone though  you ve been warned   One of my all time favorites  Bastante divertido mientras duro    Absolutely absurd  fantastically funny  philosophically fulfilling  It takes a certain kind of person to truly appreciate the wit and humor of Douglas Adams and I m glad to be one of them  I often quote from the Hitchhiker s series as so many things Mr  Adams wrote truly define the inconsistencies  incongruities  and sheer idiosyncrasies of life  the universe  and everything  A lot of fun to read again and again  I always find something new  This comical story  by Douglas Adams who was once a radio host in his home town in Europe  caught the idea of writing the book  The Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy  from the book  The Hitch Hikers Guide to Europe   The book  The Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy   is a bout a man named Arthur Dent and his journey traveling through out the universe in a stolen space craft  Arthur Dent is a strapping young gentleman  ladies  who has recently moved to a new home only to encounter a journey far different from what he ever expected This book is a very comical and somewhat romantic book but can have its sad and down points  It is a pretty entertaining book but has a tendency to jump around a lot and may leave you a little confused and having to re read portions of the book in order to grasp a better understanding of what is happening  It is set at a very fast pace which makes it difficult to completely understand what is happening  The author  although not a very detailed writer  can paint pictures in your head at times and does have the ability to show you what is happening with words  the pictures are very helpful as well This book is set all around the universe in planets such as barbaon  Haggunenons  and Megabrantis  planet home to the vigorous and ugly Vogons   The reason for the continuous traveling throughout the universe is because of a major crisis on the planet earth that may make it difficult to live there  While traveling the universe he joins President Beeblebrox on an adventure in a stolen space craft  The president of the universe  Mr  Beeblebrox  has been dedicated to finding the famous computer which is located on the planet Magrathea  The reason that he wants to find this computer is because it is said to have the answer to the question of life  In an effort to find this computer he travels through multiple planets and galaxies and at one point even turns into a flower pot and rubber ducky  I found the authors use of setting very interesting  He depicted what the farther out universe may look like  and who knows maybe if you get far enough out into the universe you ll turn into a chocolate airplane that runs on cotton candy  Arthur Dent is tall man who has recently moved to a house in the spread out western farmland  Arthur is never at ease with himself and always seems stressed out  He is often asked  what are you worried about  and  what is bothering you   Arthur  being new  doesn t have very many friends but the friends he has are close to him  On Arthur s first day living in the new urban west coast he meets a friend  Ford Prefect  who is not necessarily what Arthur thought he was when  Ford is an unusual and rare specimen who joins Arthur on an adventurous and dangerous journey in an effort to save their lives  Arthur s crush  Trillian  falls into the hands of the president of the galaxy and is used for bad  When they finally meet again they will be experiencing a journey like no other The narrator  who talks as if he is a passenger on the journey  talk in mostly third person limited with explaining the thoughts of Arthur Dent  The narrator is an interesting and comical part of this book and helps to explain what is go9ng on  Although it is difficult to keep up with what is happening at all times the narrator is there to help you understand the book better and add interesting facts about the mysterious universe  The narrator keeps an engaging and funny mood during this adventure in the universe and keeps you guessing on what he will say next  Although the narrators statements are usually random they are enjoying to read and learn  I d grown up knowing of the radio show  and watched the film when it came out  so when I got the chance to read the actual book  I jumped at the chance I absolutely loved this book   it had the exact dry comedy about it that I expected it to  Lots of simple jokes    What does it feel like to be drunk  Ask a glass of water   and lots of more clever humour too I d definitely recommend it to anyone   I thoroughly enjoyed  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy   It is full of dry British wit that I enjoy  It is reminiscent of Monty Python s Holy Grail   though I don t know which proceeds the other   The plot follows Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect  yes like the car  who are now hitchhiking away from the empty space that was once Earth  Along the way they find Zaphod Breelbrox who has stolen a new high tech ship and has a plan   This novel is not meant to be taken seriously  I consider the whole novel to be a joke  If one begins to overthink it the whole book falls apart it s so ridiculous  For instance the narrator reveals to us that humans are not the at the topof the hierarchy when it comes to smarts on Earth  In fact they only reap the bronze medal  They are directly behind mice and dolphins  The dolphins give us the hilarious line  so long and thanks for all the fish   The joke being that the hyper intelligent dolphins knew of the impending doom of Earth and simply left   Perhaps my favorite moment from the whole novel is the answer to everything in the universe is    42  The civilization waited millions of years from answer from the super computer only for it to be useless to them because they didn t know the question  What proceeds is a chain of events that leads to Earth s demise   I would recommends this novel to anyone who likes sci fis because this definitely plays on some of the concepts witnessed in other novels  Also to anyone who has a British sense of humor  as anyone without it will be lost in the inanity that is this novel   Back in the day  my best friend Ryan and me would read Douglas Adams books and think we were so epically cool  Y know  because we read DOUGLAS ADAMS  Last Summer I took the Hitchhiker s books with me on holiday and I relished in the funny looks I received  because at the end of the day   I think we were on to something   Reading Douglas Adams makes a person awesome  Just    awesome  Nothing to say     I d lived in shame till I read it      Hilarious  So  funny  Can t believe this wasn t already in my  read  list  I loved Hitchiker s Guide to the Galaxy  Wacky fun characters in a mapcap adventure across the universe  Good thing they had the Guide to help them I was hooked from the first chapter  Author Dent convinced by his  space traveling  friend that he had to hurry and leave quickly becuase earth was going to be destroyed in a few hours  Why  To make way for an inter stellar super highway  The fun and surprises continue from there Hey  Where s my towel  For my quirky  nerdy friends    read this book  Simply hilarious  quirky  clever  and science fiction to boot  Normally I don t even like this genre  but as I am determined to read all the classics  I bit the bullet and picked this up  I am not sure I want to make it through the sequels  as I loved the  hanging out there  ending  Published in 1979  the novel presents technology such as touch screens and robots as if you would be crazy to expect a world otherwise  Chock full of weird  quotable quotes  this book would make for a fun book discussion while drinking a lot of beer  If you re looking to be inspired  or need a straight forward story  skip it  If ever in my life I get wasted so much  I d love to refer to it as hitchhiking across the galaxy  But frankly   this is  was  one of my Top Two favourite and humourous writers  And remembering about the towell and answering with number 42 will probably never leave my mind  One of the funniest books I know of  Its true to life portrayal of bureaucrats as joyless  obnoxious parasites of society was bold and cathartic  Some of my favorite lines are  Time is an illusion  lunchtime doubly so  The ships hung in the sky in much the same way that bricks don t  Termine este libro el ayer en el trabajo  la verdad esta muy  muy bueno y muy  muy chistoso  Leer este libro fue como estar viendo un capitulo de Futurama y la verdad eso me gusto bastante El humor es parecido al de Terry Pratchett lo cual sinceramente era de esperar dado que ambos autores son Britanicos  pero con algunas diferencias  se nota que no son copia uno del otro y eso es genial En general recomiendo bastante este libro a todos lo que quieran reirse un rato y a todos los que gusten de la Ciencia Ficcion pues el libro tiene de los dos  Are You Ready to Travel through the Universe   Good Don t Forget Your Towel    The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  It s a sort of electronic book  It tells you everything you need to know about anything  That s its job    Page 53  Sadly the actual Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy does not do its fictional job very well  But  that notwithstanding  the book is still top notch and one of the best you can read  The book has some splendid comedy that could put a smile on everybody s face  The book tells a fun story that people can sink their teeth into  The characters are very colorful and likeable  From Arthur Dent  to Ford Perfect  to Zaphod Beeblebrox  they all have super likable qualities and are very fun to follow through the galaxy  Some of the humor makes you shake your head however   SPOILER ALERT  42 is discovered as the ultimate answer to everything and towels are super important to hitchhikers  These two awkward realties can make you confused and make you ponder an unserious book to long  I will obviously avoid telling of the ending but be forewarned  It may be strange it may feel out of place it may feel too early but the ending is the ending  Don t be depressed by the ending  This book is a part of a trilogy  yet there is six of them   that is part of the humor of Douglas Adams   Therefore  the ending makes perfect sense and is perfect for a Segway to the next book  To prove that even more the last words of the book is the title for the sequel  Furthermore  the ending is good if you don t read the sequel  It allows the reader  then  to create their own ending then the reader will always be satisfied with the ending  Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is a prime example of a classic book  A book that started as a radio drama  transitioned into a book  transitioned into a television show  and finally a major motion picture  The different media Douglas Adams s classic was made proves that classics will never die  Good things and good books only come every now and then well folks Douglas Adams made one of the best  I recommend everyone to read this great  great book as soon as possible   The answer is   4  Okay all done with this review  If you don t get the reference  then take a  trip  across the universe in a multi demensional ship with a motley crew of exotic characters  This book will take you to places you would never dreamed of  or considered  My favorite character was of course   the towel  Take a chance and take a trip with Adams and his spaceship   I ve read this book so many times  I ve laughed to tears every time   Age recommendation  10 Many libraries shelve this in the YA or even adult sections  but there s no reason that a 10 year old who s a good reader shouldn t read it  The humor is silly  and occasionally dark  the story is about earth getting destroyed to make way for an intergalactic highway system after all   but it s never crude or inappropriate in any way  It s been a perennial favorite of children  and adults  for the last 35 years for a reason  It might even be a good choice for an longer book to read aloud to children  much like The Hobbit is   Don t Panic  This is a science fiction book for the rest of us who usually stay away from this genreOne of my biggest pet peeves that drive me away from high fantasy or hard core science fiction novels it that so much is introduced to the reader with little or no explanation  Suddenly there are mythical creatures  alien races and situations that are plunked down on the page  without an explanation  I have to accept them as part of the story  without any context of what they mean Hitchhiker s Guide not only explained everything they introduced  but did it in a quirky  witty and delightful manner  It was a pleasure reading it  In the middle of a regular day  giant spaceships appear all around the earth  Just a second before they destroy the planet  to make way for a galactic highway   Arthur Dent is saved by his friend Ford  which he finds out to be an alien   The two men begin a fascinating journey through space  They meet strange creatures  steel spaceships  and defend themselves with the most powerful tool in the universe   a towel This book changes the way you look at life  the universe and everything  It is the most funny science fiction book I ve ever read  It is fast  surprising  and genius  I recommend this book for people who love science fiction and want to experience something a bit different   There s nothing about this book I can tell you that hasn t already been told  This book is a masterpiece in science fiction  and it should certainly not be passed up  So funny  I don t know what I was expecting when I picked up this book at the library  but I was very pleasantly surprised  It is funny  witty  thoughtful  philosophical  and surprising all at once  It is easy to read without being simplistic  and Adams has a wonderful knack for turning a phrase  I m adding this  and the sequels  which I ve never even read  to my  must own  list  This is one of my all time favourite books  and if you ve ever seen and enjoyed the film  or the very old TV programme  then you need to read this as neither of those do it justice  In fact if you didn t enjoy either of those then you need to read this book because you re missing out There are some many imaginative things in this book the whole world becomes alive as you read through the pages  The character s are fantastic  and I m just sad their not real because I want to know them  I ve read this book a number of times and every time there is something new  and even the old stuff still makes me laugh out loud  This book is a classic and will be retold for generations to come  never becoming outdated  It was really interesting to this audio  having read the book years ago  and since seen the movie  Of course it was still as fantastic as always  but it was interesting to see where Douglas Adams approved changes from the original book for the movie script  This was a really fun listen and the audio is really good  The tangential nature of this story is just so great to listen to  It kind of adds to the whirlwind nature of what Arthur is experiencing being so totally out of his element  The world that Douglas Adams has created is kooky and weird in all the best ways  It s fantastical but still based in a reality that appeals and is understandable  I always enjoy when a writer seems to have an innate ability to look at our world and take a step to left  It s recognizable but wacky at the same time Love this series      Pangalactic comedy doesn t get better than this Setting The Galaxy  Specifically   Earth  space  some spaceships  and a few other planets thrown in for good measure Plot Arthur Dent  ordinary human  is trying to prevent his house from being demolished to make way for a bypass  His secretly an alien friend  Ford Prefect  turns up and tries to warn him that Earth is about to be demolished to make way for a space bypass  They escape by hitching a ride on a passing spacecraft  which kicks off a crazy romp through the stars that leads Arthur to discover just how ridiculous of a place the universe really is Let s get something clear here  This was  at the time  the first part of a two book story  It was a complete radio program that was broken into two bits for novel publication  That has a few consequences Firstly  there s no ending to speak of   this book just sort of barrels straight into the second one  Also  it doesn t have nearly as much narrative action or character development as you would normally expect a novel length story to have  That stuff is just picking up in Act 3  and then it ends  However  if you smash this together with The Restaurant at the End of the Universe  then stand back and look at the wreckage  you ll see a proper dramatic arc Instead of all that development nonsense  the vast majority of this book is world building  That would normally be a terrible description  but Adam s genius is in how entertaining he makes his exposition  You re introduced to the universe through the eyes of everyman Arthur Dent  who is just as new to all of this as a first time reader would be  He s given the titular book as an easy way of explaining everything to him  and while The Hitchhiker s Guide excerpts are usually only tangentially related to the plot  they provide liberal doses of humor  social commentary  and immersion Most of the comedy is found in the form of your usual humorous inversions and beat jokes  but Adams simply does these masterfully  Characters Arthur Dent is one of the foremost examples of a successful everyman protagonist  He s very much there for the audience to project themselves into  After all  his only defining characteristics in this novel are that he likes tea  likes girls  and likes his home home planet   and he honestly seems to forget about liking girls and his home home planet after a few sentences on each  So as long as you don t absolutely despise tea  Arthur Dent is you   a human taken from your comfy chair and thrust into a wonky world you never knew existed That being said  the rest of the characters are varied and humorous   even the minor ones  The biggest flaw would have to be the lack of character development  since there isn t any  The main characters all have uniquely funny personalities  but they don t exactly change in any way Pacing Incredibly fast read  No closure at all  but you ll get to the end without so much as a bit of drag  and then you can move on to the sequel Notes DON T PANICSpoiler Zone  view spoiler  This is one of those books where it s really hard for me to pin down exactly why I liked it so much  At the end of the day  it s simply the style of the writing  I could poke at the plot a little  but it s good in the end  I could rant about the lack of character development  but Adams managed to create memorable characters  even if he left off the  development  part  I could complain about the amount of frivolous scenes  usually a cue for eyelids drooping  but here they re a starring attraction  What it all comes down to is the humor and the style  It s funny  Contrary to popular belief  you  can  quantify humor  but I m not about to sit here and parse out each little joke  I m just going to say that the way they all add up makes me thoroughly enjoy this book every time I read it All that gushing praise out the way  I will nitpick one thing  Trillian annoys me She s such a passive character that the story would be little different if she wasn t there at all  In this book  the only thing affected by her presence are her mice  who just happen to turn out to be hyperintelligent  pandimensional beings  They could ve just as easily been Arthur s mice  or some random mice  It s hard to rationalize a reason for her being in the story other than for Arthur to crush on her a bit   so it s no surprise that the movie adaptation turned their relationship into a full fledged romantic arc  even though that s lacking in the book  But to tell the truth  I think the book would ve been even better had something like that been present  As it is  she s basically just another body in the room   hide spoiler   endreview I lurrrvvv this book brilliant  Hilariously funny and brilliant  One of the wittiest and smartest stories ever  It s one of those books that make you laugh and ponder  Absolutely a favorite  It had been decades since I last read Hitchhiker s Guide  so when my daughter said she was going to read it I decided to refresh my memory and reread it myself  I am so glad I did  I remembered that it was witty and very English and a few key points like  DON T PANIC  and to always remember your towel  but this read was better than ever  I suppose it s the  wisdom of the aged   but there s so much more depth and many more witticisms and more laugh out loud moments than I remember from when I was a teenager  I was also struck by how amazingly Douglas Adams envisioned future  ie  today s  technology   rather like the original Star Trek series  The Hitchhiker s Guide was an e book before we even imagined e books were a possibility  The political commentary remains very timely  The philosophy and quantum physics remain entangled  Douglas Adams was an absolute genius and it shines through in the book s seeming simplicity that reveals itself in astonished retrospect  This should be required reading for everyone  at least once per decade  so that you can remember what you loved the first time and marvel at the new levels you discover with each subsequent read  I have read all Douglas Adams books multiple times  and they have been highly formative  Now for the first time i read this one with my daughter  and i was tempted to give it 4 stars instead of 5  Perhaps it hasn t aged as well as other books from the same time  Some of the jokes sound stilted now  The  cliffhanger  ending wasn t as funny as it used to be  But heck  it s still the book i go to when looking for a comforting thought on the absurdity of the universe  The Vogons  Magrathea  Zaphod Beeblebrox  The skillful fakeout making you think Trillian was an alien  Marvin  The Paranoid Android   How many roads must a man walk down   Forty Two   Digital watches  We take Douglas Adams  wonderfully weird creativity for granted now  but we shouldn t  So it s still 5 stars for me  And i wish he were still around  I absolutely love this book  Although I know saying this will probably piss people off  I did personally find this better than The Lord of the Rings  The Lord of the Rings books are hard to get through  I think Anyways  this is one of my favorite books and I would definitely recommend it  It is honestly kind of a weird book  but a good one    This is an odd situation for me  This book is brilliant  There is no doubt about that  I often read books and immediately say  I could write that   This book  There is no way I  or anyone else   could write a book like this  It is hilarious  I laughed out loud many times  There is also so much behind the story that I honestly didn t fully understand  I understand the author is an influential atheist  and I could pick up on that theme  but it wasn t slapping you in the face with its theory  This is coming to a  but  and the but is no fault of the book s or the author s  It s just not the kind of story I like  I enjoyed the use of language and humor  but exploration of strange worlds and their science isn t my thing  I gladly finished the book because it is so short  Had it been any longer  I might not have finished it On the other hand  if the mark of a great book is that it stays with you long after you ve finished reading  then this is a great book and thus the five star rating  JUNE 1983   IT was raining and we were crossing the English channel and listening to this amazing story on BBC    the rest is history and one of my highlights was a surprise lunch with ADAMS IN LONDON where i received signed copies from the man himselfi pity people who miss out and or fail to grasp the magnificent effort and intellectual gems immortalized by this great author in these booksi will be reading these to my grandchildren one day Hitchhiker s  volume 1 Earth is destroyed to make way for a bypass  Fortunately for Arthur Dent  his friend Ford Prefect turns out to be an alien and manages to escape  with Arthur The plot is not bad  but it s the writing that is fantastic Vogon ships  hung in the sky in exactly the way bricks don t   The Hooloovoo is a super intelligent shade of the colour blue  The old man who said nothing was true but was later found to be lying   After a second or so  nothing continued to happen    This must be Thursday  I never could get the hang of Thursdays   borrowing from Truman Capote s  Breakfast at Tiffany s    Bits of it were dullish grey  Bits of it were dullish brown  The rest of it was rather less interesting    An acute attack of no curiosity   Almost  but not quite  entirely unlike tea    It s unpleasantly like being drunk  What s so bad about being drunk  Try asking a glass of water   God refuses to prove he exists because proof denies faith and without faith he is nothing  But the Babel fish is a dead giveaway   so God disappeared in a puff of logic  Infinite improbability drive Brief summary and favourite quotes from the other four of the five books  as follows Restaurant at the End of Universe  vol 2   http   www goodreads com

vol 5   http   www goodreads com review show    Adams  thoughts on the Babel Fish are cited by linguist David Crystal in Language Death Amazing Book  Science Fiction with a lot of British humour sprinkled all over  The lightest serious book I ve ever read  42 This book had me laughing from the beginning at the absurdity that Aams conjures up  His characters are dynamite and always have something hilarious hidden up their sleeves  I loved this   it made me wonder as to what is really out there in the vastness of the universe and reminded me just how small and insignificant I am  whilst keeping a smile plastered across my face the whole time  Though the readability of this book makes it approachable for an adolescent  the content is insightful enough to stimulate adult readers  This book discusses profound topics in whimsical  comical  and near mocking fashion  I could reread this ten more times and still get something new from it each time  Adams has a very dry humor and his work is chock full of literary devices  I imagine he would be a difficult person to keep up with in conversation Quality of Writing  9 10Notes  His writing style is hilarious Pace  9 10Notes  It is a well paced book  Plot Development  9 10Notes  There is thoughtful plot development evidenced through the work  The parallelism and metaphoric qualities alone make this a sophisticated  well developed plot Characters  8 10Notes  They are an odd and quirky bunch  though each appealing in their own way  Oddly  Marvin is the most well developed character to me  which is ironic since he is a robot Enjoyability  9 10Notes  This is one of only a few books to make me literally laugh out loud Insightfulness  10 10Notes  The content is very insightful and is still appealing to re read Ease of Reading  9 10Notes  It took me longer than it should have to read  but I think that can be attributed more to what was going on in my life than the readability of the work as a whole  I definitely didn t struggle with it at all  I just didn t make time for it What are my favorite quotes from the book    For instance  on the planet Earth  man had always assumed that he was more intelligent than dolphins because he had achieved so much  the wheel  New York  wars and so on  whilst all the dolphins had ever done was muck about in the water having a good time  But conversely  the dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent than man  for precisely the same reasons     Don t Panic     Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the western spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun  Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety two million miles is an utterly insignificant little blue green planet whose ape descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea     For instance  on the planet Earth  man had always assumed that he was more intelligent than dolphins because he had achieved so much  the wheel  New York  wars and so on  whilst all the dolphins had ever done was muck about in the water having a good time  But conversely  the dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent than man  for precisely the same reasons   This is one of those laugh out loud satires that are few in the world it seems  Some hilarious incidents  with the syntax of sentences really quite wonderful and clever  A writer who loves language as much as he loved the story it seems  A classic  Yet  I didn t really continue in the series for some reason  I twice got half way through Restaurant  but never finished  The humor seemed to wane    Or become old  I m not sure  but this one stood up to a couple reads quite well over time   According to LivingSocial Books on Facebook  I m presently reading 9 books already  Realistically  this isn t the case  The Giver is on there   that s what I m teaching at the moment  Jitterbug Perfume is on there because it was a book club novel   the meeting was today and I only got 100 pages into it  Tom Robbins isn t really my cup of tea and in my present brainless mode  I really need to like what I m reading to even want to stop staring at whatever I can find on Pandora  Then there s the two Anita Blake novels I m supposedly reading   but I gave up Incubus Dreams 100 pages in to go back to the first book in the series  which I got halfway through before being distracted by Jitterbug Perfume  I started to read a book on Canadian politics by Elizabeth May  but it s too much work at the moment  There s The First Woman Doctor on that list   it s a work novel and will need to be finished soon  The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn I haven t touched in a solid year  I did recently try to pick up Jonathan Strange and Mr  Norrell again  another long book I made it 100 pages into   but another chapter through  I gave up again  The only thing I m actually reading is The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy because it s the only thing right now that can compete with TV is an author who truly understands the disasterousness that is a Thursday If I had a book that said Don t Panic on the cover  I d definitely read that  I really liked this book  So silly and amazing and fun  and it was like reading a British comedy in space  Recommend it to anyone and I cannot wait to dive into the next one    I wish my couch could do that  My favorite tidbits  42  the answer to the great cosmic question   an intergalactic race that is a superintelligent shade of the color blue  and some other race that believes the universe was born out of the nose of God  they fear the coming of the great handkerchief  Everyone knows someone kind of like a Zaphod Beeblebrox  I loved every bit of this book  Extremely hilarious and if you get the audio version it is actually read by Douglas Adams himself  It s highly imaginative and cleverly done  Such a laugh I could read it again and not be bored The movie followed quite closely  I also enjoyed the movie  but of course  the book was better by far  DON T PANIC say the words on the cover of the Hitchhiker s Guide and it s a good warning of the mayhem that follows in this classic SF Humour novel The concept of the Guide has aged well in this era of smart phones and tablets  which shows that Adams was way ahead of his timeIf you haven t read this   READ IT  If it s been a while since you last read   re acquaint yourself with the madness that is Douglas Adam s Hitch Hiker s Guide to the Galaxy You won t be disappointed     Don t leave Earth without this hilarious international bestseller about the end of the world and the happy go lucky days that follow   about the worst Thursday that ever happened and why the Universe is a lot safer if you bring a towel  After Earth is destroyed to make way for an intergalactic bypass  our hapless hero  Arthur Dent    who was saved by his alien friend Ford Prefect    meets up with the crew of a starship captained by the two headed Zaphod Beeblebrox and begins a quest to understand the meaning of life  the universe  and everything  The answer  of course  is 42  Also try the rest of the books in this increasingly inappropriately named  trilogy    La Guia del Viajero Intergalactico   de Douglas Adams  es uno de aquellos clasicos humoristicos de la lectura britanica que no pueden faltar en una coleccion  Ademas  claro  de ser el primer libro en una trilogia de seis libros  por loco que suene  La lectura comienza a ser fascinante desde los primeros cuatro renglones del prologo  en el que menciona a cierto planeta azul cuyos habitantes aun piensan que los relojes digitales son una muy buena idea  El personaje que al principio parece ser el protagonista del libro  Arthur Dent  es un hombre despistado  a quien el resto del mundo  y del espacio  parece pisotear a su antojo  Se deja llevar por algunas emociones y sus resentimientos son duraderos  Los personajes  secundarios  y  auxiliares   aunque creo que llamarlos asi no les hace justicia  ya que toman parte muy importante en la historia   llamados Ford  Zaphod  Tricia Mcmillian y el Marvin  el robot maniaco depresivo  son humanos en todo el sentido de la palabra  Me refiero a que las emociones y personalidades que experimentan  aparte de ser completamente humoristicas  son muchas y muy revueltas entre ellas   me explico   El libro habla  principalmente  de como unos seres conocidos como los Vogons  que ademas de haber sido desfavorecidos por la evolucion son tambien leen y escriben poesia de una forma terrible  destruyen el planeta tierra argumentando que el  aviso  sobre dicha destruccion ha estado presente en la distancia inmediata desde hace al menos cincuenta anos  Ford  un amigo de Arthur  es un extraterrestre que se ha quedado varado en la tierra por 15 anos y es tambien un investigador de la fabulosa Guia del Viajero Intergalactico  Ford sabe de antemano que la tierra sera destruida y advierte a Arthur  Justo antes de la destruccion ambos son abducidos por una de las naves de los Vogons  Ahi son torturados con una de las declamaciones poeticas del capitan de la nave y luego son lanzados al espacio  Ahi son rescatados en exactamente 29 segundos por Zaphod  Tricia y Marvin  Zaphod esta buscando un mitico planeta llamado Magrathea  el cual encuentran y exploran  Magrathea solia ser un planeta en el cual los magnates ricachones del espacio encargaban planetas personales  luego pagaban una gran cantidad de dinero y los habitantes de Magrathea construian el planeta  Cuando Arthur y compania llegan al planeta esta vacio  Sin embargo se enteran de que en ese momento sus habitantes estan despertando  Uno de esos habitantes  que obtuvo un premio por hacer las costas de Noruega  los lleva a conocer a los seres pandimensionales que habian encargado originalmente la creacion de la tierra  Estos seres son nada mas y nada menos que los ratones blancos  La razon por la cual habian construido la tierra era para averiguar cual era la pregunta cuya respuesta daria el significado de la vida  el universo y todo lo demas  Lo que habia sucedido es que despues de 7 5 millones de anos en los cuales una computadora habia meditado la pregunta  dio como respuesta la fabulosa suma de  42   Entonces era el trabajo de los ratones saber cual era la pregunta para entender el significado de la respuesta  La tierra  sin embargo  fue destruida cinco minutos antes de que los ratones lograran conocer la pregunta  Entonces requerian el cerebro de Arthur  unico sobreviviente actual de la tierra  para completar sus investigaciones  Arthur y compania escapan de Magrathea  despues de una serie de sucesos que es mejor que lean en el libro  y se van al Restaurante del fin del Universo Ese es mi resumen de las 215 paginas del libro Una de las cosas que son notables de la escritura de Douglas Adams es la forma en que combina los extractos de la Guia del Viajero Intergalactico con lo que sucede en la historia  y la forma en que ambas cosas estan ligadas en todo sentido  Su descripcion de los sucesos y de los personajes es meticulosa pero sin llegar a ser aburrida  y todos los acontecimientos terminan siendo  de un modo u otro  una puerta abierta para la comedia  Debo decir que la comedia britanica es una de mis favoritas  ya que es mucho mas inteligente que la comedia norteamericana  pero son estilos diferentes y mejor lo dejamos hasta ahi El lenguaje del libro es bastante amplio  y aunque al principio pense que era un libro dedicado enteramente a los ninos  hablamos de ninos con edades entre 7 y 14 anos   tiene bastantes pasajes que son claramente identificables como material para mayores de quince anos  Eso lo hace mejor Debo decir que el final fue algo seco y falto de emocion  Se espera mas del final de un libro tan bueno  pero por mas que le doy vueltas al asunto eso no le quita ningun merito  Es una de esas lecturas que te mantiene entretenido y expectante  Es dificil dejarlo a un lado  Y cuando despues de un par de dias terminas con la lectura  te encuentras esperando mas  Lo considero extremadamente recomendable  Ahora me encuentro esperando pacientemente para leer el segundo libro de la serie  llamado  El Restaurante al Final del Universo   Les dejare saber mi opinion en cuanto lo lea Saludos Ject  After you have been reading for a while  there comes a point when there is certain degree of predictability in books  With this book  you will plunge into something which is totally different and as curiosity beckons you to turn one page after another  you are taken through a journey that is quite unlike anything you have even imagined  The book  in my opinion  is a sheer genius because thinking up the whole tale and making sense out of nothing while still having a fantastic narration is not an easy thing to do  What s more  there is a fair amount of humor in it and even though it is a tad nerdy  it makes the book immensely enjoyable  I loved this one  I hope the remaining two in the series are as good  The best part of the book remains that there is almost entirely no point to it and that in itself is a wonder because the writer pulled this book off amazingly well   2014 The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams  kindle own w  iTunes audio  5I ve seen the movie quite a few times and have enjoyed it  It has a lot of actors that I really liked  And I tried reading the book a few times last year  I found it funny  but very slow  So this time I read it along with the audiobook read by Stephen Fry  I guess I needed that little help because I don t often read science fiction books about space travel  aliens  and so on  I like the movies  but reading them isn t as often Stephen Fry did a really great job on the audiobook reading  I felt that the beginning skipped around in a way that made it slow  I did not like Zaphod Beeblebrox at first  I liked him in the movie  well only because of Sam Rockwell   After first meeting Zaphod  the story picked up  There was some science talk that I wasn t interested in  So it was good that I was also listening to the audiobook in order to push past that  And there is eventually a much quicker  simpler meaning told after the science talk Arthur Dent and Marvin are still my favorites  And even with Stephen Fry s audio  I still imagined them as Martin Freeman and Alan Rickman  And I thought the book was a bit more funny than the movie was  I loved the ending  small spoiler   which was a little different than the movie s ending  So a slight surprise  And really hilarious  spoiler I have both the Ultimate Hitchhiker s hardcover book  collection of 5 books   And the first book in kindle format with a question  answer bit with the cast from the movie  And then the appendix  The interviews were nice  but really long  Had to be about 20 questions for the casts  It was just something nice to read once  I don t think I ll be reading the Q A for the movie again  I would watch the movie again And I am looking forward to reading the second book  With the audio of course Hitchhiker s Guide   Space   it says   is big  Really big  You just won t believe how vastly hugely mind bogglingly big it is  I mean  you may think it s a long way down the road to the chemist  but that s just peanuts to space  Listen        and so on   One of my favorite books I have ever read  When I was younger my parents struggled to get me to read anything besides comic books  Every summer I would receive a required reading list for the upcoming school year and this title appeared on it  My Dad brought home the book for me and told me I had to read it  no excuses  So I begrudgingly stomped up the stairs to my room and began reading  After just a few pages I was hooked  A lot of people complain about how random and weird the plot line is  but that is what drew me in  Up until that time I had never read anything so different and interesting  Since then I have probably read it about a dozen times  my copy is  well loved    This book also taught me some very good lessons  1  always have a towel with you 2  Don t Panic 3  the answer to the world and everything is 42  42   A towel   the original Babelfish   Don t Panic If the above did not make sense to you remove the rock walk calmly to the nearest library or bookstore and ask someone there to point you in the right direction  Be wary of reading in public while drinking as can lead to moments of spurting embarrassment  Adams  spins the planet on his middle finger as if he were a basketball star  he is definitely a Globetrotter  I found his escapade to be extremely entertaining  laugh able  and intellegent  it is an existential comedy  a very small genre   I left the short novel thinking that we should not take ourselves so seriously  I left it thinking that perspective is everything  so make it a comic one   I left it thinking that we are the odds on favorite to enjoy this corner of space until something better comes along  Reading it gives me permission to re phrase my questions about life and for this  I will be forever grateful  or at least until I die   One of the quirkiest books I ve ever read  The series is wonderful  but rarely exceeds the quality of this first installment  It should be required reading for every 8th grade boy   Perfect Description of Earth  MOSTLY HARMLESS I first heard the radio version  and then the LP record version  yes this was a long time ago  before I read the book  Recently I had my daughter read it and she thought it was the funniest book she d read  I decided to re read it and it still holds up as hysterically funny some 35 years later  Once you ve read HHGTTG you ll never read science fiction the same way again  Excellent  The first time I read this  I was in seventh grade and had no developed sense of humor    I also wasn t aware that it was supposed to be a humorous book  thought it was shit  and left it at that  I m really  really happy I decided I didn t trust my seventh grade self  It s supremely witty  the characters are fun  and distinct    the tone is clever and effervescent    I can t find much bad to say about it  I m pretty sure I ll read it about a zillion more times  That s about it   Thoroughly enjoyed this  Picked up a copy for 50p so well worth that investment  It was always on my intending to read list   now I ll definitely endeavour to read the rest of the series  I was not expecting to laugh as much as I did or recognise much of the content which has now passed into British pop culture   the whole Babelfish translator etc Fantastic read but the least said about the film the better    I remember watching the 2005 movie when I was 14  I found it absolutely ridiculous  and I vowed never to watch it again  Fast forward 9 years  and  with a little goading from my girlfriend  I rewatched it  and  while still ridiculous  I loved it  Someone bought me the book  and I m hooked  If anyone wants to buy me The Restaurant at the End of the Universe  feel free    How could anyone not like this book  It s a spoof  of course  but a damn good one  I ll not rehash a very familiar story  but what I liked best was the wring  It is a terrible matter of fact tone  Depressed robots  Volgons  mice  all sorts of neat characters and plot twists  but mostly just plain fun   I read this book about 51 017 times when I was in seventh grade  I wore my copy out  That was a time in my life when I very much would have preferred to belong to some alien species  trapped here through no fault of my own  Also   The ships hung in the air in much the same way that bricks don t   How can you improve on writing like that  Q  What s so bad about being drunk A  Just ask a glass of water  ahhh  good times   Not enough books are The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy  If you like sci fi  you re a nerd  If you like The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy  then your a nerd with good taste  If you haven t read this book and it s sequels  your life has been a huge waste of time so far  One of my favorite books   would recommend to anyone This whole series made me smile endlessly  I am not a fan of science fiction in general but a friend mentioned loving this book so I gave it a try  So funny and off the wall with some poignant moments  I proceeded to read all of Douglas Adams books which are very similar  It s a quick and easy read and very fun   Okay  I love this story  Discovered it in the 80s I was very young and that book still sits on my shelves now  I ve re read it maybe a dozen times over the years and it still makes me laugh  The characters and situations are so bizarre  yet so relatable  and I think that s what makes it so good  A truly fantastic novel  ahead of its time in many of its jokes and references which make it all the more hilarious to see modern day examples of the annoyances experienced with the advanced technology of the galaxy  This is one of the most hilarious and relevant books i have read to date We join our protagonist  Arthur Dent  as he is fighting bulldozers and workmen intent on destroying his cottage on the councils orders to build a new motorway  But as his best friend of five years turns up for a chat  not all is as it seems  Arthur is quickly lost in the business of hitchhiking across the galaxy with the help of some strangers and an electronic book whose best piece of advice is  Don t Panic   we are taken on an inter planetary adventure like no other  We meet an exciting array of characters  interesting planets  weird alien customs and more Although this book is best aimed at sci fi fans  i would encourage anyone to give it a go  I guarantee you will smile throughout  One of my bestest and favourite est books of all  Inspires me and enlivens me  Like no one else  is Douglas Adams  So deep and thoutfhful yet such silly nonsense  all in the same few sentences of his genius writings  If you haven t heard the Stephen Fry read audiobook edition  do yourself a favor and go find a copy now  You won t regret it Witty  silly  outrageous  This is what we ape descendant  carbon based bipedal life forms recognize as good comedy  and Douglas Adams   The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  is just that  Good comedy  When the President of the Galaxy decides it best to demolish Earth in favor of a super space highway  the Earth is officially screwed  What a fantastic idea for a story  and it doesn t disappoint  The wacky adventures of Arthur Dent and his alien friend disguised as a human  Ford Prefect  provoke plenty of gut busting laughs and will leave you wanting more  Luckily  there are two more books in the series  I somehow missed this book  originally published in 1979  Perhaps I was just  too old  to read science fiction  but finally I understand what all the hype was about  The main character  Arthur Dent  is rescued by his  human  friend Ford Prefect just before the earth is demolished to make way for a galactic freeway  Ford has been living on earth  masquerading as an out of work actor  doing research for the manual  The Hitchhiker s Guide   The two journey to the planet Magrathea  try to convince bored and depressed Marvin the paranoid android not to kill them  insult some extremely intelligent mice  and seek to find the question computer Deep Thought has answered  That answer is  42   but there is only one question  Brilliant  A fun read  The kind of book you would pick up while sun bathing on a beach  Immediately lightens up your mood by making you feel puny and insignificant and amused and happy   For those of you who have read this book  or those who haven t gotten to it yet  try the audio version of the book narrated by Stephen Fry  What a treat to have such a wonderful comedic actor interpret Adams  amazingly hilarious story  It s the perfect summer read  Go to the library and literally check it out  Taken imagination to the next level  esilarante  Themes  absurdity  probability  Intergalactic Gargle BlastersQuotes  Time is an illusion  Lunchtime doubly so   Isn t it enough to see that a garden is beautiful without having to believe that there are fairies at the bottom of it too    All through my life I ve had this strange unaccountable feeling that something was going on in the world  something big  even sinister  and no one would tell me what it was   No   said the old man   that s just perfectly normal paranoia  Everyone in the Universe has that    In those days spirits were brave  the stakes were high  men were real men  women were real women and small furry creatures from Alpha Centauri were real small furry creatures from Alpha Centauri    Now it is such a bizarrely improbable coincidence that anything so mind bogglingly useful could have evolved purely by chance that some thinkers have chosen to see it as the final and clinching proof of the non existence of God The argument goes something like this   I refuse to prove that I exist    says God   for proof denies faith  and without faith I am nothing   But   says Man   The Babel fish is a dead giveaway  isn t it  It could not have evolved by chance  It proves you exist  and so therefore  by your own arguments  you don t  QED   Oh dear   says God   I hadn t thought of that   and promptly vanishes in a puff of logic  Oh  that was easy   says Man  and for an encore goes on to prove that black is white and gets himself killed on the next zebra crossing    LOVE IT  Harlig boka att dromma sig bort med   Aqui esta el origen de un monton de chistes nonos que simplemente pululan en la sabiduria colectiva  Don t Panic Este libro es comedia pura  desde los chistes  los dialogos hasta la narracion  Metaforas como  Las naves flotaban del mismo modo que los ladrillos no  explican muy bien las sensaciones mientras mantienen al lector entretenido  El problema que trae esto  es que la trama en si se pierde en la comedia  Cuando termina el libro no se siente como un fin  sigues esperando que algo ocurra  que el chiste continue  Este libro entrega tanto  que te deja con gusto a poco Me gusta particularmente la posicion que toma la humanidad en todo este libro  Una muestra tragicomica del lugar que tenemos en el universo  Dos palabras en la guia mas fidedigna en existencia  Los problemas que tiene el personaje principal para adaptar su mente a la vastidad del universo  Lo dificil que es entender la destruccion de la tierra  las distancias  los tiempos  las probabilidades  el infinito  la vida  el universo y todo  This story is as good as a Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster  but comes without the hangover  Full of British flavored humor  outlandish adventures  and absurdly creative nonsense  the hitchhikers guide is a book that all Sci Fi lovers should love  or  if not for the love  at least read in order to cure one s head of a much needed scratching   It s a cult classic for nerds  because these are just the sort of cults that nerds get involved in  Sure  by stepping into such a improbable plot you void some of the more or less important laws of physics  but that is precisely what improbability drives are for  I m a big fan of SCIENCE fiction  with  science  in all caps  if you missed that    because I like the science part    but I ve been happy to let my reason slip away for this fun story  and was rewarded with imagination fuel If nothing else  I ve learned one of the most important things in the galaxy  I no longer forget to bring my towel anywhere that I might need it  Not much needs to be said about one of the great works of comedic imagination of the 20th century  It s silly  outlandish  non sensical  occasionally incoherent  and very  very funny  It s also subtlely profound in all kinds of unexpected ways about how silly  outlandish  non sensical and occasionally incoherent humanity can often become  A science fiction classic that may have more in common with Monty Python than Isaac Asimov  it is something that everyone with an appreciation for the ludicrous should read at some point in their lives  I have much love for this book  much love  I think  however  that a lot of it has built up over the course of thinking  talking about  and referring to it  In some ways  I think HHGG is like Star Wars   a story that I remember from the telling as much as from the experience  I was interested to read this book again in part because I m preparing to teach a course on science fiction  specifically on the influence of science fiction on our modern world  but also to see if it would hold up as A Wrinkle in Time did not  Thank my towel  it did indeed My enjoyment of Hitchhiker s guide to the Galaxy stems as much from the memories of reading it the first time  I should say  listening to it  Like the history of the book itself  I first came into the story through the radio series  My best friend at the time  where are you  Chris Murphy   and I sat around a little record player and listened to a funny little science fiction story with an awesome and anthemic opening theme  and laughed at humor that appealed to the 12 13 year olds we were  I think  at some point  we both read the books  in between putting paper plates on Chris  bedroom wall in an approximation of the interior of the TARDIS   why wouldn t my parents let me do cool stuff like that     but they didn t come into play until much later Rather  Hitchhiker s guide to the Galaxy became an in joke between Chris and me  I  oh piss off grammar nazis  for as long as it took to realize that Hitchhiker s guide to the Galaxy was an in joke for all manner of nerds  and that in fact  we were nerds  We never passed up a chance to say  Beeblebrox  or any other proper noun from the stories  again  I can t say novel because it just as likely could have come from the radio plays   or to notice how frequently the number 42 comes up in real life  seriously  have you noticed that  it s everywhere      I wouldn t read the books again until years later  as a summer camp counselor who was having trouble feeling socially comfortable around the other staff  and did what nerds usually do   retreat to their room for extending reading sessions  I think I finished the series  at the time  just four books  again before I finally emerged and made another of my long time friends  Georgia It wasn t until just now  or at least a couple hours ago  that I read Hitchhiker s guide to the Galaxy with any attention to the work itself  as literature  or even as science fiction  And what I realized is  it holds up  And it works  perhaps not as literature  whatever the hell that is  but certainly as good  quality science fiction  Going into it  I wondered if  like Shaun of the Dead  it was a comic entry into the genre only masquerading as a satire  and I realized that to be the case quite quickly  HHGG is no satire  Yes  ti does make fun of things  but only in the  ideas exploring  way that any science fiction does  Well  maybe not make fun of   hold on  Let me start again  The observations this speculative fiction makes is only different from more traditional science fiction in the fact that it often is very  very funny  Other than that  not satire  In fact  it meets my simplified criteria for science fiction  in that it tackles an idea  where we come from and why  among others  but I tend to focus on the metaphysical  that can t be done in any other genre Wow  My head is aching from how bad this writing is  I feel like I m getting dumber by the second  My head really does hurt  so I m going to go have a quick nap  Hitchhiker s guide to the Galaxy is very good  still  And in its own right  My 15 YO son is currently reading the whole collection for the first time  I remembered how much fun they were to read the first time through   The ship hovered much unlike the way bricks do when thrown    Ode to a lump of small green putty I found in my armpit one midsummer s morning  and  Don t panic   will forever be a part of me  After re reading Catcher in the Rye and not enjoying it nearly as much as I remembered enjoying it  I decided to give one of these a try  I m happy to report that it is every bit the joy that I remember  So pick this up and don t forget your towel  Classic Douglas Adams  Captivating imaginative humor  Don t watch the movie  La satira y la ciencia ficcion unidas  Nunca hubiera dicho que juntar viajes espaciales con premisas y acontecimientos absurdos pudiera dar lugar a una novela tan soberanamente genial  Hacia tiempo que esperaba un libro que me llenara como este    Y aunque no sea una novela para pensar no quita merito a la critica que se esconde entre chiste y chiste  Una narrativa peculiar  una historia entretenida e infinitamente imaginativa y no demasiado compleja y una dosis de humor  llevan este libro a mis imprescindibles  Pero es una coincidencia extranamente improbable el hecho de que algo tan impresionante util pueda haber evolucionado por pura casualidad  y algunos pensadores han decidido considerarlo como la prueba definitiva e irrefutable de la no existencia de Dios  Su argumento es mas o menos el siguiente  Me niego a demostrar que existo  dice Dios  porque la demostracion anula la fe y sin fe no soy nada  Pero  dice el hombre  el pez Babel es una revelacion brusca   no es asi  No pudo haber evolucionado al azar  Demuestra que Vos existis y por lo tanto  segun Vuestros propios argumentos  Vos no  Quod erat demonstrandum  Valgame Dios   dice Dios  no habia pensado en eso  Y subitamente desaparece en un soplo de logica   Read it carefully or you ll miss something   An absolutely brilliant book  Douglas Adams  writing style had a bite to it like no other  and I distinctly recall this being the first book that really revealed the possibility of a book that made you laugh while also carrying out an intricate story  The amazing thing of the novel is  while it is hilarious  there is an actual heart in the midst of the absurdity of it all  some larger message  The point I m trying to make without saying too much is this  if you read a book that leaves you feeling down  pick this book  and soon thereafter  yourself  up  After hearing wonderful things about this book for so long  I decided to see for myself  Overall the book is very funny  So funny that I caught myself laughing out loud on more than one occasion  If you are looking for substance and a complicated storyline then look elsewhere  However  if you just want to relax and spend some time with a good book then GO GET IT  Loved the book  Extremely funny  This always has been one of my favorite books and more read through it only affirmed that  Adams had such a way with describing things that even when he was talking about the Arcturian MegaDonkey I felt as if I could at least sort of imagine what it looked like  Or at least understand why Arthur was so confused by everything  The story is short but the pacing makes sense somehow  or at least as much as the Infinite Improbability Drive does  which is to say not very much  And I will always love the characters so much  From Arthur  who only really just wants a cup of tea to Marvin  the paranoid android  Will definitely re read this book plenty more times as it always provides me with a laugh when I need it   Rereading for fun this summer   I forgot how funny it is  The hitchhicker s guide to the galaxy aka  the guide   One of those books that is brilliant and life altering and a gateway to new friends in highschool or college and a little lame sounding when you read it later  Eminently quotable  highly enjoyable and who can t like a trilogy in five parts  POssibly better written are the long dark teatime of the soul because the author was not hopped up on drugs great read  Make sure the kids read it   Incomparable  Probably my favorite book of all time  Absolute comedic genius  This is funny and ridiculous  Silly and very entertaining  This was incredible  Witty  ridiculous  yet brilliant    I wish I could read it for the first time over and over again  This is definitely an instant favourite of mine  hilarious story  full of goofy and amusing concepts and situations  There are so many out there ideas and random situations that draws the unsuspecting characters through the universe  the writing style is very relaxed and matter of fact  I also recommend the others in the  trilogy  but don t expect a clear simple straight forward plot through the series  It is absurd and I loved it  There are very few books that I will read again and consider classics  This is one of them  This time I listened to the audiobook read by Stephen Fry  Since he is the only person alive who knows the question behind the answer  I loved it  Now off to watch the movie   This book is a full scale riot  I never knew such heavy subjects as deep space  the meaning of life  death  the human condition  the farthest reaches of space and time  probability  statistics  astro physics  depression  the end of the world  and the number 42  could be taken so lightly  But that is the art of this book  it all goes down so smooth  Each mini story in this already mini novel is so packed with goodness you won t waste a minute of your time reading it   Frabaer humor sem eg fila og  augljoslega  geggjadar hugmyndir   Bastante amigable el libro para lectores no tan expertos en lectura  trata temas de bastante interes y muy divertidos  cuando dice una palabra o un tema que el lector desconoce el libro se toma tiempo para explicarlo en ese mismo momento  Viene de lo simple a lo complicado sin burlarse del lector al ir a buen paso Esta es tan solo la primera parte de una serie de libros  solo he leido este pero quiero tener los demas cuanto antes  This book is off the wall  but in the very serious era of which we live  that s a good thing  The book is wonderful  I read it in two days  laughing the entire time  Moreover  I found myself rooting for the characters and thinking that some seriously deep concepts were shrouded underneath the hilarity of the book  like  the answer to everything  and a certain    drive  With fun characters and far reaching plot  this book was a definite fun read  A sci fi comedy classic  Made me become a book reader  Wer kennt das Buch nicht  Ich  Ja  ich oute mich  Ich habe zwar die Verfilmung schon ofters gesehen und ich finde sie echt gut und witzig  Aber das Buch habe ich bisher noch nicht gelesen  Daher nutze ich die Chance und lauschte seit langem mal wieder einem Horbuch  Ein Ausschlag gebender Grund fur mich  war hier der Sprecher Christian Ulmen  Ich habe immer Probleme  Horbuchern meine Aufmerksamkeit zu widmen  Viel zu leicht lasse ich mich ablenken  Daher habe ich gehofft  dass Christian Ulmen mir bei diesem  Problem  helfen wird Und ich wurde nicht enttauscht  Denn Herr Ulmen versteht es durch seine Stimme  jedem einzelnen Charakter seinen entsprechenden Charme zu verleihen  Dadurch wirkte dieses Horbuch sehr lebendig und ich musste an vielen Stellen wirklich herzhaft lachen  Und es ist fur mich bewundernswert  dass der Sprecher bei der Anzahl der Stimmen nicht durcheinander kam  Am besten gefiel mir die  Vertonung  von  Zephod Beeblebrox   dessen Stimmencharakter mich sehr an Udo Lindenberg erinnerte  Diese Coolness und  Mir doch Egal was passiert  Haltung in der Stimme  war einfach klasse Mir gefiel auch die Story  die hinter diesem Kult Roman steckt  Douglas Adams scheint ein wirrer Mann gewesen zu sein  Schon der Film spriesst vor skurrilen Humor  aber das Buch ubertrifft nochmal alles  Diese Wortakrobatik  die hier zu finden ist  ist einfach genial und findet keinen Vergleich Mir hat dieses Horbuch meine Fahrt zur Arbeit tagtaglich versusst und mich ordentlich vom Arbeitsalltag abgelenkt  Es ist eine tolle Mischung aus skurrilen Charakteren  einen lustigen Schreibstil und einem Sprecher  der diese Kult Geschichte gekonnt vertont hat Dieses Horbuch hat meine Lust nach Horbucher wieder erweckt   Per Anhalter durch die Galaxis  ist eine lustig skurrile Geschichte  die man nicht uberall findet  Christian Ulmen hat auf sympathische Art und Weise die verschiedenen Charaktere zum Leben erweckt und mir den Alltag versusst  Von mir gibt es fur dieses durchaus einzigartige Horbuch 5 Sterne  Fun and fast paced  I feel in love with all the characters and story lines  I couldn t put it down  What is there to say  Brilliant  Amazing  Hilarious  Witty  A must read  Never had I laughed so many times while reading a book  Just read it Some awesome quotes   hold stick near centre of its length  Moisten pointed end in mouth  Insert in tooth space  blunt end next to gum  Use gentle in out motion   it seemed to me   said wonko the sane   that any civilization that had so far lost its head as to need to include a set of detailed instructions for use in a packet of toothpicks was no longer a civilization in which I could live and stay sane   but the reason I call myself by my childhood name is to remind myself that a scientist must also be absolutely like a child  If he sees a thing  he must say that he sees it  whether it was what he thought he was going to see or not  See first  think later  then test  But always see first  Otherwise you will only see what you were expecting   God  this guy was a genius  SO good Didn t love the bonus  Making of the Movie   a bit too dense in the weeds with names of industry muckety mucks at times  ala a boring awards acceptance speech  but other parts were quite interesting  Especially the Deschanel  Nighy  and Kirkpatrick interviews  1  Remember where your towel is 2  Avoid Vogons 3  Be excellent to each other  and PARTY ON DUDES  One of those things just doesn t belong here  one of those things wasn t in the book  If you know which one doesn t belong here  I will buy you a Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster  You are indeed floopy  Through a rip in the space time continuum  this book carried me a lot of the way through my teen years  I loved it  What could be more wonderful than Douglas Adams s tongue in cheek humor  Not much I know  Though laughing at human beings and their mind numbing way of life  he is neither cruel nor patronizing  just perceptive and laughing at us all as if he were laughing at himself  The British movie of this book is is a wonderful view as well The earth is about to end due to a need for the equivalent of a intergalactic freeway  Arthur Dent is snatched off its surface minutes before and begins a weird and wonderful tour of the galaxy  The irony and idiocy of our own race is mirrored in the strange creatures Arthur meets and the activities in which they re engaged  Just plain fun  I loved this book  I plan on reading the others  He is just so quirky and random  but hysterical and smart  It s a fast and easy read  but don t read it if you lack imagination  Your mind needs to be limber for this  One of most hilarious books I have ever read  I thought this book was a stand alone book  being little bummed by the ending in all  Thinking to myself   such a great book  but what a lame ending   Then I realized it is part of series  So  now I guess I need to find other books read it with great delight     Easily becoming one of my favorites  Molto piu bello del filmHo comprato questo libro dopo aver visto il film  perche quello mi e piaciuto molto e devo dire che il libro e stato molto piu bello e dettagliato del film  come accade quasi sempre Certo  alcune frasi sono riportate alla precisione  anche perche sono davvero cartatteristiche  La storia e fantastica  se vi piacciono i racconti di fantascienza e vi piacciono i racconti divertenti  questo e davvero un libro da leggere  Omg amazing how did I ever miss this as a child  So excited to read the rest of the series  A super imaginative and impressively extensive yet thoroughly comical universe that made me chuckle 9 10 times  Bonus points for awesome names and hilarious allegories I haven t been using a towel for a while No    That s not a good way to start a review    As a matter of fact it s not a good way to start anything    Let s start again I haven t been using a towel for a while  That might say a lot about me  or nothing at all  It might imply on an improper body odor  It might mean that I m unprotected  exposed to most of the horrible things in this universe  It might say that I simply need to reread the Hitchhiker s Guide  So here I am  rereading this amazingly witty book  remembering how awesome it used to be before the awful production of the movie from 2005  my God  what was they thinking     Honestly  If you are a book lover  there s no way you won t appreciate this life changing towel abusing book  It is probably the ultimate novelized Monty Python esque book  the epitome of humor in literal history  And the strangest thing about it  It grows Now  I know what you re thinking    It grows     with a wtf facial expression  But yes  my friends  it grows  When I was reading it as a child it was this small  And it seems that the more I age  so it grows bigger   the author of this review takes no responsibility over misinterpretations of the word  it   and honestly think that you should get your head examined   Seriously   this book gets finer with age  funnier  wittier  and absolutely more fantastic  I do not think I laughed as hard as I do now when I previously read it  Now it seems that every line knocks me down to the floor  standing over me with a bully pleased expression and saying    Wimp  should have worn a towel  To conclude  a terribly hard thing for me to do btw  I seriously recommend a proper shower  But only if you have a towel  Or at least a good book to take your mind off the fact that you are about to take the trip of a lifetime  completely nude  What can be said about this book  Perhaps the most fun I ve ever had reading  To use the language of the book   the biggest bang since the big one   I can t think of any book that has made me pause and laugh uncontrollably besides this series  Adams truly is a master of satire  THGTTG being his flagship  Make no mistake though  this book is not just humor  it has more substance than most books I ve read  truly a multidimensional masterpiece  I won t even bother to give a summary  you must merely read it for yourself  Thanks again to Daniel for this fine book  This book was hilarious   Super weird but I got it  Everything made sense to me which is weird because I don t get weird books The movie followed this book fairly closely  I was timeless and thanks for all the fish  I found this book again when I was cleaning out my keeper collection  I bought this edition in 1982  when I was in eighth grade  It s funny to see my messy  childish scrawl inside the cover But that s irrelevant to the review of the book itself  This is one of the greatest humor series I ve ever read  and it holds up beautifully to the passage of time  I found myself cracking up all through this baby  Hence the fact that I ve kept my copy all of these years  I think that everything that I d like to say someone has already wrote below  This is an awesome book  It was my cup of tea  All these thing like Deep Thought  mice  dolphins  towels  And Marvin  I ve loved it since the first pages  I could compare it with Pratchett s Discword novels  it s a kind of similar sence of humour  but I don t want to do that  I love them both and both are different genres  So this is the funnies science fiction I ve ever read   This is just hands down one of the best  and I would argue most important  books ever written  I reread it every couple of years   Love this book  Ford Prefect  which for the longest time I thought was perfect  was one of my first fictional characters crushes  Such great geekinesss in the book  It s priceless Sensacional  Inteligentissimo   Outrageously Funny   Clever  DON T PANIC Expect clever  flippant science fiction satire as well as The Answer to the Great Question Of Life  the Universe and Everything  view spoiler   It s 42   hide spoiler  The The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is the first novel of the  Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  Trilogy that contains five books Douglas Adams has a whimsical writing style and he piles up one liners upon witted dialogue  and ridiculous  nerdy humor with superb skill I love all the absurd ways he unfolded the story  I enjoyed the  journey  the most and didn t mind that the plot was not that ample and rather childish There s some pretty wacky stuff that s burnt into my brain forever because of this book  like the record of the whale s thoughts from the moment it began its life till the moment it ended it  It s really hard to pick up just one quote to showcase  here s a few  I like the cover   he said   Don t Panic  It s the first helpful or intelligible thing anybody s said to me all day  You know   said Arthur   it s at times like this  when I m trapped in a Vogon airlock with a man from Betelgeuse  and about to die of asphyxiation in deep space that I really wish I d listened to what my mother told me when I was young   Why  what did she tell you   I don t know  I didn t listen   Ford   he said   you re turning into a penguin  Stop it  The last ever dolphin message was misinterpreted as a surprisingly sophisticated attempt to do a double backwards somersault through a hoop whilst whistling the  Star Sprangled Banner   but in fact the message was this  So long and thanks for all the fish For a moment  nothing happened Then  after a second or so  nothing continued to happen  Almost  but not quite  entirely unlike tea   Quick  to the favorite shelf  BEST  BOOK  EVER   4 5 Divnejsiu  ironickejsiu a zaroven vtipnejsiu knihu som v zivote necitala    neviem  co k tomu viac dodat okrem toho  ze mam podozrenie nato  ze Douglas Adams berie nejake drogy   D i have loved this book since i first read it back in middle high school and it has remained with me all through the years since   not only hilariously funny and an adventure romp of the highest order  but a biting social commentary with much wisdom that remains applicable today   i have not revisited in many years  but it was nominated and voted for the BOM for June and so i am excited to be picking it up again after so long and will do a further review after a fresh re read   everyone else in my reading group so far has hated this   i actually listened to it as an audio this time  and i still love it after all these years   i have speculated that part of the disconnect for some folks is that it is very  Brit  in the type of humor it displays   we  Yanks  don t always  get  it   i also think perhaps people do not realize that the book  the entire series  in fact  is meant to be something of a spoof on what we as a race  human  and a culture  western civ   make such a to do over while ignoring the things that should inform us as a society   remains on my favs of all time list and my rating stands at a full 5    If I could have one thing undone in life  it would be to have read this book  Only then could I have the joy of reading it for the first time all over again I love The HitchHiker s Guide To The Galaxy and can perhaps be considered slightly obsessed with it If you like the book I recommend the original radio theater  Especially the first six parts Remember Towel Day 25th May  Negli anni settanta c era una certa abitudine a fare l autostop  come si dice  erano altri tempi  Si incontravano spesso ragazzi e ragazze con il pollice fuori o il cartello che indicava la direzione desiderata  Io allora ero teenager e con una mia amica  nell estate del  73  ci siamo fatte scarrozzare in giro per l Italia chiedendo passaggi  viaggiando su auto  camion e a volte facendo lunghi percorsi a piedi  La cosa non ci spaventava piu di tanto perche cosi facevan tutti e lo stesso Bob Dylan invitava a fare l esperienza   How many roads must a man walk down      Il Fattore di Improbabilita ci ha portate in cima al trampolino di salto con gli sci di Cortina d Ampezzo e a dormire nella sala dei telefoni della stazione Termini di Roma  ma anche a regalare una sveglia ad un orologiaio di La Spezia  Situazioni strane Gli eroi di Guida galattica per gli autostoppisti si trovano in situazioni altrettanto bizzarre  un po  piu estreme delle mie oserei dire  catapultati  nel vero senso della parola  in Universi dove il Fattore di Improbabilita gioca in questo modo  Quelli che studiano la complessa interazione di cause ed effetti nella storia dell Universo  dicono che questo genere di cose succede continuamente  ma che noi siamo impossibilitati ad impedirlo   Cosi e la vita  dicono Cercano qualcosa  No  Hanno uno scopo  No  Si pongono domande  No  Sono altri che hanno gia una risposta da spendere a cui devono trovare a tutti i costi una domanda plausibile  I piu saggi ritengono che quella di Dylan vada piu che bene Lettura divertente  It s just quirky and fun   I can remember the first time that I ever cracked open The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  It was one of the fondest moments of my life  and I have taken the opportunity to relive it many times over the intervening years  People generally either love or hate the H2G2  trilogy   and I firmly fall into the former category  There is nothing that I didn t love in this  the first volume of the series  It had everything I was looking for  puns  absurd humor  space travel  aliens  adventure  The first time I read it  my young mind couldn t have asked for more Over the years as I would pick it up and re read it from time to time I found different reasons to like it  Yes  it was still absurd and punny  but it is also smart satire which appealed to me more as I grew up  This book really does have something for everyone  and I highly recommend it  If I were Zaphod Beeblebrox  I would give this three thumbs up  Since I am not  you will have to settle for two thumbs and a big toe  Adams e un genio  Avevo sempre sentito parlare di guida galattica per autostoppisti  e mi aspettavo una bella serie di libri ma  accidenti  non e possibile concepire un tale libro prima di averlo letto  Divertente  intrigante  ambiguo e a modo suo profondo  Veramente un capolavoro   This is either  a  The best weird book I have ever read b  The weirdest good book I have ever readDepending on the chapter  page  sometimes the sentence  I vacillated between this being a  good book  and a  weird book   though whichever category it ultimately falls into  I have to admit I enjoyed it  I am not big on science fiction  Fantasy  I m great with  Science Fiction  not so much  When there s a fantasy twist  I m good  If it s a dystopian world  and the sci fi elements are secondary to the overall story  I m good  When it s straight up science fiction    my eyes start to glaze over  I m not entirely sure why    the foreign terms  The overly technical intellectual gobbledygook  to use a phrase from a friend s blog   The unending use of gargantuan numbers  Probably some mix of all of those things  though I am leaning towards the gobbledygook being the big perpetrator here  The nice thing about Hitchhiker s Guide is that  while it uses all those sci fi elements  it s a spoof  so those elements are so completely over the top that it s easy to remind myself that I don t need to understand a word of what they re saying  Because none of it makes any sense  Even if I did normally understand intellectual gobbledygook  this particular book is deliberately hyperbolic and the gobbledygook has been warped so far out of line that it becomes a part of the farce  This is Mel Brooks in written form  and it s quite clear why this  trilogy  of five books has been listed as a  must read  by just about every outlet on the planet  It s funny  Really funny  It takes jabs at our politics  science  philosophy  lifestyles and just about every other thing possible  Every time the tension starts to run high  the narrator stops and tells you how everything will work out  just so that you ll read carefully and not skip ahead to find out how things turn out   Think of The Princess Bride   She doesn t get eaten by the eels    I wanted to tell you because you look nervous   And has anybody else noticed that the Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy referenced in this book is actually a Kindle  Please  somebody comment on here or message me that they have actually read this book on their Kindle and make my day    that would be just some of the greatest irony ever  Parental Advisories  Sex 0 5  Nothing  Language 1 5  A few hellsViolence 1 5  Some laser guns are shot while some people are hiding  A robot commits suicide  Reference is made to a war several million years ago that ended when a

instructions to make an intergalactic cocktail with nonsensical ingredients  The intergalactic cocktail is drunk by several people aliens at tense times in the novel   4 5 5 A hysterical  absurd  thought provoking  however a bit short  ride  I may have had to put the book down a few times from laughter  due in large part to the heavy dose of sarcasm and matter of fact ridiculousness  Having seen the movie a few years ago I will most likely venture a second viewing  mainly for the insane casting choices  Alan Rickman was voicing Marvin in my head and it worked perfectly    Hilarious  It s been a while since I last read this  and it s even more fun than I remembered  Guys  I finally read it  Much laughter  somebody gimme the next book in the series  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is a book by Douglas Adams  It is about a man named Arthur Dent  Earth gets destroyed and he travels space with a couple of aliens named Zaphod Beeblebrox and Ford Prefect  Also traveling with them is a depressed robot named Marvin and a human girl named Trillian  I thought this book was good and I think other people should read it because it is funny  short and science y  Being a science fiction fan  this was hard not too like  What I liked most was the sarcastic attitude of the author always interjecting little comments here and there  And while the book was always satirical  I feel the author was trying to make a greater point about our own culture on a galatic scale  Even more pertinent in today s global world  A really fun read  and this book would probably be a good intro for anyone into science fiction or those who claim they don t like to read  From now on I ll leave all rooms by saying  So long  and thanks for all the fish   just    what the fuck Duh  this is one of the best books out there  I can read this each year and never tire of it  I love this book and hope everyone takes the time to read it  Funny and engaging  Book ten of the summer  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams  If mice are supremely intelligent beings doing experiments on people   were my hamsters their watered down redneck cousins   This was honestly the question the book left me with  Five out of five stars   for making me think  XD So from looking at other reviews for this book  people either love it or hate it  I love it  Adams is a funny man  and reading his books makes me laugh out loud  The narrative is a little  all over the place   which probably contributes to the big difference in opinion about it  The book chronicles the adventures of Arthur Dent  one of only two humans left after Earth is blown up to make way for a hyperspatial express route  His friend  Ford Prefect  is actually an alien  and helps Arthur get off the earth before its destruction  What follows is hilarious I recommend it  but don t hate me if you don t like  Hate your lack of a sense of humor  The book is one delicious romp  starting with Arthur Dent  a rather boring Englishman who wants one thing out of life   to save his fairly unattractive house from being demolished to make way for a new freeway  To this end  he is lying in the mud in front of a bulldozer when his friend Ford Prefect plucks him from the mud  convinces him to down several pints of beer  and helps him snag a ride onboard a Vogon ship which has just come along to demolish the Earth to make way for galactic freeway  Ford  ostensibly an out of work actor  is in reality an alien from Betelgeuse who has been doing research for a revised version of the Guide and has been waiting fifteen years for someone to come along and rescue him from this backwater little planet  He didn t really want it to be Vogon ship   after all Vogons hate hitchhikers and are likely to drop you out of an airlock if they find you  And if you re really unlucky they ll read their poetry to you first This is the story of Arthur and Prefect s adventures after they survive the horrors of Vogon poetry  oh and the demolition of a planet and being tossed out an airlock   Adventures that hook them up with Zaphod Beeblebrox  the two headed  three armed President of the Galaxy who s out for a good time and in search of something that his future self wants him to find but won t tell him about  Trillian a brilliant and beautiful woman whom Arthur tried once to pick up at a party and who knows how to fly a ship with Improbability Drive  Marvin  the paranoid android  who is so depressing he cause a space ship to commit suicide  Slartibartfast  award winning designer of fjords  two white mice in search of a question  and  briefly  a large sperm whale and a surprised bowl of petunias  What will our brave heroes learn on there journey  Why  nothing much  just the answer to Life  the Universe  and Everything  Oh wait  That s an entirely different book in the series      I absolutely loved this book when I discovered it back in high school  I thoroughly enjoyed all the witty dialogue and the outrageous adventures of our heroes  I didn t mind that there really  if you think about it much harder than you should  isn t much of a plot  When you re having so much fun imagining the events that Adams puts in front of you  you don t really notice that the story line doesn t have much of an arc  And  you know what  Over thirty years later   I still didn t notice  This is an excellent  crazy  off the wall science fiction adventure  I enjoyed every minute  First posted on my blog My Reader s Block  Please request permission before reposting  Thanks  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy seems kind of like a Discworld book that was made into sic fi and then made more logical and reasonable  Douglas takes you on a funny  lighthearted  adventure of awesomeness that I managed to read in about two hours  Nothing really makes sense  but there is enough sense to the senselessness that some kind of acceptance can take place  I can t think I can really think of anyway to sum up this book so I will just say read this book  You ve nothing to lose and everything plus 42 to gain  Earth is ruled  sorry was ruled by rats   hmmhilarious book i really love it  Just as amazing every time I read it    And to think that I actually had an opportunity to personally ask Douglas Adams a question in around 1996 on an early internet radio show    The question was  Seemingly  on every page  there is a new idea  a twist on words that spark a unique thought or perspective on something   How is it that you re able to keep twisting words and ideas in such fantastic  and many times funny  way  His response  paraphrase   When writing  he enters a Zen sort of state  where his accumulated ideas and thoughts flow    and how they come out is both about how much he head learned and read and about how hard he works at  practices at  getting into that Zen state and by writing  In essence  hard work   Fantastic book  Fantastic writer  May have forever have his towel with him on his otherworldly travels  I always carry a towel now Es el mejor libro que he leido en mucho tiempo  Maravilloso  Genial  Fantabuloso  Todo el mundo deberia leerlo   Many people I know have told me to read this book  People s whose opinions on books I respect so I should have read this earlier  but honestly  I was afraid to  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy holds such a place of honor both with my friends and with the larger world of geekdom  and I was a little worried that I might not like it and would therefore be ostracized  I even picked it up once and didn t get past the first chapter before I put it down and then wasn t really motivated to pick it back up  I ve never told anyone that before  but now that I ve read it and loved it  I feel that I can safely make that admission  Bring on the rest A Note About the Audiobook Attention  Stephen Fry is a wonderful reader  That is all  Incredibly well written and  sometimes surprisingly  hilarious   5 years and a better sense of humour later I picked up this book again and yeah believe the hype it is awesome I don t know why it took me so long to read this  It s hilarious  The ending was abrupt  I assumed my digital copy from the library was missing something  but nope  I ll definitely finish the series  This is my favorite book of all time   I had these books MEMORIZED in junior high  We just listened to the audio version of Hitchhiker s  read by Stephen Fry  this time with my junior high   high school aged daughters  Still fantastic  still funny  The girls loved it as much as I did  I had planned to look for Restaurant on audio for the next car trip  but they started reading the next ones in print  Oh well  I ll just have to get the next one on audio for myself    Without a doubt one of my favourite books ever  It s cleverly written  witty and hilarious  making you laugh out loud until you cry  all the while discussing serious issues in such a way as to provoke thoughts and considerations of our role in the universe  The entire series is highly recommendable If you haven t read it yet  go pick up a copy and do so immediately  This book was laugh out loud funny  I couldn t put it down  I don t even have a favorite part  I loved it all  The movie did not do this book any justice  I hope readers open these wonderful pages with an open mind and are ready to laugh  I always pick this book up when I need a pick me up  My cure for the blues In warning this book got me in trouble in school for laughing while I was reading  Granted I was reading during a lecture  but just a warning it truly is funny   In the beginning the universe was created  this has made a lot of people very angry and has been widely regarded as a bad mood  Where to start This story is pretty much like Marmite  you either love it or you hate it  As someone with a passion for marmite  seriously  can t get enough of the stuff   I m pretty used to having and odd taste in everything  and this book is definitely not an exception Although honestly  how can you not love a story where the world is literally destroyed to make way for a hyperspace bypass  Oh  and destroyed by Vogons  creatures who are too busy filling in forms to save their grandmothers from the ravenous bugblatter beast of traal  Oh and the fact that the only surviving humans along with a perpetually depressed computer  an alien from a small planet not far from Beetlejuice and his semi half brother  they share three of the same mothers   are dragged across the universe in search of the answer to life  the universe and everything  All of this leads to a book that captures your imagination  albeit in a very weird way  and genuinely made me laugh out loud on more than one occasion  This is possibly one of the only books where I didn t mind the plot not being given the main focus of the story  It was all about the crazy backstories of all the random characters and the information about the universe and the many worlds and people in it  Also I guess the fact that nearly every line in the book is quotable made me love it even more  I mean some lines were honestly pure GOLD  At one point Adams actually uses this sentence to describe a ship  The ship hung in the sky in much the same way that bricks don t  Maybe I m a bit weird  but in my opinion that description is hilarious So basically  if you haven t read this book   you should  If you have read this book and do not like it then honestly you probably haven t understood Adam s pure genius  If you have read this book and love it then you are a really hoopy frood and you clearly know where your towel is  okay I absolutely adore this book  the great thing about this book it is that is really easy to mistake it for just a humorous and amazing adventure  but if you do that then you completely miss Douglas Adams  witty social commentary  The story is first rate  if you only know the story from the movie then you are really missing out  I know you have heard this before  but the book is better  alot better  since the movie stunk  One of the amazing things about this book and series is that you like the characters as characters without caring one bit about them as people  Arthur is whiny and annoying  Zaphod is pompous and strange  Ford is  well Ford doesn t really care about anything and that is a little off putting as a person  But they make a fantastic cast of characters for a book  I am not a sci fi fan and can not think of another pure science fiction book that i enjoy  not one  but I love this book  Loved it    Amazing book  though the sequels arent as good  A very funny story and quite enjoyable narrative  I can see modern comedians sharing a sense of humour with the author  Awesome  Quite short though  Onto the next        It took me a long time to get around to reading this book  I m a pretty strict non fiction reader  but I adore the movie and I heard so many good things about the book that I decided to just go for it  I m so glad I did This book is random to the point that it must be the work of a true genius  It s very silly  but not trying too hard  Light and fun I just wish it was a little bit longer  Ah well  on to Restaurant at the End of the Universe I guess  I read the Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy several years ago and loved it  I found myself laughing out loud more than once  I am now listening to it on my iPhone as I exercise and enjoying it again  The version I am listening to is read by the author  Douglas Adams  and again I am laughing out loud  which can be awkward when you are around people who can t hear what I am hearing   WwwwwewwwWOOOOOOW    All I have to say about this book is I literally  LAUGHED MY ASS OFF   I re read this book after 3 long years and still found it as amusing as the first time  My favorite character of the book is the manically depressed robot  Marvin   who s depressing personality reminds me of the ever so pessimistic squintern  Dr  Fisher  played by Joel Moore  in the TV show Bones  The book starts with a gloomy prediction  that the planet earth is going to be destroyed and there is nothing we can do about it  Earlier  Arthur Dent s house is being demolished to build a bypass for city needs  Ironic is the fact that the reason why earth is being demolished is the need for a galactic bypass This book is full of hilariously ironic gems  Amusing is the fact that the rats are the actual species who commissioned the planet earth to run an experiment  while the human beings think of the mice as just their lab rats   Satire at its best When I first read this book  i just loved it  I thought it had one of the best beginnings ever  it is funny and almost poignant  gentle  While I was reading it  soon afer it was published   I had a sense that I was missing a lot of jokes because I did not know anything about physics  probability  etc  I am looking forward to reading it again and getting all the jokes  Once I asked a physicist about it  and he was visibly annoyed by the book even though he had not read it  He was kind of contemptuous of it  which was quite funny  He seemed to expect that a work of fiction should not have any poetica licencia with this matter  and  who is this Adams anyway  he had ho idea about things physics anyway                                                                      Well  I read The Ultimate Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  July 2013  again  and I was right so many years ago  The book is brilliant  and I enjoyed it immensely  With my smattering of knowledge in physics  quantum mechanics  probability and bowls of petunia  I had a ball  I read somewhere  actually Neil Gaiman s intro  where he paraphrases     Richard Dawkins who said that Adams was a genius  Well  he is was a flamboyant and brilliant genius if I ever saw one  I began learning about sciences  a couple of years or less ago   and the more I learned  the more I thought  and still think  that somehow  there should be a bridge between sciences and humanities  that they should somehow merge  I m not sure how that could be done  but when I read texts on edge org  as much as I admire these guys for their knowledge  and blahblahblah  I am painfully aware that they are often sometimes  depending on the person  missing so much because they are ignorant of history  literature  art  etc   Ignorant  not of facts  but of a deeper understanding how things fit together  an understanding that only solid knowledge of humanities  history  philosophy  literature  and art can provide   Well  to give you an example  Lee Smolin  a scientist on the bleeding edge of physics  claims that he knows enough about Marxism to dismiss it condescendingly because his grandmother was a Marxist  and had friends who were Marxist  and  in his childhood  he heard them often talking about Marxism  Helloooooo  he bases his opinion on Marxism on his grandma s thoughts and words   not that I discredit gramma  but  puhlease       That was painful to read     and he is not the only one  But  that s another topic Elem  Adams did some of that merging in this book brilliantly  I enjoyed immensely his literary  linguistics  poetic  fireworks  such an inadequate work for his bravura use of English language   I enjoyed his picaresque narrative  peregrinations of the plot  Shandyesque digressions  his jokes  allusions  quips and puns  playfulness with names  his taking modern science and stretching it like a chewing gum  his ending the book with a flourish  And than wrapping all this galactic Rabelesian matter so neatly with such a bang  and not a whisper  If I were ever to write another book  it would be on DA  But  I won t  I m having too much fun with physics and math  chemistry and astronomy at the moment  In a few more years  I ll reread The Hitchhikers Guide again  and who knows what more gems I ll find  I m looking forward to it  again psI haven t talked much about the science physics part of the book  as I am still timid talking about these things  But  while reading  I could connect so many dots and recognize so many tings I ve been reading about lately  and I enjoyed how he applied all of that in a work of fiction  It really brought science to life for me   A friend recommended to read Hitchhiker s after reading a heavy book  The book will make you laugh out loud countless times  I finished the majority of the second book in the series  The Restaurant at the End of the World  but in all honesty reading Hitchhiker s alone was satisfying to me  the rest of the series didn t make me laugh as much since i expected absurdity  Maybe taking breaks between novels is recommended  very funny   from beginning to last   very inspiring also   the writer seems to be a man standing in an extremley special place to get that intriguing view of life   highly recomended if you d like to solve the big mystery of the meaning of life   which i can give it to you in a nutshell   life is a fart   This book is awesome   review over  All jokes aside  the only reason it didn t earn ten out of ten is because Adams had a knack for missing deadlines  he once said   I love the whooshing sound they make as they fly by    and the story feels incomplete But then  it is   there are further books in the series that continue from where the action left off  and each of them is well worth reading  In this  the first book in the series  we re introduced to Arthur Dent  the eccentric Englishman with his trademark pyjamas  I m sure that we ll be hearing a lot more from him in the future    This is obviously a well known and well respected classic of the modern era  The man to whom Terry Pratchett  et al  are heirs  who may have created a genre all his own  Douglas Adams was the undisputed master of the humorous  witty  complex and incredibly gratifying sci fi esque novel  of which this first in the  trilogy  is the prime example  Funny  moving  clever  linguistically genius and un put downable in the extreme  Read this book  I read this book expecting it to be OK  I don t love science fiction  However  this book was HILARIOUS  I absolutely love it   it s one of the funniest things I ve ever read   and I m not a science math nerd by any means  If you like this one  definitely read the rest of the series   the rest are just as good  Adams  atypical writing style and humor  make this an entertaining read for anyone   even those who don t typically like reading  If you can take in his random  yet on point writing style  this is one of the most enjoyable books I ve ever read  It was also made into a not so great movie  Book 1 of 5 of a  trilogy   An absolutely rib ticklin  guide  The author takes both you and the characters on an amazing adventure across the universe  If you are keen to find out the answer to life  universe and everything   look no further  Go and grab a copy today  This book was one of those life altering reads for me  The plot line and concepts about the struggles of the human race make the book itself unique and eye opening for those who are willing to see it that way  Add on top of that  Adams  British wit and humor  and the book is an all together  well written and cleverly disguised stab at politics and society as a whole  I mean   my favorite  Not reading this book in your lifetime would be a bigger mistake than reading it and not liking it  If you do not end up liking the book  your existence is a burden on the rest of humankind  The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy is a wonderful work of satire  Aurthur and his best friend Ford Perfect travel from earth to Magrathea  and to the end of the universe  literally  it depict things in a sarcastic  humorous way that almost anyone can relate to its a quick and easy read  that everyone needs to read   What s up   I don t know   said Marvin   I ve never been there   Adams 214   very imaginative and original It was an incredible fiction novel that push your imagination limits    Always know where your towel is Vubec nejlepsi komedialni sci fi vubec  Pro kazdeho i velmi vlazneho milovnika fantastiky se jedna o povinnou cetbu  Poslouchal jsem take jako audioknihu  zdarma na soundcloudu  perfektne ctenou Stephenem Moorem  Doporucuji                                                                         I think you could not find better comedic sci fi book  It is a must read for all fantasy readers  I have also listened to audioversion  which is available free on soundcloud  perfectly narrated by Stephen Moore  I definitely recommend it   The greatest book ever  THGTTG is so much fun  I had to read it after watching the movie  If you have never read the four books in the  trilogy  and have only watched the movie please read  The  trilogy  is very enjoyable  Do not prejudge the books based on the movie  You will be missing out  Being a fan of these books for several years  I enjoyed the movie but sooooo much was lost  Every chapter of this book made me laugh  Can t wait to finish the next one  I have to say this has always been one of those books I fondly remember reading multiple times growing up  The creativity  the wordplay  the story  the ironies are all incredibly novel  fresh and so much fun  This is one of those reads that is timeless and should be on any  must read  list  If you saw the film  let me just say that was highly disappointing and you should not be discouraged from reading this book  Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy brought up some questions I ve never really had to ask myself before  like  If a tree falls in the vacuum of space and somebody is around to hear it  what is the improbability that it makes a sound   I m glad I already know the answer  but I think I found the wrong question  And I still don t know where my towel is  Such a distinctive voice as an author  beyond funny and one of the first authors that showed me that humour and excellent writing story telling did not have to be mutually exclusive I have read this book many times  seen the movie the same amount of times  but that has not changed a thing entertainment wise  This book is chock full of well rounded characters  humor  and adventure  Arthur Dent  the main character  is saved from Earth s destruction by a nasty race of aliens called Vogons  who are  clearing  Earth from the path they are making for an intergalactic highway  His savior is his friend Ford Prefect  an alien using the alias of an unemployed actor  They travel across the universe  meeting new people  and aliens species  and occasionally making enemies  This book is well written in nearly every sense of the term  a book I would recommend for all high school students with some time on their hands and a craving for humor  Definitely one if the best books I have ever read   Things I Learned From This BookA  fancy dress  party is a COSTUME party  NOT a formal affair  14y o sj did not understand why a guy with a second head disguised as a parrot would fail to stand out in a group of people dressed in tuxes and gowns The  dole queue  is not related to the stock market  Oops            Things I Realized During This Re ReadI m older than Arthur now  Last read  we were about the same age  I can no longer be described as  30ish  Fuck   Douglas Adams is one of the funniest and most clever authors ever  A comic writer like no other  Douglas Adams is by far the best author I have ever come across  and likely the best that anyone will ever come across  His writing holds up our perspective on everything under the sun  and beyond the sun as well   everything we assume to be perfectly normal  and says with great gusto  bullshit   He has  in this magnificent series  held up a mirror to all of humanity  promptly giving subtle but scathing social commentary on each and every topic he comes across  Let the reader beware  if you look closely enough  this book might just offend you and everything you hold dear  and you will thoroughly enjoy the entire experience  Compared to the movie the book was slightly anticlimactic  Even with the lack of a proper ending the book is still wonderful  So many funny things happen through out the story that can bring you to fits of laughter  I now know to carry a towel everywhere so people thing I have my gear together  I m looking forward to reading The Restaurant At The End Of The Universe because I believe breaking it into the parts is what makes it anticlimactic  One of the best books I ever read  3 This may be my most read book ever I read it a couple times as a kid  high school college  It s my go to book when donating blood  yeah  read this while donating blood and it makes the queues  the waiting  and the donating move swiftly   Done already  Can you take another quart or something    I ve read it aloud to some of my kids  trying not too laugh myself into unintelligibility  Now I have listened to it  while driving across the Midwest  with my kids One of the most hilarious books ever written  I love how absolutely random this book is  That being said I don t know what it is about things being random that makes them so incredibly hilarious  I definitely think it is a good sign of a book when you actually laugh out loud to yourself while reading it and want to share whatever it was that made you laugh with someone else  The only thing I think it was missing was a little bit of direction  I feel like there wasn t much of a solid plot  But then again with this being a series and a ridiculous one at that  I feel that what it lacks in plot it makes up for in humor  And along with this being a good read  it is easy to read also  If you enjoy sci fi but also enjoy humor this is a great book series to read  I would definitely recommend it   My thoughts when I started the first few chapters was  What kind of silly nonsense is this book   and I must have fallen from a park bench and whacked my head if this is considered a bestselling literary work of fiction   but then  I found I could not put it down  the    and what happens next kept running through my mind  I found it was actually creative  imaginative and full of surprises  It was indeed a book worth reading  There have been some great duos in the past but these two  a human and an alien being are very well written and you have to love these guys  Life is too serious at times and if this is a book that pokes fun at us a wee bit for being human  so be it  If I ever need a pick me up to remember that life is full of joy as well as sorrow I will grab one of this author s other works  I think humour is often the best way to get across a deeper and more meaningful message  I don t know if Douglas Adams intended for his books to be philosophical or just mere entertainment but he did an excellent job on both  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is more than just an awesome space adventure  It s a quest to understanding life  happiness  and everything DON T PANICAdams touched on the subject of anxiety very well  His characters are very real  they have real worries  anxieties and stresses  It makes me smile whenever I read DON T PANIC  Arthur Dent tells Slartibartfast  Adams is quite good at picking names  about his belief that there s something sinister going on somewhere that he s unaware of  Slartibartfast replies that everyone feels that way  just normal paranoia  But the way he sees it is you just gotta let it go  How I interpreted it was that it s normal to feel anxiety and paranoia but we have to learn to let it go or accept it else it will ruin our ability to enjoy the present  Slartibartfast may not have found happiness in his life but he s on the right track  He focuses on the small beautiful wonders like the Fjords of Norway  which won an award you know    He d rather be happy than right Humans Are Not  1Actually we re pretty average and boring  This is a new perspective  The human reader has to come to terms that white mice and dolphins are smarter  We are the ignorant and primitive aliens  For instance  on the planet Earth  man had always assumed that he was more intelligent than dolphins because he had achieved so much  the wheel  New York  wars and so on  whilst all the dolphins had ever done was muck about in the water having a good time  But conversely  the dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent than man  for precisely the same reasons  It s Not Always The Answer But The QuestionWhen given the answer to life  happiness  and everything  No one knew what the hell the answer even meant  What was it in reference to  Masses view happiness and the meaning of life as a product to either collect or sell to others  Some are looking for something that looks good  market value  I loved when the Computer was told to calculate the meaning of life  happiness  and everything  The Computer complained that it s hard to compute with such a vague question  The All Knowing Computer asks for a definition of Life  Happiness and Everything  And the response was  Er   you know Life  happiness and everything If you want to find the answer to something you have to know exactly it is you are asking  We are often searching for these elusive things without actually even being able to define what they are so how can we expect to make sense of the answer if it was given to us  A Universally Fun Time When I first picked up  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy   I didn t know what to expect  I had heard so many rumors about this novel s contents  Every time I asked someone about it  they responded with some wacky  zany phrase from the book  most often the number  42   I decided that I needed to discover what this book was about  so I picked up a copy and started to read  I was surprised by just how entertaining and though provoking the story was  The novel concerns the adventures of Arthur Dent  a man whose house is about to be torn down to build a new road  However  on the day his house is going to be torn down  his friend Ford Prefect  who is actually an extraterrestrial  comes to tell him that Earth will soon be destroyed to make room for  coincidentally  a  space road  that will speed up intergalactic travel  The duo manages to escape the planet before its destruction  and go on to have many wacky adventures traveling the cosmos  This novel  despite its darker setting  is a fun  humorous story about space exploration  The characters have many hilarious and dangerous adventures  encountering other life forms and exploring new worlds  I was thoroughly entertained learning about the antics of Arthur  Ford  and several other characters the reader meets along the way  Charming  witty  and incredibly weird  I d recommend this novel to anyone  One thing to take note of  however  is that the novel has many instances of complicated vocabulary  so it may be more difficult to understand for younger readers  Despite that  however  the novel manages to remain interesting throughout its entirety  I would rate it 10 10  A light humorous book  As a sci fi novel  and story series   this book  and the series as a whole  is quite good and entertaining  But  where this novel totally soars  over everything I have read so far   and is so absolutely mind blowing  is in the witty sayings and quotes that it is choc a bloc with  British humor is amazing once you develop a taste for it   and Douglas Adams is arguably one of the best  probably  the best   even better than my previous favorite PGW  in this genre that I have come across so far Presented below are some of my favorite quotes lines  italicized  from this classic  I can t think of a better review  than to provide a sneak peek into the book  The content speaks for itself     Do not forget to pick this book up    especially if these few excerpts bring a grin to your face   For instance  on the planet Earth  man had always assumed that he was more intelligent than dolphins because he had achieved so much  the wheel  New York  wars and so on  whilst all the dolphins had ever done was muck about in the water having a good time  But conversely  the dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent than man  for precisely the same reasons   Bypasses are devices that allow some people to dash from point A to point B very fast while other people dash from point B to point A very fast  People living at point C  being a point directly in between  are often given to wonder what s so great about point A that so many people from point B are so keen to get there  and what s so great about point B that so many people from point A are so keen to get there  They often wish that people would just once and for all work out where the hell they wanted to be   He felt that his whole life was some kind of dream and he sometimes wondered whose it was and whether they were enjoying it   What s up    asked Ford  I don t know   said Marvin   I ve never been there  Time is an illusion  Lunchtime doubly so   Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the western spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun  Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety two million miles is an utterly insignificant little blue green planet whose ape descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea   There are of course many problems connected with life  of which some of the most popular are Why are people born  Why do they die  Why do they want to spend so much of the intervening time wearing digital watches   And so the problem remained  lots of people were mean  and most were miserable  even the ones with digital watches   Please relax   said the voice pleasantly  like a stewardess in an airliner with only one wing and two engines one of which is on fire   you are perfectly safe   Now it is such a bizarrely improbable coincidence that anything so mind mindbogglingly useful could have evolved purely by chance that some thinkers have chosen to see it as the final and clinching proof of the non existence of God The argument goes something like this   I refuse to prove that I exist    says God   for proof denies faith  and without faith I am nothing   But   says Man   The Babel fish is a dead giveaway  isn t it  It could not have evolved by chance  It proves you exist  and so therefore  by your own arguments  you don t  QED   Oh dear   says God   I hadn t thought of that   and promptly vanishes in a puff of logic  Oh  that was easy   says Man  and for an encore goes on to prove that black is white and gets himself killed on the next zebra crossing   Well the hours are good          but now you come to mention it  most of the actual minutes are pretty lousy  Then    there is the bit about finding the answer to life  universe  everything which takes the cake  It also ended up making  42  my favorite number       after all it is indeed  as has been proved in later books of this series  the answer to life  universe and everything and is just not clear to us  because nobody knows the question   D  O Deep Thought computer   he said   the task we have designed you to perform is this  We want you to tell us      he paused   The Answer   The Answer   said Deep Thought   The Answer to what   Life   urged Fook  The Universe   said Lunkwill  Everything   they said in chorus Deep Thought paused for a moment s reflection  Tricky   he said finally  But can you do it  Again  a significant pause  Yes   said Deep Thought   I can do it   There is an answer   said Fook with breathless excitement  Yes   said Deep Thought   Life  the Universe  and Everything  There is an answer  But  I ll have to think about it     Fook glanced impatiently at his watch  How long   he said  Seven and a half million years   said Deep Thought Lunkwill and Fook blinked at each other  Seven and a half million years      they cried in chorus  Yes   declaimed Deep Thought   I said I d have to think about it  didn t I   Seven and a half million years later     Fook and Lunkwill are long gone  but their ancestors continue what they started  We are the ones who will hear   said Phouchg   the answer to the great question of Life       The Universe      said Loonquawl  And Everything      Shhh   said Loonquawl with a slight gesture   I think Deep Thought is preparing to speak  There was a moment s expectant pause while panels slowly came to life on the front of the console  Lights flashed on and off experimentally and settled down into a businesslike pattern  A soft low hum came from the communication channel  Good Morning   said Deep Thought at last  Er  good morning  O Deep Thought  said Loonquawl nervously   do you have   er  that is     An Answer for you   interrupted Deep Thought majestically   Yes  I have  The two men shivered with expectancy  Their waiting had not been in vain  There really is one   breathed Phouchg  There really is one   confirmed Deep Thought  To Everything  To the great Question of Life  the Universe and everything   Yes  Both of the men had been trained for this moment  their lives had been a preparation for it  they had been selected at birth as those who would witness the answer  but even so they found themselves gasping and squirming like excited children  And you re ready to give it to us   urged Loonsuawl  I am   Now   Now   said Deep Thought They both licked their dry lips  Though I don t think   added Deep Thought   that you re going to like it   Doesn t matter   said Phouchg   We must know it  Now   Now   inquired Deep Thought  Yes  Now     All right   said the computer  and settled into silence again  The two men fidgeted  The tension was unbearable  You re really not going to like it   observed Deep Thought  Tell us   All right   said Deep Thought   The Answer to the Great Question     Yes     Of Life  the Universe and Everything     said Deep Thought  Yes      Is     said Deep Thought  and paused  Yes      Is     Yes            Forty two   said Deep Thought  with infinite majesty and calm   D  Happy Reading View all my reviews Among the funniest things I have ever read  The series began as a radio show  and was then adapted for LP record   You know  the 12 inch vinyl disk with the small hole in the center   I first discovered it in that form  then heard the original radio shows  and only later read the books Whatever the format  the humor is original  unconventional  unexpected and unpredictable  and simply hilarious  Some theists might be offended by Adams s atheist satire  which can be ascerbic and even insulting  I don t let it bother me  No matter how many times I read this book  it never fails to lift my spirits  make me think and most importantly of all make me laugh and put me in a fantastic mood I get something more out of reading each time and you really can t say that about many books  Douglas Adams never fails to help you laugh at yourself when you are feeling down Even if you don t read Sci fi or Fantasy I still recommend this one  to anyone having bad day   One of my favourite comedy science fiction stories ever written  I love the entire series  My favourite character has always been Trillian and it was a shame she didn t feature more in the stories  Douglas Adams  British dry humour shines through  especially the idea of demolishing Earth to make way for a galactic highway  Though I d hesitate to say Earth is mostly harmless  P A quirky sense of humour  nonsensical wacked out descriptions  crazy and loveable characters  and plenty of towels make this book a great read  I love everything from starting with blowing up the Earth on the first few pages  to Marvin  the Paranoid Android acting so depressed that he causes another computer system to commit suicide  Each detail and event marks this as a very special read  A masterpiece of comedic science fiction and satire  refined previously via the original radio plays and TV series  Many point to the book as the definitive version  forgetting the earlier incarnations and as Adams himself once said of the Hitchhiker s Guide s inspiration  the record is not straight  but  permanently crooked   The book s tone is a perfect example of the uniquely British aspect of humour that deals in absurd ideas with a straight face  Readers who share this sense of humour delight in this style  which was also explored masterfully by Peter Cooke  Dudley Moore  Monty Python and the great Spike Mulligan  to name but a few  The book and series are hugely influential and helped establish that the previously otherwise serious genre of science fiction could be used as a foundation for laughs without compromising legitimate social commentary via satire  Whether direct or not  the influence of Adams work can be felt in many science fiction works today  like the BBC series Red Dwarf and even Doctor Who and Star Trek at times   Wonderfully absurd  Rather than a review this is a sampling of the humour you can expect  You decide  Concise   The ships hung in the sky in much the same way that bricks don t Deep   They discovered only a small asteroid inhabited by a solitary old man who claimed repeatedly that nothing was true  though he was later discovered to be lying  Timeless  And so the problem remained  lots of people were mean  and most were miserable  even the ones with digital watches  Relevant  This planet has   or rather had   a problem  which was this  most of the people living on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time  Many solutions were suggested for this problem  but most of these were largely concerned with the movement of small green pieces of paper  which was odd because on the whole it wasn t the small green pieces of paper that were unhappy   No matter how many times I ve read it  I enjoy again and again  The book provides countless quotations      All my life  I had a feeling that something is happening in the world  something big  even serious  and nobody will tell me what        the odds to know what really happening in the world  are absurdly slim  so the only thing left to do is say To hell with the reasons behind this    I could go on and on and on    To this day I still answer 42 to questions   Series of 5 shorter stories combine into one  Fun and all over the place  One of the few to make me laugh out loud I enjoyed this book a lot  I thought that the plot of the book flowed nicely  I thought that it was very funny because the humor that they have in it is really quite funny even though it intends not to be The book itself is about a man named Arthur Dent who  prior to the destruction of Earth by the sluggish  bureaucratic and ugly Vogons is saved by his friend Ford Prefect  From this point they hitchhike across the galaxy with the help of Ford s travel guide  The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy  While traveling  they run into many colorful characters such as Marvin  a robot who is perpetually depressed due to his functioning personality chip  and Zaphod Beeblebrox  the president of the galaxy who is  for lack of a better word  an idiot All in all  I found the book to be very entertaining  I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys Douglas Adams or who like humorous books that also have a fairly good plot  One of the first books in my life that actually made me laugh out loud while reading it  This is the perfect book for fans of the sci fi genre as well as those who prefer comedy books  The book follows English human Arthur around the galaxy after Earth gets destroyed in a galactic renovation project to build a highway system  Arthur only has the help of a few friends  a mysterious book called The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy and of course  a towel  Hilariously written and a bold new take on the science fiction genre Hilariously entertaining Philosophy  physics  mathematics    and funny quotes  All in one story that will take you to an extreme imagination of how this universe works  and why do we exist    Great book Gonna start the next part of this serie  The Restaurant At The End Of The Universe        Fantastico el libro  aunque el final me ha quedado como si estuviera incompleto  asi que indagare a ver si realmente consegui un libro incompleto o realmente acaba asi  El libro te deja con ganas de mas  pero el humor que hay dentro de el te hace sonreir muchas veces  Goodreads me permite valorar del 1 al 5  pero prefiero valorar esto con decimales  Dejo este libro en 4 5 por ese final  Asi que redondeare al 5 por que el resto del libro me ha encantado  Nos gusto mucho la forma en que escribe  porque es como estar platicando con alguien  La historia es muy divertida  dentro de su ficcion hace muchas analogias con la realidad  Se burla de las maneras de proceder del ser humano ante ciertas situaciones y hace evidente los vicios que todos tenemos  The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy is a wholly remarkable book   As I write this I am again listening to the audio version as read by Stephen Fry  For the life of me  as I listen  I can t understand why anyone would not love this book  It s as some people were simply not born with a sense of absurdity and the ability to take joy in it  Let me give you an example  The ships hung in the sky in much the same way that bricks don t   How can you not at least smile at that  It s the sort of phrase that makes your mind stutter a moment as you come to terms with it  and which makes me generally happy  As the book is full of this sort of odd thinking one end to the other  it keeps me happy the whole way through  This  trilogy  of books is one of the best birthday presents I have ever received  The books are all quirky and funny in their own way each one  I loved the countdown to the end of the universe  the wacky eleveator who would not do what you want to  the difficulty of making a proper cup of tea  and the fact that a towel is essential to all space travel   I liked this book okay when I first read it years ago  Glad I reread it  it s super hilarious  I think maybe I was put off by the abrupt ending the first time  The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy is one of the best books i ve read  it is humerous  pointless and an easy read  this book would be for the science fiction reader who enjoys pointless treks across the universe in a futuristic space ship  It is the most random book out there  containing a bunch of arbitrary entertaining events spontaniously happening with little or no relevance to the plot  I would definetly recomend this book to any depressed reader  No Review Required  This book was amazing  the humour is timeless  the characters dynamic and interesting and overall just a very well put together book  I loved every page of this novel and every piece of dialogue was amazing  I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who 1  likes science fiction 2  loves themselves and wants to read a great book  Among the strangest  most random books i have ever read  It was never tedious  never predictable  and always had something amusing going on  i loved the variety in the characters  i m still not sure what the point or the plot was of thie fine book but that doesn t matter  i had fun reading it  The story  Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  is about an ordinary man whose name is Arthur  He lived a calm life out in the countryside in England  nothing much ever really happened  until a large construction crew came to his home to tear it down to build a roadway  His friend Ford comes to his home and takes him off to a bar  and tells him that Earth is about to be demolished to build an intergalactic roadway  Ford is able to get Arthur off the planet right before its utter decimation  Now the two are on a journey across the universe for absolutely no reason This book is a wonderful story and definitely a must read of the Science Fiction genre  The author has an amazing sense of humor  the plot is fantastic  and the settings and themes are described in such a way that you can easily imagine what they actually look like  If you are not a very big fan of British humor and wording  you most likely will find less entertainment in this story  but it is still an amazing book that you should read no matter what  or just go away and stop putting a damper on our enjoyment  I recommend that everyone should take the small amount of time it takes to read this book  as it is only about 215 pages  The awkward earthling thrown into a flurry or the most random  incredible joust of imagination when it comes to the way the galaxy works is what this book entails for the reader  The absolute adventure in these pages should be illegal  the pure  succulent  explosive wack of this book is immeasurable  Always such a good time to read and not surprising when you find yourself giggling at the super genius that is the workings of Douglas Adams   I read this many years ago when I was a kid and I absolutely loved it  I never got around to finishing the series  unfortunately  so I intend to this time around  I decided to re read it as a refresher  It s still as great as I remember it  A truly hilarious and original novel  Very easy to see why it is so beloved  It s an exceptional work  Can t wait to dig into the rest  And yes  the answer is definitely 42   Mr  Adams  can I borrow your brain and sense of humour    Have you ever just  fallen in love with a book after the first paragraph  Actually  after the first sentence  That was my experience with The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy  This book is basically everything I have ever wanted in a science fiction book plus more  The dry and witty dialogue paired with the outrageous cast of characters made this a captivating read from start to finish  I plan on ordering the rest of the series tomorrow    This book is one of the greatest books of all time  It is The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  the first in the series  It is written by Douglas Adams  The authors purpose in this book was mainly to entertain  This book started out as a radio series originally  It has then been rewritten so many times that using that would change this entire review  But the book is mainly an interesting story  It doesn t have any real meanings  Although there are quite a few political references and jokes  a lot of which are British  they don t try and carry any real meaning other then  again  to entertain   The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy  didn t really have a central theme  If it were to have a theme  the theme would be  Don t Panic   That needs a bit of a back story  This book is about a guide called  The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy  and on this guide the words  Don t Panic  are written on the front cover  The author may be alluding to his central message  that people shouldn t stress about life and just relax  but most importantly don t panic This story was a narration  If written in any other way it would have failed miserably  The writing was almost  if not  perfect  As a description the author couldn t have described space  because well  he was never there  A exposition wouldn t work because the author doesn t want to explain anything  except for his story  An argument would not have been done as well because there are no facts and anything to persuade someone with  I loved this book  I loved its absurdity and craziness  It is its own genre of literature in itself  I honestly can t think of anything I didn t like about this book  If i were to pick something i would say it was to short and there aren t enough sequels  I wouldn t change one single thing about this book except for the length  It is similar to nothing i have read    well maybe the sequels   This book is great for a light read  It s very funny and toung in cheek and definitely doesn t take itself seriously  so don t go for it if you want a serious read In the beginning I wasn t quite feeling it  I had to really get into it  but about half way through I found that I was having troubles putting it down  O YES  YES    YESSSS       dddddassssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss LOVE Funny  Entertaining  Was quite the page turner for me  I really enjoyed this book and would definitely recommend this book for pretty much everyone  This novel is Douglas Adams  best ever  The book picks you up  drives you to the movies  and never lets you go  Ford is hilarious with his insane logic  Trillian is a wonderful as the only really sane one on board the Heart of Gold  Marvin is so pathetic that he makes you cry every time you read the book  And through it all  the hapless Arthur Dent just tries to understand what is happening  The plot involves the earth being blow up to make a hyperspace bypass  Anyway  throw in an ancient race of planet builders  some towels  a stolen space ship  and a restaurant at the end of the universe  and you get the first novel in one of the best sci fi series ever  Douglas Adams is more or less the master of confusing but hilarious plot as well as dialouge  Now  I m not just writing this review because I love all sci fi books  In fact  I read very few  about 20   sci fi books  although I still like the genre  So you can see I m not a Die Hard sci fi comedy fan  Adults as well as children  teenagers really  will find the material and dialouge side splitting  A must read for any science fiction fan   I ve been reading reviews from others on this  Trilogy   not that I saw much about the other books   but I couldn t  believe  the amount of people who think Adams is  Overrated   Really  Really   Because they all just sounded really bitter  for some reason  Maybe they re pissed off that they didn t get it  and therefore feel the need to rage against an author who s brought a lot nonsense   silliness into the lives of people who desperately needed it  Come to think of it   that would explain why they are so pissed off  They desperately need to surrender to the absurdity of Douglas Adams  They are obviously taking themselves far too seriously  But what do I know  I loved  Long  Dark Tea Time of The Soul    After watching him speak at a University shortly before he passed  I got the chance to tell him    I loved Long Dark Tea Time Of The Soul   His response was    You are  quite literally  the only person to ever say that myself included  How can you not love the guy  I think all of the people who were saying Adams is over rated   boring  stupidly pointless   I think Douglas would take  that  as a compliment   and yes  if you can t believe it  look them up  these were the main complaints I heard  need a great big hug  or a nap  or a cookie   something to help them stop taking themselves so seriously  Do some drugs   not  really  advocating drug use   but they do work   go ice skating with a nice lonely elderly gentleman  I don t really know what will help  But you guys have gotta lighten up Seriously  Brilliant  Quick lil reread because I m thinking of giving a copy to my Dad  You know how fictional books have some highlights and some parts you just skim through  This one is full of twists and laughs  mixed with hints of incredible insight  Perhaps one too many space ships for my taste  but that s the only negative thing I can think of  and it is science fiction after all  Good news  this trilogy contains at least three more books    I had previously borrowed this book  1st edition passed down from a father to son  from a friend  I thought I d lost it  which caused me months of guilt and torment  When enjoying this without the dread hanging over me I realised it incorporated aspects of Monty Pythons  sci fi and genuine good story telling  I loved this book  some didn t live up to the hype I had been exposed to Some however were not lost on me that it was 4 years before the first Terry Pratchett Discworld  which I m a much bigger fan of   It s obvious this series is a comedic prequel  and quite probably wouldn t exist without Hitchhiker s Guide  for which I am eternally grateful  Certain scenes are as funny as they could possibly be while still moving the narrative forward  I appreciate the amount of science involved  while some of it has artistic interpretation  mostly for comedy  which is fine  Very excited to read the rest of the series  there s people who like science fiction but haven t read this      i don t talk to them anymore  This was one of my favorite sci fi books in awhile  I finished it in one day  Mandatory reading for an sentient life forms with a tendency to take itself too seriously  Really enjoyed this book and the other four books of the  trilogy  This book remains one of my all time favorite reads  I still remember one particular line that made me laugh out loud until my tummy was sore  I won t share here  I ll let you read it for yourself   This is a terrific  timeless book both funny and thought provoking  I highly recommend it  I do also love the audio version of this series  One thing that surprised me that I never realized before  I learned while listening to an interview with Doug Adams that this was originally created as a radio program and THEN made into a book  That does somewhat explain why the BBC audio full cast version of this book is so completely wonderful  I think I enjoy it even more than reading it myself  If you have never read this book  or listened to the audio version  which is by far one of the best audio books of all time   you should consider it  It s awesome   I read this book loooong ago  but it made a big impact on me then that I am still glad for The beginning of the story is that the earth is going to be destroyed by aliens   not for evil purposes of power and dominion  but to make way for a bypass  The earth is just in the way  Mild mannered everyman  Arthur Dent is also losing his home to demolition for a bypass in England in the same indifferent manner and would be destroyed along with earth but for the intervention of his friend Ford Prefect  Ford  it turns out  is an alien himself  with a wonderful device   a technological  thumb  that catches rides on nearby passing interstellar vehicles  of which there are multitudes in the heavens unbeknownst to us human earthlings  The adventures begin and you are taken along for the ride  Hitchhiker s Guide  isn t exactly easy to read but it moves fast  It challenges the reader to think in unfamiliar ways  much as Alice in Wonderland takes normal logic and reason  and makes it stand on its head  Adams satirizes normalcy and accepted ways of looking at life   yet it isn t mean spirited  He demands some level of the ridiculous in his readers as well as a bit of intellect  playing with egos and standard ways of doing things to delightful effect The books in the Hitchhiker series were not the original way it was published  First came the radio show in England  then a BBC series done at about the same time that Adams wrote the book   The feel is less bookish and more in character for various media  So if it s not exactly great Literature  it is a great and fun story  A silly relative of Sci Fi classics that lampoons the idea that the human race is the pinnacle of the universe  Humbling and hilarious  This book certainly gets better with age and life experience of the reader  I had read this book as a teenager and this time round  I find it funnier  A worthy 5 stars Read this when I was 12  Re read it last year  The humor is just non stop Some of the most fun I ve had with any fiction anywhere Get a copy and read it  You won t be disappointed  Really hilarious monty pythonesque humor and storytelling  I loved it and can t believe I haven t read it already  Though thirty years old it still read very current and the ideas are quite fresh  The paranoid android is brilliant  How about the computer  deep thought  which became the namesake of a IBM computer used to play chess not to long ago  Douglas Adams wrote the radio play for HHG at the BBC while it was being performed  which probably accounts for its marvelous manic quality  It was later turned into a book  which became a series of books  all of which  at one point  I largely memorized The ultimate dweeb  Arthur Dent  who can disable the fastest spaceship in the universe by making a cup of tea  leaves Earth just before it is deolished by the Vogons in the company of his friend Ford Prefect who taught Arthur the importance of always knowing where your towel is  They run into the completely self centered Zaphod Beeblebrox  who stole Tricia McMillian  Trillian  from Arthur at a party  And who can forget Eddie the Shipboard Computer  Marvin  I think you should know I m feeling very depressed  the Robot  Deep Thought or any of the other less animate characters  A fun  light  imaginative journey through the galaxy as you ve never seen it before  I listened to the first six episodes of the bbc audio version  Absolutely amazing  stunningly nihilistic   In my experience  readers either love Adams  books or quickly put them down  I  for example  quite literally worship the words Adams puts on the page  and have read the Hitchhiker s Trilogy so many times that I have large tracts of it memorized  But both my wife and father couldn t get past book one  the former because she found it too silly  and the latter because he found the writing to be more about  the author s personality  than plot and character  Whatever The first three books in the Hitchhiker s Trilogy  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  The Restaurant at the End of the Universe  and Life  the Universe and Everything  are inspired lunacy  The ideas  plots  puns  jokes  and phrases that fill their pages have influenced an entire generation of not only writers  but people from all fields  For instance  the Babel Fish software that translates foreign websites for you is named after a species of fish that Adams created in book one  you can find dozens of recipes online for Pan Galactic Gargle Blasters  the chess computer Deep Thought that lost two matches to Gary Kasparov in 1989 was named after a computer in book one  and seriously  who hasn t heard that the answer to life  the universe  and everything is 42   For more of these  consult wikipedia org s entry on  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy Cultural References    Chances are  if you re reading these books for the first time  you ll be surprised to see how many everyday things were named after Adams  creations The books aren t  of course  without their problems  Adams himself admitted that the Trilogy had  and I paraphrase  a long beginning  a long conclusion  and not much in the middle  though I can t remember where I read that   He was also regularly accused of writing for the sake of cranking out one liners  The books as a whole jump about like a manic puppy on methamphetamines  and there are at least a few jokes in there that will completely fly over the heads of any readers who lack a basic comprehension of quantum physics  Despite this  the Hitchhiker s Trilogy remains as the single most entertaining and enjoyable series of books I ve ever read  a position they ve occupied for some fifteen years  Adams  wit and wisdom still baffle me in their greatness  and he remains to this day one of only two authors who can regularly  consistently make me howl with laughter  the other being Terry Pratchett   Readers beware  if the Adams bug infects you  you will have it for life  And you ll never be sorry you let it bite      Amazon com Review    Join Douglas Adams s hapless hero Arthur Dent as he travels the galaxy with his intrepid pal Ford Prefect  getting into horrible messes and generally wreaking hilarious havoc  Dent is grabbed from Earth moments before a cosmic construction team obliterates the planet to build a freeway  You ll never read funnier science fiction  Adams is a master of intelligent satire  barbed wit  and comedic dialogue  The Hitchhiker s Guide is rich in comedic detail and thought provoking situations and stands up to multiple reads  Required reading for science fiction fans  this book  and its follow ups  is also sure to please fans of Monty Python  Terry Pratchett s Discworld series  and British sitcoms      Review    Don t panic  Here are words of praise for The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy    It s science fiction and it s extremely funny   inspired lunacy that leaves hardly a science fiction cliche alive    Washington Post   The feckless protagonist  Arthur Dent  is reminiscent of Vonnegut heroes  and his travels afford a wild satire of present institutions    Chicago Tribune   Very simply  the book is one of the funniest SF spoofs ever written  with hyperbolic ideas folding in on themselves    School Library Journal   As parody  it s marvelous  It contains just about every science fiction cliche you can think of  As humor  it s  well  hysterical     From the Hardcover edition    Not only is the Hitchhiker s Guide on of the funniest and strangest books I ve ever read  or heard in this case   but Stephen Fry s reading makes it absolutely hilarious  Best fun I ve had in a while  Absolutely recommended  This is the funniest book in the whole galaxy It is the first in the classic  5 part  trilogy involving Arthur Dent and his friend Ford Prefect  Arthur Dent is grabbed from Earth by his friend Ford Prefect  whom he just found out is an alien  moments before a cosmic construction team demolishes the planet to build a freeway  They are aided by the Hitchhiker s Guide which offers such insights as  a towel is about the most massively useful thing an interstellar hitchhiker can have  and as well as galaxy of fellow travelers such as Zaphod Beeblebox  Vogons  and old and tired Slartibartgast This series  obviously attracts Sci Fi readers  but will also be enjoyed by Anglophiles  Monty Python fans  world travelers  and well  anyone who is looking for answers to the questions that really matter  This book deserves a perfect score of 5 stars and should be reread at least once a year  Enough said  He leido series de novelas buenas y luego he leido A series of unfortunate events  de Lemony Snicket Despues de esos 13 tomos crei que nada le llegaria  hasta que abri este libro  No habia llegado ni a la mitad del libro cuando estaba seguro ya de algo  esta va a ser una de mis series de libros favoritas  De algun u otro modo  Adams se las arregla para mantenerte pegado al libro hasta que lo terminas  tiene un muy buen sentido del humor que me hizo soltar un par de carcajadas en pleno transporte publico  bastante pena  por cierto   Incluso tuvo una influencia enorme en la cultura pop actual  Desde Babel fish hasta Radiohead  Le doy cinco estrellas porque es lo maximo que se me permite poner  Muy ligero  muy MUY disfrutable  es de esos pocos libros que de verdad no quieres que terminen  A mi me queda claro que voy a buscar la segunda parte de esta serie en cuanto pueda   This has got to be one of the strangest books I ve ever read  I m actually a bit surprised the book made any sense at all  seeing as there are so many things in it that don t make sense  Does that even make sense  Oh well  Anyway  the book was pretty good  and is a testimony to how weird the universe really is  Ahora necesito conseguir los otros 4 Brilliant  Beautiful  and laugh out loud funny  I enjoyed it thoroughly and completely   Cool book Awesome  The Hitchhiker s Guide is one of my favourite trilogies   all five books      If you want to learn how to survive potential planetary demolition  read this book  If you want to know the importance of always carrying a towel  read this book  If you need some tips on dealing with a manic depressive robot   or really  and robot dealing with a mental health condition  I guess    read this book  Spoiler alert   42  Cheers Rodgers   Wicked  Weird  Funny  Deep I couldn t put down the book right after i started it  It was weird  It was funny  The robot which is cynical and sarcastic  is really funnily cynical and sarcastic  Kinda like a children s book  It was fun reading this  Never at once i was bored and sometimes it would make me laugh  The touch of You ll Never Walk Alone is an awesome addition to Liverpool FC like me  All in all  i love this book  Was recommended by my cousin whom never fails to recommend any good books  This is the book you should read whenever you have free time like 1 hour before sleeping or class There s something also about this book that makes me amazed on how the simplest of things can be so complex and the most complex of things can be so simple  Douglas Adams has a very good way of writing something so wicked and funny and interesting  As a fan of science fiction  this was  to me personally  a very interesting read  I have seen in this book how things can advance very quickly once they are set in motion  how not paying attention can change the course of many and most importantly  42  An absolutely brilliant and hilarious book  This book is how I test if I will like new people I meet    if they liked the book  I know we ll get along smashingly  If they hated it     well  clearly their worldview is entirely opposed to mine  and there generally isn t much more to say at that point  One of the funniest books you will ever read  The author s main message in The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is that the meaning of existence is a universal question that is meant to be left unanswered  Through the civilizations in the story  the reader comes to understand that the author believes that however close one may come to solving the   The Ultimate Question  complete understanding is not tangible  This novel begins in multiple locations throughout the universe as the characters are introduced  Though once the different story lines collide  the setting primarily takes place aboard the Heart of Gold  a ship that contains the Infinite Improbability Drive    a wonderful new method of crossing cast interstellar distances in a mere nothingth of a second   86   This story is told in third person limited from the narrator s viewpoint  This novel begins with a thirty year old man from England  an alien who was unexpectedly stuck on Earth for fifteen years  the President of the Imperial Galactic Government  his new earthling girlfriend  the destruction of Earth  and the theft of a new high tech spaceship  Through a series of events  these four characters all end up on board the spaceship  While adventuring through space they discover a lost planet where the answer to the universe tries to be answered  I thought this book was cleverly composed with a perfect ratio of humor  suspense  and action  Moreover  I particularly liked the entries from The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  the digital book that provides information about the universe that may serve useful to an intergalactic hitchhikers such as    A towel  it says  is about the most massively useful thing an interstellar hitchhiker can have       any man who can hitch the length and breadth of the Galaxy  rough it  slum it  struggle against terrible odds  win through and still know where his towel is  is clearly a man to be reckoned with   26   This Guide is similar to the short story Guide to Running Away from Not That Kind of Girl by Lena Dunham because it provides humorous information on useful items that come in handy when embarking on a spontaneous adventure  I would recommend this book for that reader who wants an easy read that is primarily humor with sci fi qualities   Looking for a book that s out of this world  If so  then the fantastically odd and out there  Hitchhiker s Guide To The Galaxy  by Douglas Adams is definitely for you   When planet Earth is about to be demolished for a new space bypass by a fleet of giant yellow spaceships  our unlikely adventurer Arthur Dent is swept off his feet into a world of doubt and total strangeness  After finding out his best friends is an alien  barely hitchhiking a ride off the now destroyed planet  and being subjected to the worst  actually lethal alien poetry of all time  he is absolutely terrified  Now without a home or a destination  Arthur explores and experiences the wonderful  terrifying  and humorous expanses of the Universe  With tons of dead on  laugh out loud humor  a vibrant and enjoyable set of characters  and tons of weirdness  it s impossible to dislike Douglas Adam s witty  poignant  and downright superior work  Personally  I love this book because of the genius humor that is integrated throughout the epic tale  While some novels may make you grin for a few seconds  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy will have you rolling around on the ground with uncontrollable laughter  Adam s manages to add the best bits of humor into the most unlikely of places  leaving you speechless the whole book  Another reason to enjoy this book is because of the total and utter weirdness that can be found on every page  This space setting is no blank black wasteland with little stars experience  Every location and area is packed with unbelievable characters  strange experiences  and odd events  It s quite near impossible to put this book down as the writing comes to life and you begin to feel a part of the story  With Adam s realistic and yet witty dialogue  fantastic descriptions  and engaging plot  it s hard not to be drawn into the heart of the novel  I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone  it s truly a staple for any dedicated reader   Don t Panic  I will give you my review  This book was so quirky and so nerdy but I loved every minute of it  I found myself literally giggling out loud at certain parts of it  It was just a fun read  I look forward to reading the remaining books in the series  This being my second read through Adams  first novel in his ever expanding trilogy   and  yes  there have been at least one more in recent years thanks to his fellow countryman  Eion Colfer   I was delighted to find that little has changed in my memory and perception of this hilariously wicked sci fi spoof  Arthur Dent is just as stupefied  Ford Prefect just as mad  and Zaphod Beeblebrox just as nutters  Not to mention Marvin being just as depressed  And can I tell you how hard it was not to hear Alan Rickman s voice in my head whenever Marvin showed up on the page  A few random thoughts that occurred during this second reading in over twenty years 1  Although the sci fi wonkiness is timeless  it was obvious that the late Douglas Adams was writing in the age before the Internet  Take  for example  the Sub Etha Sens O Matic  If he were writing this today  I have no doubt that he would have called it the Galactic Wide Web  Or something to that effect   Sub Etha brings pneumatic tubes to mind  2  The titular guide really is a spoof on Lonely Planet  if you were to put all of their published country and region guides together and have the cast of Monty Python write them  Think about it  folks  3  I suspected it when I first delved into Doctor Who a year ago this month  and it is reaffirmed yet again  Adams  influence on the Doctor is evident from the silliness that he injected into that series during the Baker years  and which is at the heart of his whimsically crazy narration here in Hitchhiker s  Too bad he didn t live to see the new Who take off into the stratosphere of a growing worldwide fandom the likes of which it had never seen during its original run  Adams passed too soon  But the misadventures of Dent   friends live ever on and on  I fully realize I am way behind the curve in finally getting around to this book  but I finally gave in to all the nerd cred pressure and purchased the book on Audible  I highly recommend the audio book for anyone thinking about giving it a try  The narration really does it service  really great performance art  Creo que es el libro mas divertido  nerd  chistoso  pero por sobre todo muy nerd que he leido en mi vida  I read this for my personal 2015 reading challenge  This is for  17   A book recommended by a friend  I also read this for National Readathon Day This book was a gift from Ilana Masad  which I am very glad I received      Go check out her writing  Slightlyignorant I saw the movie first  and the movie added a lot to it that wasn t in the book  I wonder if they just took parts from other books to make the movie feel longer  either way I loved it  The book was hilarious and wonderful  So glad I read this book  Not much more to say other than I love this book so much  Absolutely  hands down my favorite book of all time  I have read this book  actually  the Ultimate Hitchhiker s Guide   with all the books in one  many  many  many times  starting when I was about 13 or 14 years old  Even at 33  I never get tired of the quick  witty  British humor  For me  it doesn t get any better than this  wish I wrote it myself Read the complete Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  it pleasantly surprised me with its simplicity about space   time      A brilliant book I originally heard it on BBC radio4 driving home to Devon late one night in a previous life  Then saw the BBC TV version and loved it  Now I ve finally caught up with the book  In e book format  incidentally  which seems somehow appropriate when you think of what The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy actually is It s strange but I feel very much at home with the characters as well  I ve always had problems with Thursdays  I know a guy who s identical to Zaphod Beeblebrox  apart from the number of heads   and we all know a Marvin  the Paranoid Android  don t we And I love his use of logic to prove the illogical is perfectly logical  much the same as Alice in Wonderland So now to The Restaurant at the End of the Universe    I love this book  I can t put it down   The funniest book I have read in quite some time  complete with a wonderful sense of pacing and a sci fi tinge to boot  It also manages to be intelligent in a non pretentious way  which I consider a rare feat  after all  the one thing nobody can stand is a smart ass  A quick and hilarious read  It ends very abruptly which I ve heard is because Douglas Adams had to pretty much give his publishers what he had since he was past deadline  I can t wait to pick up the second book  hopefully in the near future  The writing is witty and funny  but it s biggest strength lies with the awesome cast of characters  This book found me at a crucial time in my teenage years and I loved it  I laughed and laughed at it and no one I tried to tell about it  got it   I was so happy to find other Hitchhiker s fans later at college and discover that I wasn t alone in my nerdiness  It s good  Awesome book for anyone  regardless of whether or not they find sci fi interesting  Author knows how to captivate readers  Some Minor Spoilers ahead If you have never read Douglas Adams Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  then you are lucky because you get to read it now  Welcome to a universe where the main characters are aimless wanderers  the Earth is destroyed in the first 20 pages by galactic bureaucrats and the President of the Galaxy knows more about making drinks and stealing technology  which runs on improbability  than running the government  And that s MAYBE the first quarter  In the hands of another novelist this could be the most depressing book ever written  In this author s hands it is one of the funniest books ever written  How does he do it  I don t know  Like any great book  if you start to take it apart you ll just be peeling that damn onion again  A few things can be enumerated though  First off  this book is extremely British  It may seem an odd thing to say but I m saying it  Douglas Adams wrote for Doctor Who and Monty Python back in the 70 s and used a lot of Doctor Who sets and props when he adapted this book for television  I mention it because I had a friend who went into this series not knowing that and was completely baffled  then put off and finally gave up  So be aware That brings up a second point  This is the final version of this story as opposed to the first  This story started out as a radio series  was made into a TV series and then he wrote the book  The less said about the 200x movie the better  Unlike almost any novel ever  I think you could get the personality and flavor of the book from watching the TV series  I NEVER say that  but I m saying it now  Also  if you can get a hold of the radio series  do it  There is a second Radio series that veers wildly from the story we have now but has the same exact feel  Seriously though  NEVER go near the movie  even if the visuals from TV are awful  they work better A third thing that makes this book great  or at least funny  is the sheer intellect that goes into every line of this novel and following  misnamed  trilogy  There are broad jokes too  but it is the subtle humor that will crack you up  It s also noteworthy for the new reader that some of the SF terms are rather dated now  To give a for instance he talks about white holes  That s going to happen with SF though Now  a word about the plot  There is a thing in film theory called the Invisible Style where the camera never is supposed to draw attention to itself  That is how this book s plot is  Things happen  the chapters tick away  a page or two each  and the book has a conclusion but if I were to describe the plot I would not be doing a review but giving a book report  I gave a book report on this book many years ago and it was the hardest one I ever gave  Something is always happening and the connections are sometimes wrapped together in one line  One economical line can sometimes tie disparate plots together  sometimes with cosmic results Which of course is the point of all this  I said I shouldn t break this book down and reading back I can say that everything I ve said is true  but it doesn t do this one justice  It s written in a similar style to Good Omens by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman  As a matter of fact  if you are a Pratchett fan  this is your authorial godfather  There is one other thing to address and that is HHGTG s position as the first book in a series  As the books go on they become a little more centered and a fair bit darker  There are five of them and a sixth written by another author  Needless to say  ignore the sixth  I read it so you don t have to So  if you re new  welcome to one of the most unique and interesting of SF universes  It is quite possible your outlook will be changed forever and it is glorious  To all readers old and new  remember to always laugh P S  The answer is  of course 42  Now  what s the question again  i love this stories  So I ve loved this book   The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is a clever and funny science fiction adventure  The protagonist of the story Arthurs dent  was just a normal guy  with normal job and normal life  But all of this changed when Arthur s best friend Ford Prefect revealed to him that the world was going to end and that he was an alien from the vicinity of the star betelgeuse  He also reveals that he is a hitchhiker and they were going to hitch a ride on the vogon ship that was going to destroy the earth  They manage to escape the planet only a few seconds after it is demolished  Arthur and Ford are then thrown out of the vogon ship  They wake up inside of the infinite improbability drive the fastest ship in the galaxy commanded by Fords friend zaphod beeblebrox the former president of the galaxy  He had stole the improbability drive to try and find the legendary planet of magrathea  A planet in which the inhabitants were famous for building Planets for the super rich before the great galactic economic crisis  When they finally arrive at magrathea slartiBartfast reveals to Arthurs the origins of planet Earth and the question to the universe and everything  Over all I thought the book had some very interesting concepts and I like how the author tried to come up with a scientific explanation for all the incredible things that happen in the book  It is very similar to the TV series Doctor Who in this respect  Over all I thought the book was great  I believe any lover of science fiction would enjoy this book although the themes in the book aren t as deep or serious as some other classic sci fi books such as  War of the worlds  or  1984   The Author instead decided to take a more comedic and laid back approach that I personally enjoyed  This is one of my favorite books of all time  Adams tells a wonderful story about a man who has just had his home planet destroyed and the adventures he goes through exploring space  Adams descriptions are very out of the ordinary  Before I had read this book most authors seemed to always describe people  places  and situation the same way  but Adams is one of a kind  He has helped me improve my writing style by helping me to describe things in such a different way  that it seems unique  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is a great book for anyone who is interested in science fiction  There are many surprising twists and turns  and the combination of all of the different characters makes for a very funny  slightly odd  but all around great book  this book was amazing and really random  The characters were really funny and I loved how everything fell into place at the end  You would get random stories that didn t make sense and then at the end they all fell perfectly in place  so cool   HILARIOUS  Oh What a roller coaster ride this book was   It seemed such a little book for being such a famous classic  Every single page was a delight and i could not stop laughing at the mere weirdness of things  At times ppl in my bus wud be looking funnily at me for the reason of my giggling while reading a book  It seems highly probable that Mr Douglas was drunk when he came up with not just the title but the entire story  The characters are totally crazy  Read Zaphod Beeblebrox and the Paranoid Android   and the incidents accidents too will shake up your entire physics know how    For example  when the Vogons are going to destroy earth  they condemn earthlings for being too lazy and not having seen the destruction warning notice on Alpha Centauri galaxy which was  just 4 light years  away     It was pure hilarious read and one just needs to close one s mind and go along with flow  Looking forward to reading the next of the series  The structure of the humor is fascinating  each sentence tells several micro jokes  each chapter contains brilliant macro jokes  This is one of my top 5 books of all time  It is the book that got me back into reading when I was in middle school  My mom actually made a reference to the  42  joke and when I gave her a  what the what   look  she found her copy of the book and gave it to me to read  I had no idea a book could be so funny  Def  a desert island book for me  even if I can practically recite it from memory    Quite the best sci fi or whatever  The books  strain of satire invention underlying a brilliantly observed comedy of errors can be re read and each time something new is found  Whether it s the quality of the writing or the urge to turn the page to find out what happens next the books are unputdownable  sorry  and made this reader speed read them simply for the pleasure they gave  The UK TV adaption was pretty faithful to the original radio programmes and both were far better than the film   maybe because book radio and TV were coincident in the mental picture they portrayed  Anyway the book is a 5 star and on balance the complete set is superior to the individual volumes because it is more than the sum of the parts  In the beginning they introduced two of the main characters  others came later  The earth was was destroyed by aliens  luckily our main characters aurthur and ford hitched a hike from an alien space ship  Not long after getting on the alien ship they were kicked of  They were then picked up buy another ship  It turns out it was fords cousin Zaphod and another earthing named trillian who had stole the ship  They arrive at a planet call magrathea  Arthur then met a man named slartibartfast  He told them that the earth was made to answer the great question of life and death  Then two mice riches in saying that they can solve it  They said all they need to do is to cut open Arthur s brain  Then aurthur and his friends ran away  Not long after the police came and tried to get Zaphod for steeling the ship  In the end they got away and the mixed just made up an aswer to the great question of life and death         out of 5 Stars This originally appeared at The Irresponsible Reader    If I m not really careful  this will be the longest thing I ever post here  Let s see how much restraint I have  shall we I think I read The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy for the first time in 1987  maybe 1988   and have read it countless times since then  I quote it all the time  frequently unconsciously and unintentionally     I think I ve even plagiarized it a couple of times  really unintentionally   The only reason that my PIN isn t 4242 is because it seems to be too obvious  I love this book  Rereading it is still fun  Even though I have paragraphs committed to memory  I can hear large portions of it in the voices of the original radio play actors  still the act of reading it is enjoyable  it s like coming home after a long day at work The fixation on digital watches seems so quaint  It starts in the first paragraph and doesn t really let up until late in the book  I so wish Adams was with us to see what he d do with our smartphone addictions So much of what Adams does here has been repeated by others that he inspired  it s tough to see some of it as fresh anymore  but he didn t so much break the mold as ignored it and accidentally created a new one The Vogons are fantstic creatures  From the description of their evolutionary process    abandoned though it may be    their anatomy  their inherent meanness  to the commentary on civil servants  Just a fun alien race to read about  But is Adams satisfied with that  No  He adds the monstrosity that is their poetry  and the swipe at the old schoolmate  and they near perfection The Babel fish  what can you say about that  They are inspired  They take care of a problem that every space bound Science Fiction story has to deal with in a way that s actually more believable than technology based solutions  Doctor Who does the same thing a bit less convolutedly  but less amusingly  too  The Python esque dialogue of the representatives of the Amalgamated Union of Philosophers  Sages  Luminaries and Other Thinking Persons  Is just a delight and picks up what could be a lull in the story Another little bonus that s easy to over look is cop ex machina appearance of the Blagulon Kappa police officers    they re a great commentary on law enforcement  notions of masculinity  depictions of both in the media    and how all three were undergoing a change at the time  Strip away all the laughs  the jokes  the satire  the general zaniness and you still ahve a decent story    not a great one  mind you  but a decent one  There s some good character work here  too    but it s hard to see  The reactions of both Arthur and Trillian to the destruction of Earth are a lot deeper and real then Adams needed to make them  Unfortunately  that s about all the good that Adams does with Trillian  Arthur still has some good treatment in his future It s not perfect  don t get me wrong    there are some problems with the characters  see Trillian   it being an adaptation of the radio program makes things a bit episodic with clunky transitions  and other hiccups  like the multiple introductions of Ford Prefect   Still  the highs are higher than the lows are low and there are a lot more of them I stopped taking notes of particular lines on page 5 this time  there are just too many to count  and far too many to list  Still  there are a few I have to note     Time is an illusion  Lunchtime doubly so       This must be Thursday      I never could get the hang of Thursdays      You d better be prepared for the jump into hyperspace  It s unpleasantly like being drunk   What s so unpleasant about being drunk   You ask a glass of water    I m not sure why  but this has always made me chuckle  if not actually laugh out loud  It s just never not funny     He had found a Nutri Matic machine which had provided im with a plastic cup filled with a liquid that was almost  but not quite  entirely unlike tea      In those days spirits were brave  the stakes were high  men were real men  women were real women and small furry creatures from Alpha Centauri were real small furry creatures from Alpha Centuari  And all dared to brave unknown terrors  to do mighty deeds  to boldly split infinitives that no man had split before            Look   said Arthur   would it save you a lot of time if I just gave up and went mad now     Slartibartfast  okay  not technically a line  but that name   c mon  It s a classic  you just need to read it if you haven t  If you have  is it time for a re read  I liked this book when I was a teenager  Was fun  light  had a nice flow  The characters were really fun  but I never really understood Trillian   and I was into random stuff at the time But I didn t get it  For instance  I had no idea that The Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy was so acid when I read it almost 10 years ago  I had no experience in the real world to think stuff like  Oh my Dog  this DNV employee looks like a vogon enough without telling me that I was in the wrong line for almost two hours      Took a teen to fall in love with the story  and a grown up to laugh with the details  I will read again in other 10 years  only to make sure if I wasn t missing anything this time  I had high hopes for this book  and it met them all  There is a story in here somewhere  as an undercover alien rescues his buddy just before Earth gets destroyed  then they hitch a ride on a crazy new spaceship  but the plot is not what provides the pleasure in this book  Adams had me laughing out loud multiple times with his nearly nonsensical asides  For example  there s a tense scene  and all of the characters are transfixed on something Very Important  but one of the minor characters starts humming ironically because he hates everyone else so much  Just one line  never followed up anywhere  but it s a brilliant way to get a laugh while engaging in consistent characterization  There s also a deliciously absurd chapter about how one line of dialogue gets caught up in a space time wormhole thing and starts a massive galactic war and leads to a charmingly unsuccessful invasion of Earth  This book didn t teach me any Valuable Life Lessons or enrich my view of Life  the Universe  and Everything  but it made me laugh a great deal  and I thoroughly enjoyed it  Now I look forward to reading other books in the  trilogy   this is the Funniest book i have ever read in my life      tricky logic that makes you laugh   and full of sarcasm   nothing is what it seems    that was the target of Douglas Adams in the book    he managed to create this wonderful imaginary life in the universe with us    and will take you into an adventure though it i can t wait to read the next books  Read this or you will never be a hoopy frood  Hands down  the most hysterically funny book I ve ever read  I mean  fall on the ground  laugh till it hurts funny  Pure genius  I reread all these books before the movie came out in 2005 and was struck by just how entertaining all these novels are  Most are laugh out loud funny  which is just not that easy to do  The first  though  is by far the best  and even if you don t enjoy Science Fiction as a genre  the sheer entertainment value of this novel makes it a great read for just about anyone  Arthur Dent is having an odd day   He never could get the hang of Thursdays   First  his house was demolished  Then  the entire Earth was bulldozed to make way for a new  intergalactic highway  Now Arthur s one of two humans left  scrambling around the universe with a Betelgeuse alien called Ford Prefect for a best friend and a towel for everything else The only way I can describe this book is to say that it is a hilarious work of comedic genius  And I feel like that might be understating it  My brother can attest to how funny I found it   when I wasn t reading whole passages out to him  I was giggling to myself like a madwoman  I realise this is nothing that hasn t been said before  but it bears repeating  It s probably the most quotable book I ve read  Every other line is a well observed quip  a combination of absurd and true musings about life  And I don t exaggerate when I say that I laughed until I cried   To be fair  I d also been stuck on a plane for 9 hours by this stage  and was pretty darn tired  But I digress  I didn t exactly put off reading this novel  I just kept getting distracted by other books   upon reflection  books that were nowhere near as good  I feel like a chump for missing out until now  Don t panic  But don t delay  either  read The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  It s short  sharp and sweet  and you ll come out of it wondering how you ever could have existed without this book in your brain  Ma bible de l humour anglais  un regal d auto critique humaine sous couvert de space opera  Un must   This is one of my favorite books  It has a sense of humor that makes me laugh no matter how many times I have read it  There is nothing like a book that can make a joke about a brick  This is a book that I can t evaluate fairly  When I was a kid  I read my copies till they fell apart  It s loopy  cynical  absurd  solipsistic humor is at the base in my worldview  But you know what  it still rocks  The sentences are poetry and perfect British humor  The galaxy is wonderfully dysfunctional  Earth s destruction  and construction  hilariously pointless  From the very first paragraph  where humans were describe as ape descended beings  so primitive that they still think digital watches are a neat idea  I was laughing  This book is ABSURD It s very conversationally written  Sarcasm  Satire  Irony  I was so intrigued  this book is written in the late 70 s at the description of Ford s Hitchhiker s Guide  It was described as a magical library  that held 3 rooms of books all in one box  and you can randomly go to any page you want in any of those books by pushing a button     AHEM  Kindle   LOL  Did Douglas Adams invent the Kindle in 1970 something I liked that Ford and Author switch places a bit  On Earth  Ford is super chillaxed and Aurthor is high strung  Then  out in the Galaxy  Ford becomes the one who s always anxious  and Aurthor becomes the relaxed voice of reason  I love how much gibberish they made up and then counted it as legitimate facts  A nothingth of a second  is a measure of time  I peed my pants approximately 47 times during this book  I peed during the missile impact scene  I peed about 42  I peed about the bulldozer irony  I peed that the footnote describing Ford Prefect s childhood was 2 pages long  I peed about teasers  and I did NOT know the internet translation site I used to cheat on my Spanish homework was named Babelfish because of this book  I LOVED when Ford points out that humans have a really bad habit of pointing out the obvious  Such as  It s dark in here  It s cold out there  It s raining     I feel dumb  I m actively trying not to do that anymore  HahaAnyway  I will read this book again  more than once  I also think it could be a very fun book for children  and an easy read for those who have just learned  And it s not violent  or vulgar  just tons of silly  I would recommend this book to anyone who can handle a little nonsense humor  It s just so silly  It ll brighten your day    I decided to re read the Hitchhiker s guide to the galaxy in the audiobook format  First book was read by Stephen Fry and it s a treat    Completely irreverent  I laughed on almost every page  LOVE MARVIN  Read as part of The Ultimate Hitchhiker s Guide but chose to review individually because of the different books and my feelings towards them  Awesome  Absolutely the best sense of humor anyone could ever have  Doug Adams was a GEM and I miss him  Also read his Dirk Gently detective novels  I recommend you take them on long plane trips so people around you can wonder why you keep laughing out loud  Absurd  Hilarious  Creative  Este libro es un divague total y me encanta  Un muchacho que se entera de golpe que su amigo es  nada mas y nada menos  QUE UN EXTRATERRESTRE Y LO LLEVA DE VIAJE POR LA GALAXIA  Increible  Genial  Sublime  LOCURA  Quiero eso para mi vida  Menos la parte de que explotan la tierra  Un libro con un humor muy divertido  hilarante y que plantea escenarios que dan pie a imaginarse cosas muy geniales y raras  cosa que cuando despues vi la pelicula me di cuenta que se quedaron muy cortos con las escenografias y las adaptaciones de los diferentes personajes del espacio  Me muero de emocion de solo pensar en el libro  ya necesito leer los demas   Una toalla es el objeto mas importante que un autoestopista galactico lleva en su equipaje  Even though the first time I read this book I didn t understand large chunks of it  I think I was ten   I was still fascinated  I ve read it hundreds of times since and I m still fascinated  This is just a ridiculously wonderful and uplifting book  It s a good thing it s so well known because there is no way I can write an effective review other than to just suggest that if you haven t read it yet  you ought to  This book had a great potential for a series It seems that there is already several books following this  So much better with a reread  Now a mega fan  This is the funniest book i ever read  Every page was funny from the beginning to the end and the plot twist was very interesting  I am very into reading serious literature and decided to take a break and read something silly  it was a good choice and I highly recommend it anyone looking to enjoy themselves with a good read  Cool  D Pure genius  This book is finely ground  free range  fair trade  organic  unadulterated genius  You know that question people sometimes ask   If you could have dinner with three people  dead or alive  who would you choose   Well  I m not quite sure yet about the other two  but Douglas Adams would definitely get a dinner invite  I d love to pick his brains over a shepherds pie  The man  Is  A  Genius  I read this book a while ago  and I still love it to this day  Douglas Adams takes humankind and puts them on a much larger scale  The entire universe  Unbeknownst to Arthur Dent  his house his scheduled for demolition to make way for a new bypass Unbeknownst to us  Earth is scheduled for demolition to make way for a massive intergalactic bypass  So when Ford Prefect  Arthur s long time friend and secretly an alien from a small planet in the vicinity of Betelgeuse  realizes what s about to happen  he hitchhikes with Arthur onto a Vogon spaceship and across the galaxy  while meeting some pretty interesting people  like Tricia  Trillian  McMillan  Zaphod Beeblebrox  aka  President of the Galaxy   Marvin  an android suffering chronic depression  and Slartibartfast  the designer of Norway s fjords  Throughout their insane adventures  they encounter the horrors of Vogon poetry  evil mice bent on learning  The Ultimate Question   and Deep Thought  a supercomputer built to give the answer to the same question My dad was a big fan of Douglas Adams when he was young  so it was only a matter of time before he introduced me to the books and the original BBC TV series  I saw the 2005 film much more recently  with the talents of Martin Freeman  Mos Def  Zooey Deschanel  and Warrick Davis  among many others  This book has wit  humor  and plays around with the idea that we re really not alone in the universe  in fact we never have been  Douglas Adam s crafty writing and satire is a blast to read  and I spent almost the whole time laughing out loud  I would recommend this book to fans of Sc Fi  especially those who like Doctor Who  Star Trek  Star Wars  etc  Even if you re not a sci fi fan  and you just want a witty and mind blowing book to read  this is for you  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams is a great way to break anyone into the science fiction genre  Even if you don t necessarily enjoy the sci fi elements  the satire based humor and the compelling story will be cause enough to finish it  Hilariously fun  If you like Monty Python type humor you ll love this    First off  there is very little plot going on  There is also little to no character development  So if you re looking for epic plot and evolving characters  this is not your book If you don t need either of those two things and just want to have a good time  let me say this  This book is hilarious  There wasn t a dull moment  It is absurd and random without being absurdly random  Read it  Buying that Ultimate Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy omnibus was a good move on my part  pats self on back  I love the writing style  Can t wait to read the rest  It is a very interesting it is filled with comedy  action and a bit of thriller I find beautifully crafted and I highly recommend  By page 50  i really believed i was gonna rate this book 2 or 3 stars maximum  Yeah sure it is pretty amusing and funny  but still i couldn t grasp the story s line or purpose  in other words  nothing was there to force me keep reading  However the mere fact that my final rating is 5 indicates that a whole lot have changed in the final 150 pages   I highly recommend it  and i am surely gonna finish the whole series  N B   the movie is nothing compared to it     Buenas risas y reflexiones interesantes en un ambiente espacial  Divertido con ganas Lo recomendaria especialmente para aquellos avezados en la ciencia ficcion  que reconoceran muchos mas detallitos y disfrutaran aun mas con el El resto de la critica  aqui   http   meitnerio blogspot com es 2013    This book taught me enjoing life as it is and making story in my life  Most creative book I have ever read  Extraordinary and elegant humor  Love this book  It stays on the special shelf in my soul        The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy mainly is a story of the Earth being destroyed a few minutes from its completion of the task of finding the ultimate question of the universe  The characters zip all over space because one of them was from Earth and has no home  I think that Douglass Adams is writing the book to be funny  and he writes everything in chronological order  He writes the book about another book of the same title and quotes that book in italics  He is quite good at using realistic dialogue  which is very effective at making the reader feel that they are in the story  Adams  writing seems to be very predictable  For instance  when Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect are about to be thrown out of the Vogon ship  he gives the chances of them being saved  and  of course  they are  The inclusion of the character Marvin the paranoid android is evidence of his comic intent  Marvin has no significant part in the plot  he just tags along making funny comments about how everybody and everything hates him  When he isn t talking he is sitting in a corner acting dejected  or contemplating suicide  I say that he uses realistic dialogue because he uses common slang words and bad grammar that are common usage nowadays  I think that Adams  is a good writer and that The Hitchhiker s guide to the Galaxy is a very interesting book  along with being quite comical  I say that it is interesting because it was a completely new idea to me  having the Earth be a computer created by beings of higher intelligence for their own good  This is an interesting idea because most people believe that Earth was created by either God or chance  not higher beings  It sort of makes me feel like I am a pawn of somebody else  not that I actually believe this  I just mean it as if this book were a proven fact   I mention the comic element of this book because of the frequent funny parts  For instance  Slartibarfast s name  There is no possible reason for having a character named Slartibarfast other than for the soul purpose of being funny  I think that The Hitchhiker s guide to the Galaxy is also a very brief story  as in the sense that it is short and to the point  For example  the Earth is destroyed  and the characters are halfway around the universe  and learn the answer to the ultimate question in life  42   and learn the purpose of the Earth all in about 20 pages  Overall  I really liked this book  Okay  I can t believe I haven t read this book by now  A must read for every half intelligent human being  funnay I just finished reading this for the 3rd time this summer  August 2013  and still find the humor in the book to be hilarious  Wish that I could write fiction like he did  If you ve never heard about this book  you must have at least read about it  It s one of the best books I ve ever read and the only reason why I haven t read it 5822649 times yet is that there s not enough days in a lifetime  Everyone who doesn t like it should go and jump off a cliff because they are just stealing the precious oxygen of us who know where our towel is  P S  If you know a Babel fish dealer  send me his address  please    Cosa c e di cosi spiacevole nell essere ubriachi      Chiedilo a un bicchiere d acqua   E a dire il vero ci si sente un po  cosi  all interno di questo romanzo  Sconclusionato quanto basta  mi ha fatto sorridere piu volte  anche se non appartiene al genere di libri che leggo di solito Ma passando a cose serie  se cercate le risposte a  ehm  qual era la domanda Sregolatamente geniale  e un libro che va letto  un po  perche e stato un cult degli anni  70  un po  perche stuzzica cosi come allora  Buona viaggio autostoppisti  Loved it  MY FAVOURITE BOOK  THE HITCHHIKER S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY is one of those books that sits at the very top of that narrow category of science fiction comedy  My review certainly ins t going to influence people to read it or not  if you re a Goodreads member and this genre appeals to you  chances are you ve read it long before you re reading this  I first discovered this book many years ago  back when Douglas Adams was happily still walking this Earth with us  It s about an English everyman named Arthur Dent who wakes up to find out his house is about to be destroyed to make way for a new highway  Then things just get worse from there  as he bounces around the universe with his best friend  who happens to be an alien   a girl he once met at a party  an insane two headed president of the entire universe  and a depressed robot Adams  tells a mind blowing story about the origins of the Earth and the mystery behind the Earth s purpose  but this is just window dressing for a bizarre and hilarious parade of short asides about the mysteries of the universe and the things that Dent discovers on his journey  The entire novel feels like a cross between an episode of Monty Python s Flying Circus and a conversation with a brilliant writer with a keen knowledge of good dialogue  lunatic situations and deep science fiction knowledge  For the full experience  you should seek out the massive collection that contains all five of his novels  The first one will always be the most richest and well contained story for me  they even made a British mini series and an under appreciated movie out of it   but it s worth reading every satirical  brilliant  hilarious book  So grab your towel and don t panic   this belongs on every sci fi fan s bookshelf   The suspicion that the earthman Arthur Dent had of his friend Ford Prefect being originally from a small planet in the vicinity of Betelgeuse and not from Guilford  as he had always claimed  was None at All  None at all also happens to be the amount of damage that the bulldozer about to knock down Arthur Dent s house on the Thursday on which this story begins would suffer  Ford Prefect is a researcher for The Hitchhiker s guide to the Galaxy  in which the Earth s entire entry is one word  Harmless  Of course  in the newer version  it is updated to  Mostly Harmless   By the way  The Hitchhikers guide to the galaxy has surpassed the Encyclopedia Galactica as the standard repository of all knowledge for two main reasons 1  It is slightly cheaper 2  It has the words  Don t Panic  written in large  friendly letters on the front cover   Yes  letters can be friendly   While Arthur Dent is lying in front of this bulldozer  he finds out that he has a much bigger problem than his house being knocked down  When the earth is demolished  Ford and him hitch a lift on a Vogon ship  But then they have to endure listening to Vogon poetry  which is  of course  the 3rd worse in the universe  The vogons then promptly throw them off of the ship  and something extremely improbable happens  They get picked up by the Starship heart of Gold  and meet Zaphod Beeblebrox  The best bang since the Big one   Marvin  The Paranoid Android   and Trillian  the girl who Arthur met at a very nice party  but whom went off with someone named  Phil  who claimed to be from another planet  Zaphod has 2 heads  Phil had a bird cage on his shoulder  so you could probably guess who he really was  This story really doesn t follow a very logical order  and can get extremely random at some points  due to the Heart of Gold containing the Infinite improbability drive  For example  at one point in the story a Sperm Whale and a bowl of petunias are called into existence a few miles above an alien planet  The Sperm Whale tries to make as many inferences as it can about its life and the air whooshing past its head before hitting the ground  the only thought the bowl of Petunias has is  Oh no  Not again  By the way  if you continue reading this series  you do get to find out why the bowl of petunias thought that  Also  we are informed about why a towel is the most important thing in the universe   This is definitely among my favorite books  There are just so many great quotes in it about the universe  such as very good one from the Hitchhiker s guide to the Galaxy which you can find out if you read it  If you are reading this right now  then stop and go read this book  DON T PANICALWAYS KNOW WHERE YOUR TOWEL IS  I know this book by heart  but I still love it  The original BBC radio broadcast is even better though    42 Hilarious  This book had me laughing out loud so many times  I had to put the book down because my head hurt On top of all the comedy  the book has a great story line  The only downside to the book  is some of the sci fi scenes are a little difficult to comprehend  and the writing doesn t give a good description of what is happening  But this book is amazing  Chris   I was looking on Goodreads at the  Best Books ever  and saw  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  and thought I d comment on this  trilogy in five parts   I ve read this book  as well as  The Restaurant at the End of the Universe    Life  the Universe and Everything    So Long  and Thanks For All the Fish   and  Mostly Harmless  and enjoyed them and their amusing writing  Last year  I also re  read  them by listening to them as audiobooks during my commute  Good times   And I ve even read  And Another Thing     the 6th book in the series  penned by Eoin Colfer in 2009  and I think he did a great job of capturing the characters  and Adams interesting turn of phrase and writing style  In fact  I liked this book better then Mostly Harmless and recommend others read it too  Thinking about it  I need to re read  Dirk Gently s Holistic Detective Agency   and  The Long Dark Tea Time of the Soul  as it s been a while   And I can t remember if I ever read the sequel  Long Dark Tea     Some books make you never want to stop reading  The kind of books that you wake up early in the morning so you can get a few more pages down before the day starts This is one of them You ll either love or hate how insanely nonsensical it can be  personally I love it  It s such a nice release from dull ordinary being  Its unashamedly silly  but it manages to be silly in a very intelligent way  This  of course  is a book I ve meant to read for quite some time  I even started reading it once before  This was before I got distracted and put it down  I m glad I finally put the babel fish into my ear  The first book is quite short and it just ends  I can see where Adams was told to finish the page he was on and turn it in   I m not sure I could even say if there was a beginning  middle and end  But boy oh boy is it one of the most quotable books out there I ve ever had the pleasure of reading  I think this is something that most people should read  if only  because of its humor  I don t usually find myself in the habit of laughing out loud at books  though it has been known to happen  but The Guide is so absurd and apt that I would be surprised at those who didn t find it funny  I do think though that there are those out there who might be put off by the absurdity and maybe this isn t for those people  This is on of my favorite books ever  douglas adams does a good shop in crafting a funny and interesting  The story is about earth being destroyed and the only person who survived was a everyday english man who happen to be friends with a humanoid alien  As the main character named arthur goes and a anverture meeting many people on the way to find the meaning of life  Assolutamente meraviglioso  Un ottima lettura che mi ha tenuta compagnia nel corso di questi due giorni cosi stressanti a causa della scuola Non vedo l ora di comprare gli altri libri della saga   Just fun WARNING  READING THIS BOOK IN PUBLIC MAY AFFECT OTHERS  OPINIONS OF YOU BECAUSE  1  YOU WILL RANDOMLY BREAK OUT INTO EXTREME FITS OF GIGGLING 2  WHEN EXPLAINING THAT THE NOVEL IS ABOUT A GROUP OF PEOPLE  INCLUDING A DEPRESSED ROBOT  AND A 2 HEADED EX PRESIDENT OF THE GALAXY SEARCHING FOR THE PERSON WHO IS REALLY IN CHARGE OF THE GALAXY  THE PRESIDENT IS JUST A FRONT TO KEEP THE MASSES DISTRACTED FROM WHAT THE  GOVERNMENT IS DOING  WHICH IS NOTHING   PEOPLE WILL LOOK AT YOU FUNNY No  seriously  the enjoyment I got from this book is roughly equal to getting brained with a lemon tied around a solid gold brick   coincidentally the same effect as drinking a Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster  And that is because I do enjoy satires  love them in fact  and Adams is so skilled in just slipping those little sardonic comments on government  people  and philosophers that I was tied up in fits of giggles every time I cracked the cover  Though the humor could be mistaken for a sort of slap stick comedy every humorous comment has barbs that will prick someone  Plus the wit   oh the wit   is amazing  Definitely in the top ten of all time   I loved this book  from the witty and clever writing down to the overall quite interresting story  I d heard so much about it i was really happy to start reading it  and if there s book that deserves its reputation  it s this one  I m just a bit sad that i do not own the following 4 books and that they are hard to find in english here    Because i definitly want to read more of that  Sci fi and humor absolutely my preference  Hilarious  well written  no dull moments ever  I would say it has to be in the top 50 must read books     GNIZAMA Kush e don Sci F l ijen  should read this  One of my all time favorite book  Just finished reading it for the umpteenth time  I re read the whole series every once in a while  It s been at least two years  and I ve missed my friends Arthur  Zaphod  Trillian  and Marvin  Glad they re still just as funny and entertaining  This book never gets old  I liked this book  Very funny  Especially Marvin  the manically depressed robot  I had seen the movie a while back with Martin Freeman but forgot most of it  Still  i read it with those characters images and voices stuck in my head  which made it a bit more enjoyable for me  I will be continuing this series for sure  Next stop  The Restaurant at the End of the Universe  The first time I read this book  it was my sixteenth birthday and I read it in the Dutch translation  which is  in hindsight  surprisingly well done   My friend and I were reading it out loud to each other and we were literally crying with laughter at the absurdity and the wicked cleverness of it It doesn t lose any of its power on the many re reads I ve done  A classic   I thoroughly enjoyed this book  It was entertaining  clever  and funny throughout the whole story  The characters were likable  which made it easy to keep rooting for them as they traveled across the galaxy  The story had such elaborate aspects  such as all the entries that were made in the guide  making the story a pleasurable experience  Also  I enjoyed how there was such a random aspect to the book  where the reader would never know what was going to come next  For instance  at one point in the book the main characters had nuclear missiles being shot at them  and just as they were about to hit their ship  the ship turned them into a flower and a whale  This randomness created a general amusement always kept a desire to keep reading throughout the book The writing style was witty  and made me laugh multiple times while reading  It gave detailed descriptions of what was happening  so even the weirdest of scenes made sense  This book was a great read  It had a nice ending that set up perfectly for the next books to come  I will definitely be reading the other books in the series and know that they will be just as well written and clever as this book was  brilliant book almost as good as the radio series  Love this crazy book   in fact I have read the whole series several times  Tattoos are forever  You have to wonder if those super fans that  say  got the entire cast of Twilight tattooed on their back are starting to regret that decision now  The reason I bring up tattoos in a review of a book is that in my entire life  I ve deemed one thing tattoo worthy  And that would be this You might recognize that as the hitchhiker featured on the cover of The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  I first read the book when I was probably 13 or 14 and to say it spoke to me would be an understatement  It shaped my views on everything from religion and science to things like fjords and British people  It formed in me the idea that the real problem humans have coming to grips with their place in the universe is the inability to conceive of infinity and long period of time  Rereading it now as an adult  an for at least the dozenth time  I m struck by how well it holds up  particularly in the idea of  the 1   as represented by Megrathea s planet producing enterprise exclusively for the super rich in the universe  And on top of all that  it s hysterically funny       and don t forget to bring your towel   I thoroughly enjoyed this book as i followed the adventures of Arthur Dent  a hapless earthman who  on one bad morning  got his house demolished for building a bypass  and his planet as well for construction of a hyperspace bypass  Ford Prefect  a hitchhiker who was stranded on earth for 15 years  Zaphod Beeblebrox  semi half cousin to Ford and the kleptomaniac president of the Imperial Galactic Government  Trillian  his nagging girlfriend  and Marvin  a chronically depressed robot  as they travel through space in Heart Of Gold  Mostly Harmless and Highly Recommended   My life is ruled by Douglas Adams  trilogy of five books  I have read  watched and listened to them so many times that occasionally when I swear I say  HOLY ZARQUON SINGING FISH    or  BELGIUM   In fact Douglas Adams is my hero   I love the book and generally if you don t love it  you hate it  That s just the way it is with The Hithchiker s Guide to the Galaxy   Life  don t talk to me about life   awesome book  o My partner loved this book when he was young  so I bought a copy and read it  and added in little side notes and funny pictures and dubbed it  The Bitchhiker s Edit   It was marvelous   SF  I ve been putting off reading this for a very long time as I was scared of it not being wonderful  It s such a big part of geek culture  what if I thought it was dumb   But it wasn t  It was wonderful  It s like Monty Python and Kurt Vonnegut melted together and spread on toast    crisp and tangy and a little bit ridiculous  Plus it turns out that a lot of what I like about Terry Pratchett is the same stuff that Adams does so well  If only someone had told me  Geeks  if you suffer from the same fears of nonwonderfulness as I did  don t be afraid  Read this book  though beware that it ends abruptly  I assume that the second one takes up right where this one leaves off    A computer whose merest operational parameters I am not worthy to calculate  and yet I will design it for you  A computer that can calculate the Question to the Ultimate Answer  a computer of such infinite and subtle complexity that organic life itself shall form part of its operational matrix  And you yourselves shall take on new forms and go down into the computer to navigate its ten million year program  Yes  I shall design this computer for you  And I shall name it also unto you  And it shall be called   the Earth  So many brilliant quotes  Absolutely amazing book  Dancing language and thoughtful metaphors and anaphors for society  Brilliant  I ll read the next book for sure  A known classic available in a lot of media forms  it represents the best of Douglas Adams because of his hard work to create a playfully plausible universe  Plot aside this brilliant creative exercise is the reason the book is so memorable  with the mental gymnastics needed to come up with things like the Improbability Drive or the Babel Fish and his particular style being a winning combination to create what are now popular references  a true legacy Plot wise the biggest fault seems to be he never came to terms with the position of the Earth in his universe  It s either a pale blue dot or something relevant to the interests of everyone in every dimension  and that Adams lives and dies by his eccentric self conscious dynamic duo of characters  If you can t stand one of them the whole experience falls pretty quickly apparently  Zaphod and Ford rotate nicely on the former role  With Zaphod crossing the line a couple of times  but the latter is entirely taken by Arthur Dent  leaving what should have been another interesting perspective from Trillian as  the girl  Other minor flaws come with the constant use of the word men for apparently most races and the usual stuff that comes up when time travel is a thingBut who are we kidding  the quotes alone are 5 star worthy El absurdo aplicado a la Ciencia Ficcion  La  guia     cuenta la historia del ultimo humano    en realidad  del ultimo terrestre  por lo que el sabe  debido a que el planeta tierra ha sido demolido para construir una autopista galactica  Y aun cuando los planos y planes han estado a disposicion de todos los habitantes de la galaxia en las oficinas centrales del ministerio de obras publicas  nadie se quejo o intento detenerlo  Asi pues  inicia una aventura desternillante y delirante  condimentada con memorable personajes  tales como marvin  el robot con depresion  Ford Prefect  autoestopista profesional que trabaja para la  guia del autoestopista galactico   Zaphod Beeblebrox  presidente galactico y esquizofrenico  Trillian  la otra humana salvada del desastre  y   como olvidarlo  la protagonista absoluta de la historia  la guia del autoestopista galactico  un artilugio para consultar la mas vasta enciclopedia sobre todo lo conocido  y desconocido  del universo Esta novela es la primera de una  trilogia en cinco partes   Por lo tanto  importa menos QUE pasa  versus COMO se relata  Es en el uso del lenguaje  las referencias en la  guia     y las disgreciones sobre cada cosa que sucede  sus implicaciones y sus repercusiones en el pasado y en el futuro lo que hacen a esta novela tan divertida  An ingenious work   The book I decided to read for IR is The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams  This book to me was a thriller and always had me at the edge of my seat  This entire book was about a man named Arthur Dent and his friend Ford Prefect trying to find their way to the end of the galaxy after their home planet  Earth  was destroyed only to become a highway  One major theme of this book is that there is always light at the end of the tunnel because in the end  there is always good out of everything  Overall  I felt that this book was a really fun and somewhat quick read and I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a sci fi novel  In the beginning  the book starts in a small town outside of England where we meet our protagonist  Arthur Dent  Soon enough  Arthur and his best friend  Ford Prefect  are about to be killed when the Earth is about to be destroyed to become a highway  In the final minutes as the planet is being destroyed  the two friends get picked up on a Vogon alien ship where they are saved  Turns out  the Vogons were the ones destroying the planet and both men are ejected from the spaceship  Both of the two protagonists are then picked up by some of Ford s friends in a ship called the  Heart of Gold   which was stolen  With the ship  everyone was looking forward to heading to the planet of Magrathea  where Arthur says   The suspense is killing me  51   When they all arrive to Magrathea  they search the planet for a supercomputer  where they will ask it for the meaning of life  which in the end  turns out to be the number 42  The end of the novel ends with them eating a nice lunch at The Restaurant at the End of the Universe   In the end  I believed this book was very interesting to say the least  I believe that I have read some better books but I think this novel was still good  While reading the book  I thought that I could ve spent my time reading something a bit closer to my genre of reading  Anyone who wants to read a sci fi novel will sure love this one  After spending a lot of my time reading this book  I believe it could ve had a better ending but I still believe it is worth reading   xkcd reveals the Kindle s secret identity which has me in stitches  and oh  my  when the Kindle and the Nook  etc   came out  why didn t I think of the first time Ford Prefect pulled out his copy of the Hitchhiker s Guide to show Arthur Dent    The sub title  A Trilogy in Four Parts gives a clue as the subversively funny nature of this science fiction  Don t panic in large friendly letters  Never forget where you left your towel  The sheer torture awfulness of Vogon poetry  The conundrum of philiosopher and the zebra crossing  A pan galactic gargleblaster  There are so many elements of this fabulous series of books that are etched into my cultural DNA  British author Douglas Adams may not be everyone s cup of tea  but his hero Arthur Dent certainly is mine t A spoon full of sugar helps the medicine go down  Fantastic  everyone should read it   it s hilarious and I swear marvin is my spirit animal  Marvellous  Such a great sci fi BRILLIANT  It was as funny as I thought it would be  This book blew my mind  There is so much nonsense that it makes sense  does it make sense    p   Always an enjoyable read I have loved this book since I was eleven years old  It s not really meant for someone that young  but I loved it anyway  The wit and humor of Douglas Adams is  in my opinion  unmatched by any except Oscar Wilde  another favorite of mine   The novel hilariously satirizes bureaucracy in all of its forms and features some of the best quotes you ll ever find in a book  If you re anything like me  you ll be pulling them out at every opportunity and frequently annoying those around you with your constant repetition of Adams s incomparable writing   Leitura ligeira que de uma forma divertida eleva ao ridiculo a vida e os problemas humanos  Vale a pela ler esta satira que nos faz  rir de nos proprios  dos nossos habitos e da nossa busca metafisica  Depois de o ler e compreensivel que o leitor veja as toalhas de maneira diferente e que tenha outro respeito ao numero 42  Must read   if you re a fan of randomness   I loved loved LOVED this book  It was my all time favorite sci fi book ever  Its mainly based on all the humor and irony of the universe  As the main character Arthur is being kicked out of his house so that the government can build a road over it  Then his crazed friend ford tells him the world will end as aliens send a transmission saying that they will demolish their world so they can build a galactic road over it  Ford and Arthur escape the planet with only peanuts  a towel  and the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy  I highly recommend this book for anyone who love witty humor and the factor of inconceivable ridiculousness  A blissfully and refreshing novel with its fair share of shenanigans and quirks that are simply a delight to indulge in  Very well written and funny   Funny  smart  fast read  Genuine laugh out loud moments  Strongly recommend it  I can t think of a better book that matches the way my mind seems to work  Adams  seemingly random thought processes tell a wonderful story  or multiple stories  filled with adventure  humor  sci fi goodness  and a healthy dose of sarcasm  He also manages to portray how relatively small we really are  nothing makes you feel more insignificant than ending up in a different universe and millions of lightyears from home  Just don t forget to bring a towel  The first book where I laughed out loud reading every page  The first time I saw this book  it was in a class full of upper classmen in high school  I thought the kid reading it was trying to learn how to hitchhike  and I thought  how weird  Years later  I picked up the book  read it  and loved how the narration just leapt over the moon and kept running through the stars   Wow  My friend recommended me this book and now I m really thankful for it  British humor with an absurd expressions are absolutely fantastic  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is in my top of books now  so if you like this genre  I can only recommend it  Stephen Fry reads this book  So  awesome book   awesome reader   unbelievable amounts of awesomeness  This book is hilarious to begin with  and Fry s reading makes it even more hilarious  There were times I was listening to this on the bus and I just burst out laughing  and everyone looked at me like I was crazy  I just looked back at them like they were crazy This is the kind of book where things happen for no reason  kind of like life  Writing teachers always tell you to stick to the plot  don t write about anything unless it directly relates to the action  but Adams ignores all that and explores the little side tangents and effects of the main action to hilarious effect  But all this exploring also makes us question how our mundane actions affect the world This book never takes itself seriously  It s a good reminder to never take ourselves too seriously  either  I loved this book  I found it funny  sarcastic  and ironic  It was vey entertaining  The end threw me off  as it seemed to just end abruptly  I thought I was actually missing a part of the book  The Hitch Hiker s Guide to the GalaxyBy Douglas Adams I read The Hitch Hiker s Guide to the Galaxy  a humorous science fiction book written by Douglas Adams and published by William Heinemann  The book captures the accidental travels of Arthur Dent  a normal British man  whose friend  Ford Prefect  happened to be from Betelgeuse  When the Earth is destroyed to make a hyperspace overpass  Arthur is the only one to escape  Arthur and Ford are captured by an alien race and ejected into space  and just barely hitch a ride on a very powerful ship that was stolen by the President of the Galaxy  This ship was called the Heart of Gold  and it was very powerful because it had an engine called an Infinite Improbability Drive  This engine allowed one to go anywhere as long as one knew exactly how improbable it would be that they would go to that place  With this ship  Arthur  Ford  and Zaphod Beeblebrox  the president  who happened to be a good friend of Ford s  find a lost planet called Magrathea  Magrathea was the heart of a great planet making civilization that collapsed because even though everybody on it was rich  everyone who was in other parts of the galaxy lived in abject poverty  In Magrathea  our heroes meet a strange man  see gigantic planet making facilities  and learn about the Answer  What answer  The answer to Life  the Universe  and Everything  of course  I really liked this book  It was very interesting and quirky  Douglas Adams has crafted a strange and detailed world  full of interesting twists to reveal even more creative storytelling  However  it can be very confusing for less experienced readers  as it is full of sometimes painstaking detail  Also  I sometimes found that the plot moving too slowly or too quickly  In addition  the ending is not very satisfying if the entire series is not read  so I suggest reading the entire series  For me  if was worth it  But overall  I think that it was a magnificently creative book that I suggest for any fan of science fiction  An awesome book  I loved how Douglas Adams wrote  he wrote like no other author I ve read before  He wrote with passion  I could hear that he loved writing  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  If you are looking for a comical book this is the one of the  must read  comedy books  From a depressed robot to a whale floating in space  This book was just so random it was very funny  I would recommend this book to anyone who loves Si Fi  For me I m more of a guy who loves classics and I m not that interested in Si Fi books but as soon as I read the first couple of chapters it just made me want to read more Arthur Dent is ordinary person until his odd friend Ford saves him from the destruction of Earth  What will happen now  What are they going to run into  Who will they meet now  Es dificil que un libro me haga reir como este lo hizo  Inventivo  Lleno de imaginacion  Con un toque satirico perfecto  Sci Fi classic   awesome book  incredibly funny  Be sure and read the foreword and the introduction too  Arthur s experiences are just too much  You will be entertained all the way through the book  I had it in audio read by the author and it was really cool to hear it in his voice  There was even a radio show about this book a long time ago  It has been a very popular book through the years  Re reading this for the n th time  and it s still a damn good read  Quite possibly my favourite comedy book  A little shorter than I expected  but overall a fantastic book  Very silly  with the kind of British humor that I really appreciate   Picked this book up on a whim at the goodwill and boy did it deliver  Great read that hooked me from beginning to end  The depths of the universe that Adams created is mesmerizing to say the least  Highly recommend and this book will be making its way onto my favorites list for sure    For a moment  nothing happened  Then  after a second or so  nothing continued to happen   For instance  on the planet Earth  man had always assumed that he was more intelligent than dolphins because he had achieved so much  the wheel  New York  wars and so on  whilst all the dolphins had ever done was muck about in the water having a good time  But conversely  the dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent than man  for precisely the same reasons  These are just a few examples of the humor riddled within this book  Now I must say that I am not a fan of scifi  However I am a fan of witty humor  especially in books since I started appreciating them a lot when I started reading the Discworld series  Even though I don t enjoy the setting I do love everything else about the books  The characters are so believable since they act as how you might act in these situations with your friends  The characters are really likeable and fun to follow in the story  The plot never dies down and is always full of action and it is always developing  Finally the humor is just great  When you sit with a lighthearted book like this you seriously enjoy your time and don t feel heavy or burdened  Obviously humor is a very subjective issue however I really enjoyed the dry British humor found in this book  Hopefully the next books in the series won t disappoint  5 5  http   nwhyte livejournal com 1383839 htmlI more or less knew this book by heart when I was twelve  and the Adams genius still works for me  most of the good lines are in the various other incarnations of the story  but one or two are only found here   for instance  the information that Arthur  wasn t aware of ever having felt an organic part of anything  He had always seen this as one of his problems   Sometimes the magic survives  three decades on The edition I read is the movie tie in which comes with 100 pages of back matter about the making of the film  which  I watched a year or so back   my verdict is that the Zooey Deschanel   Martin Freeman chemistry is the best thing about it   Interesting to find that most of the  pretty radical and thorough  plot changes in the film dated back to Douglas Adams  own adaptation efforts  there is a rather self deprecating piece by scriptwriter Karey Carmichael explaining that he didn t do much and was sort of filling in time between The Chicken Run and Charlotte s Web  The main cast are also interviewed  and I have to say that Mos Def comes across much better on the page than he did as Ford Prefect on screen   The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy  is a comedic science fiction romp that follows Arthur Dent  a human male  and Ford Perfect  a Betelgeusian male disguised as a human being  after Earth is unexpectedly demolished to make way for a hyperspace bypass by the Vogon race  The story involves  The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy  which is a fictional guide book for hitchhikers travelling throughout space When I met Marvin  the Paranoid Android  I couldn t help but think of my favorite band Radiohead and their song  Paranoid Android  off of their album OK Computer  The name of the song is in fact taken from the book  and according to my research  was initially intended to be a humorous song  Lead singer Thom Yorke had said the title  was chosen as a joke  It was like   Oh  I m so depressed   And I just thought  that s great  That s how people would like me to be  And that was the end of writing about anything personal in the song  The rest of the song is not personal at all   I had this same feeling while reading the parts of the book with Marvin    Oh  I m so depressed   I absolutely loved this book and almost everything about it   especially the humor  While there was plenty of slapstick British humor that might normally turn me off to a novel such as this  there was plenty of darker humor that I enjoyed  I specifically think of the section that mentions the nonexistence of God    It proves you exist  and so therefore  by your own arguments  you don t  QED   Oh dear   says God   I hadn t thought of that   and promptly vanished in a puff of logic   This section made me laugh out loud while reading for this first time in a while  Part of my enjoyment of this novel may have been statements like this that aligned to my philosophical beliefs  part of it may have been the dark humor of the novel  but overall I enjoyed what the humor of this novel and what it discussed I think this novel could work for a YA setting  Teens could enjoy this novel for merely the story and all its humor and absurdity  but it might not be a great book to use for lit study as it doesn t really have an apparent theme as much as it does an ethos  The mentioning of atheism  use of science and logic over faith  and contempt for capitalism may be controversial topics that teens may not be ready to deal with  While it seems ever apparent that teens are dealing with more severe and complex issues  especially as evidenced through their literature  Fault In Our Stars  Perks of Being A Wallflower  etc    this book does not discuss issues such as cancer  teen pregnancy  suicide  etc  Rather  this book questions some philosophy upon existence  which a child might not be ready to contemplate or grapple with  Ultimately  I find that this work is best suited for someone who will end up enjoying the dark humor that I like   Hunter S  Thompson  Kurt Vonnegut  and Chuck Pahlniuk  I ve read all five books in German when I was a teen  and read it again in its original English What can I say   it s a short  but hilarious journey of a guy who happens to become part of an intergalactic odyssey  The characters are over the top  just like every other aspect of this british space opera  If you like irony  sarcasm and don t bother the absence of logic  you should give this hilarious ride a shot Like the Matrix  it s hard to describe what this book is  you have to experience it yourself   In my opinion  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy was one of the finest books ever written  The book is extremely random and funny thought  and manages to maintain a degree of coherency that books of similar writing styles cannot achieve  It has fascinating characters  settings    and lore which gives the reader a sense of actually being part of the Guide s universe and the book s palatable length of around 150 pages means that it is impossible to have an excuse for not reading it  I m not sure how I avoided this classic for so long but I finally read it and loved every minute of it  It s quirky  funny  and very smart  My only complaint is that the book is far too short  However  this made for an enjoyable fast paced read and it s a book I will definitely read more than once  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy was an amazing story  It had so many turns and hills that you have to climb while reading  If you are a visual learner like me then you picture so many things  Ford and Arthur have an amazing journey  Traversing through the galaxy  exploring planets  and meeting alien life forms would be an amazing journey  Especially meeting a grumpy race like the Vogons  They try to torture people with speeches which is quite entertaining  The rest that you learn about them you will have to find out on your own  Arthur and Ford are like Yin and Yang  One tries to make the best out of every circumstance and the other just see s the negative side of life  The 2 put together are a hilarious outcome  Arthur is basically trying to process being in outer space while Ford talks about it as if its a normal thing  which it is  Arthur is wearing his morning wardrobe the entire book which is very interesting if you think about it  Traveling the universe one bathrobe at a time   The author uses all kinds of terms that get you thinking  I believe that is a pretty interesting technique to use  Some people like me have to wrap their brain around some of the terms being used  I was a little confused for a little while and then I constantly kept rereading the parts I was getting stuck on and I finally started understanding everything  The author wants you to think about the story  and when you are thinking about it you have to think hard  If you aren t focused you may get confused or lost inside the book  Finally I just really wanna say this is probably my favorite book out right now  I love all the turns and mountains that you climb as well as the hilarious humor that is being used inside the book   this was good       very good and a great summer read This book is amazing I find it hilarious and smart as well as random in some places  I can hardly find fault in it hardly really the only problem I have with this book is that sometimes it s a little dry  probably because the author is British   Now on to the story the story starts off with a man named Arthur dent who is just a normal person living in London  with a digital watch  until he discovers that his house is scheduled to be demolished to make way for a road  Just then a fleet of space ships fly over the earth and say the earth is scheduled for demolition to make way for an intergalactic highway  Then Ford who it turns out is an alien from a planet some where in the vicinity of Betelgeusetakes Arthur and hitches a ride with one of the ships seconds before the earth is destroyed  What follows is an amazing adventure that you just need to read it for yourself to find out how good it is   A Unique book  enjoyed it very  very  very much  The blue whale bit was my favorite  I laughed a lot which is a thing that doesn t usually happens while reading  Absolutely one of my favorites  Pretty darn good  I wish I had read it before I saw the movie  but neither disappoint  And the integrity of the story shines through  I m very happy with this series and will plow through the rest far too quickly   This planet has   or rather had   a problem  which was this  most of the people living on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time  Many solutions were suggested for this problem  but most of these were largely concerned with the movement of small green pieces of paper  which was odd because on the whole it wasn t the small green pieces of paper that were unhappy Arthur Dent wakes up to a bright sunny Thursday morning only to find out that his house is going to be torn down to pave way for a bypass  The problem is dwarfed when he finds out that the Earth is going get blown up to make way for an intergalactic bypass  What follows is a series of bizarre events through Arthur s bumpy ride through the galaxy  And that forms the first part of the classic five part series Much like Arthur s journey through the Galaxy  the readers will get to experience a range of reactions  Before the oddity of one event could sink in  another one even more bizarre shows up  The novel has abundant dose of Comedy and Science to get the readers hooked  However  the novel does have some serious twists and turns which will definitely prod one into reading the next installment of the series Bottom Line  The Hitchhiker s guide to the Galaxy is the best book to start with  if you want to take a plunge into the Sci Fi genre   The Hitchhiker s Guide to the galaxy follows Arthur Dent on his interstellar journey from when the Earth explodes to the rest of his life as a space hitchhiker  Adams unique writing style is the take away here  He discusses issues from as large as social bureaucracy to as small as simply breathing  He shows that you can write about anything and make it seamless and relevant to the story which is present in my own works   I love sci fi  especially space fiction  and it s easy to why this book is a classic  It is a pretty quick read  and I d like to get more into the characters and see more of the galaxy  but the plot kept me engaged the entire time  I m excited to read more by this author   yaaaa When I first read this book  it was newly published and I was in high school  Returning to it now  I was afraid it wouldn t hold up  I m pleased to inform you that it most certainly did  When it was written of course  the idea of an electronic book was science fiction  Reading it on my Sony reader    I had new respect for Adams  foresight  And Marvin the chronically depressed robot  and my spirit animal  is as delicious as ever  To somewhat opposable thumbs up  A real must read   for all those who are not afraid of the mirror Great novel  Full of one liners and absurd situations stories  Many a times made me laugh like a maniac  But then  it is not for everyone  as it has a science fiction kind of plot which not everyone appreciates  I see this novel as a joke on mankind  to put it mildly  which subtly underlines the fact that how small we humans are relative to the whole universe and how little is our understanding of it  Yet we consider ourselves to be the most intelligent being  atleast  on the planet  when in reality we are only the third most intelligent species on earth  which is itself only 10 million years old actually  D I loved it  At times rather incomprehensible altough I am not quite sure whether this is because of my lack of English or the way the book itself was written  Being imaginative is not a choice whilst reading this book and if you refuse to  well  good luck because you haven t a choice  Oh  and might I suggest listening to the audiobook read by the ever so amazing Stephen Fry  Delightful it was  listening to his remarkable Vogon eloquence not even to speak of the always so delightful Eddie and his wondruous singing  Happy reading  everyone  ps  I have always preferred rats over mice   There is a lot to love about this but   it is techie   but not overly so   it is funny in a British way   but in the way a really good episode of Doctor Who is   it is philosophical   but in an irreverent way   however it doesn t really demean religion   it moreso skewers the way in which we live   which is to say  ridiculously  I don t know how so many years got by me without having read this  It is fast  funny  thrilling  and engrossing  I was really impressed by how much momentum it had   once you get by the opening half  you sorta feel like the book is petering out into a traditional narrative   but no   the last section where we learn of Earth s origins it absolutely wonderful   in many ways more funny and thoughtful than the opening  Asan English teacher who regularly looks to seek answers to why we are here and what is our purpose through the thoughtful analysis of literature  this novel serves as agreat reminder that we should simply not panic   and figure out where to go for dinner  I finally read this  so I hope that means I get to keep my nerd card  I absolutely loved it  as I expected I would  and am now wondering why it took so long for me to read Come check out my full review of The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy over at Project 84  I ve read this many times  Now I m reading it to my 17 year old son  who is mostly enjoying it  and who thinks that Douglas Adams was brilliant    in the American sense of the word  Now  I know I m a geek  Everyone knows I m a geek  But I d actually never read the Hitchhiker s Guide  I know  it s like saying you have the BA in Nerd Arts  but still having 3 gen ed credits to fill  Anyway  I was the poorer for it  It was FUNNY  I actually listened to the Audio version narrated by Stephen Fry  who is fabulous  I recommend that version for anyone out there who likes audiobooks Hitchhiker s Guide is laugh out loud funny  savvy  down to earth  and just a really fun take  You don t even have to be a nerd like me to enjoy it  I promise  The story is fast paced  with sense often having to run to keep up with plot  in an enjoyable way   Adams imagery is flawless  his characters lighthearted and human  well  in some cases   It s an adventure story in the best ways  a social satire that we can all relate to  and just a really good time If the rest of the galaxy is as it s told by Adams  sign me up The movie  not as impressive  Although it benefitted from a decent cast  and Douglas Adams  input into the screen adapt  it just couldn t capture the same free wheeling joie de vie of the book  As is usually the case  the book was light years  sorry  I had to  ahead of it s film counterpart  Love it or hate it I would like  only once  to be on Adam s mind following his line of thought and beholding how absurdly chaotic and  at the same time  entirely consistent with any possible context his ideas would come out More than a book  this is a medicine against all mundane  common and uneventful  Keeps your brain fit to expand to any possible horizon  I m sure my head didn t know I had so many neuro paths to create a synapse  Absolutely brilliant  Life  Universe and Everything 42 stars out of 5  Heard the radio  bought the book  bought the tapes  saw the telly  saw the film  that s a lie   drunk the tea  bought the teddy  bought the other teddy and found myself with two hundred baby teddies so had the teddies shot         great loss  Adams early death  Fine book  fine book  A 5 star book with a note  the story in the book has not finished  This book reminded me why I like UK humors more than US ones  The jokes are cleverThis is my second review of hilarious SF novel  the first is The Martian  and I decide not to discuss the content much  I believe the best way to enjoy a humor is if the reader has as little expectation knowledge as possible  to optimize the surprises  This book was laugh out loud delightful  I heard the audio book read by the author himself    and was sad when the book be finished as I was enjoying myself so much  Who doesn t love the wacky adventures of Arther Dent  the last earthling in the galaxy  told with the dry Brit humor of the late Douglas Adams  I remember the summer I found these books on my parents bookshelf  I started with the first one and read strait through the series  When I finished  I immediately started at the beginning again  and the jokes seemed even funnier  Brilliantly witty piece of writing that always makes me chuckle  I love every book in the series  I can t believe I never read this book before  I think I probably was attracted to the cover as a kid and then read a few pages before abandoning it  Picking it back up 30 some odd years later was a great move on my part and I just loved this book  Adams reminds me of Terry Pratchett in a big way  I am most definitely reading the entire series as soon as I can If you are like me and the  0001  of readers who have somehow missed this along the way I urge you to check it out  Well here it is  the one and only great sci fi comedy  Douglas Adams has indeed created a wonderful genre  When you think about the genre sci fi and all the horribly cheesy things that have happen under it s name  you wonder why nobody caught on quicker  Maybe they did but met with much less success  or they were to busy trying to make the genre plausible  Whatever the case  this book is an amazingly funny book  with enjoyable characters  and a plot so wild you might buy into it  Laced with british humor and Douglas s dry wit  this book will definitly be around to make all science nerds laugh in years to come Kind of a perfect little sci fi book  Caught me off guard  I had tried to read this once about 10 or 15 years ago and thought the beginning was garbage  Guess I just wasn t ready for it  Went through it now in about 5 hours  grinning like a dumb ass the whole time at the witty word play and ironic situational repedity  The reversal of what some thought was important and others didn t created some funny observations as well  A lot of easy one liners that I ve found myself already repeating in conversation  somewhat by accident   Excelente humor  inteligente  absurdo  un poco incoherente  y genial  Me ha hecho reir muchisimo  Vamos por los siguientes  D I loved the comedy of this book  and as I love most other science fiction books  I enjoyed this one greatly as well  I can t wait to read  Resturaunt at the end of the Universe  I enjoyed reading this a lot  There s not much I can say about this one that hasn t been said before  It s a classic  plain and simple  and should be required reading in high school  It d be far more entertaining and fostering to the love of reading than most of the crap they force upon the students  I finally read it  I absolutely LOVED it  smart  clever  hilarious  I am on to at the End of the Universe and hoping that Arthur can finally get his cup of tea  One of the great works of modern literature  I read it as a late teenager and enjoyed it somewhat  I have since read it twice more  as an adult and now as a middle aged man  and it is much  much funnier from an adult s perspective  Adams s sly humor relating to bureaucracy is absolutely brilliant  This one lives on the top shelf next to Twain and Shakespeare  DON T PANIC  it s just a classic   like becase not only of geekyness but it is very funny  Douglas Adams really knew how to tell a tale even when there is no way of it being true  I really like his fast and loose writting style  I have read other but Adams but this one is still the best  It so good that once you finished the book you can turn it over and start all over again to find the joke you miss  You are able to this for about three time before you go mad  Pure comedy  Definitely a classic I first read this book roughly 20 years ago when I was a Freshman in high school  I am doing a challenge on goodreads where I needed a book published in 1979  I was curious if this book was as funny as I remembered it being  So  I decided it would make a good re read for me I am such a geek  This novel is still hilarious to me  It didn t feel dated  It was still as zany as I remember  It is still one of my favorite books Sometimes I wonder if this book helped influence my career path in Computer Science  I know it influenced my sense of humor    I saw a marathon of the original British TV series and knew I had to own this  Sort of a scatter brained author in his writing  but still this is one the funniest books I ve read  I even came to enjoy the short side stories he throws right into the middle of his scenes  Don t give up if this annoys you  Try to continue reading  because I guarantee you will be entertained   Funny enough to get you nuts  It s a mix of human science and other ones  if you know what I mean  It s ridiculously awesome and you don t have to be an expert to understand what Adams is talking about but you must have a huge imagination to get what he s talking about  I hope I made myself clear  but don t worry  that s how it s gonna feel when you read it  And don t think you re the only one who wants to kill that freaking annoying robot  A completely silly nonsensical tale of the last surviving human and 3 others  along with a depressed robot as they take an improbable trip across the universe  What is the meaning of life  the universe  and everything   Is it mice  is it a higher being  is it nothing  or what  All this and more is explored in this book  An easy quick read  well worth the time to read it  if you like anything completely silly  mixed with a bit of science fiction  Oh man this book  I need to make some sort of tradition of reading it  I think The  liberal  sensitive cop  scene  however  read as kind of tone deaf to my  modern  sensibilities  Hilirious  Outrages  Ridiculous  makes fun of you for thinking this is a thought provoking book but discreetly poignant  Subtlety my friend  subtlety  One of the funniest  most inventive books I ve ever read and if you ve never listened to the audio edition  it is a must Reminds me of the old radio programs I grew up listening to but funnier My contemporaries as well as my daughter  granddaughter  21 years old  and most of their friends consider it a classic  And after you ve read that read So Long and Thanks for All the Fish  Adams is unendingly clever  Two things I love rolled into one  science fiction and comedy  Somehow I managed to not read these books when the rest of my age group did   but now finding them in my 30 s I couldn t possibly enjoy them more  Hilarious and quotable  I ve had to take my time reading the original book and the subsequent sequels several times because my face hurt so much from smiling  All I know is that the next time I travel I m making sure I have my towel in my bag     And maybe my next dog s name will be Zaphod     One of the best books EVER  Can t get through a week without quoting it  Sometimes a day  I can t count the number of times I ve read it  but at least two paperback copies of it are in pieces at my house  Still laugh out loud every time  For me this is one of the best books in the whole universe  I really love it It doesn t take itself seriously  it s just full of weird  hillarious situations that made me laugh on nearly every single page  Every character is very well writen and fits perfectly into the setting While reading Adams Book I often thought about how meaningless life is in comparison to the endless space in the universe  But DON T PANIC   you will discover the answer of life and everything else soon    Probably one of the few books that has actually made me laugh out loud from start to finish  Could not put it down  Words fail to describe the delight this work has brought me over the years  in all it s different incarnations  Hilarious  wonderful  lampooning  playful  devilishly clever  fantasy  sci fi  humour  relationships  humanity  vogonity  terrible poetry  towels  Read it  Then read it again  So long and thanks for all the fish   This funny and fast paced narrative is simply superb  Crazy in a delightful manner  wish i had read it much much earlier    This is one of the most fun books I have ever read  Not only does it encompass some of my favorite science fiction aspects  space travel and alien beings  but Douglas Adams  sense of humor adds a joy to this book not included with other science fiction masterpieces  If I could give it more stars I would  Definitely putting  Restaurant at the End of the Universe  on my to read list  I loved all the books  specially the first and second one  I have always loved the witty British style of humor  I totally recommend it  especially if you are open minded about religion and you want to laugh  Marvin the depressed robot with its sarcastic comments will make you laugh since the first appearance  Just read the prologue  that s my advice  you will be hooked  You know a book is going to be good when it begins   Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the western spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small  unregarded yellow sun   Actually  good doesn t begin to describe the Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  It is my favorite book  Ever  Other books have come close  but as of February 2015  nothing I have read has been better than the Hitchhiker s Guide First of all  I didn t actually read the book first  I listened to the radio show  The radio show is  by far  the best of all the media that the Hitchhiker s Guide has been converted into  It is also the original  The book is based off the radio show  The book is slightly different and slightly less good  but still amazing  Then there was a TV show  which I haven t seen  but is supposed to be good  Then there was the movie  which was a waste of good acting and spoils the Hitchhiker s Guide franchise  Let s leave it at that This book is crazy  And when I say that  I mean it  It is probably the weirdest book I have ever read  And I ve read the ending of 2001  A Space Odyssey  Douglas Adams is so funny  The Hitchhiker s Guide makes fun of everything the author could think of  Including Life  the Universe  and Everything  It is so satirical and ironic and just completely nuts  I mean  look at the beginning  Arthur Dent s house is demolished to make way for a bypass  He s pretty mad  A couple minutes later  the Earth is demolished to make way for an intergalactic bypass Now    the sequels  The Restaurant at the End of the Universe is great too  probably as good as the first  Life  the Universe  and Everything is good  but not as good as the first two  So Long  and Thanks For All the Fish is terrible  Even though it has the best title  And Mostly Harmless isn t amazing  but it s good  I d recommend only reading the first two or three Okay  so not everyone is going to love Douglas Adams  odd humor  It is exceptionally weird  I had never heard any kind of humor as good or as weird as the kind in this book before I heard the radio show  so it might introduce you to something completely out of your experience  But it is so worth it Oh  gosh  This review is not going to be enough  I ll never be able to explain every single little thing that Douglas Adams does to make the book amazing  from the Improbability Drive to all the awesome characters to 42  Just go and read the book  Bello bello bello  Sono stato con il sorriso stampato in faccia dalla prima pagina all ultima  E nel frattempo di dicono anche cose abbastanza serie  Mi piace tutto di questo libro  La trama  i personaggi e soprattutto il modo in cui e scritto  Veramente bello  Non vedo l ora di continuare questa fantastica saga     Totes epic  must read Such a great book  I am so curious what is going to happen in the next book in the series  I am definitely looking forward to read those I love science fiction  It is my favourite genre  you may know this already and this one didn t let me down  A great sci fi book with a bit of humour  Perfect for me  Oh and also it was such a quick read so if you don t have a lot of time and want to read a good book  you found the perfect one for you  Congratulations  Anyway  the characters were good  the plot amazing  but what made me love this book were mind blowing stuff that author thought of  like  the answer of everything is 42  the Earth was destroyed and the smartest creatures on earth are rats  I just love things like this So  go read it  it s super good  trust me  Great book  great fun  A must read  Very short  I come back to it every now and then to have some fun  After hearing so many good things about this cult read I decided to give it a go  A few things about me I am not the type of reader who enjoys classics   not for a lack of trying  I didn t read Harry Potter till I was 28 and I blame that fact for not obsessively loving it while sci fi and I go together like Spock and something Spock does not go together with so needless to say I thought this book would be above my caliber of understanding  I was wrong and happy to report loved the first book of this series  Douglas Adams creates an imagery that is hilarious to the point of me laughing out loud on public transportation  people moved seats I wasn t affected   His imagination has satisfied the inner child in me and I shall be devouring this series of books   This may be one of the best books of all time  From this book  one may learn the very meaning of life  how steak cows will be chosen at the end of time  and how revenge will always find a way This book is a must read for anyone who considers themselves a nerd  or even a fan of good humour  Douglas Adams possessing the ability to make even stealing a car a hilarious affair  This book is a must read also for anyone who enjoys science fiction  as it s full of space travel  time travel  and flight This book is very influential on the reader and will most definitely make them funnier by osmosis  Absolutely hilarious  From the moment the book begins and Arthur Dent goes out of his house to see all this construction crew  the whole travel in a spaceship with Ford  the crazy aliens they keep encountering  Martin  who happens to be the best robot ever  all depressed and sad  to the ship that does inexplicable things because of the improbability device It s got humour  romance  frustration and towels Classic sci fi and a must read if you re into it  I first read this book  and the series  of course  during high school and have reread it several times in the years since  It is an indispensable device for eluding notice of the passage of time in waiting rooms  a point never properly advertised   though the grinning and giggles it produces will draw the glance eyed  brow raised attention of one s fellow waitees as they  sadly ill prepared for the tedium of such environs  wonder what you could be so delightedly lit up about  I doubt such individuals know where their towels are  but I digress Douglas Adams isn t merely funny  he s sparklingly  unconventionally  absurd perspectively  heart warmingly  truth tellingly funny and he takes his reader on an adventure packed journey in the company of a delightful cast of characters  A gem   It s hard to know where to start on this one  I ve been intimidated by my sheer adoration of Douglas Adams for so long that I ve put off attempting a review Perhaps I should get one thing out of the way first  I am a proud member of the Cult of 42  and a total HGTTG fangirl  Expect gushing and a completely biased lack of criticism I know this particular brand of humor isn t everyone s cup of tea  but to me it s brilliant  I used to have a serious amount of trouble whenever I was asked the dreaded question so many regular readers are plagued with   So what s your favorite book   My usual reply was something along the lines of  Gee  I don t know   Uhm   well   I guess      I d go on to recite a list of just about every novel I ve ever read   Since reading Hitchhiker s Guide  however  I reply without hesitation   Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  You haven t read it  Oh  my dear boy  there is a serious gap in your cultural education       Cue me giving a usually unwilling audience a play by play of the whole book  The Earth is destroyed by a race of bureaucratic Vogons to make way for a hyperspatial express route  Arthur Dent  a delightfully British human  is saved  and goes whooshing around the universe with the aid of his best friend  Ford Prefect  who turns out to be an alien from a small planet somewhere in the vicinity of Betelguese  There s a hilarious footnote on Ford s real name somewhere   On the way  he encounters some of the most thrillingly funny and original characters in literature my personal favorite being Marvin the Paranoid Android  a robot who hates the entire universe only slightly less than he despises himself  Depression has never been this funny Adams displays a unique mixture of wickedly sharp humor and surreal satire  a blend which was previously unheard of at the time of this novel s first publication in 1979  It became a  surprise bestseller   but in retrospect it s really no surprise  The completely original product of a true genius  this novel was irresistible to me the first time I read it as a teenager  and has lost none of its charm in the intervening years  If I was asked the  Desert Island  question  I d take three copies of Hitchhiker s Guide What to expect  Aliens like you ve never seen them  laugh out loud footnotes  a planet that manufactures planets  a three armed intergalactic President  a kick ass spaceship that can do anything but make tea  poetry that s so bad it actually prompts acts of desperate euthanasia from your internal organs  and  just for kicks and giggles  Adams throws in the Ultimate Answer to Life  at no extra charge  Lovely absurdity  completely ridiculous in each and every way  and a totally wacky thrill ride  Don t Panic   This book is quite ridiculous  Yes  that is the word for it  Completely random  bonkers  probably fit too  I think we can agree on it being an improbable book something that does things you wouldn t expect a book to do  It kind of jumps about a bit more that you d think a book should Nevertheless  I thoroughly enjoyed the book even though it took me a while to get used to it  It s a light and funny read and I will  when I get the chance  pick up the next book  Restaurant at the end of the Universe  here I come   So  when I first picked up this book  I was utterly bored  What was so bad about Vogon poetry  Why was Arthur s house so important  But then I continued to read and I realized how wonderful this book is  It s definitely on the ridiculous side  there s no doubt about that  but the jokes and overall theme to this book are wonderful and  I feel  fairly under appreciated  I definitely would recommend this book for when you need something unique to spice up your reading  I really enjoyed this book  and especially the author  Douglas Adams  I am a large fan of dry and  British  humor like this  I would recommend this book to all young adults and high school students  especially if you enjoy dry humor  In this book  the main character Arthur Dent is taken by his alien friend  Ford Prefect off of Earth  They meet up with the president of the galaxy Zaphod Beeblebrox  and another human  Trillian Astra  As they travel through the universe on their stolen spaceship  they also have to deal with Marvin  Marvin is a clinically depressed and paranoid robot  Arthur finds out what the true meaning of Earth is  and why he is alive  Along the way  he meets a thousand year old scientist  super intelligent mice  and a race of violent  ugly Vogans who are awful at poetry  The Vogans are constantly trying to capture Ford  Arthur  Zaphod  and Trillian and read their poetry to them  They obviously try to stay away though  since hearing it would kill them  This book deviates from regular science fiction books by adding lots of dry humor to it  The main character  Arthur Dent  is very ingenuous with his knowledge of the galaxy  while Ford knows lots about it  Zaphod has two heads  and both of them are filled with thoughts about himself  He is a stuck up creature that only cares about himself  and his money  Trillian is not focused on a lot in this story  She is characterized as down to Earth  even though she is far from it  and timid  This book definitely classifies under the categories of science fiction  humor  and young adult  It is one of the funniest books I have ever read but does use some profanity  so I would classify under the young adult category  If you read this book  I highly suggest Douglas Adams  other books  He wrote two sequels to  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy   They are called  The Restaurant at the end of the Universe   and  Life  The Universe  and Everything   I have read both of those and thoroughly enjoyed them as well   The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy is a witty sci fi comedy that is enjoyable at any age and a must read book for everyone  It s a This book will not only leave you chuckling after each chapter but it also has a depth to it that will keep you pondering about the universe and life long after you have finished it  Brilliant  One of my favorite books of all time  A LOL funny romp through the universe that points out so many ridiculous things in our own little world  So what are you waiting for  Get a copy and read it already  Surreale e spassoso Surreale perche ci sono molte scene allucinanti e piene di risvolti improbabili  Inoltre la tecnologia presentata viene descritta spesso con parole matematiche infarcite di spiegazioni completamente a caso  eppure le ho adorato quasi tutte  perche nella loro stravaganza sembravano quasi imitare una reale spiegazione scientifica  E poi alcune cose  benche siano state scritte nel 1979  sembrano descrivere alcuni oggetti che noi oggi abbiamo  come il libro della guida galattica  che ricorda un ereader o un minuscolo computer dove e salvata un enciclopedia elettronica  quasi una Wikipedia tascabile ed efficiente  Surreali sono anche alcuni personaggi e il loro modo di comportarsi  come ad esempio il robot con istinti maniacodepressivi  Il surrealismo e indissolubilmente legato alla vena umoristica  infatti il libro e davvero scorrevole e leggero  un po  perche e molto breve  ma soprattutto perche i dialoghi sono divertenti  la trama ha un svolgimento assurdo che fa sorridere  le reazioni dei personaggi agli eventi sono sorprendenti e comiche Una cosa che ho apprezzato molto e che l autore infila fra le righe quesiti filosofici  considerazioni interessanti  spunti per ulteriori riflessioni  One of my favorite books of all time  The book is hilarious and perfect for recreation   Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy  by Douglas Adams  is a science fiction book that follows main characters Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect  as they journey through space on a stolen ship  The Heart of Gold  with the most unlikely crew members  such as Zaphod Beeblebrox  a relative of Ford Prefect  and a particularly gloomy robot  Marvin  after narrowly escaping death by the destruction of Earth  Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is an entertaining book  as it encompasses many desirable aspects  such as humor  and includes anecdotes and descriptions of foreign places in space  through a handbook that the character Ford Prefect owns   The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy   Overall  Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is a very amusing book  and I recommend that anyone who enjoys science fiction read it  Great classic comedy I read this book in less than 24 hours  It s witty  filled with interesting characters  and written in the same British satire style popular with other writers like Terry Pratchett  but Adams brings his own style and personal touch to it  My only complaint is it doesn t resolve at the end  it just keeps going and presumably the next book will answer the questions posed in this one   Straordinario Riflessivo  divertente  trascinante fantascientifico e surreale  ma non troppo  dopotutto  It s so sad that none of the sequels lived up to the original book  but at least this one was such a gem  I remember reading this the first time in junior high or high school  mostly because of the references I heard and wanted to understand  It was my introduction to British humor and I loved it from the start because of how ridiculously funny it was  It s also a great example of how some things just don t translate to film  as the funniest stuff in the story is simply in the wording  I highly recommend reading this to catch and understand all the references  but mostly because it s just absurdly entertaining  Also  if you like the humor in this book  be sure to check out Terry Pratchett and his Discworld series  They re priceless  Dec2015  just listened to the audio book on a road trip  So good  Stephen fry kills it  I just reread this for the first time in probably a decade and was so glad I did  It s laugh out loud hilarious  so very English and full of unforgettable characters  I love this book so very much  If you ve never read it  I highly recommend it because it s so bizarre and adventurous and comedic and fun  I was thoroughly entertained  What can be said about Douglas Adams  freewheeling science fiction comedy that hasn t been said before  Probably nothing but that doesn t mean it doesn t deserve a review I first came to the Hitchhiker s Guide series through this book  It was about 1981 I suppose and it was recommended by a school friend  I hadn t been aware of the radio series  although as luck would have it it was repeated on BBC Radio 4 withing a few weeks  and it was a little while before the television adaptation appeared  which for all its faults   mainly a lack of budget   stayed true to the spirit of the books and the radio series rather more successfully than the film  From the point I opened this and started reading I couldn t get enough Hitchhiker s Guide  Adams  style is so much like a swan on a lake   it all seems effortless on the surface but underneath there s a lot going on  As Adams  friend John Lloyd has commented  he had the ability to write backwards  so he would start with several pages of  what to other people would be  excellent material and after a couple of days  furious writing it would be down to 2 pages  but each sentence a carefully crafted gem  The result is like the difference between beer and vodka  You will enjoy drinking the beer but the distilled and concentrated vodka will knock you out There is real genius in the wit  ideas seemingly being pulled from nowhere and taking on a whole new aspect  towels for example   Delightful non sequitors  especially from aliens who turn out to be pretty ordinary   or frequently less than ordinary   brilliant and inventive word play and sheer imagination and brio run through every page  all joined together by delightful asides from  the book  The story itself is based on the radio series of the same name which was pretty much made up as it went along  Adams following whatever idea seemed to give him the best scope for a quick gag at the time  But somehow this all works and the story is remarkably coherent  although the book does veer away from the thread of the radio series at the very end   It has been said before that it resembles Gulliver s Travels as each new world reveals new wonders  or new banalities shining a light on our own humdrum existences here on Earth  Oh the story  The book essentially follows one Arthur Dent  a completely unremarkable and normal human being apart from two things  Firstly his house is about to be demolished to make way for a bypass  a fact he was previously unaware of  Secondly his friend Ford Prefect  the book explains the name  is not from Guildford after all but from a small planet somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse  When aliens show up to demolish the whole Earth to make way for an interstellar bypass  Ford saves Arthur from certain death and reveals he is a reporter for a book called The Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy and he got stuck on Earth for rather a long time Arthur proceeds to have a rather horrible time being shot at  thrown out of spaceships  patronised and generally baffled by everything that is going on around him  But The Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy is always on hand to try to explain things Incredibly amusing  brilliantly written and ultimately quoteable this not just a good book  it is something that really everyone should read  I can t believe it s taken me so long to read this amazing book  Can t wait to read more from Douglas Adams  How I ve managed to go twenty three years without reading this book is beyond me  It is certainly one of the most well known science fiction novels of all time  It definitely lived up to the hype  Douglas Adams is clever and hilarious as always  The book follows Arthur Dent through his crash course in traveling the galaxy following the untimely destruction of Earth  I would go into more detail but everything I can think of to say seems like it would take away from how amazing this book is  Just read it  Even if you don t like science fiction  read it  If you don t laugh you should probably see a doctor and find out what s wrong with you  One of the most incredible books I have read  A mixture of sci fi and humor so amazing that you can reread over and over  This is the first book in the series that spawned the classic five part trilogy  The first book in a five part trilogy  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is an insane and incredible book about Arthur Dent s travels across the universe  Does Douglas Adams stretch the laws of reality once or twice or every other sentence  Sure  But you won t stop laughing the entire way  make me find the answer yeah  42   Combined review with Restaurant at the End of the Universe As a pet peeve  I don t read books after watching films based on them  I had watched Hitchhiker s Guide recently for the second time just due to how plainly dross it felt the first time  and I thought it may just have been me  It wasn t  The movie is REALLY bad  Had to  therefore  read the books because I understood after consuming Adams on the internet  examples  Is there an artificial god  and Biscuits  that he was fantastically funny without doubt  They are outrageously books  Nothing makes sense and everything is perfect  The prose only adds to the experience  by a lot   but is not THE reason that the plot is funny  The most interesting characters  however  are the ones that the crew come across on their adventures  and the earthlings  especially  are quite uninspiring  I mean  what exactly is the point of Trillian  She adds nothing to any of the stories and the only memorable scene where she plays any part of significance is an emotional one with Marvin  the android  That took two paragraphs tops In any case  I can t wait to read parts three and four of this trilogy and then read them all over again   very humorous writing    I was laughing the whole time This book is pure joy  wrapped in wonder with a healthy side of whimsy  I loved this book  Every hilarious part of it  Hitchhikers guide to the galaxy only helps prove my theory that Englishmen are the best storytellers  Even in the darkest moments where all seems lost and there is no reason or known way to get out of a given situation  the  guide  reminds you   don t panic   then promptly shoots off into the heart of adventure  Douglas Adams  prose is hysterical  insightful and  most important of all  fun  Do not miss out on this book  There were diminishing returns as the trilogy went on into books four and five   did you know some other guy took it upon himself to write a sixth  after Adams s death    but that might ve been because I tried to read them all in a row  marathon style  But you can t beat his wit  Nobody else ever made exposition more fun  It also helps to never  ever see the dreadful movie  THIS IS AWESOME                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      This book is now perhaps one of my favorite books of all time  after reading it  It does humor really well  given that it is a book  My opinion is probably the same as other people s  the book is really good at what it does  make people laugh  Unfortunately  I wish that the book was longer  to be honest  I wanted more  I especially love some of the plot devices it uses  such as the improbability engine  because it can create anything  It really allowed Douglas Adams to make an epic  yet quirky story  But overall  I really enjoyed it  and would recommend it to anyone who wants to read a fun book   This is quite possibly the best book ever written  From a former Doctor Who writer comes the most fantastic tale ever told  of Arthur Dent s journey from earth  to space  and beyond  Once again  this is the best book ever  I recommend to every single human being ever  Holds up  Still love it  Lo he leido  me he reido  he abierto los ojos de par en par y si     me ha encantado La guia del autoestopista galactico   es un llamado a la aventura  ironicamente gracioso y hermosamente creativo  con una trama que nos lleva a explorar los linderos del espacio conocido  tanto el exterior como el interior  pudiendo contemplar ciclopeas estructuras de imposible envergadura con la misma angustia que representa perderse en un desolador viaje introspectivo que tenga por objeto hallar la justificacion de la vida que si no me equivoco es mas o menos de la misma magnitud que el infinito del universo u otras profundidades semejantes   es una obra que se balancea en extremos opuestos del espectro  va desde lo mundano a lo mas descabellado  de lo infimo a lo meramente supremo  hace reflexionar sobre lo importante e insignificante que cada ser vivo puede llegar a ser Douglas Adams  sin duda un autor a tener en cuenta en los proximos viajes a la ficcion mas absoluta De entre todos los pasajes rescato en que me ha enamorado  La pared desafiaba la imaginacion  la atraia y la derrotaba  Era tan pasmosamente larga y alta  que su cima  fondo y costados se desvanecian mas alla del costado de la vista  solo la impresion de vertigo que daba era capaz de matar a un hombre   I don t think I d give this five stars if this was my first reading  but I remember reading it back when I was fifteen or sixteen and loving it  and looking back  over thirty something years  at my sweet teenage self makes me feel fond and generous  So  five stars BUT  it Is still entertaining  My kids  to whom I read it aloud  enjoyed it very much  Of course  part of what they enjoyed is the way that current technology has  in some ways  surpassed the Amazing Alien Technology in the book    the Hitchhiker s Guide appears to be an e reader  and I am reading it from a Kindle  with a single  Wikipedia like book installed  My daughter did ask  last night  when we finished the book  what the theme of the book was   It doesn t seem to be About anything   Not wanting to get into a explanation of nihilism  which I am ill equipped for  anyway   I suggested that we go on to the Restaurant at the End of the Universe  which I remember as featuring a cow that wanted to be eaten   Can t type  Still laughing  Frankly I would give this book 42 stars if that were possible  Absurdism at its finest  I read this on a fifteen hour train ride in the Ukraine while surrounded by people yelling in Russian  and so this book had the oddest effect of being comforting  Every time I felt overwhelmed by my surroundings  I would dive into poor Arthur s misadventure and instantly feel better  I would love to study this book more  I loved the satire social commentary aspect And let s not overlook the fact that this book made me eloliaps  embarrassingly lol in a private setting   which is a feat in and of itself  What a book   Very funny book which I must read again sometime soon   Love this book    Cheeky  witty and funny In the northern arm of a spiral galaxy  a man named Arthur Dent is about to undertake the most improbable  When His house is about to be taken down to make a bypass  several vogon ships are about to destroy the earth to make their own  Arthur is whisked away by his alien friend Ford Prefect  And their he goes  To distant galaxies  to strange times I really like this book because it really makes no sense at all  For instance  since when was a towel the most important object you can have  How can you be invincible with just rubber band  And since when is it a easy feat to fly  This is one awesome book      The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  Book IDouglas Adams  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is full of such acuteness  sharp detail  and droll wit that it is sure to make you laugh  The Earth is about to be destroyed by alien construction workers to make room for a new hyperspace bypass  However  moments before this occurs  Ford Prefect hitches a ride through the galaxy with his human friend  Arthur Dent  Together they face the improbable events of the galaxy with thirty Altairian dollars  a towel  and a copy of The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  written by Ford himself  The success of this book is based upon the author s brilliant ability to suspend the reader s disbelief  He uses Ford Prefect as a metaphorical way of introducing his writing style  as both Prefect  an alien born in the vicinity of Betelgeuse and currently posing on Earth as an out of work actor  and the author strive to make their appearances  nicely inconspicuous   11   Whereas some science fiction authors rely on  magic  as a way to approach this technique  this author uses his characters and keen descriptions to make his story seem believable The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy focuses on the emphasis of every detail  even the minor ones impact the story significantly  Adams begins chapter twenty three with a topic completely irrelevant to its precedent  it states how humans misinterpret their inferiority towards dolphins and mice  The author further explains his thoughts in the following chapter    Earthman  the planet you lived on was commissioned  paid for  and run by mice     109   Though random as they may seem at first  Adams cleverly arranges his words to discretely foreshadow the plot of the story The author infuses his tongue in cheek humor and insightful observations in even the most mundane situations  His most ironic statements typically concern oddities of human behavior   One of the things Ford Prefect had always found hardest to understand about humans was their habit of continually stating and repeating the very very obvious  as in It s a nice day  or You re very tall  or Oh dear you seem to have fallen down a thirty foot well  are you all right    35   The book views Life  the Universe  and Everything at an angle that is not only utterly true  but creative as well Adams writes in a very satirical and wry manner that can be enjoyed by everyone  It will surely bring you laughter  as well as provide a unique perspective about the Universe  The fast paced narrative in this book will keep you on your toes  with well defined characters such as Marvin the Paranoid Android and former President Zaphod Beeblebrox of the Galaxy  and intriguing questions that have yet to be answered  Get ready to stick your thumbs into space and begin a cosmic adventure in The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  I have it in both print and audio  The audiobook I have is not the one read by Stephen Fry  instead I have a British edition from many years ago read by the author himself and it just takes the joy of it to a whole new level  I really wish they would reissue it so everyone could enjoy that version  The best introductory for the new sci fi enthusiastic  Also  the best way to determine if a friendship will last You   Have you read  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy   Friend   Um  no  I actually don t really like science fiction  You   Oh  good  thank you  Former Friend   Thank you  You   Thank you for letting me know YOU RE INCREDIBLY DULL AND THIS FRIENDSHIP MUST CEASE    If you like books that are weird  funny  and adventurous this is a book for you  Arthur Dent wakes up to see a bulldozer out side his window ten minuets later he is lying down in front of it trying to save his house  Little does he know that the whole earth is about to be destroyed by a Volgon Destructor fleet  Arthur s friend who happens to be an alien from the vicinity of Beetle Juice  helps him escape earth  Together they re off on a weird and crazy adventure through  the galaxy  with only the Hitchhiker s Guide and a few towels to keep them safe  Will they find a place they can call home  To find out you ll have to read the Hitchhikers guide to the galaxy   Absolutely hilarious  Such an easy read  jam packed with exciting adventures  I found The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy to be an extremely fun  humorous  and upbeat space adventure  The characters are well developed in such a short book and Arthur Dent is used as a wonderful protagonist in this story  He  like us  is a human and isn t educated on what he encounters in the galaxy  We learn about the galaxy along with him  which makes him relate to us  The upbeat tempo of the book made it hard to put down and left me wanting to read more  This is easily one of my favorite books The ethical issue is Change fate vs Accept fate  This is because Arthur Dent must decide whether or not to accept that the world ended and join Ford Prefect in his journey across the galaxy  Absolutely loved this wonky story  I read an ebook version  and the story abruptly ended when my kindle said I was only 66  into it  The last third was about the making of the movie  which I haven t read   When I reached 66  I thought the chapter had merely ended  but when I turned the page and realized the story was over  I was MAD      Needless to say  I ll be reading further into the series   This is a perfect spoof of the Science Fiction genre  In 1981 I was a Freshman in college  I had a friend who told me about this book  He loved it so much that he had written a fan letter to the author and the author had written back  That is kind of neat  I can remember patiently listening to my friend go on and on about how much he loved the book and the author  It sounded pretty lame to me Eventually  I read it and was blown away  It is silliness from start to finish and I mean that in a good way  Characterization and the story are interesting  Dialogue and narration is nonstop funny  He leaves hilarious images in the readers mind Alas  Douglas Adams left us way to early  I just hope he has his towel with him  De los mas interesante y divertido que he leido en toda mi vida sobre este planeta  Adams  writing is a Godsend to those of us who enjoy observational humor about life  from the people in it to how it works  His humor within this book is quick and both  simple and witty  It s that magic that keeps the pages turning and your funny bone satisfied  The only downside to the book is that while the humorous narration and dialogue is what drives it  it also seems to be the bulk of what the book is  While the characters and story are fun  the plot and direction of the story is often all over the place and typically not very deep  That s okay though  because for me  what made the book was the humor and the humor is why I picked up the book in the first place If you are looking for  what people consider  a traditionally great book to read  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy may not be for you  but if you are looking to laugh and enjoy a good read and observational humor is a favorite of yours  then hitch a ride on this hilarious tale   I know that last line was really corny but that s just how this review has to end  I can t see another way around it   On my growing list of  Books I Wish I d Read Many Years Ago  is this fun story  Wickedly hilarious  Roald Dahl meets Monty Python plus a healthy dose of science fiction  Been meaning to read this for years  and I was not disappointed  Cleverly written and very easy reading  I highly recommend it  Love it   very funny and AWESOME    This one was fun  and not just fun on a stupid ridiculous way  but fun for the brain  The jokes were pretty nonsensical but witty as hell  The plot seemed simple but there were a lot of philosophical ideas hidden there and in a very amazing way  Sadly I read the book after watching the movie  not that the movie es bad  but I feel like a lot of the scenes and plot would have had a bigger impact without the image I already had  Would recommend this one to anyone who likes to laugh by themselves with some very well constructed jokes and punchlines   Don t Panic   Somehow I never read this book and was so enhanced I blew through it in a day  One of my top ten all time favorite books  If you call yourself a sci fi fan and you haven t read this book   series yet  I pity you for your life is empty and meaningless  For the uneducated  the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy is a general reference encyclopedia about all of the alien cultures  planets and people of the galaxy that our hero  Arthur Dent  encounters in this highly entertaining novel  This is a book I loved  It has many terrific sections  and while parts of it don t work for me  the description of the Pan Galactic gargleblaster  the vogons and the workings of bureaocracies keep me coming back  even though I can t say I have any great love for the actual characters  which is my usual reason for returning to a book  A classic British comedy with witty humor and well thought details  Loved and laughed throughout the whole thing  I decided recently at work that I need to brush up on my science fiction books for teens  it s a genre used as part their required summer reading and I ve never been particularly good at recommending or describing them  I figured I might as well start with Hitchhiker s  I ve had a copy of it floating around for as long as I can remember  and most people are appalled when they discover I have never read it And appalled they should be I absolutely loved this book and can not believe that it has taken me this long to finally read it  I m not going to describe the whole plot in depth  most people are fairly familiar with it    Arthur Dent is saved by his friend Ford Prefect  who happens to be an extraterrestrial  in the last minute just before the earth blows up  The two then find themselves traveling the galaxy in search of answers to the universe s biggest questions  meeting strange and funny characters along the way  This was funny and thought provoking at the same time  and I can not wait to read the next book in the series  That and I can finally let myself watch the movie  even though I know it will never be as good as the book   I love this book  What a mind Douglas Adams had  The crazy satire and biting wit really captures the absolute absurdity of modern life and the stories we tell to get through life  The most arrogant  self involved and clueless characters struck me as kind of  dare I say it  American  but they were so important to crafting a story about  well  everything  creation  intelligence  human and otherwise   art  science  scientific theory  mega corporations  government  government bureaucrats  bureaucracy generally  corruption  the meaning of life  and the wonder of all sorts of modern  conveniences   which conveniently did nothing you wanted  annoyed you thoroughly  but executed their intended function admirably   The same could be said about the bureaucrats   If you re not interested in any of that  then read the book anyway because it s just plain funny   So long  and thanks for all the fish   This is an amazing book that I would highly recommend to anyone  It is funny at times  even though it can be completely random and make no sense at all at times  It is a story of a man named Arthur Dent  who barely escapes Earth s destruction and joins up with many interesting Characters to make it to Magrathea and discover the meaning of life  the universe  and everything  Overall  I like it a lot  since it is funny  action packed  and exciting  The book I just finished reading was called  The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy  It was written by a author named Douglas Adams  The story was about a guy named Arthur Dent who went on a adventure with his Alien Friend Ford Perfect who was leading writer for the new revised edition of the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy recording new facts into the book wherever they go  They then went off to find a way to bring back the planet earth after it got blown up and made space to build a intergalactic Highway  The book was filled with a explosion of comedy  Through out the book I really enjoyed some parts where they really made the story really goofy but still was set in a serious way  Like through the second chapter  when Ford and Arthur snuck on a alien space craft  He gave Arthur a fish and told him top put it in his ear  He then gave Arthur the  Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy  and said that if he put a Babel fish into your ear  It will make you be able to translate any language into the one that you speak  Then there s a warning in the book that don t listen to a Vogon s poetry or you will perish  The book really does a fine job at putting detail in the setting and whats taking place at that moment to give the reader a picture of whats happening in there head just like your watching a movie  Douglas Adams also puts in good vocabulary and using more vivid words than using boring words like good happy scared  words like that  I really enjoyed this book and would recommend this book to anyone who would love to read sci fiction books  I would rate this book around four to five stars for having a outstanding story plot and adding in a little comedy to help support it and the amount of detail and vivid word choose makes it like your watching a movie   There was some kind of freaky genius swimming around in Douglas Adams  head  I loved this book  I m a philosophy student  and some of the ideas that Adams wrote  such as the god that disproved his own existence  were the kind of thoughts that made me lean back  close my eyes and softly chuckle for a good four minutes  I ve been pushing my CHAS group at uni  Cosmic Hitchhiker s Appreciation Society  to hold a competition for who can most convincingly re create the Pan galactic Gargle Blaster  This is the kind of fun and humour that Adams gifted to his readers  And gosh are we grateful If you re tossing up whether or not to read this book  just do it  even if you hate  you ll love the fact that you ve read it  The FUNNIEST book I ever read  I love it  and will definitely read the other books of the series    If you ever wondered why the  Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life  The Universe  and Everything  is 42  this book is for you   D Just a bunch of words  really Though I must say  those words  more so than any other group of words that I have ever read  are beautifully put One size doesn t fit all in any case  but this should fit most   Douglas Adams was much like Tolkien with the effort  thought  and just pure love he put into his works   This is definitely a book every fan of science fiction should at least attempt to crack open   So that s the answer  but what really was the question   The Great Question   of Life  The Universe and Everything   with that concept alone  the book became one of the most amazing reads for me  add to that a comedic tone hardly found in the best comedy books  and on top of it a set of lively and spontaneous characters  all in all I can t wait to visit the restaurant at the end of the universe    Don t Panic Adams has a delightful way of writing that is easy on the eyes as well as on the page  Although there are many different incarnations of this book  each one has been equally hilarious  Hitchhikers Guide to the GalaxyDouglas AdamsSci FiArthur Dent is an average guy with an average life  But one day  he meets Ford Prefect  an alien from Betelgeuse  Ford tells Arthur that the earth is about to go up in smoke  and that it does  Vogons demolish it to make way for an interstellar bypass  Seconds before that happens  Ford takes Arthur off the planet and onto the vogon ship  This starts their entire galactic journey across the stars  meeting many friends I find this book very funny and entertaining  It has so much suspense and Science fiction  its hard to put down  I have already read the entire second book before posting this review  so that just goes to show how interesting these books are  I wonder if the number 42 really is the answer to life  the universe and everything  La guia  asi le diremos para abreviar  es una joya de la literatura  Que hace que sea una joya  La combinacion perfecta que logra de dos generos que parecen imposibles de asociar  la ciencia ficcion y el humor  del bueno  La guia se centra en el desarrollo de una historia que tiene como eje el sinsentido  Todas las situaciones son inverosimiles y completamente ridiculas  y todos los avances de la narracion presentan episodios improbables  Y sin embargo esto no espanta  la historia se transforma en una montana rusa que  asi y todo  mantiene una trama marcada por causas y efectos  absurdos hasta la medula  Adams no maneja el sinsentido como un recurso que puede tirarse como una bombita de agua para que deje una mancha y listo  El lo posiciona  acomoda  estira  manipula y retuerce para que hile una historia y rompa con la probabilidad  el tiempo y el espacio y se nutra de los recursos propios de la ciencia ficcion Esta novela es un delirio que oscila constantemente entre el sentido y el sinsentido y que juega con nociones tipicas de la ciencia ficcion dandoles respuestas impensadas  El fin del mundo  el sentido de la vida  la raza mas inteligente del universo  los viajes interestelares y las maquinas pensantes adquieren un sentido totalmente nuevo y marcado por el humor Y como si fuera poco a todo esto se le suma una capacidad innata de Adams para presentar las frases mas espectaculares en los momentos mas increibles    Por ejemplo  en el planeta Tierra  el hombre siempre habia asumido que era mas inteligente que los delfines porque habia logrado muchas cosas  la rueda  Nueva York  guerras  etc  mientras que lo unico que habian hecho los delfines era dar vueltas en el agua y pasarla bien  Pero  al reves  los delfines siempre habian creido que eran mucho mas inteligentes que el hombre por exactamente las mismas razones    Por un momento  no paso nada  Despues  un par de segundos  continuo sin ocurrir nada    Nada viaja a mayor velocidad que luz con la posible excepcion de las malas noticias  las cuales obedecen a sus propias leyes      Demandamos areas bien definidas de duda e incertidumbre  La guia es sin duda alguna uno de los mejores libros que lei en mi vida  Gracioso  sumamente original y decidido a burlarse de todo y todos  primero en la lista  la humanidad entera   esta novela marca un punto de quiebre en el genero ciencia ficcion y deja ganas de seguir leyendo y de atarse una toalla a la cintura Resena subida originalmente a Obras citadas Wow  that s a game changer  Top shelf  Short chapters and quick wit  two of my favorite things  And Douglas Adams  skills at inventing names for alien races and planets is astonishing  42 stars   It was a great book  engaging humorous and metaphoric  Once you start don t put it down  not for the whole series  Now unlike normal people  by  normal  I mean people who read the book and then go see the movie  I did it the other way round  I had heard of the book  and was aware of its existence  but I ended up watching the movie first  This often happens to me because I admit that I m a slow reader  I must say that I liked the movie a lot  even though a friend vehemently told me the book was millions of times better  Having read the book  I still like the movie  But  I like it a little less now than I did previously  That s mostly because I m curious why they made some of the casting decisions they made  But enough about the movie  This book had me laughing very hard  If you re a fan of the Monty Python crew  then you ll enjoy this  It s silly  Now unlike a lot of sci fi writers  Adams doesn t really describe what it is that he s talking about  He ll name something  and give you a general description  For example  he ll tell you that it s called  The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy   and he ll give you a basic description of it s dimensions  and or color  For example  he ll tell you that a Vogon is large  and very slug like  and that the Vogon ships are huge  blockish  and yellow  But that s it  Where other sci fi writers might devote at least a paragraph  if not more  to describe a device  what it looks like  what it can do  what it s used for  Adams doesn t really do that  He gives you just enough information  but uses such descriptive words  that you tend to allow yourself to fill in the details  Because of this my mental picture of what a Vogon looks like might be different from yours  and yes it s different from the Vogons in the movie  But that s part of the fun of it  If you want a fun  quick read  you should definitely pick this up  You ll be glad you did   There is an art to flying  or rather  a knack  The knack lies in learning how to throw yourself at the ground  and miss   I m sorry I waited so long to read this but very glad I finally did  How else could I learn to start measuring things in a nothingth of a second and a nothingth of an inch  Here s to Douglas Adams   I think I like the audio version even better than the printed version  One of the best  Witty  funny  suspenseful  My first exposure to the Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy came by way of the six episode 1981 British TV series starring Simon Jones as Arthur Dent  All six episodes were terrific and I began reading the books shortly after the series ended  At one point Douglas Adams described the books as  a trilogy in five parts   If you find that amusing then these are the books for you  And don t panic  The books are much  much better than the 2005 film which  in my humble opinion  missed the point entirely  Not the first time I ve read this  nor the second    but this time it was as a bedtime story for two boys  the oldest being eight  They have seen the film  so have a good idea of the story  but had not been exposed to the wonderful use of language and sheer scope of ideas percolating through Adams  writing  Yes  some of the concepts have to be explained  but the broad nature of the comedy has them  metaphorically  rolling in the aisles  Even after thirty years  it holds a freshness and boldness which later works cannot emulate  One of the funniest  wittiest and most precious books in the English language   Best book ever  No exceptions  Marvin and the whale    3Comedic fiction is not really a genre I have much interest in  but a friend told me he couldn t believe that I m a geek and have never read this book  So read it  I did  It was a quick read and a short adventure  but the witty humor kept me completely amused  Some passages were just so silly and random  but so well written  I had to read the paragraphs about the whale s lifespan and Marvin s dialogue out loud to my husband   I got a real kick out of them  This is a hilarious venture into the realm of science fiction  Douglas Adams pushes the absurdity envelope to the edge  over the edge  onto the next table  to the next edge  over the next edge  and to a third table s edge  HHGTTG is modern satire in its best form  One of the best ways to discuss a topic  or to teach someone something  is to use humor  Adams shines the brightest spotlight on the humanity with this incredibly funny  and insightful  book Whovians will love this because Adams wrote chunks of this series as Dr  Who scripts before repurposing them for his own universe  Science fiction fans will enjoy the fusion of intergalactic species with satire  There s a reason why HHGTTG is beloved by geeks and english teachers alike  No  it isn t 42  You gotta read this to find out  It s doubtful that you need anyone to tell you to read this book  but if you ve never heard of it  or don t know what it is  let me tell you a little something  Basically  this is a science fiction story that isn t too worried about explaining how all the technology works  but instead manages to make some commentary on humanity  if you dig deep enough  while simultaneously being completely hilarious  It s not all just cheap jokes  either   there are science and math jokes that I didn t really appreciate until I d taken several years of physics classes  Douglas Adams is a genius  This book literally made me laugh out loud  Absolutely hilarious  The way this guy writes and thinks is so unique and funny  He comes up with incredible ideas and concepts  And if you look beyond all the humor  he actually makes a LOT of good points  Do NOT judge this book by the movie  It s a terrible idea  The movie has absolutely nothing on it  I m not sure I can accurately describe just how incredible this book is  or explain the way Adams writes  I think for these books it would be best to just let some quotes speak for themselves  Here are some  JUST SOME  of my favorites  The ships hung in the sky in much the same way that bricks don t   In the beginning the Universe was created  This has made a lot of people very angry and has been widely regarded as a bad move   Now it is such a bizarrely improbable coincidence that anything so mind bog gglingly useful could have evolved purely by chance that some thinkers have chosen to see it as the final and clinching proof of the non existence of God The argument goes something like this   I refuse to prove that I exist   says God   for proof denies faith  and without faith I am nothing   But   says Man   The Babel fish is a dead giveaway  isn t it  It could not have evolved by chance  It proves you exist  and so therefore  by your own arguments  you don t  QED   Oh dear   says God   I hadn t thought of that   and promptly vanished in a puff of logic  Oh  that was easy   says Man  and for an encore goes on to prove that black is white and getshimself killed on the next zebra crossing    This is one of those look behind the humor and you ll get something actually quite smart ones  And an amazing point he makes that I think is actually very true and speaks a lot about human nature  Anyone who is capable of getting themselves made President should on no account be allowed to do the job   A really great book  One of the few that has managed to make me genuinely laugh out loud   This book is one of the funniest books I have ever read in my entire life so far  This book tells the beginning of exciting ourney of an  earthman  named Arthur Dent across the galaxy as he accompanies his friend Ford Prefect  a space traveling hitchhiker  Shortly after the demolition of his house  and the Earth  Arthur begins his amazing adventures with Ford in outerspace  Along the way he meets up with one of Ford s old friends and a girl named Trillian  This hilarious book is a definite must read  If you don t think this book is amazing by the first couple of pages  hereby give you permission to call me a liar   P  A pleasure to read it  Great book  A wonderful  and comedic approach to sci fi  Douglas Adams is a genius with coming up with creative approaches to futuristic travel  The line   Ford  you re turning into a penguin  stop it   I think accurately sums up the weird and wonderful  and perfectly shares the adventure Arthur has resigned himself to have   So  this book  This book was nothing I was expecting and exponentially better than anything I had pictured it to be  I had no idea what to expect when I opened to the first page of this novel  I  of course  had heard many of things about this series  and  most of it has all been feedback of good to phenomenal  I am happy to say that I fell in the in phenomenal category  This book started out as a five star book  had a five star middle  and ended as a five star book  Giving this book the highest rating I possibly could wasn t even a little bit of a hard decision  Now  what can I tell you that this book is really about  I can honestly say that The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy cannot be easily explained  I now know why I didn t really know what I was getting myself into because I m not sure how to write a clear synopsis about the actual plot of this novel  But  here s my best effort  Join a human  Arthur  as he travels through space with some new intergalactic friends as they trek through the galaxy after planet earth has been destroyed by the revolting Vogons to make room for a space bypass  Little does Arthur know what he is about to find out about earth and the original reason it was created  After all  the answer to the question of life and what not is 42  Be prepared for one wild ride  And  make sure you don t forget your towel First off  I m going to start with the writing  Douglas Adams is an extraordinary writer  The sentences that this man creates are beautiful  and extravagant  and crazy  and absolutely wonderful  This is one smart man and boy was he meant to write science fiction  He creates a world that is so utterly ridiculous but you can t help but believe everything that he is putting down into type  His writing is also fun  If I had to describe this novel in one word  that word would hands down be  fun   There is no way you can t help but love this man s quirky sense of writing  and his fun story about travelling the galaxy  The story that is told  as I ve already briefly touched on  is so fantastic  I immediately fell in love  This novel  and I m sure the rest of them   is a new favorite of mine and has easily climbed the ladder to the books I hold most high  in my own opinion of course  Along with this fantastic story Adams weaves together  there are fantastically odd  eccentric  and delightful characters that make this story even better  It was so easy to like these characters from the get go  Although I don t have them all pegged down yet  I love them anyway  But now  what is it that really makes this story so whimsical  It s definitely the humor  This novel is nothing but humor  I found myself smiling and even laughing out loud throughout this entire read  The humor that Adams writes with is probably one of the main things  along with how short the novels are  that makes this such a quick  easy  and  most importantly  enjoyable read  I know that all this review has been is me saying how much I loved this book and basically fangirling   a lot     but  if you haven t read it  you just don t understand how good this book is  Usually when I read I like to keep a pen and a highlighter easily accessible because  some of you may cringe at what I say next but oh well  I love to highlight favorite lines and even writing notes in the margins occasionally  But  I didn t even bother to do that here because if I did  the entire novel would be highlighted from beginning to end  There are so many magnificent lines that I couldn t possibly just pick a few that stood out to me  There was nothing unnecessary in this novel  absolutely nothing at all  I loved every word So  you may be asking yourself what kind of humor this novel contains that has me praising it to the ends of the galaxy  Well  it has the kind of humor that makes fun of the human race but in such a way that it makes the reader  us  easily nod in agreement and laugh at ourselves along with the alien characters  Adams is not afraid to point out the flaws that we have  but makes light of them in the most pleasant way that will give anyone with a funny bone  especially  if you re like me  an exceedingly sarcastic funny bone  a good laugh  because he brings them to life in the most outrageous manner and in the most outlandish settings that you can t help but say  yea  that s true and it s definitely funny  Another great tool that he employs in creating this sense of humor the novel is based on is irony  There were so many times I couldn t help but scream in my head   THE IRONY  OH  THE IRONY   And  believe me  said irony is superb So  incase you re still unconvinced if you should read this novel  read it  Definitely read this novel  Absolutely 100  read this novel  I had a copy of the first book in the series at home  but after finishing that  the next time I was at Barnes   Noble  which wasn t long at all   I had some giftcards to spend   I picked up the complete collection  If you  like me  have been debating about this novel or kept insisting to yourself  and others  that you d get around to it  get around to it  You will not be disappointed  Thanks for reading and make sure you stop by and check out my Facebook page  Keep up on my latest reviews and follow for other bookish posts   https   www facebook com dreamingthro    Alright  so in parts this book was extremely hilarious and had me falling off my chair in hysterics  But at other instances  it was such a drag that it kind of killed the mood  I enjoyed the twists and turns  especially the one regarding the mice being the smartest creatures on Earth  which happened to be the best computer every made  A huge experiment gone wrong and the most exhaustive text of knowledge mentioned it as harmless  waiting to have its status improved to a meager mostly harmless level I think that Douglas Adams has me hooked enough to give its sequence a shot  however  I do believe there he has left much to be improved  as far as the over all outlook is concerned   The single most hilarious book iv e ever read  packed with the most laugh out loud absurd British comedy  If your thinking about reading this book  remember  take your Towel  make sure the babel fish is in  DON T PANIC  Hilarious and nutty  even if you don t like sci fi  After reading this  I am definitely going to explore the rest of the series  This book definitely goes on my favorite books list  One of the things that I really liked about this book is how it kept the plot moving  You think the book is going in one direction but then something completely unexpected like the Improbability drive turns that book in a completely different direction  Another thing I liked is that the author was able to balance his comedy and his writing  His writing was brilliant and his descriptions were vivid  The comedy aspect of the book propelled his writing to whole new level  Rarely do you find a book that is able to combine these 2 aspects without one overpowering the other  Overall  it was a fun read and I highly recommend this book to everyone  Brilliant fun  Douglas Adams was so creative  Loved the book  I would give it 10 stars laugh out loud funny  Had an embarrassing moment in the dentist office while reading this trilogy  couldn t stop laughing and everyone was staring   Laughed the entire way through  A classic  Amazingly random and very well executed  I didn t have a clue what was going on a lot of the time but it was still good and i laughed out loud in more than a couple parts  I love Marvin the paranoid android and Eddie  the disgustingly cheerful ships computer with a personality malfuntion You just can t write this stuff  Well obviously you can  but Douglas Adams rules at it  No one else could compare so ha  na na na naaa na I read it about 25 years ago  Thoroughly enjoyed it If you re a sci fi fan and have a sense of humour then you ll love it  A book I can re read over and over again  This is one of those books I d heard about since a child but never got around to reading  until recently  It s absolutely hilarious  It was fun to make all of the early internet culture connections with elements from this story Douglas Adam s writing style is genius  and is full of curious ways of expressing things that are very precise and funny  such as   The ships hung in the sky in much the same way that bricks don t  The story is quite unpredictable  maybe because it was written by the seat of Douglas s pants  and full of intelligent humor  Marvin the super intelligent robot  and enormously depressed as a result  is likely one of my favorite characters  The humor is often just plain silly  and there s not really a point to any of the story  it s just a fun  amusing ride Heavily recommended  I first read this book back in high school and have read it twice in the last 3 years  The series   I have never had a book make me laugh and shake my head as much as this one  The sheer stupidity of it is enough to raise an eyebrow  If you want something light and filled with nonsense  I strongly recommend this book   I read this book way back in high school  mid 80s  and then again right before the movie came out in 2005  I was so looking forward to the movie  and I probably hampered my enjoyment of the movie by reading the book so close to seeing it In short  I love this book  I loved it as a teenager  and I found it more enjoyable as an adult  The writing style  the characters  the plot are all incredibly irreverent  It has brought the number 42 as the answer to the ultimate question concerning life  the universe  and everything into my regular lexicon  I can t wait for my kids to be old enough to read and enjoy this Don t panic  Hilarious  Amazing book but could of been better  After all I enjoyed it and I recommend it  This isn t science fiction  it is something else   I read it some years back  it and everything else by Adams that I could find    And I just found a nature book by Dougie  he is writing about animals that may well become extinct  lemurs and rhinos for instance  I stuffed it away for a plane trip to Italy when I will need a great book  Summary After trying to defend his home from construction workers  Arthur Dent is whisked away by his friend Ford Prefect as the Earth was to be demolished to make way for a space bypass  Ford reveales that he is an alien who was trapped on Earth  They get picked up by a Vogon ship and are held hostage until they are discharged into space  Meanwhile  the President of the Galaxy  Zaphod Beeblebrox  examines the new spaceship  The Heart of Gold  Transfixed by the ship  he steals it and activates the experimental Improbability Drive  a device capable of producing events that are incredibly improbable  Just as Arthur and Ford are about to be discharged into space  The Heart of Gold shows up and they are saved  It is then revealed that Zaphod is Ford s cousin  Zaphod decides that he wants to visit a luxury planet filled with treasure  and sets course for one  They crash land on the planet and explore by themselves  Arthur meets a native and is led to the knowledge that Earth was actually a massive super computer designed to reveal the answer to Life  the Universe  and Everything  Centuries before  the computer revealed that answer was    42  Not knowing what the question was  the computer was set to work to figure that out  It apparently was going to show the answer when the Earth was destroyed by the Vogons for the bypass  The original inhabitants of Earth  believed that the question was implanted in the human brain and offered to buy Arthur s  When he declines  the strap him down and are about to disect him when the alarms go off  providing a destraction  Him and the rest of the crew make it back to the ship without being caught by the Space Police  After the escapade  Zaphod offers to take them to The Restaurant At The End of The Universe  To be continued    I rated this book 5 stars because the action  adventure  and pure science fiction context I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in science fiction  and would be able to understand the immense plot  Reread  5 starsI think you have to be in the mood for this to really appreciate it  and be a fan of British humour  I was in the perfect mood  stressing about finals this light and fluffy comedy was perfect  Nothing is really serious in this book even though there are A LOT of deaths  an entire planets worth  haha  First read 5 stars It s been a number of years since my last read  so I figured it was high time to revisit  Hitchhiker s Guide   Can t really think of another book that I m as familiar with as Douglas Adams  classic tale of intergalactic silliness  Read it at least 2 3 times growing up  watched the cheesy BBC series  the newer Hollywood film  even played an ancient computer game version on my old Atari ST  This time it was an audiobook read by Stephen Fry  who does a great job with the material   Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy by douglas AdamsScience Fiction216 pages The hitchhikers guide to the galaxy is a book contained in a tablet containing the secrets of the universe  There are many galactic hitchhikers working on a new more accurate version  That is how Mr  Ford gets stuck on earth  He only manages to get a lift from some unfriendly aliens that destroy the planet along with Fords friend Arthur Dent  When they are read the third worst poetry in the universe and thrown off their ride they are saved by the most amazing people  President of the universe Zaphod Beeblebrox and Trillian Not to mention the clinically depressed robot Marvin  They then find the mystery planet margreathea where they made planets and where they sought to find the answer to the great question  7 5 million years later in the second most powerful computer later  The answer is 42  But you do not know the question  Ten million more years and you get earth the universes largest and most powerful computer  Only to be destroyed 5 minutes before the question  Because you can not just have one awnser it is not a probable question  I gave this five stars because of the humor and ironic nature of this book  Only the improbable happens  Although it does make sense considering their ship is powered by imporablility  This book is a novel to read for action and humor loving readers  One thing to say about this  everything  think about everything  was improbable to happen  Even though this is a satire   a well written one   you will find the events improbable  no spoilers   And will receive a good touch of humor   was the only book when I really laughted a lot actually  My all time favorite sci fi book     This book is timeless  It really just doesn t seem to age at all  If you are one of the few that has not read this yet  then please get on it soon  If nothing else  you will understand where many pop culture references are from and will know why the answer to most questions is 42 Arthur Dent wakes up one morning with his house about to be demolished  His friend  Ford Prefect  drags him off to the pub and tells him a story that puts Arthur s house problems into perspective a bit  Turns out Ford is an alien  and the Earth is about to be destroyed to make way for an intergalactic highway  This first section of the book is just constantly hilarious and worth reading more than once  Ford introduces Arthur to the infamous Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  and they hitchhike a ride off Earth just before it explodes  The rest of the story is a fast paced adventure through space The book is really a transcription of the radio show and therefore it does move at a really quick pace  It is fair to say that this is not your typical sci fi  Imagine a short story  sci fi version of Discworld  That s the best way I can think to describe it  You will find that the book is slightly low on explanation and description  Adams is no worldbuilder  although ironically one of the characters is     but that is not what the book is supposed to be about All the books in the 5 book trilogy are short enough to make the whole thing readable in one go  This time round though  I am reading one at a time and reading other books in between  I think it is better that way  The style of writing is best in small doses  because otherwise you read it too quickly and miss lots of the subtle references  Well  I do anyway 9 10 I adored this as soon as I first heard it on the radio back in 1978  The radio series fitted Adams  work perfectly as did the cast  Peter Jones as The Book is epic  I ve got the recording now and it s a favourite  The book comes over well too  You need a really quirky sense of humour for it but more people have this than might be thought      I love the way Adams  does the characters including Marvin  the paranoid android  The line   Brain the size of a planet and what have they got me doing  Opening doors   always brings me a smile  there are many lines like this  another is  I m only in it for the shouting   as the Vogon guard tells Arthur Dent  Arthur actually quite likes vogon poetry too  Yes  I really am an adict  Although it s classed as sci fi it s certainly not in the old par secs brigade  it s about ideas  attitudes  relationships  all the things that turn me on  Setting them in an alien sphere enables us to get one step back and so get a better perspective  You really don t need to be a sci fi freak to enjoy Hitchhiker  Some of the later books in the series don t work as well as the later episodes on the radio did  I still have them to keep the collection whole but they get read less often  It can be a problem with a series of books on the same theme that the first is really good and the follow ons are just that and get more dull as they go further from the original  Frank Herbert s Dune is a case in point but Adams does far better than Herbert s sequels  I ve put the date that I first finished the book but it gets regular re reads so the last time I read was in 2011   Hickhickers has such a great humor and personality  I can t believe it s taken me this long to actually start reading it  but after I did I couldn t get enough  I listened to it on Audible  bc it was narrated by Stephen Fry  which adds a whole other layer of wit and awesomelyness  Hold on to your towel I read this book while I should have been reading other assigned literature during the good ol  high school days  Heck  if On the Road did not give me the metaphysical happiness in face of the shifting mirage of the American identity  I ll just resolutely give up and hop on the heart of gold Too much fun with this book  Someday I ll join all the rest of you guys at the Restaurant at the End of the Universe  Prochetena za ne znam koi p t  Briliantno idiotska  osvezhavashcha  zabavna  Prod lzhavam s s sledvashchite      I actually read the film tie in edition of this book  but practically ignored the photos and skipped the interviews and afterword  I m afraid The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy was originally published in 1979 but has remained a favourite of many people throughout the years  A lot of people will probably think of the famous film adaptation upon hearing the title  but I must admit that this book is fabulous and definitely worth a read It begins with an ordinary man names Arthur Dent  who s house is about to be demolished  His friend Ford Prefect   who turns out to be a native not to Earth  but to a planet somewhere around Betelgeuse   abruptly arrives bearing news of the end of the world  The pair hitch a ride on the attacking Vogon airship  surviving the destruction of the planet Earth This book is a bit all over the place  but to give you the gist of it  Zaphod Beeblebrox  the President of the Universe  steals The Heart of Gold   a one of a kind spaceship named after the Infinite Improbability Drive  After Ford and Arthur are thrown off the Vogon ship  they re rescued just in the nick of time by Trillian and Zaphod aboard The Heart of Gold  As luck has it  Trillian turns out to be the girl Arthur had tried to win the heart of at a party  and Zaphod the guy who won her instead The crew set off toward a legend of a planet   Magrathea  where customised planets were supposedly built  Here  Arthur is told the truth about Earth   and how the mice were in charge   by Slartibartfast and the rodents Trillian brought to space with her attempt to buy Arthur s brain  due to it having the Ultimate Question to Life  the Universe and Everything  to which the answer is 42  as determined by the Deep Thought computer  Arthur is also informed that dolphins are far more intelligent than any human realised  and had made many attempts to warm us of the impending doom  One message of theirs  had we bothered to listen  translates to So long  and thanks for all the fish This book is so fantastically eccentric  I absolutely adored it  The characters are just great  and the humour is so subtle  Everything fits together in weird  ingenious ways  and every piece of  seemingly  irrelevant story is so well written  and I loved every bit  Even the bit about the sperm whale  and his thoughts throughout his short lifespan  Poor whale   This is definitely in my favourites  and I cannot wait to read the rest of the series   In fact  I m about to grab the second book right now   I have to give The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy 5 stars out of 5 BookMarked HomeHome againI like to be hereWhen I canWhen I come homeCold and tiredIt s good to not burn booksBeside the fireI pick up a storyIt s time to readDouglas Adams supplies meThat which I needThe Universe is very smallLife is just a joke to tellAliens watching computer screensAs we devolve into a single cellFar away Across the skySoaring on the iron shipCalling humans to their kneesJust to hear the softly spoken trick Excellent fiction  absolutely work of a brilliant  far beyond his age mind  despite a little lack of portrayings and literary elements Yet i believe this book is a must read  5 stars is well deserved  In Douglas Adams s The Hitchhiker s Guide to the galaxy  the average reader is in for a type of literature that is guaranteed to be like no other book that they have read before  This is a space age book that starts off with a normal character named Author Dent who has to go through the regular mature problems and face real life situations  That all changes when a planned alien attack vaporizes earth and kill all living organisms  Arthur was only able to survive due to his alien friendFord Prefect hitching a ride in space and him taking Arthur with him  This begins their intergalactic journey as they continue it with a depressed robot  a girl he once tried to talk to at a party  and the trouble making president of the galaxy  The book is filled with fictional facts about space that are very humorous as they all find away to affect Arthur and help him survive as he goes along with Ford to explore space since his home earth was destroyed by aliens  HG2G is a classic that not only influenced many subsequent scifi movies and books  but to this day is still the source of countless cultural references  such as babelfish   dont panic   and of course 42  So long  and thanks for the fish  So long and thanks for all the fish  Perhaps the smartest and funniest book in the English language  A true exploration of the absurdity of the human condition  ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC  Richard Dawkins had mentioned Douglas Adams frequently in his books and I finally had a chance to come around and read this book  I finally know why this book is so popular and well known  It s hilarious  it a great story  and he makes some pretty good points about things such as religion  politicians  and our place in the universe  It only took me 5 days to read it and it s one of those books where you don t really want to put it down because it flows off the page and you want more  I already ordered  The Ultimate Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  in order to finish the next 4 books  I can t wait  So much witty humor and bizarre  coincidences   I recommend this to all who like a good story and don t take themselves too seriously   Read the book only after watching the film  It was still a treat  The concepts and out of box thinking is amazing  Combine that with a lot of humor  Awesome  Thumbs up  or the thumbs sideways for doing some hitchhiking      I tried to read this book for the first time about 6 years ago  prior to the movie  and though i cried laughing as I read and reread the intro  i just couldn t warm to the sci fi terminology and never got beyond the Vogon poetry  This time I blasted through book 1 of this  trilogy  in tree days  Adams  style is unlike any literature I d previously read  and his way of blending science  humanity  humour  and culture with limitless imagination is brilliant  Looking forward to book 2   Este es un libro pequeno hecho  y adaptado de  como un serial de radio  Como tal  los capitulos son pequenos  el lenguaje digerible y el ritmo rapido  Eso hace aun mas increible la cantidad de informacion y estructura que Douglas Adams mete a este mundo  En un librito que  de apartar el tiempo  se lee de una sentada y sin una pizca de cansancio  Douglas Adams logra incorporar un mundo con una mitologia ya bien definida y personajes entrenables  Todo el mundo ama al androide paranoide  a pesar de que la cantidad de hojas en la que aparece es limitada  Pequenos detalles a la mitad del libro de alguna manera tienen sentido al final  En fin  Hay poco que se le pueda criticar a este libro  fuera de que se acaba demasiado rapido   I enjoyed this book very much  If you ve ever watched any Monty Python movies  and ENJOYED them  then this book is for you  This book is very funny  in the same way that Monty Python is  Also  many references to math and science are made  like improbability  alternate universes  the end of time itself  and more  The story begins with an Earthman  named Arthur Dent  who  in the process of lying in front of bulldozers  which are threatening to knock down his house  is completely unaware that Earth is to be destroyed in the next 12 minutes  Also  it just so happens that at the same time  Zaphod Beeblebrox of Damogran  who as soon as he becomes president of the galaxy  steals the ship Heart of Gold  containing the improbability drive  which lets the ship do everything  as long as it s properly programmed and fed a fresh cup of hot tea  I really loved this   clever  witty and funny  I give this book 4 9  Over all the book was great  I would recommend this book to people who love science fiction or the person who loves a good adventure  Have you ever wondered what the universe is like  No human knows  So how will we survive if the universe if the world is destroyed  That s exactly what happens in Douglas Adams  The Hitchhiker s Guide To The Galaxy  A man named  Arthur  who is the only survivor of the world s destruction  He is rescued by an alien named  Ford  Ford is a hitchhiker who is collecting more information for one of the best books in the universe  The Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy  When they escape they are captured and blown into space  where they are picked up by the president of the galaxy and his girlfriend who has stolen a new spaceship prototype  While on the ship they search for the ancient planet of Magrathea  When they try to land they are attacked by missiles which hit their ship  Will they survive  What secrets does the planet hold  Find out in Douglas Adams  The Hitchhiker s Guide To The Galaxy  I would have given this book five stars  but I thought the beginning could have been a little better  When I was reading the beginning almost made me want to quit reading it  After a while I got really into it and thought it was a great book Have you ever read a book so well crafted  and outrageously funny  Well  if you haven t  and are looking to dwell into this peculiar genre  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is a great place to begin  This novel is a classic book  as it has withstood the test of time for over fifty years  However  it is science fiction  making this book a science fiction classic  A disclaimer  the story takes place in the future  so  consequently  some parts of the book are a little bit confusing at times  Don t worry  the book will sort itself out  and make perfect sense at the end  This novel follows Arthur  a Brit  who likes routine  He likes to wake up in the morning to a warm cup of tea  He enjoys waking up and not seeing giant reptiles flying down onto him and snatching him up for dinner  nor would any human  I imagine   However  one morning  he wakes up to find construction workers  claiming that they have the authority to tear down his house  This puts Arthur in a terrible mood  as he spends a good part of his day lying down in front of his house  Much to his surprise  his friend  Ford  soon tells arthur that he wasn t human after all  which Arthur had the sense was the case   and that the Earth was being destroyed that day  So  Arthur and Ford quickly escape the obliterated Earth  and journey across the Galaxy  due to the fact that Ford is a researcher for the newly improved Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy   The story takes place in different parts of the Galaxy  from the deck of a Vogon ship to the man made paradise of Magrathea  Arthur and Ford must outrun Vogons  police forces  and even mice as they travel throughout the galaxy  Will Arthur and Ford stay alive throughout their adventures  or will their fate take a turn for the worse I felt that Douglas Adams did a tremendous job at creating suspense  whether that be right at the end of the book  or in the first forty pages  The suspense was embedded into the plotline of the book  which added exceedingly to the story  Another superb element that Douglas did very well was character progression  The main character  Arthur  is a great example of this  In the beginning of the book  Arthur  as stated before  love s routine  and when his routine is broken  he gets annoyed at the fact that everything isn t going his way  However  as the story progress on  Arthur learns to expect the unexpected  and to take what life throws at you  He learns to be happy and cheerful without routine  which is a crucial skill to have if you are a Hitchhiker of the Galaxy  I loved Adam s style of writing  which was filled with high pace action and adventure  Throughout the book I was craving more as new challenges for Arthur and Ford kept appearing  However  at the end of the book  I took away some major lessons  or themes  that Arthur had woven into the plot  i e being contented with what you have   I extremely enjoyed the major motif in the novel  which was improbability  This was the first book I read that had an idea come to life as a physical thing  and that idea be a major motif  My only concern with the book was the ending  I thought that Douglas tried using a cliffhanger to end the book  yet the story finishes at the end of a major conflict  Otherwise  I had no problems with this book  I think that a classic has to have an aspect that is appealing  but also  that aspect must withstand that test of time  For an example  this book  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  a major aspect is it being written in the future  The book was published in 1979  and the events that occurred in the book seemed impossible to happen  However  forty some years later  this same aspect applies  As I was reading this book  the things that were happening seemed crazy and unimaginable  This is what makes this book a classic  A book that is to withstand the test of time must have an aspect that will be relevant in the nearby future  As I was reading this book  I felt excited to read about what would happen next  I also felt shocked at times  due to some of the characters decisions  Throughout the book  though  I felt joyful as I saw the characters developing into better people  or beings  if you will   I truly enjoyed reading a classic book  I felt as though I connected with the people that were reading this book back in 1979  and that was an experience that was new to me  A challenge  however  was understanding some of the context of the book  this was due to the book taking place in the future  which wouldn t matter if it was a classic or not   I would rate this book five galactic stars out of five  because it was truly an outstanding novel  Times have changed a lot since this book was published   the original radio series was broadcast  While there are echoes of Doctor Who   Red Dwarf  to me the Hitch hiker books have a lot more in common with Alice in Wonderland than modern science fiction  There is a feeling that the whole world is askew   oops  sorry universe  A great cast of characters with really witty dialogue  Marvin the Paranoid Android will always hold a special place in my heart Edit    prophecy fulfilled  view spoiler   Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy was an early ereader  Wow   hide spoiler   I m not sure what I just read but it was great      A hillarious intergalactic adventure took the place as my 2nd favorite book  with a laugh per second rate and good natured themes   Hitchhiker s  delivers a perfect satire of what it really means to be human  Tied along with smart characters and a collection of great science fiction plot points  A great novel was born by the legendary Douglas Adams  and it goes by the name of The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  This is an absolutely stunning piece of work  A lot of whimsical seat of your pants type of material that will lead you for an adventure way out of this world  Douglas Adams is phenomenal as a writer  Don t forget to bring a towel when you start this book  Now one of my all time favourite books  I absolutely love Douglas Adam s absurdist style of humour  and he pulls it off perfectly in The Hitchhiker s Guide  This book is good     and funny too  PNo seriously  this is one of those pointless books just written to lighten up your heart  and it works  Kinda reminded me of Three Men in a Boat when I was reading this  That book was funny too  kinda in a similar fashion Arthur seems like a real nice character who is satisfied with his daily routine and his life turns upside down when Ford takes him Hitchhiking across the galaxy  Ford is a cool and funny character  clever too  Zaphod and Marvin are the characters I really liked  being funny and all  Would have loved to see more of Trillian  but I guess I need to read the next books for that  which I definitely intend to do  Seems like a cute nice chick  she does  One of my favorite books from when I was younger  this was a fun reread  Now I may need to go watch the movie again Edit  My original review and status updates were for a different edition of the book  one with interviews and other information about the Hitchhiker s movie  On July 26  2011  I bought the entire 5 book trilogy and am updating to that edition  This book makes it to the all time list  not reaching the pinnacle only because it ended far too soon  Absolute brilliance  Absolute lunacy  Perfection   which is of course completely improbable  You will either love this series or hate it  there is no middle ground  Here is a test I have devised to determine whether or not to try it What is your reaction to the following true statement   The Hitchhiker s Trilogy  is a series of five books   The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy    The Restaurant at the End of the Universe    Life  the Universe  and Everything    So Long  and Thanks for All the Fish   and  Mostly Harmless  A  How stupid  EVERYONE knows that trilogies mean THREE books B  Why does he have a 5 book  trilogy   I m curious C  ROFL If your answer is A  forget it  You won t get it  If your answer is B  give the first book a try  You just might appreciate Adams  warped sense of humor If your answer is C  RUN  don t walk to the nearest library or bookstore  you have been missing the ride of your life  Logica van een dronken aardbei  You will learn the meaning of the universe  life  and everything      Maybe not  However  it will teach you what you need to do when you are hitchhiking at the universe  Everyone    drink your beers  and some salty nuts  Ohhh     Do not dare to forget your towels  Towels are important     When I was a kid my dad and I used to listen to audio books while driving longer distances  travelling etc   and one of them was The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy   The Restaurant at the End of the Universe  So  whilst first reading them in English  there s the general knowledge of the German audio books  Which of course adds a nostalgia factor Adams humour is perfect  so perfect  Sarcasm and lunacy   I like that  and I think listening to it as a kid kind of shaped my taste   Also the narrative style is so perfect  I can t even decided whether I preferred the excerpts of the Guide or the story  the characters are perfect  itself  What more can I say  I love that book and it s up there with Alice s stories This is the third SciFi books in a row  also  three books in a row I really enjoyed  Guess  I should stick with this genre  My survival guide to life  This book will never get old in my case  I first read this book when I was a preteen and I ve read it over and over since  This is my all time favorite book  In this book there are a variety of characters from different planets in the universe who come together to find the Heart of Gold because of the President of the Galaxy  Within this scheme of things  the President of the Galaxy has destroyed Earth  the original prototype of the meaning of life  If you enjoy excitement and adventure this book literally will take you on an epic journey  Lo amo  lo amo  lo amo  Me encanta el humor absurdo y me encanta la ciencia ficcion  asi que lo disfrute caleta  me rei mucho  Ademas en este libro sale un  androide paranoide   que supongo que es lo que le dio el nombre a esa cancion de Radiohead  Me entere que tiene una pelicula donde actuan Martin Freeman y hacen voces Stephen Fry y Alan Rickman  DEBO VERLA  I find myself unable to say how much I truly loved this novel  How had I never read it  Barely a page was turned without a giggle escaping from my throat  Wonderful  I m still laughing about it   From 1979 comes The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  by Douglas Adams  a wholly remarkable book and a fully unexpected best seller The book shows itself at the beginning of Douglas s unconsidered literary career  A screen writer  he didn t want to write books  but write books he did  given enough prompting and large amounts of small green pieces of paper  The book shows the writer s newness to the medium  reading in a rather uneven yet deeply comedic fashion  No pro writer would have put that book out  because you just don t structure a story that way  but Douglas was writing by the seat of his pants when he wrote the radio show which the book adapts  so he paces fairly close to the original story  What is very obvious from the beginning is that the man knew how to twist a phrase  tie it into knots  wash it  dry it  hide it in the bathroom  and in the end  throwing it when it became unidentifiable Douglas Adams also showed himself among the best futurists that the world has ever seen  if only because he knows that the engineers aren t in charge  He keen looks at how technology can go wrong proved prophetic to the years ahead  because new technology sure likes to go wrong On the whole  I feel that the book has aged well  There are some references to tapes and databanks  and other period technologies  The Guide itself is described as having a very small screen  And yet  mostly  you don t notice the technology at all once it gets going because the important parts of recently technology haven t change much  More importantly  the frustrating and annoying parts of technology remain the same because marketeers and engineers haven t changed very much  Dumb ideas remain dumb ideas You should give the book a try  It s a quick read and though a bit rough about the edges  looking at times as haggard as the original actors  once the characters start speaking  all that will wash away  The humor in it that works still hits the mark  assuming that you like British humor  It s a point of great shame that it took me so long to read this book  and if you haven t read it  I hope you re avoiding the  but have you read the book   question like I did  Pick it up and read it  I was shocked by how short it is  around 200 pages  and it flows so quickly that you can finish it in less than a day  It s an extraordinary read that deserves every bit of its acclaim  imaginative  clever  and totally out of this world  in all senses of the phrase    Recuperaremos la normalidad en cuanto estemos seguros de lo que es normal    La guia del autoestopista galactico es el libro mas bizarro y uno de los mas divertidos que lei hasta ahora  Estaba necesitando reirme cuando lo empece y solo con el comienzo me hizo doblar de risa La introduccion es imperdible  tiene un humor impresionante  inocente y oscuro a la vez  En pocas lineas muy sinteticas y extremadamente literales resume al planeta Tierra y a la humanidad  Tambien nos anticipa que nuestro mundo va a ser destruido porque basicamente estorba en el camino de una autopista galactica  y por alguna razon de la burocracia cosmica es mas sencillo demoler la Tierra que rodearla La historia comienza unos momentos antes de que nuestro mundo deje de existir  con Arthur Dent  un hombre comun  en una manana comun  dentro de su casa comun  Arthur se entera de que su hogar esta a punto de ser demolido por un funcionario publico con el que es muy dificil razonar y no encuentra modo mas efectivo para impedir que demuelan su casa  sin aviso  que acostandose frente a la entrada  El dialogo que habra entre el y el funcionario es muy divertido  descabellado y lleno de burocracia hasta un punto insospechado  El delirio es la gran clave de esta historia Arthur obviamente no sabe que la Tierra esta a punto de ser destruida  de repente lo de su casa tiene otra perspectiva  y que el sera el unico humano sobreviviente  Tampoco sabe que su excentrico amigo Ford Prefect es en realidad un alien autoestopista interestelar que esta varado en nuestro planeta  Sera el quien le salve la vida  y con quien  muy a su pesar y con constantes quejas muy comicas  empezara a recorrer el universo utilizando la Guia del Autoestopista Galactico  Arthur tanteo nerviosamente el colchon antes de sentarse  en realidad tenia muy pocos motivos para estar nervioso  porque todos los colchones que se crian en los pantanos de Squornshellous Zeta se matan y se secan perfectamente antes de entrar en servicio  Muy pocos han vuelto a la vida  Se toparan con personajes muy pintorescos que aportan mucho humor a la novela  desde un robot paranoico maniaco depresivo  resentido y existencialista  hasta seres que se agregan partes de cuerpo extra por razones cosmeticas o puertas que suspiran de satisfaccion luego de un trabajo bien hecho  de abrirse y cerrarse  porque eso es basicamente lo que hace una puerta   La incredulidad del pobre Arthur  a quien me imagine siempre como Martin Freeman  no se si por mi locura personal o porque lo vi en imdb  se pondra a prueba una y otra y otra y otra vez A todo esto  nunca se aclara realmente  pero creo que nunca llego a sacarse el pijama La Guia del Autoestopista Galactico es basicamente una guia turistica muy completa que posee informacion de todo el universo  Es monstruosamente grande y de imprimirse tendria cerca de un millon de paginas  por lo que en realidad es   como un libro electronico   y su aspecto fisico es llamativamente similar a un modelo de Kindle con teclado que salio hace unos anos  Tambien aparecen referencias a la que ahora se conoce como la tecnologia touch y a los sensores de movimiento  Ah  y ademas hay un  pez Babel  que hace traducciones  y fue quien dio origen al famoso traductor de internet    aunque afortunadamente el que conocemos nosotros es menos invasivo Ah   de nuevo  y tambien creo la   Estrella Googlepex    una de las computadoras mas poderosas del universo  Recordemos que esta es una novela de 1979 y hagamos juntos   ohhh   Pero aparte de todo eso  la idea de la Guia es magistral  El autor tiene una imaginacion desbocada y en este libro le da rienda suelta a mas no poder  La informacion de la Guia es realmente muy turistica  pero con detalles bizarros y remates inesperados  delirantes y muy graciosos  Mi preferido creo que fue el peligroso trago detonador gargarico pangalactico   Tambien hay referencias a la Enciclopedia Galactica  de Isaac Asimov  pero a el no se lo nombra  como uno de los libros mas importantes de la galaxia  La Guia del autoestopista ya ha sustituido a la gran Enciclopedia galactica como la fuente reconocida de todo el conocimiento y la sabiduria  porque si bien incurre en muchas omisiones y contiene abundantes hechos de autenticidad dudosa  supera a la segunda obra  mas antigua y prosaica  en dos aspectos importantes  En primer lugar  es un poco mas barata  y luego  grabada en la portada con simpaticas letras grandes  ostenta la leyenda  NO SE ASUSTE   Vieron como en algunas historias uno piensa  todo podria pasar   Bueno  aca es literalmente asi  Douglas Adams con su imaginacion delirante invento lo que llama la energia de la improbabilidad  algo que vuelve posible absolutamente todo en el momento mas impensado y por las causas mas incoherentes  Deja abierta la posibilidad de que ocurra absolutamente cualquier cosa y todo sea aceptable  Solo falta Doctor Who Ademas este es el libro de las frases inesperadas  Quizas en un momento viene hablando con seriedad y de repente hace un remate delirante que te hace doblar de risa  Lo peor es que lo que dice tiene sentido dentro de su delirio  Hay hasta teorias cientificas que tienen logica No queria que se termine  pero por suerte hay mas libros  Si los que siguen son la mitad de buenos de lo que es el primero  entonces mejor dejo a mano una toalla Resena de Fantasia Magica I don t know how I went 28 years without reading this  I loved everything about it  but listening to Stephen Fry s audio version was an absolute delight  Made this week s commute so much better  I really liked the first book  It was very spacey  especially in the language  It was a bit hard for me to get the hang of it at first and I think that happened when I started with the second book  The book is written in a very funny way with brilliant one liners and lots of quotable parts  The thing I kept doing as I read was imagining Alan Rickman s voice every time Marvin spoke  I was so good  Alan Rickman s voice is the greatest  And that was the theme as I read the book  no  not Alan Rickman s voice  sadly   but the movie  I have watched the movie twice and so it was pretty easy to imagine the characters like the actors and keep waiting for the same things to happen  something that did not occur  I got the  read the book before the movie  thing  I usually do that so I do not have that problem  But this time was a little distracting and maybe the reason I was a tad confused about the spacey things  The good part is that the book and the movie are not completely alike  The first part of the movie is pretty much the same  but after that events are very different and then at the end it comes back to the book a little  I was told that to do the movie they had picked parts of the other books as well to build the story  If this is true I do not know  I have not finished the whole series and so far I do not think it is  But anyway  this first book is really enjoyable and it does a great job of introducing the universe where the story is set and the characters that will be expanded upon further in other books  My recommendation  read it  definitely and be sure to have the next one close  because you will want to keep reading  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy was one of the best book I have read in a long time  This book it made for the fun of just reading it  The book

Dent   view spoiler  I will agree that he not the best to hold all humanity but what ever   hide spoiler   The Hitchhiker s guide to the Galaxy  much like it s movie adaptation  is quirky and funny  From the Volgon battle destroyer and learning about the actual hitchiker s guide  to Deep thought and the question of life  the universe  and everything this book brings to you a wild and wacky story that is thoroughly enjoyable to read  So if you are worried about whether or not you will like this book DON T PANIC  just be calm and don t forget your towel  This is one of my favorite books of all time  This award adventure of author dent is funny and interesting  The authors writing style really brings out the universe displayed in the book and has the reader wondering what will come next  I really liked how the author referenced things that don t exist but explains them so that the reader is not lost on the reference  I also identify with the character who has no idea what is going on for the majority of the book  This book is a funny book that I would recommend to anyone and everyone  Incercam cu greu sa nu rad isteric in tren  e awesome  So long and thanks for all the fish  This book will let you explore impeccable sights from your own cozy bed I loved this book and tore through it within days of purchasing it I went blindly into the store to find a new book to read  not knowing that I would cross something so spectacular This novel pushed me to love reading science fiction novels  Aged 11 I had seen the first episode of the TV series  I loved it  I was given PS1 and bought this book for 95p  I still own that book  It s been read so often it s falling apart  This is one of my favourite books ever  I ve read every book in the series and always go back to it  Everyman Arthur Dent has a bad day that turns into a really bad day  Aliens  beer  fish and towels  Cannot praise or recommend it enough  persevere and don t forget your towel  Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams is a fun novel that details the humorous  zany  and often insane interplanetary journey of earthling Arthur Dent and his alien friend Ford Prefect as they travel the galaxy on less than 30 Altairian dollars a day and learn about probability  Vogons  and why you should always bring your towel  This fanciful book will both amuse and captivate readers as they are introduced to the universe via the ultimate hitchhiker s guide  a heart warming book  so many great plot twists  definitely recommend this book to anyone who is in for a great  life changing  story  I picked up this book this evening  little did I know that it would be such a fast read  Finished in about four hours  I really enjoyed the pace of it  I m not much for a lot of detail and this did the job well  The detail is sparing and the dialogue is quick  Very gripping introduction  if I m not gripped by the introduction of a book in the first 25 pages it s hard for me to keep reading  Short chapters make it fun  Easy to get the gist of the story without having to stop and stumble through definitions  however I still was privy to a few words for which I had not known their definitions  The book does bounce back and forth between timelines and is a bit annoying  but needed for the story In short  pleasant read  interesting time travel and intergalactic related story telling  Este libro es genial  lei que era un buen libro de ciencia ficcion y no me ha defraudado para nada  ademas  me mantuvo riendo mas de lo que cualquier otro libro lo ha hecho  Uno de mis libros favoritos  Mrs AB read this book in grade 9 and found it pretty easy to read  It was the first science fiction she had ever read  She loved the humor in it  She has used the characters in this book for halloween costumes for more than 20 years  READ IT  Fantastically absurd and deeply wise  As good a philosophical work on our follies as any Tolstoy or Roth     This is the type of book I ve never encountered before  The universe is a joke and the book is an explanation to everything  Everything is not what it seems  Earth is not a planet  to be honest  This book will make you spew your drink through your nose  don t read it while you drink     In an Indonesian word  kampret    Hahahah  just so you know  kampret is a type of a bat   I LOVE THIS BOOK  This is the first English book that make me laugh without thinking the meaning of the joke  I absolutely loved the movie and fell in love with the book  Adams created such an intelligent and dry sense of humour  you can t help but to laugh at the witty conclusions drawn in the book  Yeah  I m reading it again     Especially for Towel Day     xD    Every year I m reading the book for Towel Day now  the third time by now  and every year it s as good as the very first time  xD Simply brilliant  42  What can I say  I wish I had been in the movie  although it was bad and I guess I should be happy about NOT being in it  Douglas Adams had a quirky and original sense of humour  This book started life as a radio programme  then became a book and a television series  all of them slightly different and all of them very funny   There is also a film  it is not included in that list  If you must know what it about  The earth is destroyed and one earthman travels around the universe  visiting several rather odd planets and meeting a variety of aliens  with very little help from the guide of the title  That does not give much of the flavour of the book  This novel is just   amazing  I couldn t stop reading because it made me lough quite a lot but also had a lot of tension  Because I don t think that  must reads  exist  noone should read a book although he doesn t like it  I consider this novel a  must try   Most probably have seen the motion picture and although I ven been spoilered by it reading the novel was still a great experience  I m definitely going to read the other 4 books of the  Trilogy in Five Parts   42 I first read this book when I was 13  on the recommendation of the person I was dating at the time  I thought I was going to hate it  but that person was really sure that I would like it  and since I really liked that person   well  you know how that goes     I utterly adored it  of course  and promptly proceeded to plow through the rest of the series  devouring every page of heavily hilarious hijinks  cleverly constructed characters  and wildly wondrous wordplay Then I saw the movie  in 2005 when it was still in theaters  Afterward  I promised myself I would read the books again as soon as possible  to expeditiously supplant the overwhelming disappointment  Yet somehow  as soon as possible  ended up being ten years later  when I finally had an urgent hankering for some Deep Thought that just couldn t wait another day  I brought it with me on a long train ride last week and relished every moment of the first installment of this whimsical romp through space  every bit as enjoyable as when I read it more than half my life ago  I m excited to read the rest of the  trilogy  again  I love it  I love it  I love it   This is by no means the first  second or third time I have read this book  but it has  although I can t imagine why  been a little while since I last visited  I love Douglas Adams  I love how subtly clever he is in a world that is completely of his own creation  One particular line made me fall in love with this book all over again   Science has achieved some wonderful things of course  but I d rather be happy than right any day    In fact I love that whole scene so much  but I won t bore you typing it all out again   Every time I read this I get a smile on my face  and really  what can be better than that  Well  maybe a meal at the Restaurant at the end of the universe   I absolutely adore this series    first read it when I was a teenager  OMG   over 25 years ago   Revisiting it has been a blast     First one was great  Absolutely hilarious  completely unpredictable  and just about the funnest thing I ve ever read  Douglas Adams is an absolute comic genius and Hitchhiker s is a timeless classic of any genre or category  An absolutely amazing book  Would recommend it to anyone who enjoys books   I think this is part of a series  right  Oh duh  it s right there in the title   Trilogy  But this is the only one I ve read so far  Earth gets destroyed and the sole survivor  a Brit  is taken on an outrageous journey through the galaxy  with his alien best friend and  The Hitchhiker s Guide  as his only source of information  It had me laughing out loud  And it has surprisingly deep moments as well that get you thinking about humanity  Another good time read  Quando sarcasmo  ironia e intelligenza lavorano in armonia  il risultato e strepitoso come questo fantastico testo  Un capolavoro di humour e di sagace  perfidia   Recently  I read the book The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams  The main character  Arthur  ended up going onto an adventure in space after Earth was demolished for an interstellar highway  Arthur is rescued by an alien named Ford Prefect  He finds out many things about Earth  including the fact that it was a giant computer  The giant computer was calculating the question to the answer of 42 given by another super computer  Arthur must find a way to get the Earth back up and running I personally enjoyed this book  I thought that it was goofy  but at the same time scientifically accurate  For example  there was a part in the book where a whale was generated from an impossibility generator  which could happen in the future  The whale was having many thoughts go through its mind  until it fell to its death because it was generated in the upper atmosphere of a planet I would recommend this book to anyone with a sense of humor who also has a very scientifically based mindset  I have come across many people who have hated this book because they didn t get the science jokes  This book is one of my favorite books  just because of all of the science jokes  To simplify  if you don t think scientifically  don t read this  If you do think scientifically  this book is a must read  If you re not sure if you think scientifically or not  read it to just see if you like it or not  Mezclar ciencia ficcion y humor quizas no se algo sencillo  Mezclar cualquier cosa con humor en un libro es una tarea compleja  los libros siempre parecen  cosas serias   aburridas y de otras generaciones  Pero la Guia no es el caso  La Guia se parece  de a ratos  a un sketch de Monty Python  un sketch de Cha Cha Cha o un gameplay del Monkey Island  Definitivamente cualquier persona DEBE leer la Guia  porque debemos estar preparados para que el absurdo extremo se nos presente en cualquier momento  Again and again a fantastic book And narrated by Stephen Fry  What else could you want  This is the best book I ve ever read  and you should read it if you haven t  It s the fist in a series and is pack with non seance  funniness  action  and witty writing from Douglas Adams  I am really on a reading roll this month  I think I ve read more than half of 2015  This book was part of the List of Books To Read in 2016 because I m not sure how I hadn t read it yet I was a bit afraid to dislike this book  after the hype around it and how it s loved by so many sci fi people like me  So it s lucky that in fact I really liked it and high five it with five ish stars  It s short so it was fast to read  and the writing was funny  and at first I was looking for the aliens but then I found them so it worked out Douglas Adams writes like Terry Pratchett  or the opposite way around   in that there is no lack of entertainment anywhere  If you want to look at it more deeply then you ll find some questions about humanity  life and the universe  and incidentally 42 is the answer to none of them   espectacular    me encanto el libro  es recomendable 100  I can t really give a proper review on this because I loved so much about it  and I can t wait to read more  and it ll probably just be me flailing I read this years ago and I decided to re read it as both my Brother and Father read it recently and loved it  I wasn t disappointed a second time   and it is still just as hilarious when you know what is coming The writing is just brilliant   yet so simple  It s funny in the way that it takes normal everyday things and just turns them upside down   as well as spouting educated waffle  and the names of things   LOL  I know a lot of people who would avoid this book thanks to the  sci fi  kind of wrap it s got but truth be told it s more of a comedy than anything else  Don t PanicIf ever there was more helpful a phrase in the history of all that is written  that phrase should be terminated   Don t Panic  should be reason enough to give this book a five star rating  but since you re probably not going to read it solely on that bit of information alone I will be forced to expound on the subject   And I m not quite so happy about that Douglas Adams presents us with Arthur Dent  your proverbial  every man   This makes Arthur Dent very ordinary  very accessible  but otherwise very boring to the majority of readers like me who need merely to wander to the local pub to find a dozen of these fellows and instantly lose interest  However  should any of those fellows at the pub raise their thumb in an expert pose and suddenly be whisked away into the oblivion of the cosmos to argue with paranoid androids  endure the abusive prose of very  very  very  very  very horrible Vogon poets  and you d have something altogether not quite unlike a cup of tea  Or this book If you enjoy British humor of the unbelievably silly and clever nature then you should find yourself right at home with this book on your lap in your   well   home  My recommendation  Go out and grab this story of the universes general mish mash  brew a cup of tea  and enjoy the tales of Arthur Dent  He s just a regular guy stuck in a rather irregular and unhealthy universe  I re read this book in anticipation of finally reading the whole Hitchhiker Series  and in spite of my familiarity  the jokes and clever asides in the novel still made me laugh out loud in multiple places throughout the novel  Between the worst poetry in the universe being destroyed with Earth  Zaphod Beeblebrox s second hand ballpoint business  and Marvin s suicide inducing personality  Douglas Adam s subdued comedic genius is one of my favourites out there  This is the perfect book to read when you are feeling down  I dare you to read through Marvin s dialogues without cracking a smile  Marvin the paranoid android is my favorite character  Really  anyone who could make a starship commit suicide is rather highly estimated by me He jacked himself up to his feet and stood resolutely facing the opposite direction  That ship hated me   he said dejectedly  indicating the policecraft  That ship   said Ford in sudden excitement   What happened to it  Do you know   It hated me because I talked to it   You talked to it   exclaimed Ford   What do you mean you talked to it   Simple  I got very bored and depressed  so I went and plugged myself in to its external computer feed  I talked to the computer at great length and explained my view of the Universe to it   said Marvin  And what happened   pressed Ford  It committed suicide   said Marvin and stalked off back to the Heart of Gold It s an amusing book  really  and the way Douglas Adams tells the story brings to mind some of the passages of Godel  Escher  Bach  An Eternal Golden Braid  It challenges your perspective of things  One of those passages was this complete record of thoughts of a whale Another thing that got forgotten was the fact that against all probability a sperm whale had suddenly been called into existence several miles above the surface of an alien planet  And since this is not a naturally tenable position for a whale  this poor innocent creature had very little time to come to terms with its identity as a whale before it then had to come to terms with not being a whale any more This is a complete record of its thoughts from the moment it began its life till the moment it ended it  Ah       What s happening  it thought Er  excuse me  who am I Hello  Why am I here  What s my purpose in life  What do I mean by who am I Calm down  get a grip now     oh  this is an interesting sensation  what is it  It s a sort of     yawning  tingling sensation in my     my     well I suppose I d better start finding names for things if I want to make any headway in what for the sake of what I shall call an argument I shall call the world  so let s call it my stomach Good  Ooooh  it s getting quite strong  And hey  what s about this whistling roaring sound going past what I m suddenly going to call my head  Perhaps I can call that     wind  Is that a good name  It ll do     perhaps I can find a better name for it later when I ve found out what it s for  It must be something very important because there certainly seems to be a hell of a lot of it  Hey  What s this thing  This     let s call it a tail    yeah  tail  Hey  I can can really thrash it about pretty good can t I  Wow  Wow  That feels great Doesn t seem to achieve very much but I ll probably find out what it s for later on  Now   have I built up any coherent picture of things yet No Never mind  hey  this is really exciting  so much to find out about  so much to look forward to  I m quite dizzy with anticipation    Or is it the wind  There really is a lot of that now isn t it And wow  Hey  What s this thing suddenly coming towards me very fast  Very very fast  So big and flat and round  it needs a big wide sounding name like     ow     ound     round     ground  That s it  That s a good name    ground I wonder if it will be friends with me  And the rest  after a sudden wet thud  was silence And also   The GooglePlex Star Thinker   isn t that where the name google came from par hazard    Better late than never  Douglas Adams  Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is a genuine delight  There are plenty of reviews out there  predominantly positive  and rightly so  so I m not going to go too in depth in my review We follow Arthur Dent and his friend Ford Prefect  Arthur is your average Joe  the kind of guy most of us can relate to  but Ford is actually a researcher hitchhiker from somewhere around the star Betelgeuse  After Earth is blown up they find themselves in less than friendly  poetry loving  company aboard a Vogon space cruiser  the one that had just destroyed Earth  Arthur and Ford then find their way onto the spaceship Heart of Gold  captained by President of the Galaxy Zaphod Beeblebrox and his shipmate Trillian  The rest of the book follows the four  as well as the depressed  paranoid robot Marvin  on a journey through the galaxy  There s no way to do this book justice to merely summarize its plot  it really deserves to be read so you can experience the enjoyment  It s a rather quick read  but Adams packs an amazing amount in and does so with slick brilliance  The book is abundant with jokes and marvelous wry wit  There s plenty of sarcasm veiling some thought provoking statements on life  power  and how we go about living The dialogue was by far my favorite part of this book  The interaction between the characters is irresistible  The writing flows beautifully  and it s on par with some of the best British comedies I have ever seen Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy definitely merits a few rereads in the future  It feels like there is so much packed into this short novel  that I have just scratched the surface  I am eager to reread this once I ve had a little more time to process it and continue Adams  Hitchhiker  Trilogy   Brilliant    Its like the beautiful erotic spiritual sensation to have your brain licked by a fire dragon of furlonis                                                                                                       If you are reading my ridiculously short comments and reviews  feel free to ask  i d love to discuss and answer your questions about the book  and if you should read it or not                                                                                                            sick Utterly amazing  You only need to read  or in my case  hear  the first few pages of the book to fully understand why this series was so successful and loved by people all over the world Adams is a true genius in both his writing style  his plot  his characters  his imagination  his sci fi concepts and technologies  his england inspired universe building  his    aaagh  who am I kidding  This book is p e r f e c t Well  that s a lie of course  I bet some grumpy old literature scholars can find all sorts of problems and grow all sorts of issues with its style  narrative or use of pronouns  but I don t care  no one cares  Let us be honest here  Guide to the Galaxy is pure comedy and sci fi gold  A standard in the business  and the ruler onto which all other comedic enterprises are calibrated In short  I m so glad I read this book  and I m so mad I didn t read it ten years ago  at least Stephen Fry s reading on the audio version is  by the way  great  Lots of kudos to him and hopefully he ll narrate the other books following this one  You could tell by his voice he was also having a fun time when narrating  a possibly impossible to refuse reaction to Adam s work  Prior to starting this novel  one must understand that it was written by an Englishman  with typical English humor  If at times the jokes or events seem outlandish or silly  try to remember that they are being related in an almost sarcastic voice  these moments are meant to be absurd  which is why they are humorous in the first place  Believe it or not  the novel also provides a unique  almost meaningful  view on what it means to be human  what we find important  who we find important  etc However  be prepared for a handy dose of nerd culture  To this day  I check electrical devices for the  answer   for which I am sometimes rewarded to in all it s tiny glory  And   you should bring a towel   just in case      one of my favourite books of all time did not expect to like it but loved it Ceaselessly imaginative and hilarious  Even after multiple reads   Amazing first book introducing Douglas Adams unique and existential universe   Digital watches and towels  totally amazing peice of illogical humorous story telling here  When you need a great laugh  even the cliche laugh out loud  read this one  Infact read the whole series  I love the title for the last one  So Long and Thanks for All the Fish  Just great story telling  I had always thought that space was supposed to be serious stuff  and then when I was 13 I discovered The Hitchhicker s Guide to the Galaxy and my whole perception of what was sci fi was changed  Also  what was funny as well I had forgotten how fast a read this is and how much I love just going along for the ride  just as Arthur Dent does  I was happy to discover of course that it was a triolgy in five parts  Absolutely hilarious  I am a little angry at myself for taking so long to get around to reading this  I haven t run into a book that has a dry  absurd sense of humor that matches mine so well  and I certainly didn t expect it to happen here  but I am very very glad it did  I ve been wanting to read this book for a while now and I honestly know why it took me so long to do it  I guess 42  I absolutely loved it  loved the writting  the humor  the characters  everything  It s been long since I enjoyed a book like this  a book that made me laugh but still be serious about it  Its awkardness is what makes it so good for me  It was ridiculous in the best way and made me laugh   Holy crap  That was freaking amazing   Let me just say that I m VERY TIRED of having to explain about the whole  answer to life  the universe  and everything  bit every time the number  42  comes up   My parent s celebrated their 42nd anniversary  and neither of them knew why that was so cool   If you can  try out the CD version  as read by Douglas Adams himself  Nobody can capture the furious and helpless panic of Arthur Dent quite the way Adams could   Extremely witty book  Short read and definitely worth checking out  i haven t read this since i was about 15 and i ve never read any of the other books in the series  this is clearly because i m dumb though  since this book is fun and funny and generally awesome  i will admit though  that i pictured most of the characters like they were in the recent movie  since i have a big ol  crush on it and have watched it more than a few times now  maybe one of a gem in our times or    maybe one of the biggest joke I ve ever met or   maybe bothingeniously stupid and stupidly ingenious deeply entertaining  have a laugh with your own stupidity about life  universe and everything find a meaning of life  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is the first in a pentalogy of mind boggling adventures through the inexplicably intricate Universe  One day  aliens arrive to planet Earth in order to demolish it to make way for a super galactic highway and Arthur Dent gets whisked off  moments before its demise  along with his Betelgeuse born friend Ford Prefect It is filled with thoroughly scintillating concepts  including a logical proof of the non existence of God and the answer to the Universe and Life which incidentally is 42  Maniacally funny  whimsically clever and shrewdly philosophical  I found it immensely difficult to put this book down even for an instant   The hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is an fantastic sci fi novel  the first of five  that sinks you straight into a world packed with unimaginable number of races that span across our universe and happen to have an   improbable  and yet fantastic adventure  Can t wait to start the next four books   THE BEGINNING OF THE BEST BOOK SAGA OF ALL TIME MOTHERFLIPPIN TIME This was actually required reading in my high school English literature class  but I ve enjoyed the entire series since I was a kid  It s offbeat science fiction that should be considered classic at this point  I would also suggest playing the old Infocom interactive fiction game with the same title  What a fun book  I don t remember being so enthralled in a novel in quite some time  While the plot is engaging  what really makes this book fun are the steady interjections of the narrator   adding literary  philosophical and absurd commentary   and the author s playful take on some of the whacky theories coming out of the last century of theoretical physics  I think that to truly appreciate this book  one should pair it with a popular physics books such as Brian Greene s The Fabric of the Cosmos or Max Tegmark s Our Mathematical Universe  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is an exciting and hilarious romp through outer space  It follows Arthur Dent  a man from England that is whisked into outer space just as his planet is destroyed  In his space adventures we meet many quirky and interesting characters  like Marvin  a chronically depressed robot  Douglas Adams  writing gives a funny and in depth look into humanity and politics  With sections about economics  theology  and science  I enjoyed every page of it  This book has it all  suspense  mystery  action  friendships  amazing characters and a whole lot of humor  This book does have some flaws  For instance  it has a very episodic plot  with the beginning of the story not feeling like the same story as the middle  the middle not feeling much like the end  and so on  Also  the book felt like it wasn t long enough to tell all it wanted to tell  Sometimes it seemed a little rushed and without much detail  but it was a fun ride all the same The Hitchhiker s Guide is the first book in a four part series  and I highly recommend the sequels  If you re not planning on reading them  you ll want to when you finish the book  because it ends in a cliffhanger  but not too bad a one   Overall  I highly enjoyed this book  It was funny  had a great story and was full of charm  If you like science fiction  and even if you don t I m sure you ll like this book   The Hitchhiker s Series is wonderful and quirky  The Main Character  Arthur Dent  is swept up in events beyond his control when the Earth is destroyed to make way for a hyperspace bypass  Accompanied on his journey across the galaxy by assorted friends  or at least traveling companions  Arthur learns to take things in stride  the importance of a good cup of tea and to NEVER go anywhere without his towel Douglas Adams was a true visionary  To me sci fi books about space travel were always a bit too clean and perfect  think  Federation   Adams  however  has created a bizarre and often ridiculous universe where literally anything can happen  This series is one I have read several times and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys comedy  sci fi  or fantasy  In a world of writers  Douglas Adams will be sorely missed by his fans  Finally got around to reading this     few decades behind I know HGTTG was VERY amusing  I totally smiled pretty much through the whole thing  I can see why it s been sure a popular book with its total twist on the concept of questioning the meaning of life  The reason I wanted to read this book so bad  is because I ve sen it appear in many author interviews  Authors doing Q A s always get asked  What is your favourite novel   and I ve heard seen HGTTG come up many times  I wish we read this one in school because I feel likeI coud have defintiely spent time thinking about more parts of this one  making it a re read for sure sometime in the future   Highly recommend it and hopefully i ll be able to pick up on all the HGTTTG references in pop culture now  Well  I ve been telling people that the meaning of life is 42 for years now  so thought I may as well start to read the series behind it too I loved it  I ve only just got into sci fi really and this is a proper treat  Fun  clever and silly  in a good way   Oh Douglas Adams  you genius  Now I have the small problem of getting the others  which I hope will be soon  Casi  Casi no le doy las cinco estrellas  por el final tan apresurado  Pero la historia es tan buena  los personajes tan interesantes y  MARVIN Debo admitir  vi la pelicula hace ya algunos anos y siempre quise leer el libro  por lo que no pude evitar que los personajes de la pelicula se traslaparan con los del libro  Pero en lugar de arruinarme la experiencia siento que la mejoro notablemente  Espero con ansias leer la segunda parte  This was the funniest book I have ever read  not to mention  very witty and smart Chapter 25 had me in tears  laughing  Definitely a must read   Great book  I m currently reading the entire five part volume  This first book was so far the best  A true classic  very peculiar sense of humor shown by Adams  I very much enjoyed the randomness that occurred and his explanations for things found in the galaxy   I recently watched the Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy movie  the more recent one   while it doesn t fully do justice to the books  as movies rarely do  it reminded me of how much I love Mr  Adams  works    His books are simply genius  and they re fantastic reads  I feel like this first book especially should be one of the quintessential reads that lovers of the genre  or those just getting into the genre should take the time to read and appreciate   Loved the witty language and the incentive scenarios  British Humour   Sci Fi   Deus Ex Machina   Total Genius Come dire     un mini capolavoro  Mischiare non sense  fantascienza e filosofia nello stesso libro  Si alternano visioni comiche a estratti della vita quotidiana sin troppo contemporanei Vale davvero la pena di essere in ogni libreria e vi garantisco lo si legge di un fiato e sarete tentati di leggero per almeno altre due o tre volta se non     42    This is the story of Arthur Dent  a normal human living on the normal earth  He starts his day very badly  finding out that his house has been put up for demolition so as to have a bypass built  He isn t very happy about that but he eventually gets over it when he finds out his friend Ford Prefect is actually an alien and the Earth has been blown up  They hitchhike onto the ship that just destroyed Arthur s planet  The owner of the ship is not very happy to find them on his ship  as you would imagine  since he destroyed their planet a few pages ago  and throws them off  but not without reading them some of his finest poetry as a courtesy  After spending 29 and some nothingths of a second  30 seconds in space is death  they are picked up by another ship which has some old acquaintances of Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect  the president of the galaxy and an old  almost conquest of Arthur s  Her name is Trillian which is short for Tricia McMillan  A robot named Marvin which is extremely intelligent and just as equally prone to bouts of depression at the level of the common angsty teenager  Together they go on an adventure and rediscover the mother of all planets  quite literally  On this planet live the people that used to create planets for a living  including the earth  Here Arthur discovers the meaning of life  which is the number 42   and that the world was actually ruled by mice  Stuff happens  which is really unpredictable and funny so just go ahead and read the book  and the dysfunctional gang goes on to the next great adventure My reaction to the book was mainly either laughing too hard  laughing in my head because my lungs were exhausted or extreme confusion blankness  I think this book can be read by all age groups  although it contained some blatant very carefully hidden sexual themes  but other than that children would enjoy it just as much if not more than adults I would recommend this to people who are very open minded  and can handle some criticism to their religious views  the author criticizes God although I got the very faint impression that he was actually a Christian man   If your mind cannot handle the most far fetched of ideas then this book is not for you  and you risk an aneurysm You were warned  Amazingly funny  Takes you on a journey  Literally     Douglas Adams successfully incites a wonderful narrative of a completely ridiculous situation  making it a raw and real fiction story  It successfully depicts serious situations in a hilarious way  Adams has made me laugh like no other author has been able to   This is not a book that I would have read had it not been recommended to me  Although I enjoy the science fiction genre  I tend not to enjoy older books  Even though it was published in 1979  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy seems like a modern novel  Some of my favorite things about this book are the characters and Douglas Adam s use of humor  With characters such as Arthur Dent  an Englishman from Earth  Ford Prefect  an alien who travels the world assembling  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy   and Zaphod Beeblebrox  the President of the Galaxy  it was hard for me to believe how well their plots developed throughout the story  Humor is also sewn throughout novel  through Arthur s examinations of his surroundings  through Ford s commentary and dialogue  amongst other things  For me to describe the plot would be too difficult and would not do the book justice  This is a book that I would recommend to anyone that has a sense of humor or is even remotely interested in the science fiction genre  It makes me happy to say that this novel is one of the favorite books I have read to date  The world will be ending in five minutes  but human Arthur Dent and alien Ford Prefect have to get another beer before they leave on their journey through time and space  I don t usually like sci fi  but this was different because of how funny it was  I would recommend this book to people with a higher reading level  but like time traveling and hilarious books   A common mistake that people make when trying to design something completely foolproof is to underestimate the ingenuity of complete fools  It s not just a book to laugh and have a good time   it will give you the chance to look behind the things that makes you human    and your strange love for towels and free verse poems  When I was a kid  I was utterly obsessed with this book  I read it constantly  But I hadn t read it in a out 20 years  more  probably  but I find it depressing to think about that  In that time  I listened to the radio show  replayed the Infocom game  watched the BBC television series and also the utterly forgettable Hollywood film  In short  I hadn t read the  book  in 20 some odd years  but the material was pretty fresh in my mind  But the question still lingered  does this book hold up For me at least  the question is yes  However I almost feel like I didn t need to reread this book  Despite an utterly depressing number of years since my last reading  I can still recite passages from memory  There are sections where the various versions conflict  and my memory is a little hazy  but for the most part  it s completely fresh in my mind But that s just me  and not a reflection on the book itself The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy was  and is  a very funny book  It is unappolgetically British  This is a good thing if you appreciate the delightful silliness of Monty Python  If you don t  then don t bother reading this book  Also we may have difficulties in our friendship  at least when it comes to laughing at the same things There are many versions of this material  For me  the book is still the best  although the radio show is a close second  the Infocom game and BBC series follow after that   let s pretend the movie never happened   If you haven t read this book  do so  If you don t like it  then I m very sorry   This is a ridiculous and funny novel about Arthur Dent who  along with his friend Ford  escapes Earth seconds before aliens destroy the planet  They then go on an adventure with other aliens in search of the planet Magrethea while also searching for the right question to ask in order to understand the meaning of life  the universe  and everything This is a really funny book and I definitely recommend it to anyone who likes science fiction at all  Everything about this book is over the top  making it a really fun read   Weirdest book i ve ever read    Sometimes i can t even fully grasp what he wants to say    So out of the mind ideas and names and places and events and co relations  you actually get hooked into it still remaining at a observer state  sound weird  but hey if you read the book  you will get it  D    And it was really entertaining   More importantly  i found the whole 5 book collection in the library itself just when i was 2 pages away from the end  which actually proves the book theory of improbability but again you ll have to read it    Should give it a try  its a small book    British humor and space travel    what s not to love         I wasn t expecting this book to be so funny  but I found myself laughing out loud quite a few times  Highly enjoyable   Such an entertaining book that I couldn t put down  This book is written in a sassy way that almost mocks the reader but does it in an intelligent way and made me laugh out loud at numerous points in the book  Excellent read and I look forward to watching the movie soon  asaam  bittaa chelebelaa mne kriy e dey     baaraandaay  bse  kii durdaant sb abhiyaan kre clechi

que el libro habia terminado  desconfie de mi version digital  y tuve que chequear en internet que efectivamente la ultima pagina era tal  El relato es excelso  me sorprendio un desenlace tan abierto  Necesito leer lo que sigue antes de que explote la Tierra   Possibly one of the funniest books ever written   Very charming and very intriguing  also  very worth the time   Very funny  However  you need an acquired sense of humour to like this book  bloody awesome  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy Book Review Ford    you re turning into a penguin  Stop it    If this made absolutely no sense to you  then don t panic  it s just a minor reality shift  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  by Douglas Adams  is now officially my favourite book of all time  It s creative  funny  and in some parts  completely nonsensical  In the book  the Earth has just been destroyed to make room for a new hyperspace highway  Arthur Prout has been saved by the alien Ford Prefect  who had been studying the Earth for an article in the  Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy   This is the title of the comprehensive guide to  well  the entire galaxy   After landing on and subsequently escaping the Vogon ship  the creatures who destroyed Earth   they re picked up by the Heart of Gold spaceship  The chance of this happening  as described in the book  was     two to the power of two hundred and sixty seven thousand seven hundred and nine against   The ship also just so happened to be captained by Zaphod Beeblebrox  President of the Universe  and Trillian  his girlfriend  Not only is Trillian the only other human alive  she s also a girl Arthur met at a party and failed to hit it off with  Arthur also meets Marvin  possibly the most miserable robot in the entire universe  The book is full of extraordinarily unlikely coincidences like the ones mentioned above  Normally  I d consider this an unrealistic plot or lazy writing  However  considering that in this universe  mice are pan dimensional beings who created the Earth as a supercomputer  the coincidences worked well with the theme of the book  Adams  way of writing is unique  managing to keep you focused on the book  even when he goes on about how  A towel  it says  is about the most massively useful thing an interstellar hitchhiker can have     This is referring to the  Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy   which contains an article completely about the usefulness of a towel to a hitchhiker  The article is fairly long  especially compared to the Earth s article  which simply reads  Mostly harmless   I really don t have anything seriously negative to say about this book  It can be confusing at first  but you get used to Adams  writing style quickly  Of course  if you like  relatively  realistic fiction  then this book is definitely not a good pick  Parts that I found hilarious  others might find absurd  There s a few pages about a starfleet attempting to attack Earth that was eaten by a dog due to     a fatal miscalculation of scale   For a moment  I thought my book had missing pages  but it was just a random story  However  if you like ridiculous storylines  space  and grumpy robots  then The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy will probably be the funniest book you ll read all year  If this doesn t seem like fun to you  then I can only assume that you are Marvin  and hold     the emotional capacity of a matchbox  without removing the matches    humorous  clever  engaging  I absolutely love the absurdity of this series  first book is top notch of course   It was so good  It was about Earth Demolishing and the humans trying to fight the aliens  So now I can say that I ve read this book  Having seen the movie several years ago  and forgetting every bit of it  I had no idea what to expect  other than I vaguely remembered it being a bit like a dream  By that I mean  nothing makes sense  but somehow you wake up and you remember some of the events and then spend days pondering it because it was so bizarre  And thus is the Guide  Bizarre  incredible  silly  and you have to marvel at the man who created it all  My favorite character   why  Marvin  the depressed robot of course  Oh  and of course  I couldn t forget the most famoous lime of all    So long and thanks for all the fish   It s been about 30 years since I read The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy   but I still remember it fairly well  It speaks well for it that there are so many passages and characters that have stuck with me after all of this time  I still laugh thinking about parts of the book  Good humor and wit  breezy writing  subtle wisdom  and lots of fun  I think it s time for a re reading  Still one of my favorite books  5th time reading it now  Con anos de retraso  despues de que me lo recomendaran por activa y por pasiva y tras haber visto la pelicula como ochocientos millones de veces  y haberme reido cada una de ellas como si fuera la primera vez   por fin me decidi a hincarle el diente a la obra de Adams  Que puedo decir  Un libro genial  Fresco  Dinamico  Divertido  Con un universo que roza lo demente  En definitiva  una novela que no me habria importado escribir   Ah   Espera  Yo no soy escritor    tal vez sea por eso   Pensamiento profundo    Tal vez uno de mis pasajes favoritos  Espero poder descubrir que significa 42  porque hay momentos en los que se necesita la respuesta a la Pregunta Ultima de la Vida  el Universo y Todo lo demas   O solo me pasa a mi  This is so much fun to read  I can only imagine the thrill Adams had in writing it  The off the wall occurrences and the casual tone of the narrator make this book a hit  It begs to be read aloud and shared with fellow Earthlings  I can t wait to get my hands on the rest of the series   Clever  brilliant and funny  Loved this book for the stretching of the imagination  and the profound wisdom I found in each page  My favorite part is where there is a discussion about the dolphins on Earth and how we humans always considered ourselves the smartest and most dominate of species   one of those quotable lines you remember    plan to read all the other sequels to this series  Thumbs way up  Amazon Review for Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy I wasn t sure what to expect when I started reading this book  I heard a lot about it from various sources and watched the movie when I was younger  The book did not disappoint  it was a great read from start to finish  The book is full of laughs and some confrontation that keep things interesting  The book starts out introducing the main character Arthur Dent who is a normal man from England who is about to have his whole universe flipped upside down  In the first few pages we also meet Arthur s best friend Ford Prefect  The book describes him as an odd looking Ginger man but he is so much more  Ford warns Arthur of the oncoming destruction of planet earth and gets them both to safety on a spaceship orbiting the earth  Later we find out that Ford is actually an alien and is a researcher for the revised version of The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy which is a literal guide to the universe and is filled with lots of useful information  From then on Arthur and ford are met by a lot of hilarious situations trying to find their way around the universe  They meet up with new friends and run into some old friends as well  I would give this book 4 5 out of 5 stars just because it was so good I wish it was longer  If you love comedy and science fiction than you re going to love this book  Naprosto dokonale  Tesim se na dalsi dil   3 well  time to write the formal review for this biggie  500 000  ratings   I admit I m a little reluctant to start rating reviewing the series  as it is a cult classic  soon the landing page for Goodreads will be full of updates on the discussion forums for this series anyway    how to say     absurdist   surrealist   psycho Science fiction   British humour   Dr  Who meets Red Dwarf meets Raving Lunatics Party  an underlying ethos runs through the Hitchhiker s Guide series  and here  in the perhaps obviously written  first entry   the book ends on a clear    more to come  note   is the beginning of a humor saga from then 27 year old radio producer Douglas Adams  the Kurt Vonnegut influence is obvious  but in many ways exceeding the prior master  more unified  more witty  more quick paced well  this is a timeless classic  I have no idea what took me so long to read this book  I suspect it s because it came out the year I graduated from high school and started college and had other things on my mind  I only picked it up now because I needed a book by an author with my initials for the 2015 Reading Challenge  and I loved it  Now I have to figure out what order I m supposed to read the other books in     It was recently demanded of me by a new friend that I simply must read this book  I m thoroughly glad such a demand was made  I had of course heard of this series of books before  but I had never gotten around to reading them  That s going to change now  as I plan on reading the rest of them sooner rather than later  Both hilarious and subtly profound  this was a brilliant little work  I m only left wondering what error in judgement left me apparently avoiding them for so long  The only time I ve ever consistently laughed out loud at a book  So clever and perceptive while wildly entertaining   A person s taste says a lot about them  In fact  I would go as far to say that people ARE their tastes  That said  you have to appreciate the silly and the absurd to like this book  This is a pretty polarizing book  there are quite a few people I know who don t like it  and at the risk of sounding incredibly pretentious  I just have to say that almost without exception I have found all of those people to be a certain type   conventional  practical and tedious bores  To all the restaurant managers and government bureaucrats  go read Sarah Palin s memoir  push the daily special  photocopy some memos  die forgotten and rid the world of your facile existences  My normal train of thought towards finishing a book is one of anticipation  I enjoy the thought of closing the back page  having the entire story behind me  Hindsight is a powerful thing and I like being able to see all of a particular stories events behind me and able to see them as a whole  a singular experience  This was not how a felt reading A Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy  from the first page onward I dreaded the coming conclusion  I hoped that it would never end  Yes I was interested in seeing the narrative resolve it self  and seeing it as one picture has brought insight  but the sheer joy of the read  the pleasure I toke in each and every word  I wish I could erase my mind and live the insanity again A bulldozer sits outside Arthur Dents house  preparing to demolish it  His homes imminent destruction is about to become the very last thing on his mind  in a few minutes Arthur Dent will be the last earthman in the galaxy  Paving the way for a new galactic highway  the mostly harmless planet of earth is demolished as Arthur and his newly revealed alien friend  Ford Perfect hitch a last second ride in to the stars  Arthur takes the loss of his home world quite well  that is until he realizes that he will never again visit a McDonalds  Ford instructs his earthling companion in the ways of intergalactic hitchhiking  introducing him to the most amazing book in the universe  the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy itself  a vast codex of mostly correct  some times even relevant information on every subject in the universe With unbelievable improbability Arthur and Ford find them selves on a grand adventure with a cast of remarkable loony characters  from the two headed president of the galaxy to his manically depressed robot healer  Hitchhikers Guide is choked full of hilarious personalities  all brought to life through Douglas Adams incredible talent in getting inside there heads  There every bizarre though process and wild minds are illustrated with great humour The writing leapt from the pages  shockingly funny  absurdly illustrating every wild detail and description of a crazily creative world  A truly funny and remarkable easy to read book  yet not written simply by any means  incredibly smart and thoughtful in tone  but at the same time filled with one absurdity after the other  It is ridiculous but amazingly all the craziness feels real  the strange world all fits together into comedic brilliance  a marvellously enjoyable hilarious book  I got this book for my 17th bday  And it made me forever a science fiction fan Before this  I was entranced with A Wrinkle in Time  and Harry Potter  But I thought  adult  books weren t fantasy sci fi  This proved me oh so wrong  I listened to Douglas Adams read the story on an audiobook while driving from Winnipeg to Yellowstone  many years ago  Before that I had watched the old British TV movie but didn t fall in love  But there  on fifteen hour drive or whatever it was I fell head over heels  So when I got back home from Yellowstone I read the next three books in the series  I m so glad I listened to the audiobook  It opened up a world to me that I might have otherwise missed  And I wouldn t have known about the importance of towels   The short version first   Don t panic  This is the second time I haVe read this zany  delightful yarn about the last human from Earth  Arthur Dent  and his two fellow earth life forms white mice who were running the planet as it was blasted to atoms by a galactic freeway expansion project  Living in Central Texas as one of the major north south American Interstate Highway projects for IH 35  I can see in a microcosm what Douglas Adams explains in his work  The Vogons match well with our road construction companies when meetings about the project are held at times when few if any people are available to attend  never understanding and pray forbid dissenting on the project  The Vogons destruction methods are thorough and swift with only one human and two mice surviving the Earth s demise  The tale involves the third largest inprobablity in the universe to date to get the human retrieved by aliens who happen to be passing by at the moment of the end of the world The story is mostly about how the Earth was actually an unwitting part of the solution to the ultimate question of what is the universe and everything all about  When it took 7 million years to get the answer from the most complex computer in the universe  it would have seemed simple to apply this ultimate answer to the appropriate question  but the question was not forthcoming so the resources of the Earth were used to provide the appropriate question mediated by the white mice  Of course  the Earth was destroyed with the question s completion only five minutes from completion  and no hint of its final form was available as the Vogon beams blasted the Earth  the question  and all but the intrepid trio to atoms Zany at the best  crazy fun is the best way to describe The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  affectionately abbreviated  H2G2  You have to read this work with a very clear head  preferrably with the sidebolts just a bit unscrewed to allow for any slight deviations from specifications  just in case  And remember  Don t Panic   Recommended for those who want a wildly  unique read with a lot of dialog that really reads funny if you take time not to think about it  Thinking about it will make you PANIC     Enjoyable by most individuals with a need or a desire for a  fun  read on a chilly afternoon with rain  sleet  and ice predicted  That way you can focus on the catch phase of this wild ride    Yep  Don t PANIC     Well that was an experience  amazingly unexpected every step of the way and so much fun  You kinda don t see what s coming but the story wraps around to ask the question why this story exists things I love about this book robots are not the emotionless ones we ve often seen anymore  robots  can be depressed the most insignificant  aka the mice  turned out to be the most significant  don t we all think we re the mighty creature of all  the idea of infinite probability   whatttt  You  at a moment  exists at all points   Just great ideas  mixed with a unique style of story telling  a great adventure  DON T PANIC but what a book From crazy things like the  Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster  and  Brockian Ultra Cricket  to normal things like dolphins leaving messages to the world that say things like  So long  and thanks for all the fish  this book is unique  Douglas Adams manages to use language in such a different way to all other authors  This book is so random it s hilarious I read this centuries ago but I should say that this is my absolute number 1 all time favorite  I couldn t stop reading  It was so fun and interesting and I even laughed aloud multiple times  I never do that with a regular book  The entire Hitchhiker series is worth reading and I would suggest it to anyone   Douglas Adams is a hero of mine  I need to set that out from the beginning  So this IS through the eyes of hero worship  He is amazing  erudite in his observations  unbound in his imagination  and downright funny and self deprecating to a very fault I won t delve into huge amounts of detail about the story  because that is the true joy of reading Adams  you have no idea what will come next Suffice it to say that  opening with the destruction of Earth to make way for an inter stellar highway   motorway  is a perfect analogy to our own very human approach to the world around us But even with the Vogons  the  villains  that wipe out the earth to make way for an outer space highway   Douglad Adams pitches the perfect balance between evil and irony  While Arthur Dent represents the bemused  hobbit like English personality trait  the Vogons represent the opposite  plodding  pedantic  borish English personality trait  As such the entire book  and in fact the entire  Trilogy in Four Parts   could be an internal war between two halves of Douglas Adams  own personality  making this an interesting psychological analysis of our own human existence Did I take this analysis too far  Maybe  Only a Vogon could tell you how many statutes I broke  and what the requisite punishiment might be for such evil behaviour on my part In the meantime  they ll bore you to death with their Vogon poetry  which isn t a touch on Shel Silverstein s  Enjoy   this is a right rollicking read if ever one existed And remember not to take yourself all that seriously The best humans never do  Originally I gave this book 4 stars  It had been assigned as summer reading for my 10th grade Honors English class  I think   perhaps 11th   I remember reading it alongside books like The Jungle and Pride and Prejudice  For some reason  I remember liking it  but apparently I didn t quite appreciate it as much as I do now  I just gave it another turn  this time via audiobooks  and I have now changed it to 5 stars  Maybe I am swayed by the fantastic reading done by Stephen Fry  but this book was fantastic and I couldn t WAIT to listen to more  It wasn t just hilarious enough to make me laugh out loud  but it was also a well crafted story  I believe that it is probably hard to be so funny and still keep a story line moving  But Douglas Adams did it  I m actually excited to pick up the others now  Recommended for people who appreciate humor and science fiction  I love this book  Douglas Adams does an awesome job of balancing funny and serious in The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  This book takes place in outer space with Arthur Dent and Ford Perfect jumping from ship to ship after Earth s tragic fate  This book is highly detailed and every scene invokes the proper emotions  There is a part  around halfway through the book  that made me jealous that the characters were able to experience something so beautiful  Everything feels properly described without feeling dragged out  For example  a quick and kind of gross teaser   Ford  with a lightning movement  clapped his hand to Arthur s ear  and he had the sudden sickening sensation of the fish slithering deep into his aural tract  All the chapter are very interesting and if not relatable they are likable  Besides the two previously mentioned there are a handful more big character who all contrast but still seem to complement each other  Adams does such a good job of making characters connectable that the short appearances of a sperm whale and a bowl of petunias leave a impact on the reader  But the main characters leave a much bigger impression  like they should  A lost human  an alien researcher  a depressed robot  a human scientist  and the President of Imperial Galactic Government are the characters who make up to main pentad of explorers  All the characters are intertwined before they even officially meet up in the story  As mentioned before this book is a good balance between funny and serious  the humor is not overly obvious or obnoxious and the seriousness of the book does not take away from the humor  There are parts that are a little confusing but they are usually the parts that are meant to be confusing  at the beginning of a chapter it says     reason was in fact out to lunch   The language of the book can get a bit big and when it gets into complicated concepts they are usually excerpts from The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy and that concept gets explained there  I ve decided to add a few teasers to this review because I can gush all I want about what I like about the book  but it would not be too helpful since it would not tell you much about the book  There is a kind of poetry that can kill you  The answer to the great question of Life  the Universe  and Everything is 42  The top three smartest beings on Earth  and their order  are not what one would normally expect  And Eddie the computer has a wonderful singing voice  this is not actually said in the book but I am almost positive he does  My almost random sounding teasers could be major points of the plot or they could be the most insignificant things ever  You won t really know until you read the book   Gone Hitchhiking for March A Not So Book Review of Douglas Adams s The Hitchhiker Guide to the Galaxy Pardon me Gentle Readers  I still feel a little bit woozy today  it must ve been the Infinite Improbabilty Drive    or the Pan Galactic Gargle Blasters I downed this morning  Argh  I dunno  Anyway  reason seems to be out to lunch  and hell it s not even Thursday yet But you know what  I ve just been in the most satisfying expedition EVER Not your usual road trip by any chance since it involves a lot of thumbing a ride through hyperspace  coasting the vast reaches of the Universe and an occasional encounter with one or two Vogons Sorry I m not entirely being lucid  am I How shall we begin Erm   This is a not so book review of a book called The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy    not an Earth book  never been published on Earth  and until the terrible catastrophe occurred  never seen or even heard of by any Earthman  Nevertheless  a wholly remarkable book orThis is the story of The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  an original radio series in 1978 that went on to spawn a novel  still more radio episodes  albums  a television series  four more novels  the author called the books  a trilogy in five parts    a stage play  comics and a computer game through the years that the author can t keep track of how the original story went it always end up crooked and the author misquoted  but whose cult following involve millions of life form it would put to shame Humma Kavula s Coming of the Great White Handkerchief religious group orThis is the story of Arthur Dent  who seconds before Earth is completely demolished to make way for a galactic freeway  is saved by his friend  Ford Prefect  who has been pretending as an out of work actor for the last fifteen years but is really a researcher for the revised edition of The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  Together they begin a space odyssey through the galaxy aided by quotes from The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy In their travels they meet    Zaphod Beeblebrox   the two headed three armed ex hippie and mental President of the Galaxy    Trillian   Zaphod s girlfriend  formerly Tricia McMillan  whom Arthur once tried to pick up at a cocktail party    Marvin   a paranoid android  a brilliant but chronically depressed robot    Veet Voojagig   former graduate student obsessed with the disappearance of all ballpoint pens he brought over the years and who I think is an insignificant git in the whole scheme of things Have you ever felt secure reading a book  I mean  have you encountered that very book that the sole act of reading it alone makes you feel relatively safe  I did  And that s what this short book will do to you    well  if you ever have the right mind to pick it up and the right kind of mind to understand what British humor is  Seriously  I wish Leo Tolstoy s War and Peace or James Joyce s Ulysses have the words DON T PANIC printed in their covers so that it ll not make me ill at ease while browsing its pages  I would really like to have a shot with those kind of books  And there s nothing much sweeter than a book reminding you that  A towel is about the most massively useful thing an interstellar hitchhiker can have   And so after reading this I never went out without my towel at hand In a swift span of six days no book or author has been this endearing and close to my heart  Why  No other thing has ever made me crack up and ponder deep the existential conundrums of this planet simultaneously  It s a work that let me wallow in absurdity and absolute sensible nonsense all in the spirit of good  clean FUN  Sure thing  you may have had asked yourself burning questions such as Why are we born  Why do we die  What is the answer to life  the universe and everything  What s with the number 42  Where are we going to have lunch  And why do we spend so much time in between fiddling with computers and diurnally responding to inconsequential comments on our Facebook account which  really is a question that hasn t anything to do with this book And as a nebulous  ape descended Earthlings  has the thought ever occurred to you that the universe is just a big joke waiting to be unraveled and that the world  the whole planet  has gone to the   Rats I m feeling a little peckish right now  This definitely might be because of thatPan Galactic Gargle Blasters  I should have had water instead    or tea Anyway  someone told that there s

American Edition 215 pagesStarted  March 21  2011Finished  March 26  2011My Rating   See this not so review in my book blog  Dark Chest of Wonders  and to see some good pictures of my amazingly  mind boggingly small collection of Douglas Adams s books    well  assuming that you re interested to see it anyway   Douglas Adams is equal among my favourite authors  he is offbeat  erudite  ridiculous  and possesses the widest and silliest imagination I have found  His brand of humour matches mine so exactly that this is one of the few books  and series  that I have read multiple times and enjoyed every single time  This series also happily accompanies the Red Dwarf books by Grant   Naylor  This is an imaginative  exceptionally well written book worthy of many other reads  I was torn between giving it a 4 or 5 rating  simply due to the one gripe I have with this particular book  the ride is over all too soon  And if that isn t insightful enough  the answer to everything else is simply 42  Don t Panic  This book will love you back in much the same way that your crush won t  This is ultimately great satirical comedy book  It is funny  interesting  original  and grabs your attention from start to finish  It is the simple story about a man named Arthur who one day finds out his house is being torn down that day and goes to a pub with his friend Ford Prefect and they both catch hitchhike off earth on to a spaceship right before the planet explodes  They end up traveling the galaxy with the president of the galaxy and his trusty companion  Trillian Although the language is a bit complex at times and it can be of a higher reading level this book is worth it  The story and each and every main character is fun and interesting  There s not one flatline in this book because it is constantly developing  It even gives you little random snip bits that are always good for a laugh and makes you wonder  who in the world would think this up and can I shake their hand  Highly recommend to any fan of comedy or SciFi  Arthur Dent s house is about to be demolished  As he lays on the ground in front of it  blocking the bulldozers  his friend  Ford  comes to him and tells him that the EARTH is about to be demolished    by aliens  The book is about their adventure in traveling around the galaxy  meeting new friends    and enemies  trying to save the earth  their lives  their friends  lives  and having a grand  ol time This book is so funny  Maybe it s just me  but I think Douglas Adams is a humor genius  I absolutely love it  Normally  I m not that into science fiction books  but I think I might be now  because of The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  I love the story line  the characters  everything  Marvin  the chronically depressed robot     A comic sci fi phantasy  It has been years since I read this trilogy  but it remains a favorite that kept me laughing throughout  The movie however was a complete disaster  If you saw the movie without reading the book  and didn t like it  do yourself a favor and give the trilogy a shot   It s hitchhiker s guide to the galaxy what would i think other thanTHIS IS THE BEST BOOK I EVER READED Some of the book went off on hilarious tangents including entries from the  Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  and all I could do was sit back and laugh  I m glad the book still has a plot involved  and isn t just mindless humor  I have to say my favorite character is Eddie the computer  a gentle and optimistic soul  I feel bad for him   Zaphod is so mean   Regardless  this was a funny and great read for me  I chose the right book to read on my boring vacation  Amusing good read  I ll admit  most of this book is based in its author s strange sort of humor  which I apparently get because I loved the book  I watched the movie a while back  didn t like it  and then forgot about it by the time I picked up the book  I can t say that the book has changed my life in anyway  or caused me to look at things differently  but for the length of the work  I enjoyed reading it throughout  This book is hilarious  It s quick witted and is written with such dry humour  it s fantastic After reading The Hitchhiker s Guide  I can say that the movie was perfectly cast and executed  I also found myself reading the The Hitchhiker s Guide parts in the same voice that is used in the movie  This book is about the Earth being demolished to make way for a new intergalactic space route  The main characters are the human Arthur Dent  and  human  Ford Prefect  who is actually a hitchhiker from the Betelgeuse system  Trillian and Zaphod Beeblebrox  In this story  they escaped Earth moments before it was destroyed  The characters ran into multiple problems  such as being thrown into space by Vogons  or being shot at by intergalactic police  The main characters had a nice few adventures  one of which was finding a long dead planet that was thought to not actually exist  I think my favorite character was either Zaphod or Ford  because both are very sarcastic  very cocky  and super entertaining I don t know that I could relate to any of the characters a whole lot  maybe like Arthur is some ways  like how he feels like an outsider who doesn t belong a bit  I don t think that I have ever done anything that any of the characters did  I feel like it would be quite difficult to have experience escaping the Earth right before it is destroyed by Vogons   but I have felt a lot of the same things that Marvin or Arthur have felt I loved this book  and am in the middle of reading the second book  I loved it because it mixes a few of my favorite things  crude comedy sarcasm and Sci Fi  I think my favorite part of this book was that Douglas Adams would allude to things from the first chapter all the way at the end  and I had forgotten about some of the things  so him bringing them back up after the entire book just made me laugh  I don t think that I had a least favorite part of this book  I honestly loved everything about it  I think that he could not have done anything better than he did  but I m sure that he would be able to I would most definitely recommend this book to another person  because I want other people to experience the sarcastic and clever humor that is present throughout the book  I would recommend this book to anyone that enjoys a book that will make them laugh  or anyone who enjoys Sci Fi  42     One of the things Ford Prefect had always found hardest to understand about humans was their habit of continually stating and repeating the very very obvious   How have I lived my life without this book  Suberb   This fantastic novel has a specific humor    which I like  xD Really  this is the first book that made me laugh so hard  And just by reading a book  A book  Who would say you can laugh reading a book  xD It has a very interesting story and interesting characters and it definitely is a special one  The re read was even better  as clues for the next books are all over the place  geniealna A brilliant start to the reading year with an exceptionally well written book  And it s just the start of a forever love of the entire collection     I seem to be having tremendous difficulty with my lifestyle  Consigliato a chi ama il genere  pieno di fantasia e colpi di scena che rendono la lettura molto piacevole e scorrevole Inoltre gli sprazzi di comicita all interno del libro rendono tutto ancora piu divertente E il primo di una saga che si prospetta fantastica  This one so closely follows the old BBC miniseries that I had to laugh along with it  All of the parts I remember from when I watched it as a kid    Deep Thought  Norway  the Earth  the Highway  Hitchhikers Guide was the first comedic science fiction I ever learned about and I see why this is a classic  I loved this book  it was funny and cleverly done  There were parts I had no idea what was going on  and scenes that were hard to picture  but I still loved it  I would re read it in a heart beat and still find most of the jokes funny and clever  I worked as a sound engineer on the original radio series at the BBC  it was a radio show before becoming a book   There was a real feeling of excitement in the studio   we all felt that we were working on something really special   and so it turned out I never felt the TV series or the  pretty awful  film ever did justice to the story but  like the book  the radio series lets the imagination of the listener or reader do all the work It s still available on itunes   give it a go  Even on my third reading  The Hitchhikers Guide remains as fresh and funky as ever  Now where did I leave my towel    Hey  you sass that hoopy Douglas Adams  There s a frood who really knows where his towel is  This is the book which sits close at hand and becomes a staple to read when you need some humor  An incredibly fun read  this book can be as light or deep as you want to make it  The pinnacle of satire  Mr Adams breathes his wit and humor into every page as we follow Arthur Dent  one of the last remaining humans in the Galaxy  in his maiden voyage through space I have enjoyed this book countless times and refer to it often  Mr Adams passed from this world far too soon in the humble opinion of this reader   So long  and thanks for all the fish Sincerely Forever in search of 42 A masterpiece of our time  Engaging and funny throughout I love it when I go through and really feel a whole new world  If you haven t read this book     this series      um    but not the movie     or the other movie     they stunk  your funny bone may as well calcify and turn to granite Nobody  EVER turned a phrase like Douglas Adams  and the world lost a world class humorist when he passed away I wrote my books hoping against hope that I could capture any bit of the magic that was Douglas Adams  When reviewers started comparing my books to his  well  my toes tingled  that s stupid  they did not  they did too  shaddup   No  you shaddup   smack  OW   I used to love reading  I d go through at least 2 3 books a week and would feel uncomfortable if my bedside table didn t have a stack of unread books to get through every night  And then I stumbled upon this Nothing else has ever been able to compare since I embarked upon my Hitchhiking adventure  I ve searched high and low for another book which would entertain me as much as the Trilogy of Five has over the last 8 years or so  Douglas Adams  you have spoiled me Chronicling the adventures of Arthur Dent  who wakes up one morning to discover the Earth is about to be demolished to make way for a hyperspace bypass  the first book in the Trilogy of Five introduces us to several recurring themes such as the answer to life  the universe and everything  the fickle nature of probability and the enigma that is Zaphod Beeblebrox  You ll have to read the books to find out more   it ll be doing yourself a favor  These are books that deserve several re reads  Adams combines brilliant dialogue with intelligent story lines and insanely witty and satirical comments about religion  politics  philosophy  technology and so much more with ease  Pick up this book  it makes for an effortless read and paves the way for a more sustained Hitchhiker s fix   I have known this story for as long as I can remember  Heard the radio show  watched the TV series  even watched the film  I think this is the first time I ve read the book however  How very remiss of me  Of course I loved it  Fascinates me every time I read it  Definitely a book to read again and again  I first read this book four years ago and it still cracks me up  Douglas Adams  Hitchhiker s Guide to The Galaxy is brimming with intelligence and humor  It is funny  philosophical and a bit satirical  Arthur Dent s house was demolished  and so was the Earth  12 minutes after  to give way to Hyperspace Bypass  Ford  from planet Betelgeuse  saved Arthur  Both of them hitched a ride in a Vogon spacecraft up to the galaxy  only to be thrown in dark space  Vogons are one of the vilest creatures   Thanks to Zaphod Beeblebrox s stolen spaceship  Ford and Arthur were again saved  Inside the Heart of Gold  the stolen spaceship   Arthur saw the girl he admired  Trillian and found out she decided to leave the Earth six months ago  Zaphod  Galaxy s President  stole the Heart of Gold because he wanted to go to a long lost planet whose entire economy depends on a luxury trade  the manufacture of other planets  All four of them traveled to this planet  Arthur found out how the Earth came about  who designed and ran it  Towards the end  the book became action filled  I actually felt my heart racing  The book ended with Zaphod asking the Earthman if he s hungry because they are going to the restaurant at the end of the universe   An introduction to the second book of the series   Still  to this day  one of the funniest books I ve ever read and one I ve re read too many times to count  You should read it  too  Don t panic  it s not a very long book  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is very light science fiction filled with abundant British style humor  It is the story of  everyman  Arthur Dent and his unique travels hitchhiking in space after his home planet  Earth  is destroyed to make way for a galactic freeway  During his space adventures  many topics are explored in Adams  writing  ranging from poetry to the creation of the planet Earth  The whole novel is told in an evenly paced mix of science fiction and laugh out loud comedy  which works very well with Adams  wisdom and wide imagination   Very enjoyable read  Don t expect it to make to much sense  but it was an excellent read none of the less  Each character is interesting and fun to read about  Their personalities are what make this book so good   Buy  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  Now The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy was a refreshingly witty and well thought out book  It mocks our trivial ways of doing things without seeming angry  and is full of irony  Overall  it s a fun read and I d recommend it to anyone looking for a laugh  Hermoso  Con tan solo leer las primeras paginas sabia que me esperaba algo bastante bueno  y asi fue  La lectura es un poco frenetica en ocasiones pero la mayor parte del tiempo mantiene el mismo ritmo  Esta lleno de guinos a la cultura pop  Maneja un humor muy sutil que logra su cometido la mayor parte del tiempo Oh si  no se olviden de su toalla  my sister used to read these books out loud on family roadtrips and we would laugh and laugh   update  re reading for emory book party   man  this made me nostalgic  it s not quite the same reading it silently to myself  i would rather have my sister reading it to me in a maroon mini van as we careen through the mountains of west virginia  there were so many great moments that i had forgotten about  like eddie  the friendly computer saying  hi there   and how we used to tease my dad  also named marvin  about being a paranoid android  good times  After the second reading  now in English  it only gets better  Can never have enough of the genious art Douglas Adams has written  What can one say about The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy that hasn t already been said  There are a plethora of reviews for this book  so what makes it so special to me personally Part of it is in the way Douglas Adams never lets you think he is absolutely certain of anything  I m a Christian  and he was an atheist  But some hints in the book made it seem to me like he wasn t truly convinced  For example  he makes fun of the way that atheists over the ages have felt the need to denounce God so strongly that it seems like they actually believe in him but don t want to  For example  in the Hitchhikers universe Oolon Colluphid is the author of the  trilogy of philosophical blockbusters  entitled Where God Went Wrong  Some More of God s Greatest Mistakes  Who is this God Person Anyway   and Well  That About Wraps It Up For God  The joke seems to be that if you really don t believe in God then surely writing four books to state that claim so forcefully is just a little bit of overkill  Surely Oolon Colluphid would have better demonstrated his atheism by simply ignoring God  Richard Dawkins could take note of that  He s like a real life Oolon Colluphid  and was a personal friend of Douglas Adams  so I m told   I mean  if he doesn t believe in God  then why is he so angry at him  How can you be angry at someone you don t believe exists  This desperation to disprove God  repeatedly and vitriolically  suggests that Dawkins actually knows in his heart that God is there  Oolon Colluphid seems to be doing the same thing  trying repeatedly and unsuccessfully to write God away  Anyway  I digress Something I appreciate about Adams s humour is that it s never mean or nasty  Yes  he pokes fun at things  but as I ve already pointed out he does it in a way that isn t quite ridicule  I never found myself offended while reading Douglas Adams  In the whole series I can only recall one use of an actual swear word  and that s a restraint he didn t have to show  given the tone of most other modern era writing  His work is childish  yet sophisticated  It bridges the age ranges so well that the film of The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy quickly became one of my children s favourites while they were still quite young  I thought I would let them get a bit older before encouraging them to read the books  but I probably needn t have done Adams often takes particularly wacky concepts to their logical conclusion  Some of his ideas  though presented with scientific plausibility  are utterly bonkers  And yet he treats them as fully reasonable story elements and uses them as part of the    should I call it drama That s just a couple of observations on The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy  I recommend it highly  as I do most of Adams s other work  Before Hitchhikers he did some excellent work for Doctor Who  much of which he reused in his Dirk Gently books  He was a well rounded writer of comedy  and the only one who could reliably make me laugh out loud while reading I miss Douglas Adams  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is a hilarious book  I would definitely recommend it  One of the best SF comedies ever   Good bye and thanks for all the fish   Taking all on the twists in and trying to figure out what was coming next was a real treat for me  I had some issues with the English word usage  but not enough to distract from the story  O M G  I m listening to Audible s full cast of characters audiobook and it is hilarious  Am loving it so far  What took me so long to read this  or rather  listen to it This kept me in stitches all the way through to it s abrupt ending  The interview at the end of the audio was great  The humor reminds me of Monty Python s films which I love  So if you like Python s humor  you re in for a treat with Hitchhiker s Guide   1  I highly recommend the audiobook with the full cast  This book is absolutely hilarious  A fun and easy read at the pool or on the beach  It will leave you laughing and saying  so long  and thanks for all the fish   The book begins with a marvelous excuse for the writing of this story  It explains the concept of the book in a humorous if slightly dry  but wholey British and wholey Adams fashion  If one needed a concise example of his style  look no further  In a few words Adams takes us from postulants to neophytes in his world of improbabilities I understand how many might think he was influenced by Lewis Carol  It does seem very much like one of the Alice stories  The truth was  he hated the little bit of Wonderland he read  Pity  I thought it was great  This makes as much sense as Rhiannon hating Wuthering Heights  She ll disagree  but I ll let her do that     Chapter 01One of my favorite parts of the entire series is this repeated use of the word yellow in the opening sequence  The color unfolds the story  introducing us to the main character  his emotional state  and his direct conflict  Colors can be so expressive     British sarcasm is something I hope to fuse with our style  That brand of humor is particularly funny to me  This scene with Dent arguing with Prosser the guy with the bulldozer is pretty freaking hilarious I resemble Ford s reasoning  Rhiannon s logic is constantly coming up against my reasoning  Luckily  like dear old Ford here  I manage to convince her enough of the time to go along with me  it doesn t matter my reasoning doesn t make sense half the time  Besides  you never know with a guy like Ford  If someone like that came up to you  would you do what the crazy man proposed Read more commentary and add your own here  http   www rjspindle com content the     I simply love it  For this particular book is like all of those Monty Python jokes all over our culture without even noticing until you finally find the source  I was shocked for a very long part even after the book itself quotes  Don t Panic   I found amusing and hilarious that the sequels names were inside jokes  The mythical 42  and that thing with a certain whale and flowers  Fantastic  If you ve not picked up this pop classic since the 80 s  don t panic  Adam s sci fi Lewis Carroll inean text is still fast paced and still hilarious  42 stars  H2G2 follows an earthling  Arthur Dent  as he is introduced to galactic hitchhiking by a Betegeusian named Ford Prefect  This duo joins the other sole remaining human and the Galactic president aboard a stolen ship  Along with a chronically depressed robot  the group gets to the bottom of life s grandest questions I just finished re reading The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  I wouldn t have figured there was any reason to review a 34 year old book  To my knowledge  there isn t another movie in the works  Surely  everyone who is likely to read it already has  right  Young people like new stuff  and if you re    let s say    youthfulness challenged and haven t gotten around to it then it s probably not your cup of tea  which  sad so say  means you are likely devoid of a sense of humor   Then I saw a  best in 2012  list by genre  and H2G2 was on it  Yes  I realize that  best seller  lists are a euphemism for  most printed  and are not a perfect indicator  Of course  when I went to look for said list  I was unable to re discover it  It may have been the  top 20 books used to prop up the corner of a coffee table  for all I can prove  However  in looking for the list  I did find H2G2 on a lot of other lists including best selling books of all time and most popular sci fi of all time  In short  read this book I don t want to give a lot of spoilers  but here are just a few of the things H2G2 will do for you  It tells you the answer to life  the universe  and everything   Now everything else will be anti climactic and  thus  stress free    You ll never look at a mouse the same way  It tells you what you need in order to hitchhike through the Milky Way  Spoiler alert  a towel  What more could one want from a book   If you say vampires or zombies  I ll choke you through your USB port    Damn it mice  I ve always known there was something vicious and sinister about you  Anyway  I had always thought that the answer to everything is 47    I should definitely go back and check my calculations  P S  Can anyone tell me whether I should watch the movie or not  This is one of my favorite books of all time  Okay  maybe that was a really bad pun  but I didn t mean it  I used to only hang around with people who had read this  It may be one of the reasons I started dating my husband  The humor and word play still capture my imagination  although I ve read this book over a dozen times  No one writes like Douglas Adams  The whole universe is a damn big Joke  Still as fun and awesome as the first time I read it  The best part of re reading a book is picking up on everything that you missed the first time around  Sometimes you get to make more connections with things that made no sense originally In the case of this book  well nothing makes sense ever  And there is no continuity  As such it is beastly awesome  That is all  never  ever watch any movies based on this book  for it is sacred  Sheer amount of ideas presented and the incredible insight into human spirit  for instance   The History of every major Galactic Civilization tends to pass through three distinct and recognizable phases  those of Survival  Inquiry and Sophistication  otherwise known as the How  Why  and Where phases  For instance  the first phase is characterized by the question  How can we eat   the second by the question  Why do we eat   and the third by the question  Where shall we have lunch   Not to mention God that questions its own existence  only to disappear in a puff of logic  Bless you Douglas Adams  I want to be like you when I grow up   I really can t add anything to the general sentiment of Adams  fan base  I love his style  I love his books  and I get positively giggly when I read him as we all do  You get the sense while reading these books that Douglas Adams will introduce tangents that last pages just as bedding for a single clever joke  This is probably why the books are so long and  incidentally  so light and pleasant to read  Also he s really  really clever   I think  SIX WORD REVIEW  Lesson   always read interplanetary memo boards  It gives you the beauty of not asking why and how  Sometimes in life we just have to accept a joke  a shit load of crap and not ask why That s how you will realize the beauty of life Most of the time asking questions blinds us of how pretty simple it s supposed to be  Oh  that was so fun       Sheer  silly  nonsensical fun    I m so glad I finally read this    I have to admit this book is a very good book  I have never read a book like that The Earth was destroyed  because in the place where it build a fast track to the space In the journey  they met some very interesting friends This book has a good start and also has a good end  I enjoyed reading this book from beginning to end and it never seemed to have a boring moment  It is a good book  A masterclass in fiction  basically  with aspects of everything  not just  although predominantly  science fiction  Frankly  It doesn t get any better than this  Adams approaches religion and philosophy head on  whilst still managing to keep the  buddy  aspect strong yet introducing romance along the way  all painted glorious colours of humour  Never before has a series of books crammed in such a ridiculous amount of ideas  and I sincerely doubt any series will again If an alien came down to earth  and wanted to read one book  THHGTTG would be it  Followed by the other four  I have changed my mind about this book  I guess I just did not give it a chance when I closed it on page 10 and said to myself  What a bunch of nonsense   Actually it is quite hilarious  especially as read by its author  book on CD   Absurd  but true    RELATABLE This book was not only an exiting si fi novel but also a hilarious book that sparked my interest for the series  The lovable  and despicable  characters mixed with the seemingly randomly placed humor makes it a classic essential for any book fan  After reading the book  i was so  pumped  that i decided to watch both the British TV show and American movie  Although they were good  they could not capture the marvel and humor that this book presented  As a great choice for anyone over the age of 12  I thoroughly recommend this book      ridiculously riveting      all I can say is you can trust my review  woops out a towel   I would rate the characters in this book a 5 because each character is individualized   Arthur Dent   was about thirty as well  dark haired and never quite at ease with himself  The thing that used to worry him most was the fact that people always used to ask him what he was looking so worried about   Adams 8   The characters are well described as Adams does not only describe their appearance  but also their personalities  I enjoyed the characters as they had a lot of personality  and also because each character stayed true to who they are  The characters are so believable because they are so well rounded  each character has good and bad qualities   I would give The Hitchhiker s Guide a 4 on the setting  because Adams has a great imagination   A slight hiss built into a deafening roar of rushing air as the outer hatchway opened onto an empty blackness studded with tiny  impossibly bright points of light  Ford and Arthur popped into outer space like corks from a toy gun   Adams 55   The general setting is very important to the story  as they are in space traveling to different ships  and planets  Adams has his characters constantly in trouble which results in a fast passed book  This book wouldn t make sense if it was any where other than space   I would rate the plot in this book a 4  the only reason the plot isn t a 5 is because the plot can be hard to follow along with    Zaphod   he drawled   great to see you  you re looking well  the extra arm suits you  Nice ship you ve stolen    Adams 78   No special plot devices were used  although the story line skipped around to different perspectives  I did not expect the ending  the book just kind of ends  it seems like when you turn the page the book will continue only it doesn t  Arthur and his friend Ford end up escaping the end of the world by hitchhiking onto an alien space ship  They run into some interesting characters all the while getting into trouble where ever they go  I would give The Hitchhiker s Guide a 4 in themes  because there isn t really a theme  but the motif of randomness is apparent   A book called The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy not an Earth book  never published on Earth  and until the terrible catastrophe occurred  never seen or even heard of by an Earthman   Adams 6   The authors message is about how random our universe is  and how everything anything you do will effect your future  The title has a little to do with the theme as the guide itself is all sorts of random   I enjoyed reading this book greatly  it is a funny  and a light read  I m not used to reading random  but it was definitely good  I would recommend this book to a friend  because it doesn t require any in depth look as it is very straight forward   Well  do I need to say anything about this book  A comedy about life  the universe and everything  42 is the answer  Moving  funny and amazing detailed  even when we can t understand some of those details  It was definitely a trip through the galaxy from start to end   I read this about a year ago    don t know why it took me so long to read this  I was not disappointed  It is quirky  goofy  silly and fun  Makes one wish that if something so cataclysmic occured to them that they could react so well  Make sure and bring a towel  A fantastic mix of sic fi and comedy that manages to blend the surreality of the far future with serious yet overlooked events   awesome book  Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect are going around the universe to discover the meaning of life the universe and everything  which happens to be 42 but we don t find out the question for a few books later when it is discovered that the inhabitants of earth were not descended from cavemen but a colony of phone sanitizers and hair dressers that were expelled from their own planet because they were thought to be useless   everyone on this planet died soon after from a disease that was transmitted through phones  This book is hands down the best fiction novel I have read so far with the correct amount of humor and mystery  The narration is done in such a very splendid way that you don t drift apart from the story even when they are talking about a different aspect of the story and the transition from one chapter to another always keep you on the hook so no matter what you have to keep on reading Honestly I loved this book even with all its non sense references and theories and would definitely recommend it to others who want to get a taste of real fiction  Awesome  very good and funny  What can I say about this SF classic that hasn t already been said  Oh   one or two things   the book remains one of my favorites  simply because it is so zany   yet somehow comments brilliantly on our pathetic modern state of being  I hated the Hollywood movie  I loved BBC s  Dr  Who ish  low tech TV version  RIP Douglas Adams   best book ever   XDXD one of my favorite books to pick up from time to time  so much good laughs    Why did I avoid this book for so long    I don t know what I expected  but I found it to be surprising  clever  subversive  challenging  creative  hilarious    I was all in from the beginning  Listening to the author narrate the audiobook surely helped because you know that s how he imagined the story sounding in his head  I believe I ll be listening to this again soon  with my husband this time  and will read the hard copy and the rest of the series  I m so grateful to my friend and fellow Bookcrosser Goodreader  allysther  for the recommendation and loaner   The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  makes a great satire of a lot of issues people tend to take way too seriously  very creative story line and awesome characters Loved it  I ve just become an instant Douglas Adams Fan  his humor is unique  sarcastic and witty    looking forward to reading  The Restaurant at the End of the Universe  and the rest of the series  I listened to Stephen Fry read this  It was amazing  I am saddened that he doesn t read the rest in the series  I fear that no one can compare to Mr  Fry  Classic  Good combination of humor and philosophy  Hilarious and unique  Very clever plot and very funny  This was a wonderful  listen  of this book  the story is so creative and lol funny  FABULOUS reader   Ninth grade    the year Craig Brehm moved to town  I first heard Guns n  Roses play  Welcome to the Jungle   and I swiped my dad s copy of Hitchiker s Guide to the Galaxy  Just in memory of his crazy hair  long striped shirts  and smartass attitude  I have to give it five stars for nostalgia    even if it hadn t been completely addictive on its own    J ai decouvert H2G2 grace au film eponyme qui m avait enormement plu  Quand j ai vu qu il etait tire d un livre  il me le fallait absolument   Je remercie Kob de Harcelement Textuel de me l avoir offert l or d un swap  ce petit livre rentre dans mes coups de coeur de l annee   Ecoutez  dit Arthur  est ce que ca vous ferait gagner du temps si je laissais tomber et devenais fou tout de suite H2G2  c est l histoire d Arthur Dent  un terrien qui apprend dans la meme journee que sa maison va etre detruite pour construire une deviation  que c est la fin du monde  que la Terre va etre detruite pour construire une voie express hyperspatiale et que son ami Ford Prefect n est pas terrien mais natif de Beltegeuse  Ajoutez a cela une touche d improbabilite et d ironie  ainsi qu une bonne dose d humour et un robot depressif pour obtenir une histoire totalement delirante  improbable  completement bancale  mais oh combien drole Il est important de signaler que soudain et contre toute probabilite  un cachalot s etait materialise a plusieurs kilometres au dessus de la surface d une planete etrangere  Et vu qu une telle position se revele difficilement tenable pour un cachalot  la pauvre innocente creature eu fort peu de temps pour assimiler son identite  Voici donc l ensemble de ses pensees pendant qu il tombait Waaaaouuh heee   Que s passe t il   Qui suis je   Pourquoi suis je ici   Quel est le but de ma vie   Euh   Que veux je dire par  qui suis je    Bon  allez  du calme  re saisissons nous  Wouhouu    Quelle interessante sensation   Qu est ce que c est   Un genre de picotement dans mon    Bon  je suppose que j ferais mieux de commencer par trouver des noms pour les choses   euh   appelons ca une queue   Oui  queue   Et qu est ce que ce sifflement rugissant qui passe en trombe devant c que j vais tout a coup

bout  L auteur reste totalement coherent dans son univers decale et completement loufoque  partant dans des explications plus dingues les unes que les autres grace au Guide du Voyageur Galactique que Ford a prete a Arthur pour qu il puisse en savoir plus la galaxie Les Vogons  Une des races les plus antipathiques de la galaxie  Pas mechants mais caracteriels  bureaucrates  psychorigides au coeur

witty  amusing and inteligent  a real treat to read i am looking forward to reading more of arthur s adventures as soon as posible a must for anyone in search of a good book or a laugh I thoroughly enjoyed this book  Like many people I saw the movie first  Those of you who saw the movie have a pretty good idea of what will happen in the first book of Douglas Adams Hitchhiker series but with a few minor changes  The same witty and intelligent humor is present in the book as well as most of the characters you saw in the movie  I am eager to start his second book and highly recommend this book to anyone who likes the genre  This book is zany and lovable  I bought it on audio so my carpool  kids ages 10 14  could listen  They all love the book and were quiet Someday  I d like to visit D Adams grave and thank him  its a fascinating story of a boy s jurney throught out the galixy with his best friend that happens to be an alien  well  its a wonder story that keeps you laughing with all of its clever humor and interesing observations about the world  it also shows how great and creative the imagination can be  its a great fun read for anyone  There is no other series ike this  Not even close  This is slap stick comedy set in science fiction  It is a spoof of every science fiction work ever written  Just like Hollywood had hot shots to make fun of all their action movies this is the book version for science fiction  A parody of all we love  And this is unique in that endeavor   First thing you should know about this book  is it is full of whimsy  This book is so whimsical and almost irrelevant that im sure the plot of the book could have been explained in about 150 pages  But the reason the book is almost 300 pages is because of Adam s ability to make realistic characters and a great adventure  I picked this book up because I had heard it was a classic  and you know im not a sc fi fan  In fact this was probably the first sc fi type book Ive read  I didn t think I would like it  but really the style of writing and note worthy one liners  I don t think I had enough ink in my pen to underline it all  You ll really fall in love with some of these characters because anyone could relate to them in some way  even if you re a pessimist  He allows his characters to run in circles and take the long way  he allows them to say things that are irrelevant to the story  If you think about that though  that s what humans are    they make mistakes and say irrelevant things  The plot itself was simple but genius  The answer to life  the universe and everything  I have nothing else to say to this point but I give it a 5 5Basically I would recommend this book to anyone  even If your not a sc fi fan  I would read it again too     Marvellous book Love this Book    I rated it five stars because it is well written  without being too long  It explains so many things that the movie left out  The story is of a man  Arthur Dent  who s home planet Earth has been blown up  Other interesting characters are Trillion  Zephod Beeblebrox  and a clinically depressed robot named Marvin  To avoid being blown up with the Earth  he and his friend Ford hitched a ride with a passing Volgon ship  This book is both hilarious and deep  Key issues  This book can be read by anyone  however younger students should have a good grasp of satire and irony to fully understand some of the humor  Additional information  JUST READ IT  It s self explanatory   Loved it just as much as the first time I read it  No one writes like Adams  Guida galattica per autostoppisti  come tutta la saga  un capolavoro del brit humour e del surreale  La felicissima fusione tra fantascienza e comicita  Tutti i personaggi hanno qualcosa che rende impossibile non amarli  da Arthur e Ford  protagonisti inimitabili  a Marvin con le sue laconiche depressioni  Uno dei migliori viaggi di sempre  pura fantasia   Yes Need I say more  Hacia mucho mucho tiempo que no leia una historia tan divertido como esta  La pena que ya me sabia las bromas por la peli  pero aun asi un gran libro  Que haceis que no lo habeis leido  CORRED INSENSATOS    One word  hilarious  I remember trying to tape the bbc radio 4 adaptation of this off a dodgy speaker on an even wonkier cassette recorder in my mums chysler alpine  Our Ford Prefect being off the road at the time  true   I used to be able to quote tracts of this  trilogy  at will  You either find this sort of thing excuciatingly funny or go on to do something unspeakable in financial services or something I can t even remember how a copy of this one found its way into my hands  in my mind  it just seemed to appear in my house out of nowhere  I didn t know the first thing about the plot  the author  or anything  really  but I was in the habit of reading can soups and cereal boxes if they came my way  and so I got down to it  And I loved it  It s funny  entertaining  and makes some very good points about interstellar travel  What s not to love  There are no words for the plot twists in this book  it is probably the mother of all plot twists  Must READ and RE READ every couple of year  can t recommend it enough  Soooo much fun  It has only gotten better as I have gotten older and had more personal dealings with bureaucracy and existential dread  So it s getting bumped up to five stars on adult re read  This is the book that made me realize that writing was an art form  I think the exact line that brought on this revelation was  the ships hung in the air in the same way bricks don t  Just like the universe  this book is beautiful  ridiculous  and not always comforting  But that s what makes it all the more exciting   Douglas Adams takes an eccentric and humorous take on the classic question  Are we alone in the universe   in the science fiction book  Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  From the moment the Earth is destroyed  it becomes obvious to the very average man known as Arthur Dent  that the answer to this cosmic question is no  we are not alone  After being whisked away from the disaster by his friend Ford Prefect  who Arthur always had thought peculiar  but had never considered alien  From Earth to the Restaurant at the End of the Universe  we follow the adventures of Arthur  Ford  Zaphod Beeblebrox  the president of the galaxy on the run   Trillian  the other surviving human who dated Zaphod   and Marvin  a very intelligent but depressed robot   One thing I love about the book is the complete oddness and randomness of the plot and it s characters  From an Improbability drive  which is an engine which performs at a level of extreme improbability to an inside look at the thoughts of a newborn whale and a bowl of petunias   Curiously enough  the only thing that went through the mind of the bowl of petunias as it fell was Oh no  not again  Many people have speculated that if we knew exactly why the bowl of petunias had thought that  we would know a lot more about the nature of the Universe than we do now    135   The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy gives it s own quirky answers to all kinds of everyday or scientific questions  for example  the Ultimate Question of Life  the Universe  and Everything  I would strongly recommend this book to fans of science fiction and comedy  especially those with broad and vivid imaginations  It is an important and popular fact that  when ranking one s favorite media  there is an important difference between what is the best and what is the most re consumable  For example  I don t know if Pulp Fiction is my favorite movie of all time  but it is my most re watchable  If I were in a room and Pulp Fiction was on the television during any scene  I could contentedly watch from that scene through to the end of the movie  Similarly  I would just about always be up to watch a random episode of Mythbusters or start a game of Sid Meier s Civilization  I could probably listen to Sara Bareilles  The Blessed Unrest on a continuous loop until I went insane and you d hear no complaint But books are different  I am a slow  methodical reader so compared with movies  TV shows  games and music  even short books are a major commitment in time and mental energy  It is very rare that I ll read a book more than once and typically only then because it s something I read as a child and had largely forgotten  The exception to this rule is The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy with it s light but precise language and episodic sequence of comic essay adventures  The plot is so loosely strung together yet the internal loopy logic so distinct that it s equally enjoyable to take any scene as a hilarious nugget or bask in the great mock rational whole  I could turn to any random chapter  any random paragraph  of The Hitchhiker s Guide for instant amusement  Just writing this makes me want to do another re read  As for which book I feel is my all time favorite  I ll leave that more nebulous question unanswered  I was a philosophy major in college  and we demand rigidly defined areas of doubt and uncertainty  I discovered this via the radio programme when I was at university  It s a surreal comedy with a science fiction setting  but like all good comedies it says a lot about its own world  eg the Earth is about to be destroyed to make way for a hyperspace bypass  The characters are a motley assortment  from Ford Prefect   who happens to be an alien   to Arthur Dent  who is a typical Englishman and would like to solve all problems with a cup of tea  It s a pity Arthur isn t on Goodreads since his lit crit is exemplary  when about to be thrown out of an airlock by a poetry reciting Vogon  then despite the poetry being appalling  he managed to say that he thought  some of the metaphysical imagery was particularly effective  Like all artists  however  the Vogon wanted more fulsome praise  which led Arthur  and Ford  to say that the  interesting rhythmic devices counterpoint the surrealism of the underlying metaphor of the      er       humanity and       Vogonity      of the poet s compassionate soul  which contrives through the medium of the verse structure to sublimate this  transcend that  and come to terms with the fundamental dichotomies of the other  and one is left with a profound and vivid insight into       into  er         Ford leaped in with the coup de grace    into whatever the poem was about  Despite this masterly flattery  the Vogon still threw them out of the airlock I love this book  One of my favorites  I was not a fan of Science Fiction until a friend of mine introduced me to the Douglas Adams Hitchhiker s  trilogy   which is actually 5 books        The Hitchhiker s Guide To The Galaxy  is the first book of this  trilogy  and it s about two friends that live on earth  Arthur Dent and Ford Perfect  who is actually an alien   These two characters survived the destruction of Earth by hitchiking a lift with the same spaceship that destroyed the planet  Then begins a journey through the galaxy full of odd and absurd adventures This book is very  very funny and and I couldn t stop reading it for a minute  It s very original and definitely unlike any other book I have read so far  This is yet another book  dare I say  classic   that I have somehow neglected to read  yet everyone has been telling me to read it for I don t know how long As you can see from the rating I gave it  you can safely say I was glad I finally did  I finally decided to read this after I came down with a terrible cold and could do nothing but lay in bed  Douglas Adams  masterpiece made the sickness seem like it was not even a burden  This is one of the books that you find yourself not able to put down  I would constantly try to do other things  play video games  write  whatever   but I would always find myself returning to the pages of Hitchhiker s so I could see how the comical adventure of Arthur Dent  Ford Prefect  Zaphod Beeblebrox  and Trillian would unfold One thing that I especially loved about this book is that it reminded me so much of Kurt Vonnegut  my favorite writer  Douglas Adams often said that Vonnegut was a huge influence on his writing  and it shows  but in a positive way  There s a dose of Vonnegut within these words  but Adams keeps his own style that brings bright life to the characters and their actions The book is hilarious and I caught myself actually laughing out loud at times  something only a few authors have been able to do to me  At the same time  beneath the humor  I also found Hitchhiker s saying some important things  In my opinion  that s the best combination  I recommend everyone to read this  whether you re a fan of science fiction or not Time to start The Restaurant at the End of the Universe  Total shock value as a young reader  Douglas Adams reaches out and makes you laugh at life  This was a wonderful read for me as a teen and again as an adult  Pick it up  And the others in the trilogy  ooops  he wrote five   joke s on us   while not as great as the first book  are wonderful fun and do not disappoint  Remember  the answer to the question is 42  For about the past year or two  I ve been attempting to read this book  However  I ve lost interest after the first few chapters  and stopped reading it  But recently I decided to try  once again  to read it  This time I read it all the way through  loving the entire thing  It was hilarious and entertaining  and thoroughly enjoyable  I still have to read the other books in the series  and I can t wait to do so   So why exactly did it take me this long to finally read The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  I very much doubt I could come up with a satisfying answer other than I suck I m glad to have finally read it because it s amazing  After the slightly slow start I found myself laughing out loud pretty much every page  right til the very end  which unfortunately comes too soon  or maybe that s just how much I enjoyed it   The operative word in this book is  random   It takes random to a whole new level  and remains surprisingly up to date   mainly because it s all made up and not based on any sort of science  which is actually a good thing here All in all it was a great novel and I can t wait to pick up the second one  The book is extremely humorous and interesting  The interesting language engages readers  attention and leads me into some deep questions in life  Also  the writing perspective is really clear  It feels like the author is talking about the story in front of you The book is about a fictional galaxy travel  which really makes no sense  but the messages that the author tries to convey is really deep and worth to consider  The main character Arthur is a normal human being until the earth was destroyed  He started his journey with a friend Ford  which is alien  He is alien because he has the devices that earthmen don t have  They were caught by the alien who destroyed the earth  When they were going to be throw out of the ship  fortunately  they were picked up by the president of the galaxy  who just wants to steal a spaceship so he became the president  Then they visited an amazing planet  They know that the earth was built by the others  Now there are some mice from the earth are providing the money to build the second earth As you can see  the story is really complex and not reasonable  After all  it is a fictional novel  The whole novel is written in the third point of view  The author didn t write it in the human s view because we are human beings  There is an interesting part in the book  It is about the comparison between dolphin and humans  The author compared it in a third point of view  Who is smarter  A dolphin or a man  You will say that though the dolphin is very smart  it still cannot be compared with human beings  We have New York  wars  advanced technology  long history and language  But dolphins think they also have these things  This really shows that the deep thought in the book  I think you really should read the book  for fun or for reading a meaningful book  When you start it  you will be engaged by the interesting sentences  What is the answer to the life  Forty two  Actually  the really mean of this is not just a number  The life is your choice  The life is what you make it should like  Hilarious  Absurdly funny  wildly creative  highly unorthodox  somewhat philosophical   and absolutely fantastic I loved this book so much  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is an amazing blend of comedy and science fiction  The novel starts with a man named Arthur Dent  He lives in a small town in the U K  and wakes up one morning to find his house is surround by bulldozers  His friend and alien Ford Prefect tells him that the Earth is going to be destroyed that day  After the earth is destroyed in the same manner his house is they get on a Vogon ship and gets chucked out an airlock  They then gets picked up by Zaphod Beeblebrox on  his  ship  I really enjoyed this book because it is an amazing blend of both comedy and science fiction  The way Adams writes really makes you feel like you re participating in the story  This book is also a part of a series which I plan to read all of  I give this book a strong 5 out of 5  If you like satire  you have a good chance of loving Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  Some of the negative comments I seem to stem from unfamiliarity with  or dislike for  satire  Such readers may not appreciate the hilarity of  Hitchhiker s   Hitchiker s  is brilliant  memorable  and so quotable  To wit    DON T PANIC Hilarious  One of the few comedy novels that s actually funny  If you ve read any Terry Pratchett  you know what to expect  It s all satire  parody  and British humor  Makes fun of literally everything in life  and does it in a witty  clever way This is a classic  If you have any interest in science fiction or comedy  this should be the next book you read  So funny  intricate and intelligent  Looove it  Excelente libro  recomendado total How many roads must a man walk down  I read this vook as a prerelease it was and remains ne of the funniest books I have erver read and I still laugh out loud when I reread it Poor Arther willing to laid down in front of his little home that is about to be demolished  Luckily Ford Perfect comes in and reminds him that all you need is a towel to travel and the adventure begins  Marvin the totall depressed robot is enough make anything commit suicide  It is enough to almost make me laugh myself to death  One of the shining excellent fiction by a Brit  It may be a dry humor but I defy anyone not to be amused   It s simple to fly  just through yourself at the ground and miss   The delights of Vogon poetry and always knowing where your towel is  Read the six part trilogy  expand your universe  PerfectBook This book is one of my favorites  It has a beautiful blend of adventure  mystery  suspense  and comedy that really makes it a wild ride from start to finish  It was the first time that I have ever actually laughed out loud from a book  The characters each have very interesting and unique personalities  making interactions very entertaining  If you are looking for a poetic  deep novel with complex literature  then this is not what you re looking for  This book is very lighthearted and has relatively simple literature  making you feel warm inside when you read it  It is truly unfortunate that the movie was horrendous  This book is just so amazingly hilarious  I love how it s written and the type of humor  I was pretty much laughing when the Earth was destroyed  That s all you need to know  You will laugh while mankind disappears just like that   This made me laugh out loud  I have to admit to seeing the BBC movie before I read the book  but it didn t make me enjoy the book any less  It s fabulous Edit  reread 4 21 08 during a particularly horrible night  and it was still thoroughly enjoyable  Best part of the night  As I was reading  the movie was playing in my head because it really did closely follow the book  and it made those hours pass by a bit quicker than they could have   Read it to the kids  and enjoyed it as much as they did  I have read this book  and the whole series  several times and I will always love the spontaneous  improbable  and intelligent humor  Douglas Adams was a pure genius  R I P Throughout my life I have learned many things from this book   Never trust a president  their real job is only to distract you from where the real power lies  Especially never trust a president with two heads   Always bring your towel   Respect the mice  And the dolphins   It s okay to be rude to computers  especially if they are annoying   Don t panic  after all the whole of the planet is mostly harmless  It could be worse   Don t let the critics get you down  They haven t heard Vogon poetry so they really have no sense of what  Bad  is anyways I m currently reading this again with my 12 year old daughter  I was about her age when I read it for the first time  and I figured she was ready  Reading it with her is so much fun  although reading this book out loud is proving to be hard on my tongue at times  Nejzabavnejsi knizka  co jsem kdy cetl       Never again will we wake up in the morning and think Who am I  What is my purpose in life  Does it really  cosmically speaking  matter if I don t get up and go to work   Reading this brilliant book in 1980 instead of 2015 could have saved me 35 years of waking to these very questions  But it s not too late to discover truth in satire  especially since this one seems to not have aged at all  The humor  the wit  the imagination feel remarkably fresh  as do the inventions  such as talking tablets and movement controlled devices    Must now read the entire series and won t go to work until I m done   Really enjoyed this book  Very funny and clever  rating  5 5 5Arthur Dent woke up one morning  got up to make coffee  and realized a demolition crew showed up to destroy his house to make way for a new bypass  While he was busy uselessly defending his house  another demolition crew showed up to clear the way for a galactic freeway with the planet Earth being in the way of their construction  Luckily  Arthur Dent had a friend  unknowingly to him an alien and a hitchhiker  who found a way for both of them off the planet  hitchhiking of course  before it became completely disintegrated  And then the real adventure began   The only word sufficient enough to describe this book in its entirety is WOW  This novel is out of this world  literally  Within this sarcastic  funny  witty  and outrageous tale  Adams weaves social commentary and philosophy spectacularly  the point and meaning if life  how we live it  how ridiculous it is just to live sometimes  etc    This novel will make you laugh and contemplate life at the same time  a weird combination   Don t Panic What can be said about this book that hasn t been said since it was written  Adams  humor is hard to describe and must be read to be appreciated  The situations are ridiculous and yet they draw the reader in  I was left wanting to know what will happen next to our band of protagonists  After the demolition  Arthur kept trying to understand the enormity of Earth being gone and clung to anything he could in a universe he didn t understand  Ford Perfect seemed to be back in his element  winging it  They were thrust in the middle of a mystery with Zaphod Beeblebrox  the ex president of the Galaxy  in the middle  Along with his human girlfriend  Trillian  and a very depressed robot  Marvin  they set out to survive everything the Universe throws at them  I can t even begin to describe the greatness in the book  the humor and wit  and just how everything seems so random and yet falls together as you read more into creating a plot  The only criticism I have is that the ending is a bit abrupt but since I had the second book sitting on my nightstand  I didn t worry but kept reading  The aliens are alien  In many sci fi books the aliens are either like human or are about humans in an alien environment  of the ones that try writing from a perspective of an alien who is very different to humans many fail  But here we get aliens as main characters whose behavior and thinking seems so different  alien  to us humans  And yet they are relatable  As one who has struggled to write from alien perspectives before  it is a very  very difficult thing to do and Adams did it brilliantly  Ugh what can I say Douglas Adams is the man that turned me on to reading it was the first boom I picked up years ago in a faint interest and fell I love with these series of books I hold close to my heart not only cause their such good books but because they are the books responsible for sparking my interest in reading  Read it  if you like it there are five fore of them if not then at least you know you don t like it lol  The  five part trilogy  of Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy goes down as one of my all time favourite books  There are so many great concepts that Douglas Adams brought to the table  It s just brilliant  To say I love this series is an understatement  It s a great novel  it s got fantastic concepts and it is witty as hell  It s a must read  I guarantee you  if you give these books a chance  you ll fall in love with them  Funny  clever  completely silly from start to finish and filled with crazy characters and a crazier plot  this is definitely a must read if you like your sci fi on the humorous side  It s a short read  too  so it s not too much of a commitment  I definitely want to read the rest of the books in the series before I cast an opinion on it as a whole  because this book doesn t really  end  in the traditional sense  but it s a jolly good ride nonetheless  I just reread this and still enjoyed it  Forgot that it was written in 1979    and was amused to see that the Hitchhiker s Guide is basically some version of a tablet  with buttons  attached to wikipedia  Wondering why I don t see more ipad covers with the words DON T PANIC on the cover I loved this book  and the imagination that went into it  Pondering the big question has always seemed like an exercise in futility and this book proves it  Likewsie  the notion that whole planets will be blasted out of the way to make room for interstellar transit  while seemingly outlandish today  will likley someday be commonplace  I greatly enjoy escaping from the everyday and this book  along with its  companion  certainly provides that in a breezy style   I loved this book so much that it deserves a review I think it s extremely well written  incredibly witty and funny  and definetely a page turner  If you re into science fiction i higly doubt you haven t read this  but if you haven t  you should definetely check it out  And to those who are not into this genre  I think you ll enjoy HG2G too The only downside of this book for me is that  being non native speaker  some parts were a little difficult to understand  But that was just a minor issue It s been some six years since I first read  The Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy  and I must say I found it a much more enjoyable read this time around  I always revered Douglas Adams as a good author but now I realise how baseless that belief was  After this latest foray into his great work I ve come to see the subtle genius of his writing  The Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy  is without doubt a modern classic  well written and intelligently witty  Many of the subtle references in the text illuded me as a teenager but left me spellbound now   The Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy  is truely a phenominal read and one I d thoroughly recommend   Why should the future be serious  Why should aliens have noble names and only be interested in friendship or conquest Douglas Adams  Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy shows a paradoxical view of how strange the universe can be  How can you not like a name like Zaphod  or Slartibartfast  Who wouldn t be tempted to try a Pangalactic Gargleblaster Arthur Dent spends most of his time in a state of shock  One ludicrous and impossible situation follows another much to Arthur s chagrin and relief This is a book for the ages  an iconic work of comic satire that will be handed down from generation to generation  Have towel  will travel  Absolute Lunacy   The readers will choose either of the two paths once they start reading it  to put the book down and forget about it  or continue with the book and get sucked into the ever lasting science fiction  It s a thrilling book  absolutely loved the description put on the paper by Douglas Adams  purely imaginative which gets you into a beautiful trance and makes you wish to continue with the sequels of this series  A book which must be read by people who would love to try science fiction   In my opinion this is the best science non fiction novel of all time  I love reading this book and all of its sequels  It has some of the best character developement I ve ever seen in a non fictional book  I would recommend it to anyone reading this review  thank you for letting me steal a few seconds from your life  At no point was I bored reading  Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy   It is an interesting sci fi read  and I suggest it to anybody  Can t wait to read the next books  The Hitchhiker s Guide is still as fresh today as it was when first published in 1980  thirty four years ago      Adams  turn of phrase is brilliantly unexpected and characters such as Marvin the Paranoid Android and Arthur Dent are endearing and infuriating works of genius  Bizarre  extremely funny and still a joy to read  We miss you Douglas Adams  Bloody gyms are not good for your health     WOOOOW love it The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is among science fiction what Laphroiag is among whiskies  missionary opening your eyes to a subject you ignored before because of exposure to Star Wars and Jack Daniels  And I think the phenol level  high in peaty smoky whiskies  here is the humour  This book is telling things about reality that could not be done in more realistic literature   SPOILERS AHEAD Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy is a Sci Fi comedy book written by the wildly sarcastic and witty Douglas Adams  It is originally set on Earth  which is before long destroyed by an alien race to make room for a galactic freeway  When the Earth is destroyed  the two main characters  Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect  go hitchhiking in the galaxy on many assorted spaceships  The reason those two were even able to survive was that Ford had actually been an alien sent to Earth to make amends to the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy  and had gotten stuck for 15 years  He had already known that Earth was to be destroyed that day  They were picked up by an alien ship just before the Earth was destroyed  This is where Arthur learned that the only amend the Ford had made to the Hitchhikers Guide about Earth had been  Mostly Harmless  which ends up being the name of the 5th and final book in what was originally supposed to be a trilogy  This book is very funny if you can follow sarcasm even when you aren t expecting it  I would also recommend that you only read it if you have an advanced knowledge of the English language  as he does on occasion  seem to be trying to mess with your perception of the language  I enjoyed it because it really expanded my mind into new ways of thinking  I would recommend it to anyone that enjoys a challenge while still enjoying what they ve read  Couldn t put it down  So otherworldly and exciting    I utterly adored this book  it was so funny I loved Douglas Adams humour in this book  I actually loved every aspect of the book  from the chapter with the sperm whale  and Petunia  to the end that sums up some of the plots  view spoiler   such as  the earth is a computer  and Arthur holds the secret to the universe    hide spoiler    The ending also leaves you wanting more  and excited to read the next book in the series My absolute favorite character in the book is Marvin  the depressed robot  I find him funny  mostly because he contradicts the stereotype against robots that says  robots don t feel  And here we have a robot that feels too much  It may sound cruel that I find so much joy in Marvins depression  view spoiler   but for example when Marvin  and Arthur talk about the sunset he is just so uninterested  and sad it becomes funny    hide spoiler  Overall  I really loved this book  and it was one of the funniest books I have read in a while  Really funny  Really good book This book is amazing  It s very easily the funniest book I ve ever read  With genius explanations for the otherwise random observations  it s a wonder that anyone can dislike this book   A towel   The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  says  is about the most massively useful thing an interstellar hitchhiker can have  Partly it has great practical value  You can wrap it around you for warmth as you bound across the cold moons of Jaglan Beta  you can lie on it on the brilliant marble sanded beaches of Santraginus V  inhaling the heady sea vapors  you can sleep under it beneath the stars which shine so redly on the desert world of Kakrafoon  use it to sail a miniraft down the slow heavy River Moth  wet it for use in hand to hand combat  wrap it round your head to ward off noxious fumes or avoid the gaze of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal  such a mind boggingly stupid animal  it assumes that if you can t see it  it can t see you   you can wave your towel in emergencies as a distress signal  and of course dry yourself off with it if it still seems to be clean enough  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy manages to combine the genres of science fiction and comedy into a wonderful book that can make you smile no matter what kind of day you re having  While I do believe this book is hilarious  if you don t enjoy British humor I don t recommend reading it  The humor is much like Monty Python and the Holy Grail  Great book  5 5   Besides the Sherlock Holmes and the Harry Potter series  I don t think I have ever been this hooked to a book literally from its preface section  This book is a combination of the best possible ingredients   its sci fi with its the puns and jokes sarcastic  absurd and even lunatic sometimes  I am baffled and awe struck at how talented Douglas Adams is with his out of the universe plots and creations and I cannot wait to read the next book in this series  Mmmmmmillions of years ago a group of pan dimensional beings created a super computer called Deep Thought  They believed Deep Thought was the most powerful computer in the whole universe  So these beings asked the computer  what is the meaning of it all  The Life  the Universe  Everything  FFWD to seven and a half million years later and Deep Thought came up with the answer  42  The answer to the meaning of it all  Life  the Universe and Everything is 42 Deep Thought told the pan dimensional beings the question wasn t a very good question  That was why the answer was unsatisfactory  Deep Thought told them it would design a computer more powerful than itself and later they could ask it what is the meaning of it all  Life  the Universe and Everything The computer was to be called Planet Earth And on Planet Earth they will find the answer to Life  the Universe and Everything     in 10 million years This was not how the book started 9 999 999 999 years later  give or take  the Vogons came and blew up the Earth And that was how the story began That  truth  about Earth was my favorite part in the whole series  It was better than all of the jokes combined This book was improbably absurd  philosophical  extremely funny  smart    and the worst part of it was that Douglas Adams made it look so easy  Can t wait to find out what happened in The Restaurant at the End of the Universe   The characters ARTHUR DENT   the everyman  One of the two last human beings in the universe FORD PREFECT   human in appearance but he actually came from Betelgeuse  He worked for the HIthchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  He d been in Earth for 15 years before the Vogons came  collecting data for the Guide  His long  detailed entry about Earth was changed by his editors into two words  mostly harmless  He picked the name Ford Prefect because he thought it was a common Earth name  ZAPHOD BEEBLEBROX   the President of the Galaxy  Self obsessed  egocentrical  He would look like an ordinary human if he had only one head instead of two  and two arms instead of three MARVIN  THE PARANOID ANDROID  very  very brilliant and very  very depressed  My favorite character  His  oh what s the point  rant is always hilarious TRILLIAN   one of the last two human beings in the universe  Her real name was Tricia McMillan  I suspect she was created just so there would be one female character THE HITCHHIKER S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY   a digital book contained all kinds of information you need about the universe  If you wanted to know how to see the marvels of the Universe and you only had less than 30 Altairan dollars to spend in a day  this is a must have FENCHURCHMentioned very briefly in the prologue  You ll know about her in book 4 MARVIN THE ALBUMKODAK MOMENT   1  DEUS EX MACHINA Chapter 34  Two police came to apprehend Zaphod in planet Magrathea  After a shootout suddenly things got quiet  Zaphod  Ford and Trillian found out that the coppers were dead  But they didn t do anything so how was that even possible When they ran into Marvin  we found out he d been talking to the police ship s computer  And that talk got the latter so depressed  it self destructed itself  You heard me  It committed suicide  And the life support for the police were managed by the ship s computer    So without him knowing it  Marvin actually saved the gang   I find this book as the most accurate example of how weird our society is  Looking at it from a third person point of view via the different alien species makes yourself wander and pay a different attention to small situation  we as humans  face in a daily basis   I no longer have to hang my head in shame that I haven t read this book  Nerd cred regained A delightfully humorous read  fulll of wit and tongue in cheek  or not so much in cheek and outright cheeky  observations on the silliness and absurdity of life   Douglas Adams wrote for Dr  Who series  He was a true life friend of Monty Python  has a sense of Pythonesque humor  is a lover of all things technological and has a profound sense of the absurd  Loved all parts of this series  Read it all during the summer of 2012  Lots of LOLs in the middle of the night  Who do you think is the next Douglas Adams  We ve lived without him for much too long   One of the best books I ve ever read  A rating of 5 isn t enough  This book should get an inifnity minus 1 rating   This book combines advanced technology with humor and space travel  The universe Douglas Adams creates in The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy contains technology so advanced it seems like magic  humor viewable at a glance with one meaning and a second meaning after thinking about it  characters who just can t help but unknowingly get themselves into trouble  and space time travel  Arthur Dent  the last existing part of a huge computer program to find the Ultimate Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life  the Universe  and Everything  is saved from destruction  only to find himself in other  more dangerous situations such as being confronted by a robot threatening to destroy the galaxy  Why can t anybody know the Question and Answer  Why did Vogons destroy Earth  only so it could be built again  And who on  nonexistent  Earth is this Ford Prefect guy  I recommend this book for people who like humor such that you can read quickly and slowly and still get a laugh  a bit of magic  and technology  Great Book a little complicated but also very fun  Beautifully written book  Listened to the audiobook which was narrated by the author himself providing a very rich experience  Creative written that makes you laugh very frequently  The ending is very abrupt but I m eager to read the rest of the series   What a strange book  I read this book awhile back in high school and didn t really get it  This time around I loved it  Having seen the movie  I ve had visuals in my memory to work with and found the humor to be amongst the most funny that I ve ever read before  Then again  it s always funny how as time passes our maturity and life experiences change our tastes  especially with regard to books There s quite a bit of philosophical thought in this book that in an effortless way  makes an effort to explain life and allows one to laugh at the whole thing together Unlike the movie  this book doesn t exactly end  but I know that there s several books in this series  I very much look forward to reading them  Downloaded from Audible comI read the paper version of this book when it was first published  and enjoyed reliving it as an audiobook Narrator  Stephen FryPublisher  Random House Audio  2005Length  5 hours and 51 min Publisher s SummarySeconds before the Earth is demolished to make way for a galactic freeway  Arthur Dent is plucked off the planet by his friend Ford Prefect  a researcher for the revised edition of The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy who  for the last 15 years  has been posing as an out of work actor Together this dynamic pair begin a journey through space aided by quotes from The Hitchhiker s Guide   A towel is about the most massively useful thing an interstellar hitchhiker can have    and a galaxy full of fellow travelers  Zaphod Beeblebrox  the two headed  three armed ex hippie and totally out to lunch president of the galaxy  Trillian  Zaphod s girlfriend  formally Tricia McMillan   whom Arthur tried to pick up at a cocktail party once upon a time zone  Marvin  a paranoid  brilliant  and chronically depressed robot  and Veet Voojagig  a former graduate student who is obsessed with the disappearance of all the ballpoint pens he bought over the years Where are these pens  Why are we born  Why do we die  Why do we spend so much time in between wearing digital watches  For all the answers stick your thumb to the stars  And don t forget to bring a towel  Yes yes yes  This book triggered my love of reading  I have never been a massive book worm but as soon as I finished this book in early 2013 I knew I craved more  It is fantastically written and very witty  Can t recommend enough  I look forward to the second read through this masterpiece  Vazne super kniha  doporucuji  I loved this book  well obviously   you can tell from my rating    The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is super funny and entertaining  It can be a somewhat patient read at times because you may have to read on before the previous chapter s  make sense  But it s worth the wait  The plot is simple and flies by  but the descriptions and unique events of the story make it an interesting read  The main characters are clever and likable  They kept me turning the pages with their shrewd sense of humor  The ending is surprising but doesn t really wrap up the story because there s a sequel   The Restaurant at the End of the Universe   I haven t actually read it yet  but it s on my reading list  I d recommend The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy to you if you like humor  science fiction  light reads  or just if you ever need a good laugh  Or even if you don t   I love Douglas Adams and rereading this just reaffirmed my desire to be rocketed into outer space   This book was a lot of fun to read and makes me really want to read the next book in the series  It is so well written and matter of fact with some of the things that are in it that it makes it really easy to get into the book and the plot  By far my favorite part of the book is the scene when the two missiles turn into a Sperm Whale and a bowl of petunias simply because if how ridiculous it is and how crazy it is for that to happen  Over all this book is a give out of five  great read that is a ton of fun to read   I know  I know  I finally read this book  It s not like it was never on my radar  It s just  when I was younger  well I was younger  Plus I ve only recently begun reading fiction again so you have to cut me some slack  Right This was one of the funniest books I ve read  It s timeless  I loved every minute of reading it and devoured the book in one night  I couldn t put it down It s one of those books that has garnered such a following for good reason  For me  at least  it lived up to the hype  It s been said a million times  If you haven t read this book you should do so now  Especially if you love good wit and science fiction  Its been a while since I ve read this  so I can t list any specifics  but remember it being quite hilarious Many a sideways glance did I receive when reading this in public  for I d burst out in laughter at frequent intervals and the thing  it was a book with the whole trilogy bound together  was a huge book liken to that of a heirloom picture Bible  I m sure they thought I was in hysterics over a Bible story and went to call those nice young men in clean white coats     haha  heehee  haha  hoho  It s a very weird book Definitely a great book  though  Arthur  If I asked you where the hell we were  would I regret it Ford  We re safe Arthur  Oh good Ford  We re in a small galley cabin in one of the spaceships of the Vogon Constructor Fleet Arthur  Ah  this is obviously some strange use of the word safe that I wasn t previously aware of  funny This book has taught me more about the meaning of life and British humor  not humour  than anything else  ever  I will probably never not carry a towel again  My first science fiction read ever and I m glad it had to be this  I found HHGTTG to be hilarious and charming  From the characters to the plot itself  the story is absolutely absurd  But I think that s what makes it so great  I adored the way Adams was able to make us feel right aboard the Heart of Gold because I feel that it helped me felt the way they felt  I also enjoyed the clear yet unclear  if that makes sense  definitions given from the Guide  Arthur was a such character who was always worried about everything and that much about him makes him as human as the rest of us  I would probably approach things the way he did if that was to happen to me  I can t wait to follow the Heart of Gold on their next adventure   The other end of the SciFi spectrum from Frank Herbert  Adams uses the flexible format universe of science fiction to skewer Western culture and human conceit on a Galactic scale  Dialogue is the best in the business  but if you re not used to cerebral and fast moving dialogue as the primary driver of the story  then it ll be a somewhat confusing read  If you like Monty Python  you should love this  Think you know anything at all  Think again  And then  stop thinking and read this book  With a red face I admit I had never read this seminal book until I listened to this version  Having confessed my sin of omission  I am so happy to have heard this wonderful reading from Stephen Fry  It is apparent that this book is foundational to so much that is good about current satirical sci fi Still don t know if I can bear to watch the film version  Completely ridiculous and wonderful  One of my all time favourite books  I should re read it this year  as after all  the answer to the question of life  the universe and everything is 42   that has to be significant   A classic  crazy sci fi book  Never a dull moment when reading this  Fun  sarcastic  imaginative and an all around great read  Love it  love it  love it  Buy this book  you won t be disappointed  There are a lot of things that I loved about this book  it s sarcastic  crazily funny  I don t remember laughing out loud while reading a book this much   creative  and it pushed the boundaries of my thoughts further It s not a novel  don t expect any character depth or evolution  it s senseless fun  that sometimes pushes you to contemplate whether it s senseless or meaningful  Of course  being a believer  I don t agree with the author s atheistic views  but the thing really forces you to appreciate it  a new book added to my all time favorites   The hitchhiker s guide to the galaxy is considered to be the best science fiction novel out there making sci fi fans and haters alike rise in its praise  Unabashedly funny  strikingly original and thoroughly engrossing  it is a read unlike any other  Ford Prefect  an alien from a corner of Bulgaria has been living an  earthling  existence as an out of work actor for the last decade and a half  So when the earth is destroyed  he escapes with the sole human survivor  Arthur  his friend who until that morning was entirely clueless about the universe  So it is when they embark on a space journey  that we are introduced to things and people way vast our wildest dreams  THGTTG is the proof of the sheer genius imagination can achieve when its not being held down by the conformity of our mundane world This book had me alternatively arching my eyebrow in shock as well as succumb to the most strongest set of giggles and roaring laughter  The Paranoid Android  the mice  the various creatures on the numerous planets so effortlessly constructed no matter how nonsensical it may be And of course the humor is the highlight  buckets of hilarity and digs at the human race  both subtle and apparent  A book sure to lift up your spirits  Fantastic  odd  but fantastic  full of great characters  funny  tense  gripping  sad  everything you need in a good story Four aaand a half  Maybe i couldn t give it a five star because i was so excited about this book    And it didn t exactly meet my expectations  The hitchhiker s guide left me a slightly exhausted at the end  which is a good sign  so I might as well pick it up again later when I need a break from all those  serious types   Left me with thinking  we are very small  and our life honestly doesn t mean anything in the universe  Quite sad  If you have seen the movie and you liked it  I highly recommend to read this  If you have not seen the movie  and you like science fiction books  I would still recommend it  I really liked this book because it was funny and creative  I ve never really read a book that would make me laugh out loud  I really enjoyed it  Elveda ve baliklar icin tesekkurler genialni   Genialni   GENIAAALNI      I m proud to have finally joined the legions of nerds who have read and loved this book  This is one of my new favorites  It s quick and witty  the dialogue is on point and the characters have the appropriate amount of depth  Even the footnotes are great  I can easily see myself rereading it  My favorite quote  He gestured Arthur toward a chair which looked as if it had been made out of the rib cage of a stegosaurus   It was made out of the rib cage of a stegosaurus   explained the old man   Sheer silliness  I loved it  This will always be one of my favorite series  Douglas Adams was a genius  If you like Monty Python  you will probably enjoy this book  The audio version has the added bonus of being read by the author  and is hilariously fantastic  there s also a very good audio version read by Jim Dale   A quirky science fiction story about a human who escapes from Earth in its final days  only to discover that everything he thought he knew about Earth was incorrect  Good fun  and I m not typically a sci fi fan  When I read this in 8th grade  my rating was 3 stars  I did not get this book  I do now I love it I will never go anywhere without my towel  I carried all five books in the form of  the Ultimate Hitchhiker s Guide  around with when I hiked 22 miles in two days  It was worth the weight  My girl scout troop had to endure me spouting off random and apparently nonsensical quotations  42Of the three I have read so far  this is my favorite  I don t know if it was the novelty of it or what  but I enjoyed this book immensely  and I laughed a lot  It is my type of humor   Ford Prefect has been stuck on Earth for 15 years  but when he realizes that Earth is about to be demolished to make way for a hyperspace bypass  he grabs his Earthman friend  Arthur Dent  and the two of them hitch a ride on a Vogon spaceship  That s just the first few pages   I have read this book many many times  and each time I laugh  Funny is the first word that comes to mind  Clever is the second  Throughout the book there are neat little statements  concepts  and ideas that are both ridiculous and oddly infused with Truth  Philosophers adamantly demanding the destruction of a computer which can provide the ultimate answer  physicists lynching the student who figured out the Infinite Improbability problem  mice and dolphins being a bit more intelligent than commonly assumed  etc The part that makes it clever and funny though is not necessarily the plot so much as the writing  Adams employs syntax and turns of phrase that make the writing as clever as the ideas  For example      it invariably delivered a liquid that tasted almost  but not quite  entirely unlike tea   The first time I read that line  I paused  went back  and read it again  I love it when a writer can make me pause for a clever turn of phrase  What can be said other than so long and thanks for all the fish   The first and best of the whole series  Adams just has a way with humor and wit that I think just about anyone can get onboard with  even without the presence of a Babelfish  Either that or I just have a really British sense of humo u r   Either way the book is lighthearted  zany  strange  and overall pretty damn great  Now I know what 42 is  3  A very interesting read undoubtedly   Not much to review here as it s basically classic and most of people  especially those liking sci fi  exactly knows what s the book is all about  and if not  at least they know the overall spirit of the book  A simple heuristic that may help to judge whether you may like the book 1  Do you like sci fi  2  Do you like Monty Python  If answer to any questions above is positive you ll probably enjoy this book immensely  as I did  As for me I am just going to pick one Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster and start to read second book in the Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy series  Wow I devoured that book in two days and absolutly love it  It is easy to read not to heavy stuff and packed with awesome humor  Love the improbability drive and the best part is Marvin with his hatred for the happy doors and the the spacecraft who commited suicide after talking to him  So sad   D Must read  Haven t read this in years  and even after three or four times  it still has me laughing  Just good stuff  Amazing book  it s so unique in every way and even tho most of the chapters are so random they have almost nothing in common about 50  of the time it s a book you just can t put down  I just wish I could say the same for the second book in the series which I have been slowing and forcefully trying to read for probably 3 years without an ounce of pleasure left or it    biut this one  This is the bomb    I did not only stick up my thumb to get into the adventure of reading this extremely funny book  but also to give it a thumbs up to show how much I liked it What I liked most was the twisted humor  the absolutely brilliant ideas  I want a Babel Fish    the tongue twisting names and lovely characters  My favouritve charakter is the chronically depressed robot Marvin who never failed to make me laugh   As if there was anything about this book that failed to make me laugh     His philosophy on Life is simple   Loathe it  or ignore it   you can t like it  And even if you don t like science fiction  go ahead and read this book for the laughs  It s almost impossible to describe the humor  It s twisted  abstract  sarcastic and dry  But in a good way  of course It s over way too soon and leaves you starving for more and a Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster  The Hitchhiker s Guide To Galaxy describes the Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster as the best alcoholic drink in existence   DON T PANIC   Douglas Adams luckily wrote more books  and I for sure will go on and read them  Don t leave the Milky Way without it  There is nothing about this series I do not love  Except the fifth book  of which let us say no more  Funny  brilliant  quirky  and generally perfect science fiction  Douglas Adams is a voice we will all sorely miss  The related movies  television shows  Inforcom text adventure game  and BBC radio series are also worthwhile  Well    this was quite honestly one of the weirdest books I ve read since Breakfast of Champions by Kurt Vonnegut    In the best way possible  This book is completely irrelevant and wonderful at the same time  Absolutely hilarious and stupid I laughed out loud more times reading this than I had in quite a while  It s not for everyone  but for those who enjoy strange humor and weird plots    It s for you  Read it or you ll be missing out   This is my very favorite book  ever  Tahle knizka patri k tem nejvic veselym a vtipnym taskaricim  ktere jsem kdy cetl a musim rict  ze se k ni moc rad vracim  Nektere z konstrukci ze stoparova pruvodce se natrvalo uhnizdily v moji hlave i v mem slovniku  nenapada me jak tomuto dilu vzdat vetsi pochvalu nez prave toto priznat Mozna to nekteri  mozna vetsina  z vas nevedi  ale Douglas Adams spolupracoval s firmou Infocom na velmi uspesne pocitacove hre zalozene na Stoparove pruvodci  psal se rok 1984  Ve svete se prodalo pres 350000 kopii teto hry a D A  potom mohl  take diky tomuto uspechu  travit svuj zivot poslouchanim  jak mu za oknem svisti dedlajny   Pokud byste v sobe nasli dostatek trpelivosti pro textovou hru  pak vezte  ze tenhle skvostny pocin se dockal pred par lety oziveni a BBC4 hostuje  Hitchhikers guide to the galaxy  ve dvou grafickych verzich   viz  http   www bbc co uk radio4

lec jednu drobnost budete muset prekousnout   hra je pochopitelne anglicky Jeste jednu poznamku ke knize  Setkal jsem se s lidmi  kteri  Stopare  proste nedokazali cist  Mel jsem puvodne samizdatove vydani na A4 a cela uvodni scena  L  Prosser  digitalni hodinky a pytlik buraku  se vesly na dva listy  O  Stopare  byl emnormni zajem a vzdycky kdyz jsem ji nekomu pujcoval  cinil jsem tak s poucenim  ze pokud dotycneho kniha nezaujme jiz na techto dvou listech je pratrne nekompatibilni a nema cenu aby dale cetl  Takze ochutnavku dvou listu bylo mozno provest velmi rychle a pokud to nezafungovalo mohl ji zkusit ochutnat nekdo jiny  Dluzno uznat  ze  Stopar  nechutnal jen nekolika malo nestastnym lidem  o kterych jsem dikybohu jiz nikdy neslysel  This book and the others in the series was my summer vacation one year  still love them all  A must read for anyone interested in the genre  Just a lot of fun and a bizarre sense of humor  Once upon a time  many years ago  I was fortunate enough to have lunch with Mr  Adams in a Chinese restaurant in NYC  I don t remember much from the lunch  but do remember being happy afterwards  hima es gitem GooglePlex e orteghits  e ekel  ChCh A must to re read yearly for me  This just pain fun  I read it is history class while my teacher was going on and on  He must have thought I was studying our text book  but this story is much more fun  Everyone who likes science fiction has read this  so I won t tell the story again  It isn t often that a science finction book is humorous  but this one sure is  If you begin it  you won t put the book down  Read the whole thing in one all night sitting  Couldn t put it down  Laughing out loud all alone and smacking your forehead with the book kinda just plain dumb humor  Was a great way to ease the stress of graduating from university  Dunno if I d still find it so amusing  but at the time it was a revelation  The next day I put it in an envelope and mailed it to someone who I thought should read it  This is the best ever sci fi comedy  When you read some spectacular nonsense  you might be inclined to think any fool could have written it  Only when you try it yourself will you realise how thoroughly wrong you are  It takes a special kind of crazy talent to be able to pen gobbledygook and actually get away with it  Simply brilliant  The ultimate in nonsensical writing  Everyone should read it at least once  There are quite a few covers for this novel out there  There s the movie cover  an edition with just the green planet with a mouth and arms  and a few others  I chose this one because it was on the edition that I read  and it s not new fangled like the movie one  I know this book is really old  so I didn t want to choose a shiny cover I ve tried to read this book before   I checked it out once and even started it   but this was the first time that I actually finished it  I m very proud of myself  actually  since I feel like it is one of those books that should be read  It wasn t a hard read  but I had trouble getting in to it the first time that I tried to finish it  I think one of the reasons that I had trouble getting into it the first time was the beginning is so random  All of the major characters are introduced in the first few chapters despite the fact that their intersection in the plot occurs much later in the story line  It s sort of confusing  bits are boring  and it s difficult to get attached to the characters with all the jumping between them Once all of the characters got together in the space travel machine of random awesomeness  or The Heart of Gold   the plot is a lot more cohesive  There are explanations  wonderfulness  and a super depressed robot  It s pretty neat   If you notice  I m trying not to put any spoilers in this post  In light of that  I m going to move on to characters  The characters are many and entertaining  they aren t very deep  There s Arthur Dent  the last human to escape from Earth  Ford Prefect s an alien  Zaphod Beeblebrox is Ford s cousin and president of something or another  his only real job is to draw people s attention away from politics  who  Trillian  aka Tricia McMillan  is a human from Earth and Zaphod s girlfriend  That information is all available on the front flap of my edition  and is all the information you get and or need about them  They re that shallow  But it s okay  The story doesn t really call for complex characters  so you can love them anyway Let s discuss The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  As in the book Ford Prefect writes  It s fabulously wonderful  Little bits of random information about certain subjects  like really bad poetry  are spread throughout the book in a style that convinces me that they are from the Hitchhiker s Guide  The information snibits are wonderful and funny Overall  I enjoyed this book  While it isn t one of my favorites  I think it was worth it  especially since I now understand a lot of references  like 42   You should try it  Maybe     Douglas Adams is an amzing Sci Fi author  and I love how he adds humour to his work as well  If only the guide was real and there were really hitchhiker s out there  Doctor Who fans should read this as it is very inkeeping with the theme of the novel  It s almost Doctor Who meets Red Dwarf  Zaphod is by far my favourite character  It may be Sam Rockwell s performance in the movie  but his fun loving personality just makes me smile when I read it  This is a hilarious classic by a brilliant mind  I will always remember it as the first book that made me laugh out loud despite my otherwise quiet nature  It is filled with clever commentaries on society and life  the universe and everything  It is an exciting read as well  the pace keeping on despite some anecdotal side paragraphs from the guide  which you will love    Humorous read  hands down  I m seriously wondering why the hell I haven t picked it up sooner  I think this is probably the very first sci fi I have ever tried  and it seems a great idea to start from the famous  well received ones  I d certainly love to keep digging the rest of this series  as well as other works by Douglas Adams   This book was read by student Ryan Hutton as part of the Six Book Challenge and was his final review  Here is what he has to say  You finish reading the book  You take a step back  And then you realise how short it actually is and how not a whole lot happens in the book  Of course  it is a part of  A Trilogy of Five   and so you know that this is only the beginning of Arthur Dent s adventures in space  the thought of which eases the heart with some comfort  If the book is good at anything  it is giving its audience merely a taste of what is to come in the series  It most definitely left me wanting more  Acting as a series opener  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy introduces us to its key protagonists that the series is surely set to revolve around  Having Arthur  a man who was conveniently saved from death seconds before the Earth is destroyed at the beginning of the book  as the main character allows the audience to truly connect with him  Where Adams succeeds the most is by helping his audience empathise with Arthur  who is thrown completely into the unknown without much time to breathe  Not only is the reader guided through the book being bewildered as Arthur  but they are entertained richly as they do so by Douglas Adams  spectacularly witty humour  which can both shock and amuse the reader at even the most unexpected points during the book It may be short  but The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy does not fail to impress the eager readers of Science Fiction  however readers who are not interested in the genre may be left a little confused by some of the elements in the novel  Though if you like it  then it will undoubtedly leave you with an addictive taste in your mouth lusting for more    Re reading the Hitchhiker series  Love these books   This is the best book ever if you want to be entertained  I read this on a cruise ship once  and couldn t stop laughing  A lady had to walk up to me and ask what I was reading because I was laughing so much  It s good  intellectual humor  though  not stupid humor  This is what I like  Great book  Total silliness  Lots of lines to quote  Loved the book  During my childhood I heard about this book series  which managed to lampoon the sci fi genre while remaining an engaging read  I ve always been a sucker for British humor  so when I was able to locate a hardcover omnibus of the whole Hitchhiker s Guide series  it was a no brainer  Suffice it so say that it was simply awesome  No radio  TV or film adaptation touches the novel s ankles  even if it started as a radio play before it was a novel   let alone really do it justice  I m in the process of getting Eoin Colfer s authorized sequel  just for completion s sake  and reading the Dirk Gently novels as well  Very much recommended  About time I read the book that defined its genre  Curious how a book as unassuming as this one could leave you deep in thought one moment and roaring with laughter the other  One of my favourite moments would have to be when Marvin  The Paranoid Android   had a chat with a ship and it committed suicide  So random and bogus  Still it makes perfect sense Frankly I was under a lot of pressure to like this book  I had unwittingly ordered a collector s edition that cost me some serious buck in good faith  It was a beaut  that s for sure  But what if I don t like it  Glad I don t have to figure out the answer to that   If you like whimsy mixed with dodgy science fiction  this is a light read that is pure fun  That s pretty much all I can say  Loved it and holds up to repeat readings  Incredible book  My first foray into Sci Fi   so the offbeat comedy of  Hitchhikers  was the perfect entrance  Though I have to say in my opinion  this book isn t so much  funny ha ha  as it is funny in a genius sort of way  Some things might appear to be comedy fodder but you find them to have an important meaning later in the book and dare I say   later in your actual life  I think that s why this book has become a cult classic   you can relate so many stories quotes scenarios to actual every day world occurrences I ve fallen in love with all the characters too  humanoid or not  and it s made me continue on into the series  much to the chagrin of a few coworkers who say they only get worse    Would it save you a lot of time if I just gave up and went mad now    D http   minzgruenesbuecherregal blogsp   StoryWenn man das ganze mal ganz logisch betrachtet  was man beim Lesen dieses Buches niemals tun sollte   stellt sich heraus  dass alles totaler Schwachsinn ist  Ich meine  eine Umgehungssttrasse  der die Erde im Weg liegt  Seltsame Ausserirdische  ein Unwahrscheinlichkeitsfaktor  Das  und noch einiges mehr begleitet den Leser  auf der Reise durchs Weltall Ich fand es am Anfang etwas schwierig mit der ganzen Weltraum Sache klar zu kommen  weil es eben alles so viel und verruckt war  Doch nach und nach wurden einige Sachen erklart  sodass es  sofern das moglich ist  logisch wurde CharaktereAuf dieser Reise verfolgt man Arthur Dent  einen typischen Briten  finde  ich jedenfalls  und seinen besten Freund  Ford Prefect  Sie sind beide erwachsene Manner  wobei man das bei Ford eher nicht so sagen kann  er ist schliesslich ein Alien  Aus diesem Grund sind die beiden nicht so die Protagonisten gewesen  mit denen ich mich hatte identifizieren konnen  Aber das war okay  da die beiden ihre Macken hatten uber die ich einfach nur schmunzeln musste  Die Dialoge zwischen den ganzen Personen  waren auch zum Totlachen SchreibstilAdams schreibt lustig  manchmal auch verruckt  aber trotzdem angenehm zu lesen  Man liest einige Passagen ohne sie zu verstehen  weil sie total verruckt sind  aber das ist lustig und gehorte fur mich irgendwie dazu Fazit Trotz all des Humors bringt dieses Buch einen zum Nachdenken  Man bekommt einen vollig neuen Blick auf die Welt und ihre Probleme  Ich meine  die Erde  was ist das schon  Ein kleines Planetchen    Und mehr nicht  denn es gibt ja noch so viel mehr  Wenn man Per Anhalter durch die Galaxis vertraut  weis man sogar schon wie dieses  mehr  aussieht   Die Geschichte ist schon etwas speziell  aber mir hat sie gefallen  Ob ihr sie lesen wollt  musst ihr selbst entscheiden    I just read this book for the third time  and I have to say  it definitely gets funnier every time I read it  If anyone s read it once and thought  okay  that was weird   then read it again and thought  huh  yeah  it s pretty funny   read it one more time  I picked up a lot of little nuances that i didn t catch the first two times around  Like Napoleon Dynamite  The Hitchiker s Guide to the Galaxy becomes funnier and more ridiculous with each go round  Un de mes livres perfore  je l ai lu plusieurs fois  en francais  anglais et en allemand  Ce que j aime dans l ecriture de Douglas Adams  c est la maniere qu il y a de jouer sur les mots  detourner le sens  nous faire reflechir sur la maniere d ecrire  meme de voir le monde  le tout en etant extremement drole  Les traducteurs Benjamin schwarz et Jean bonnefoy ont fait du bon travail dans leur langue respective  Awesome book full of great lines i had to read this for english and i didnt want to but as i kept on reading it became more intreging and i couldnt put it down we are watching the tv seris in english some kids dont understand it so we watched the modern day movie DON T WATCH THE MODERN DAY MOVIE it ruins the whole thing if you want to watch it watch the BBC version from the 80 s its way better  The Hitchhiker s Guide To The Galaxy is probably the most entertaining  the most whimsical  and the funniest book that I ve ever read  It tells the story of Arthur Dent who wakes up to find that his house is about to be demolished for the construction of a bypass  What he doesn t know is that at the same time the Earth is also being prepared for demolition  ironically for the construction of an intergalactic bypass  With the help of his friend Ford Prefect  who turns out to be an alien himself  he manages to escape the Earth right before its destruction by hitching a ride on a spaceship  This is the first book by Douglas Adams that I ve read  but it definitely won t be the last  In fact this charming little book not only manages to surpass all expectations for its genre  Sci Fi and Humour   but has presented itself as one of the most delightful works of fiction ever written  and has successfully made its way to my favourite books list  One of my favourite characters is Slartibartfast who understandably repeatedly insisted that his name is of no real consequence  One of his best features are his hilarious replies such as the following  Slartibartfast  I d far rather be happy than right any day Arthur  And are you Slartibartfast  No  That s where it all falls down of course  In fact the entire  Guide  is filled with such dialogue that makes it undesirable for the reader to put the book down Another aspect of the book that I enjoyed is the wonderful writing  One of the best paragraphs is this description of how the Infinite Improbability Drive was invented  The principle of generating small amounts of finite improbability by simply hooking the logic circuits of a Bambleweeny 57 Sub Meson Brain to an atomic vector plotter suspended in a strong Brownian Motion producer  say a nice hot cup of tea  were of course well understood    and such generators were often used to break the ice at parties by making all the molecules in the hostess s undergarments leap simultaneously one foot to the left  in accordance to the theory of indeterminacy Many respectable physicists said that they weren t going to stand for this  partly because it was a debasement of science  but mostly because they didn t get invited to those sorts of parties    Then  one day  a student who had been left to sweep up the lab after a particularly unsuccessful party found himself reasoning in this way  If  he thought to himself  such a machine is a virtual impossibility  it must have finite improbability  So all I have to do in order to make one is to work out how exactly improbable it is  feed that figure into the finite improbability generator  give it a fresh cup of really hot tea    and turn it on He did this and was rather startled when he managed to create the long sought after golden Infinite Improbability generator  He was even more startled when just after he was awarded the Galactic Institute s Prize for Extreme Cleverness he was lynched by a rampaging mob of respectable physicists who had realized that one thing they couldn t stand was a smart ass  It s no wonder that the pages just fly by when the reader is constantly presented with such outlandish background history  I would even say that the context  that is the funny tidbits here and there and the references to what The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy has to say on different matters  might just be the tipping point that makes this book a timeless masterpiece In conclusion  The Hitchhiker s Guide To The Galaxy is a work of genius guaranteed to put a smile on your face  It s a world of its own   I thought this would be an easy review  but it s difficult because when you fall in love with anything  describing why you love seems foolish  I fell in love with the books  the radiobroadcast  the author  the author s sensibility and environmentalism  But first I read the Hitch Hickers Guide backward  I saw a smallish book on a local book store shelf  and it read  so long and thanks for all the fish   I laughed out loud  and just had to buy it  It was only after finishing that I learned it was  then  the last book of a series  I thought I ruined it  but being a trooper and curious I got the other books and started over  Certainly way up there as one of the happiest joyful stimulating and imaginative reads of my time  I also learned that Douglas Adams originally wrote the Guide as a radio show  never knowing week to week if the show would continue  so the episodes were pretty much written on the fly  so to speak   I eventually was able to hear those tapes  and loved them too  To get a sense of the man  go to Ted Talks and look up Douglas Adams  I think he did 2 talks   the one about his journeys around the world seeking rare species is wonderful  No doubt I am a hitch hiker from way back  adventure finds me  and I like it that way  I do try to remember to always carry my towel  and not to panic   If you have yet to read  give yourself a weekend with the series  good food and drink nearby  or take the book your on with you to out of the way funky kinda restaurants where staring off into space will go unremarked  and go for walks in pretty parks  and fancy yourself holding a computerized book that holds all the knowledge in the universe    who knew the internet and google would come along and give the Hitch Hikers Guide a run for the money well   where do you think those ideas came from  Ha    enjoy   and send me a little thank you  through the ether     Is V  Naice  modern catch 22 type satire  V V  Naice nd Funnie  worth reading for anyone with a 6 10 sense of humour  book is 10 10  v naice  This book is HYSTERICAL  It s very British in its humor  and gets very silly  The entire time I was thinking Monty Python style ridiculous  My favourite characters were probably the cops threatening to shoot  I laughed so hard  The rest of the book is more of a smirk and chuckle humor  The first book of the series was adapted from the radio show  as was the second installment  with only minor re workings and some sequence of events changes  If anything  the book format conversion was making Adams  wonderfully imaginative  tremendously impacting and very funny story even better  I urge everyone who haven t read this to do so  This is my review of the Swedish edition and it is a fantastic translation by the poet  amongst many many other things  Thomas Tidholm and this is really not a bad choice if you read Swedish   dio non esiste  siamo cavie da laboratorio per i topi  e siamo troppo stupidi per capire i segnali che il mondo  i delfini  ci manda sulla fine imminente del pianeta ma per fortuna c e il modo per riderci sopra  sempre stando bene attenti a non scordarsi l asciugamano e nel caso non bastasse quarantadue  To say this is my favorite book would be an understatement  For one  my copy has all four books in it  and I ve read it about six times already   but who s counting  It s sci fi  it s deep philosophy  on the life  universe  and everything  of course    and side splittingly hilarious comedy  Douglas Adams  I raise my pan galactic gargle blaster to you  sir  It s a little overwhelming to have to write something about HHGTG  I wept when I heard of Douglas Adam s sudden and very untimely death in May 2001  The man was a genius  I became even more convinced of this after reading Salmon of Doubt  which contained his last unfinished Dirk Gently novel  speeches  letters  and a lot more  It was left behind on the hard drive of his Mac computer  Amazing  Amazing  Amazing If you haven t read any Douglas Adams  this is a good place to begin  with the first book of the four  yes  four  in his trilogy If you are a bookcrosser  you can probably appreciate one of the many words he has coined  Ballycumber  n   One of the six half read books lying somewhere in your bed And  thanks to DA  I ll never look at 42 the same again   I have just finished reading The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  1  This phenomonal story is about a boy named Arthur Dent who wakes up to a terrible day  He sees that a bulldozer is outside of his house and is ready to tear it down to build a freeway  To make matters worse  he later finds out that one of his friends is actually an alien form a planet called Bettleguise who has knowledge of the Earths impending desrtuction  Arthur is an Englishman who has just met the love of his life and then suddenly  everything changes in one day His alien friend Ford Prefect saves Arthur when the Earth is whiped out by the Vogons to make a motorway  In the end Arthur is reunited with his love and him  Ford  and others they meet along the way  travel to find Earth 2 I chose read this book because it has been recommended to me by many friends as a great book I gave this book a 5 5 rating because I agree with everyone else that this is a great book  Douglas Adams has done a great job explaining very detail in the book This skill paints a picture in my mid and keeps me hooked on the book  Thats what I like about fantasy and sci fi books   God doesn t exist   now with proof  42 is the answer to meaning of life  the universe and everything else  Some people name computers as Googleplex Now seriously this book is a shitload of nonsense and intelligent comedy  in a very outstanding  mind blowing way  Prepare to laugh your pants off with the sarcastical genius of Douglas Adams  Bring a towel  This book is funny and good for all audiences  The humor may be a little hard to grasp  its British but if you have the time you should try it   Amazing Don t forget your towel We re all just little evolutionary rodents scurrying about on the surface of a mega computer that is about to be destroyed to make way for a new hyperspacial by way And this is the first few pages  It only gets better Remember  the petunias have already been through this once  One of those pesky books that ends right in the middle of everything  Be warned   I loved this book  It s not something I would normally read  but had been suggested to me multiple times  It was really entertaining and I can t wait to read the next book  Huge fan of British comedy and this is exactly what I would have expected from the book  Unfortunately I was a hold out  no idea why  saw the pathetic movie  well parts  and realized what I missed once I read it  How have I lived so long and not read this book  I listened to it on CDs in the car  and laughed out loud all the time as I drove along  Adams has absolutely the best character names of any book ever written  just their names make me laugh  I think the wackiness carried me along more than plot or plausibility  I did feel slightly let down at the end when the last line so obviously reached toward the sequel  but I ve already ordered THE RESTAURANT AT THE END OF THE UNIVERSE   Pulled this back down off the shelf after almost 12 years  which had also been a re read from some time before   I think what strikes me most this time is how the critique of contemporary culture is handled so irreverently  Nothing is above being laughed at  and if nothing is sacred  then we can all relax  What an amazing message for Adams to have delivered    Why   said Ford squatting down beside him and shivering   are you lying face down in the dust   It s a very effective way of being wretched   said Marvin   Don t pretend you want to talk to me  I know you hate me   The History of every major Galactic Civilization tends to pass through three distinct and recognizable phases  those of Survival  Inquiry and Sophistication  otherwise known as the How  Why and Where phases  For instance  the first phase is characterized by the question How can we eat  The second by the question Why do we eat  and the third by the question Where shall we have lunch  If these two extracts don t pique your interest in this piece of work  either because you lack the humour to understand them or don t find them interesting enough  you will never be able to figure out why 42  I loved this book  What happens when a humble earthling gets thrown into a large  confusing galaxy  This book is amazingly quirky with different characters from all around the universe  In this classic novel  Adams talks about the mysterious futuristic technology that designed the earth  a topic that does a great job of connecting with and engaging the reader  Cool ideas and logical expressions  Where has this book been all my life   I can t believe I didn t come across it before  And boy  have I been missing something like this  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is the ultimate satirical comedy series out there  I guess it s the only one of it s kind  who knew sci fi and comedy could go hand in hand    with it s wide range of eccentric characters  witty space jargon  rib tickling humour and deliciously fast pace The writing style is distinct  and there are so many little things in every page to be appreciated  I didn t realise that a towel had so much universal importance and that poetry is even used as a form of torture  Read the book   you ll know what I m talking about  The science is questionable and at times  just plain nonsensical  but nobody s complaining because that s exactly the point of this book  to keep you guessing what the hell is going on  What s even more wonderful is that the author manages to keep a thoughtful storyline amidst all these bits and pieces of ridiculously funny chaotic elements A must read for anyone who would want a chuckle every now and then  Simply unputdownable  Can t wait to finish all the five parts   the feeling of incompleteness is driving me crazy P S  If you re not a fan of science fiction  or find farce and satire unenjoyable  this book might not keep you interested for long  If you do not have any such issues   well  what are you waiting for   I have read this book probably 20 times  There was a time when I could quote it in its entirety from memory  I can still recite the Vogon poem from memory right now  and it s been 25 years since I ve picked it up   The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  by Douglas Adams  Our characters are Arthur Dent  a normal human living in England along with his friend  Ford Prefect a researcher for a updated Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  Zaphod Beeblebrox  Ford Prefect s half cousin and president of the United Galactic Federation  Trillion the earth born companion of Zaphod  the optimistic Heart of Gold spaceship computer  and Marvin  the depressed robot When Arthur Dent s house is scheduled for demolition to build a bypass  we soon learn that the earth has also been scheduled for demolition to build a galactic highway by the Vogons  Luckily Ford Prefect hitches him and Arthur a ride on one of the spaceships  Ford came from a planet called Beetle Juice 7 and knew how to hitch a ride  Eventually Ford and Arthur are picked up by the Heart of Gold spaceship  Where we meet Zaphod  Trillion  Marvin and the computer This book is very much like a Guardians of the Galaxy and Monty Python mash up  with Guardians Of The Galaxy story format and Monty Python humor  So if you liked these things this book is for you You may not like this if you prefer action sci fi books  or don t like irony enhanced jokes It s very humorous  there are a lot of laugh out loud moments  like when ____ thinks they have a way out of somewhere and then realize that they don t    The  Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy  is a very fun  entertaining  and confusing book  if you don t pay attention then you ll be lost and very confused   Author Dents house is a very nice house  until one morning when he looked out his window and saw a big yellow bulldozer  He frantically searched through his memory s for an answer of why the bulldozers were there  he remembered  they were there because the government wanted to build a bypass  He ran outside and laid down in front of the bulldozer    This book is a very fun  entertaining  and a what happens next book  it keeps you reading and on the edge of your seat   one of the funniest Sci fis I ve ever known  full of humourous scenarios  scientific super amazing made up technology and the Guide itself  performed wonderfully by Peter Jones is unique and exteremly funny       Calmatevi   prego   disse la voce  suadente come quella di una hostess su un aereo di linea con un ala sola e uno dei due motori in fiamme   Siete perfettamente al sicuro  Forse mi aspettavo di meglio perche me ne hanno parlato troppo  Tutto sommato e divertente  la storia e ininfluente se paragonata alle assurdita che nel contesto sembrano assolutamente normali  Volendo  fa anche pensare   Fiori per Algernon  Do you like Science fiction  Neither do I  This book has great spoofs of sci fi movies and books  and has the answer to life  the universe  and everything    DON T PANIC    I can t wait to read the rest of the series    The story begins with a house being torn down to make way for a bypass  but then someone arrives and says that the planet is to be demolished to make way for a  hyperspatial express route  and    oh you will have to read the rest so I don t completely spoil it  I recomend this book to sci fi and non sci fi fans  This is a great book  Slartibartfarst  you da man  S putevoditelem po Galaktike ia stolknulas  v pervyi raz v kino v 2005 godu  spustia 3 goda kupila knigu  eshchio

 Douglas Adams needs to be recognized as one of the ultimate inventors of the internet and cyberspace  as well the precursor inventor of the smart phone  the tablet  the laptop  and any other form of portable computer And  of course  the perfect wisdom for how people deal with comnputer technology  especially when the cyber mind overrules the human mind and the human fist starts punching   Don t

chto nado posle tiazhelykh knig i rabochei nedeli Stavliu 5 iz 5 zvezd   This is one of those classic books that hits a niche of pure entertainment  The dialogue and writing is hilarious  the characters are interesting and well structured  and  yes  the plot is also quite excellent One of his best traits is the ability for tangential writing  where a bit of absurdity flits off in another direction for a few paragraphs but doesn t actually impact the greater story  Think of the Family Guy   Remember that time     running gag  which I d argue is pretty consistently the funniest  and sometimes the only funny  part of the show  Adams does tangents beautifully  keeping them brief but quite hilarious Simply  this is an excellent book  well worth anyone s time  Hadn t read it in years  but still one of my favorite books ever  RIDICULOUS in the best possible sense of this word  Absolutely entertaining  witty and fun read  The intergalactic world full of most impossibe creatures like hyper intelligent shade of the color blue is exciting enough  but the hilarious writing style of the author brought it home for me  I m definitely hooked  and in desperate need to carry on with the series  Bizarre and immensely readable  Pretty cool read  Author was quite witty in writing this  And he definitely had an intriguing plot for a comedy like novel  Very sci fi based  Ending was ok  Was looking for more climax and explosions and what not  but eh  can t blame him   Looking forward to watching the movie now and see how they pulled it off    Overall  a good read and def recommendation   A classic from a legend An answer for a burning question given in such a humorous way  One of the most entertaining book I ve ever read  Brilliant plot  I was looking for this book for such a long time because of its popularity  For once  a book with a big hype did not disappoint   A classic in sci fi genre  Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is a book that is either well loved or loathed  The humour is off the wall  but surprisingly clever  and the characters are similarly odd    with the notable exception of the protagonist Arthur  who is a normal guy caught up in the end of the world  and who spends most of the book in his pyjamas  The dialogue and prose are both witty and fun  and I highly recommend this book to everyone who likes a humorous take on sci fi  Warning  Unforgivable Spoilers 42  Bring a towel     P S    sigh   As some moustached motherfucker in tights once said   brevity is the soul of twitter   Or  levity is solely for half wits   I m pretty sure both of those sentences arrive at the same station  but if they don t  I was just kidding AND I meant to do that  It ain t Shakespeare  but it works  and no  I won t clarify who or what I m referring to with that sentence    why should I have to make sense when I write stuff  The reader should meet my brain dead rambling halfway past confusion and just north of chaos   If you re one of those indecisive types who needs someone to hold your hand for every metaphorical crossroad and actual crosswalk    or you need a gargantuan 145 character review every time you buy a book  watch a movie  or plan a murder    fine  This book smells loudly and pleasantly and often  It tastes even better  with twice the daily color level recommended by proctologists and voodoo priests  You can t argue with that  But reviews are for suckers  when it comes to books  and movies  and murder  just trust your gut and pull the trigger  You don t want to be one of those sad fuckers who s always thinking and whatnot  Jeebus    I feel like I just wrote a book about reading a book       Yep  Five stars I always thought old books lacked any good jokes that would appeal to the youth of today   well  all i can say is  Boy  was I surprised This book s awesome    P It gives a whole new dimension to  light reading   I suppose it could get a little annoying  coz the story takes some very  very twisty turns  But  that s the fun of it The lunacy of it all the utter eccentricity makes it all so    fun  Commonly mistaken for science fiction and also even more commonly put aside because of it s strange cover   this book isn t given much attention  but once you do give it attention you will not stop giggling  So  if people give you stares just suggest that they should pick it up the next time they visit the library  I picked it up  just to pass time while waiting to consult my doctor    well  that s how my galactic journey began  What about yours  I didn t know what to expect when I started reading this book  I just knew it involved towels  people panicking  and Earth exploding You know  fun things like that I was hesitant at first   Then I reached the scene where Arther hung out in the mud all day  I laughed And the scene where the Vogon read Ford and Arther his  poem  It completely sold me on this book What can I say  It s wonderfully  brilliantly hilarious  Like every other young person in the world  I am really familiar with this story because of the movie and all the references to it in society  I have also listened to the entire audio book  but I felt like I wasn t connecting to the story  so I decided to read it in print this time  Nothing can prepare you for the awesomeness of this book  So why even write a review  Go take this book to a place where you won t be assumed strange for laughing aloud and enjoy   AWESOME  I ve always wondered just how much difference there is between Arthur in The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy and Alice in Alice in Wonderland Why  Well  the thread has some potential answers   or maybe some questions  As usual  it was Manny that started it  I love this book and all the ones that follow  Quick read and super fun  I listened to this book on tape when I was sick as a dog with morning sickness and it made me laugh through the green haze of extreme nausea  Reading all the books is lots of fun anytime you need escape  I m so surprised  that guy really knows where his towel is  never caught on as a catch phrase  I am not a sci fi person  I am not an alien person  I am not a physics  space  chemistry  or biology person But I am a Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy person  Despite my lack of knowledge and interest in most fields of science and math  I found this book entertaining  well written  interesting  and certainly humorous  I couldn t put the book down    This book is about the end of the world  The world is destroyed in order to make an intergalactic space highway  Only two human being survive the destruction of planet Earth  one  who less s half brained  literally  alien boyfriend let out the secret  grabbed her and bolted  Who s name would be Trillian  and her boyfriend Zaphod Beebelbrox pick up two hitchhikers  Arthur Dent  the hero more or  of the story  and his best friend for seven years  Ford Prefect  who is actually an alien  Ford grabs Arthur  two towels  and bolts just as the Earth is destroyed and hitchhikes himself on to Zaphoid s  stolen  ship  A very paranoid robot named Marvin lets them in  and Zaphod  who was incubated as a fetus     with Ford gives them a warm welcome  The rest of the book is about their harebrained adventures  which usually end up going badly  as Zaphod is really stupid  The book ends in the realization that Earth was a big science project for mice to find out the meaning of life  The meaning of life is  27 I know  I don t get it either    I made a text to world connection  If the world were to end it would probably be about something as stupid as the creation of an intergalactic space highway  Because humans are so willing to accept that were the only ones in the universe  that we would not take any action if we did happen to here we were going to be replaced by a highway  I gave this book five stars  It is witty  exciting  hilarious  and the ending was unpredictable  these are qualities I look for in a good book  It was also very well written  and I never lost interest  I would recommend this book to anyone who likes the following authors  JK  Rowling  Eva Ibbotson  Christopher Paolini  and the kind of person who likes funny movies  but not to predictable funny  not really  movies   My husband asked me to read this book and I have to admit  I liked it alot   Douglas Adams tem essa facilidade em inserir criticas sociais e religiosas em um texto de ficcao cientifica misturado com um humor  muitas vezes interpretado como fraco por pessoas acostumadas a um humor escancarado que a TV ja deixou suas mentes acostumadas  Voce precisa pensar  UM POUCO  pra entender as tiradas desse escritor que morreu tao precocemente  Adams tambem foi um dos primeiros escritores a utilizar a internet pra ficar em contato com os fas  isso na epoca que grande parte da populacao nem sonhava em execrar seus livros em um site  Very entretaining  It is unique in its style  and its style is unique  One of the most absurd stories to ever be told narrated with a great simplicity but showing an inmensly complex story  What a weird and yet entertaining read  I ll definitely pick up the other two  Arthur Dent is a human on Earth  whose house is about to be destroyed  However  Earth is also about to be destroyed  and Arthur s friend  Ford Prefect  a humanoid alien for Betelgeuse  informs him of this  They hitch a ride into space  and are soon kicked off of the ship  They are then rescued miraculously by the Heart of Gold  a ship that was recently stolen by the President of the Galaxy  Zaphod Beeblebrox  and his girlfriend Trillian  Together  the four journey to the planet Magrathea  where they uncover secrets about Earth and its purpose I found The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy to be not only hilarious  but also very satisfying  The main focus of the book isn t the guide itself  but its the journey they make through space  People who enjoy comedy  sci fi  and simply enjoy reading will find this book to be one of their favorites  This book has received lots of praise  and that praise is well deserved  My all time favourite book  I still have the copy I bought in what must have been 1979 or 80  when I was about 13  I very clearly remember buying it  It was an almost accidental purchase  bought from a general store  not a book shop  while my family took a rest break during a long car journey  I don t know how many times I ve read it since  and my paperback is barely in readable condition any more  I have another  hardback  copy fortunately  I love every bit of it 2nd Feb 2014   Finished the audiobook narrated by Stephen Fry  Excellent reading  and I still love adore the book  A strip joint waitress at Mobile s Lucky Lady Lounge named Margaret gave me a soiled copy by in 1982  It was a treasured hardback edition that I passed along to a dear friend because it meant so much to me The Hitchhiker s guide series tickles the funny bone  stirs the imagination and is just plain fun When a young Ensign showed up for her first day at her new duty station  I could tell she felt over her head  When I inquired about her furrowed brow  she said she didn t know where her towel was  To which I replied   Haven t you even READ The Hitchhiker s Guide   She relaxed and that set off a great working relationship that has lasted The other reason I like it is that one of the very first automobiles I can recall riding in was my Dad s 1961 yellow and white Ford Prefect  It was powered by a small Ford tractor engine  and the car resembled a potato  but the memories of it are sweet This is one of the most imaginative books of the 20th century  It s so brilliant  I m actually speechless  It s perfect  IT S PERFECT  Never laughed this hard while reading a book  with the single exception of reading P G Wodehouse  and this  frankly  is better than P G Wodehouse  Bless   Out of all of the books I ve read  none can hold a candle to the pure brilliance of Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  Not only is the story great  the absurd little tidbits that freckle the book are thoroughly impressive  The creative genius required to even consider some of the ridiculous ideas mentioned is astounding  The frank and factual way these ideas are presented just adds to the appeal When the Earth is destroyed to make space for a interstellar highway  alien journalist Ford Perfect and normal human Author Dent are the only ones to make it off  Through a series of improbable coincidences  they join former galactic president Zaphod Beeblebrox  human girl Trillian  and depressed robot Marvin on a ship that runs on pure improbability  and hijinx ensue  The plot is a lot more advanced than that  but I don t want to spoil anythingThe only thing I don t like about this book is that none of the sequels are as good as the original  but that s a review for a different time  I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to be bombarded with pure  concentrated  randomness  It s a great book for any type of reader  and you are at a loss by not reading it  I knew nothing about The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy before I read it aside from something about the number 42 and that people from the Internet seem to like it  Well  people from the Internet  I m a fan The Hitchhiker s Guide is a funny book  but it s very cynical  That s not a bad thing  funny cynicism is better than crushing cynicism  or maybe the only alternative    I think my favorite part was the chapter about the whale   The day starts out bad for Arthur Dent  His house is about to be torn down by the local council and  unbeknown to everyone living on earth  his planet is about to be destroyed Fortunately for Arthur Dent his friend  Ford Prefect  doesn t come from Guilford but is a researcher for the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy The book  the first in the trilogy of five  differs a lot to the Radio series  TV Series and the Film  In my opinion the book is much better  Well written with the true humour of Douglas Adams at his best  later books do seem to lose some of the beauty that makes this the best of the series   4 75 stars For years I had neglected to read The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  if only I knew what I had missed  This book is absolutely fantastic  crazy  but always funny  and never boring Until yesterday  I only knew the content of the story through nerdy jokes and some parts of the movie I had seen on TV  I thought it was funny  but I didn t know if I would have enjoyed it in a book format  This was only mere superstition as I found myself laughing at loud rediscovering the Babel fish  the true story of the dolphins and the answer to life  the universe and everything However  I didn t quite like the two last chapters and that s why I have to take out 0 25 stars  but that won t stop me from reading the next one   Fabulous  Absolutely amazing  Not only is it hilarious with almost every sentence  but it is also a rather inspired commentary on the human race s egomania  Many readers tend to think  hmm    Funny   but fail to consider the profound depth contained in the series  and especially this book  Adams has a very tight grasp of the functions of the universe  and essential teaches readers to reach one of the highest forms of enlightment  extreme unimportance  I loved the sense of humour and Adams  writing style  The book brightened up my day  This is the book that spawned the BBC television series of the same name and later a movie  I remember the television program  an irreverent parody of science fiction done in the offbeat and whacky Monty Python style  Listening to this book some thirty five years after it was published  I was astonished to discover how contemporary the story is  Yes  great humor is timeless but even more so   The HitchHiker s Guide to the Galaxy  still has relevant messages about life that are brilliantly comic and absurdly profound What amazed me most was the mind of Douglas Adams  a fascinating and often troubled creative soul who left this world before he was fifty years old  For all its seeming craziness  The HitchHiker s Guide to the Galaxy is surprisingly deep in philosophical observation and wonderfully complete in its multi dimensional story telling This is a short book  full of fun and humorously posed life questions  I found it both mentally refreshing and laughingly enjoyable  It was a real treat to listen to a writing genius at play Here s a link to a free audio book version on YouTube https   www youtube com watch v 6pI4X   Approximate listening time  5 40 hoursNarrator  Dennis Bateman  Excellent and Funny   A hilarious little book that succinctly explains the entire universe     Cracked me up   This story was so humorous  pretty much every single page made me laugh for some reason or another  The characters are very colorful and fun and most have hilarious dialogue  It does end very abruptly  however  so I would recommend having the next book ready to read for once one finishes this first book  Like getting hit upside the head with a slice of lemon wrapped around a gold brick  Loved    Listened to Stephen Frye reading it and it was wonderful  I love the mix of absurdity and literalism  A masterpiece I could stop there  After re reading this just this past week  I m curious to go back and find out just why Adams had an obsession with digital watches  and if there were other allegorical elements to the book  like the extreme aversion to bureaucrats  Vogons   He even gives them really ugly faces  and explains how their poetry can literally kill you  That s a serious hate I originally read this in the 9th grade  and now I feel I can appreciate this book so much more  If you have only seen the 2005 movie  understand that it is not based on the same storyline  As far as I know  each time this story was adapted  it took on a different character  The Producer of the film apparently cleared that up  The script we shot was very much based on the last draft that Douglas wrote    All the substantive new ideas in the movie   are brand new Douglas ideas written especially for the movie by him    Douglas was always up for reinventing HHGG in each of its different incarnations and he knew that working harder on some character development and some of the key relationships was an integral part of turning HHGG into a movie  If you are a fan of the film  you ll be pleased to know that Stephen Fry  the voice of the Guide in the movie  has also narrated a most excellent version of this book  which I was given as a gift  I need to go thank that person again  Adams etait definitivement un genie  et j ai tres hate de recuperer les quatre autres tomes de la trilogie  Foi um livro muito bom  No comeco eu sempre parava de ler no primeiro capitulo  mas acho que foi culpa minha mesmo  Nao estava sentindo  sabe   Mas assim que tive um momento  li consideravelmente rapido  E um livro cheio de non sense  um humor diferente  que pode estranhar alguns  mas me tira umas otimas risadas  E meu tipo de humor  hehe  Comecei a amar todos os personagens e achei engracado  pois na narrativa sentia que eu amava mais os personagens do que o narrador   mesmo ele sendo narrador observador  intruso talvez  nao lembro   Morri de amores pelo Arthur  Acho que todos nas verdades sao diferentes em seu jeitinho  A construcao de mundo tambem e bem feita  eu amei Esse livro ta no meu coracao  3 A great fun read  satirical  prophetic and funny  laugh out loud  I loved Marvin  so reminiscent of Eeyore  I so admire lunacy translated into humour  An inspiration if not a road map  It was a hilarious and fun book  It made funny analogies like  The Spaceships hung in the air just the way bricks don t   I loved the excerpts from the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy like  Definition of the Marketing division of the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation  A Bunch of Mindless jerks who are the first against the wall when the Revolution comes   The Humor of this book was outstanding  It captivated the reader and explained every detail  It is a weird book so be ready for the weirdness  It is definitely a great Science Fiction book   I don t really need to extoll the virtues of this book   and like many people  I m revisiting the story for yet another time  This time  though  I took the wonderful audiobook route  mainly because this edition was narrated by Stephen Freaking Fry I now understand why they used him as the voice over in the movie version   recently there was an argument about who was the better narrator of the Harry Potter Books   Stephen Fry  who narrated the UK edition  or Jim Dale  who narrated the US edition  No contest   I have previously seen the 2005 film adaptation of this book series starring Martin Freeman  and was surprised at how different the book is  I thought that the film was just based on the first book but after reading it  I found this was not the case and that a lot of the details from the book were missing from the film  The plot of the book was really interesting and I was hooked in straight away by the beautifully eloquent writing style  It reminded me of the way that Stephen Fry writes in it s complexity  yet was entirely manageable  which made this an overall quick and highly enjoyable read  I really liked the shortness of the chapters as it made the plot flow well and even though some of the chapters were all about the back story of particular planets or species that the reader is introduced to  and are written in a very scientific way  they were understandable and helped build the environment that Douglas Adams was trying to create in a way that gives the reader just enough background information to build a full picture in their imagination whilst reading  The characters that are created really bring this book to life  I really love Arthur Dent  our protagonist  with his very human way of approaching the situation  as well as Marvin the paranoid android  as he just adds such a contrast to the otherwise light hearted story Overall I would definitely give this book 5 out of 5 stars and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys science fiction literature  or has only ever seen the 2005 film  I will definitely be carrying on with this series and am looking forward to reading about these characters again  Is there anything about this book that is not to love From the first day I picked it up 10 years ago  and my best friend gave me an odd look saying  are you really going to read that   I knew that this book would be right up my alley Douglas Adam s sense of humor is right up my alley  His style is quick paced  quirky  and sometimes downright confusing  but that is the beauty and appeal of his writing  It is his own style  and I haven t found another writer that can make me laugh in the manor that Adam s can  Great humor and sci fi fantasy fiction  Um engracadissimo livro simples cheio de satiras sobre muitas coisas do cotidiano e ate mesmo do existencialismo humano  Vale muito a pena ler este livro porque alem de personagens caricaturando nossos comportamentos mais estranhos  depressao  loucura e estresse   situacoes inusitados que fazem nossa barriga doer de tanto rir  o autor ainda consegue nos alfinetar com sua visao critica de algumas questoes fundamentais da vida  morte  vida  religiao  tempo e espaco   Fique curioso e leia e diversao garantida                                                                                 A very funny simple book with a lot of satires about everyday things and even about human existentialism  Worth reading this book because beyond of characters caricaturing our strangest behaviors  depression  madness and stress   unexpected situations that make our belly ache of too much laughing  the author yet can prick us with his critic vision of fundamental points of the life  death  life  religion  time and space   Be curious and read it s guaranteed fun   Okay  this book is hilarious  This whole set of books is hilarious  actually  so don t stop with just the first one  But it s great  and I loved it  It was one of those that you couldn t put down  not only because you wanted to know what would happen  I had seen the movie first  not altogether the same  but I wasn t hanging on the plot with bated breath because of it   but because the humor and the storytelling just made you feel so light and happy that you didn t want to stop  It s a great alternative to happy pills  Just saying  The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy is the greatest book of all time  One cannot argue this fact without reading the book  and after reading the book  one instantly loves it  It is impossible to dislike this book  One owes it to oneself to read this story  as it is outstandingly comical When introduced to this book  I was hesitant at first  fearing a boring  cheesy sic fi  However  after reading this story  I realized why so many before me have read and loved this book Adams has created a whole joke universe which has replaced millions of peoples favorite numbers with 42  and the subtle humor for which one must pay attention is for the true comedians  who can recognize a joke where no other can  And accompanied by the brutal irony on the first three chapters  this is a true work of art Sorry Picasso Adams captures the true essence of confusion for someone who has just gone out into the universe for the first time and has no idea what is actually happening because he makes so many obscure references  none of which had ever been heard by any humans prior to this book This is the science fiction that forever changed science fiction  After this book is read  one is never truly the same So  for Mr  Adams  who so graciously changed the way we see the universe  the color blue  and of course the number 42  read this book  The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy No matter how many times I read this book  it makes me laugh  it s very clever  funny  with a great turn of phrase  and it even has a basic plot  which tops more books than it should of late  and as an added bonus I can read it in 2 hours while in a newborn baby tiredness fog  so I have a sense of achievement    Love it    This book has made its way onto my favorite list  I read this on my flight to and from miami and I could not stop giggling at this book  Plus the writing style was wonderful and there was never a part of this book that slowed down or I was bored of  I can t wait to read the rest of this series  After reading this book  now I know what is the Ultimate Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life  the Universe  and Everything  Utterly delightful  Fry was perfect and why didn t anyone tell me how perfect Adams  writing is before now  OH goodness  what can i say  it is douglas adams just beign douglas adams  that would be awesome  of course  Highly recommended book from the very beginning to the end it keeps you entertained  The characters mr adams created give and extra life sense to the book  The science fiction space community ideas are brilliant  the other creatures  to put in a way are intriguing  If you want to laugh and have some very smart jokes and arguments well this is the book for you  His style is really nice also  The book has really small chapter so if you start you won t be able to stop  I felt the book is a very bit too short  but that is fine  there are others of this same author  One of the things i loved the most is marvin  although he appears little in the book If you want to go into a really fun adventure well then read this book and have a good time  When Arthur Dent s house is threatened to be destroyed  and his friend Ford Prefect is not at all concerned  it s immediately obvious something is not right  Ford s methods in a time of crisis seemed to be unconventional at the least  and his methods had always been this way  Arthur  still concerned about his house  has no idea about the impending danger lying in wait  As it turns out  Ford s ideas would help the two to survive the explosion of our earth  Over the course of time on Earth  other intelligent life had developed in other parts of the universe  faster and farther than us  This is the story of Arthur Dent s adventure discovering the wonders of the galaxy and universe The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams is a comedy  but yet thought provoking with many statements that get through proving a few of Adams  main themes  The main point Adams tries to get across  is that at the end of something good  comes the beginning of something better  Adams solidifies this idea by making the adventures of Arthur better than the known life of Dent  He understands more about himself than before because of his new knowledge  The other main idea Adams puts across is that nothing should ever be taken too seriously  This was a fantastic read  keeping you entertained with humor and thoughtful storyline  A hilarious adventure  Highly recommended It will probably sound silly to you  but this book changed the way I see world    in many meaningful ways  It also opened my mind to things I suspected  but refused to accept for one reason or another  Third time reading  Still amazing   Steeped in wacky brilliance  all of Adams  books manage to weave together the blandly mundane and the fantastic in such a way that we can t help but notice the most ridiculous and routine aspects of our own tiny behavior and the most exciting and stimulating mysteries of the huge and beautiful world s  around us   Great ride  really different and stimulating No words can possibly describe this book  My first thought as soon as I finished it was  Why the hell don t I own the next book   It was completely  utterly ridiculous and purely amazing and simply supermegafoxyawesomehot  I was hoping for some deep  lengthy review on this book  but no words are able to describe it  None  It s just simply amazing  Where has this book been all my life And why have I waited so long to read it  I am so mindblowingly amazed by the genius and cleverness of this author  I can t put thoughts into words right now  SO  GOOD        Fun  quirky  whimsical  I loved the movie as well  I love this book     Love it  love it  love it Especially love listening to the audiobook  read by the author  Especially during road trips with friends or family  subjecting them to my idea of a good time  hopefully converting them to Hitchhiker lovers as well  Read it again recently in Portuguese  listened to it actually   I still enjoyed it immensely  but found it tough to follow in a foreign language due to his unique and quirky use of language  Definitely going to have to read it again in English after I get through Eoin Colfer s addition to the trilogy  A billion years late to the Hitchhikers party  I finally whizzed through this very witty book which so cleverly pokes fun at human beliefs and traditions  The universe and journey through it is massively fantastical and brilliant for it    I always excitedly looked forward to settling down and having my imagination transported to the other side of the galaxy for some light relief  Most favourite of all is his nonchalant mentions of very levelly British names amongst the ridiculous  Scunthorpe  tea and the creator of the very worst poetry in the universe  Paula Nancy Millstone Jennings of Sussex Remember   It is an important and popular fact that things are not always as they seem  Absolutely brilliant Hilarious  stupid  insightful  laughable   a must read  I must have read Hitchhiker s at least five times  Probably more  And every single time  it s just as hilarious as the first time I picked it up  completely unwitting  and found myself diving headlong into this outrageous misadventure alongside poor Arthur Douglas Adams has woven an utterly engrossing tale that is  at all times  magnificently outlandish  uproariously funny  and also stands as a humorously scathing commentary on the State of Things  It never disappoints  every single page contains gems of comedic brilliance that have me sporfling coffee all over myself every time  And it s a story that is so perfectly ridiculous  so rapidfire rampaging through the galaxy fun  and so subtly poignant  that I never want it end  And when it does  I can t wait to pick it up and start all over again Hitchhiker s has become the literary equivalent of my comfort food  Whenever my life goes to shit  or the world gets me down  I curl up in bed with my tattered and dog eared old copy and set off again with Arthur  Ford  Zaphod and Trillian  And suddenly everything seems all right again  Because at least I know where my towel is  Imaginative  I cannot believe this was written more than 30 years ago  It s hilarious  I love the author s tone and personality  and I adore so many of the ideas presented in this book  such as dolphins just saying  peace out  right before the Earth blows up or the idea of an organic computer  This author predicts a lot of the future correctly   touch screens  etc  I m looking forward to finishing the  trilogy   Wow  apparently I never added this to my shelves  but I ve read it years ago  Hysterically funny and amazingly imaginative  It s my dad s favourite book and I can see why  Definitely a must read  Totally loved this book when I first read it in high school  It s like a head first plunge into British wit and humor that accompanied Monty Python and The Young Ones so well  I reread it recently and still found it enjoyable  surprising and just as vividly crazy as I did all those years ago  Adams weaves a wild ride of a story that takes place in so many corners of the universe and with so many completely goofy characters and unimaginable weapons and devices that your head might well spin right off  But trust me  that s a good thing  Don t panic   Look I had a degree in astrophysics it was either this or back to dole que on Monday  First read this book when I was around 13  loved it then and still love it now  Brilliantly funny  most of all I love the fact that in Adams space travel is still regulated by the people who make sure there s five different warning diagrams on the side of stepladders  the section where Arthur s struggles with the local council is juxtaposed alongside the vogons is pure genius   So  I ve seen the BBC series  the movie  and listened to a little of the old radio show  but decided that it was time to finally read the books  This first of five was excellent  Adams gets such good social commentary through in his comedy and otherworldly situations  after recently finding out that he and I share many worldviews  I felt a real connection to reading his work while keeping them in mind  Can t wait for the rest  This is the greatest novel ever written   A fun adventure Classic  I like walking around the house and randomly spout some of the characters names in place of curse words  they fit quite nicely I do like to add  The absurdity of this story is one that I love to get wrapped up in  there should be much more sci fi mixed in with off the wall comedy in this world  And I can t tell you how many passwords that I ve seen over the years involve  don t panic  and I just chuckle and move along   It s unpleasantly like being drunk  What s so bad about being drunk  Try asking a glass of water    Got to honest  nearly put this book down after the first 30 or so pages So glad I didn t  definitely gets better as it goes on  absolutely loved it  can t wait to rid the rest of the  Trilogy  When I was growing up during the 1980s  I had heard of this book and immediately associated it with weirdness  and not the kind that attacts one that was growing up during the 1980s  Youth has its benefits  but rarely is taste on of them Maybe its me  maybe its the increasingly fragmented post modern world that we live in  or maybe I ve finally come to understand the timelessness of Douglas Adams  but this book is an amazing work of art that should be included in the annals of the category  Masterpiece  alongside Shakespeare  There were times  as I was reading  that I commented to myself regarding some of the sentences and dialogue   God  Shakespeare is easier to read than this is  In short  there s nothing like it  Seriously  there s nothing like this storyline  If you haven t read it  read it  So long and thanks for all the fish  http   www youtube com watch v ojydNb    Re reading the trilogy at the moment  still some of my favorites books  grab yout towel   Hilarious and intelligent  imaginative and endearing  I could run out of superlatives because this is plain brilliant  and the lack of answers just adds to the overall charm  It s the kind of book I can read over and over again  Scifi doesn t have to be dramatic or profound all the time  sometimes it can just be downright confusing with a lot of laughs and that is exactly why I love this book so much   Isn t it enough to see that a garden is beautiful without having to believe that there are fairies at the bottom of it too     Ford Prefect long sigh  The Hitchhicker s Guide to the Galaxy is so many degrees of genius and brilliant  it s hard to know where and how to start describing it It s unique  unorthodox  thought provoking  mind bogglingly inventive  downright hilarious  and these are just some of the words popping into my head as I recall the events of Chapter 1 The Hitchhicker s Guide to the Galaxy is the story of a book  But not just any book  of course  The most awesome  most remarkable guide ever spewed by the minds of the galaxy s carbon based  or not  life forms It s the story of Earth and of its destruction  yes  sadly our dear old planet is very early on demolished to make way for a hyperspace bypass  go figure    of its sole human survivor  Arthur Dent  of his soon discovered to be an alien and contributing writer to The Hitchhicker s Guide friend Ford Prefect  of Ford s cousin  Zaphod Beeblebrox  who is none other than the  slightly unconventional  President of the Imperial Galactic Government  of Zaphod s girlfriend Trillian  a human who long ago figured her double degree in Maths and astrophysics had more chances of employment outside Earth  and of Marvin  the perpetually depressed and sarcastic robot It s also the story of a ship theft  The most amazing ship ever built to date  capable of crossing vast interstellar distances in a mere nothingth  yes   nothingth  is a very used word throughout the book so get used to it  of a second  and how the ship brought together Arthur  Ford  Zaphod  Trillian and Marvin and sent them on the adventure of their lives In between  there are also unfriendly aliens with a knack for reciting poetry  an existentialist whale  a thinking bowl of petunias  a planet where custom built planets are made for astronomical sums of money  imagine a custom planet made of solid gold    a couple of very demanding and somewhat unreasonable mice  and the ever ongoing quest for The Ultimate Question and Answer of Life  the Universe and Everything But above all  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is the story of how the universe  and anyone and anything in it  is frankly just absurd  A joke really  there s no soft way of putting it  And that if we spent our lives more often enjoying it for what it is and not trying to find deep or spiritual meaning in everything  from a sunset to a dog s sneeze  we might be able to enjoy our fleeting existences in this vast universe a lot more than we actually do      It s a really funny book  to the point you should think twice before reading it near other people  You might crack up so loud and fast others might think you re in need of medical assistance  Adams  humor is witty and to the point  You might end up not enjoying all of the characters in the book  but it is very hard not to fall in love with their sense of the ridiculous    I m sure the book has flaws  many readers at least seem to have pointed some out   but my current love for it is still clouding my mind to any weak spots   I have a feeling this love affair will last a long time though    I will never look at my towel the same way again  I can t say enough  Douglas Adams has mastered the art of dry  ironic humor  So far  I ve talked to people who love the book  and people who hate it  there seem to be no  it s OK  people  Interesting  I will definitely keep the rest of the series on my list  It has been ages since I read this so when I found the audiobook version  read by the very funny Stephen Fry  I could resist giving it another go  What a hoot  Ik heb het boek 20jaar geleden gelezen  Nu herbeluister ik het  Het was weerom prachtig  Hoe Adams je verplicht om de wereld te relativeren en onze homocentristische wereldvisie te herzien De wereld is maar een computer gebouwd door wezens uit een hogere dimensie die niets beters wisten te bedenken  Het wordt vernietigd omdat het in de weg zat voor een intergalactische snelweg  So good  One of my summer intern friends  2001  at Lehigh University in PA loaned me the whole Hitchhiker s Guide series when he found out I had never read it  It was hilarious  I really liked the movies too  Definitely a must read if you re getting into Sci Fi  are a nerd  or just plain hate bureauocracy   There s an alien race that is a satire on British queues and some people s obsession with filling out forms in triplicate  etc   Anyway  GOOD TIMES  Read this book   The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is a fascinating book about space travel and worlds beyond our own  The story follows Arthur Dent  who is one of the only survivors of the Earth s destruction  The Earth is destroyed to construct a superhighway through space  Arthur is taken off the Earth by Ford Perfect  who takes him on a journey through space  On their journey  they meet Zaphod Beeblebrox  the president of the galaxy  With him  they continue their journey  This is definitely one of the most unique book I ve ever read  Overall  I recommend that anyone reading this review give this book a read  Its story is compelling  and you never will get bored while reading the book  There are plenty of quirks that make this book so unique  such as little entries meant to go in the real Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  Almost as good as fish  I first saw this book in middle school and wanted to read it  I think put it off  Then i my husband and one of my Best friends talked about it constantly  especially when the movie came out  Still didn t pick up the book  Why  for varies reasons  ironically i did something similar with piers Anthony  and kept it on my pile  So what do i think about his book  Well i think i read the prolog three times in a row because it was that funny  This book is a fun adventure that throws random stuff at you and then later ties in up  the crew of the Heart of Gold are quirky  My favorite is Marvin  who i could not help but read it in alan rickmens voice  even though i pretty much knew the whole story going in  it still was amazing read  take someone that hasn t really watched the movie and have them read this  they would fall in love  This was the prefect book to come back to syfy with   Deliciosamente ironico  tremendamente original y lleno de humor  Al leer esta novela una no puede evitar acordarse de las novelas de los Monty Phtyon  tienen la misma esencia  Un ex presidente corrupto esquizoide con dos cabezas  un robot maniaco depresivo  un extarrestre llamado Ford Prefecty dos humanos son los protagonistas de esta historia que SEGURO te hara reir Pd  La unica pega es que la historia en si era menos de la mitad del libro  el resto era informacion sobre la pelicula y entrevistas con los actores    AMAZINGLY FUNNY One of the best books of the 20th century  right up their with Lord of the Rings  They stumbled out of the Heart of Gold and looked around them  It was very quiet among the tall buildings  The ground was covered with brightly colored objects that  from a distance  looked a little like paperback novels  Trillian picked one up  It s a paperback novel   she said  surprised   Long Hard Ride  by Lorelei James   She flipped through it   Hm  who d have thought that the late inhabitants of Frogstar Z would have been into women s erotica  She picked up some more   Be With Me  by Maya Banks    Dangerous Secrets  by Lisa Marie Rice    A Little Harmless Pleasure  by Melissa Schroeder  They re all women s erotica The rest of this review is available elsewhere  the location cannot be given for Goodreads policy reasons   So much fun in one book     Always a good one One of the funniest books I ve ever read  I love Marvin the most  a seriously depressed robot who saves the day is my kind of character  This book has wormed itself into my brain  Sometimes I find myself mumbling DON T PANIC in terrifying situations  Also  I have the intense desire to perversely answer 42 to everything because of this book And to bring a towel everywhere There s just some excellent lines and ideas in this book  I love the sense of humor Adams has  His imagination  Love    The Answer to the Great Question    Of Life  the Universe and Everything    Is    Forty two   said Deep Thought  with infinite majesty and calm    amazing book This book was always somehow present and known to me  like the answer to the universe and stuff  but I had never actually read it  now I decided I d pick it up  and I m hooked  it s a very good book full of fantasy and worlds that seem very different but at the same time very similar to ours  it doesn t get boring at all  I ve read through it in one and a half hours without wanting to pause  it has a reason this book is so successful     Very amusing and a pleasure to read  5      BUY   SAVORFIRST of all  who wants to join me in concocting a glass of Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster Douglas Adams spins a mighty funny intergalactic tale that draws in highly unimaginative people like me  I find out that this was originally a radio comedy  which is why the storytelling plays out like a movie in my head  You know  something I don t have to imagine because I see it in front of me  I wonder why it has taken me this long to pick up his book I loved every single description  and the characters  Oh  to be four kinds of stupid as the cleverly brilliant Zaphod  Instead i am often just one kind  the last kind  And oh  to be as snootily sassy as Marvin and Deep Thought  Well  I shall find me a host of kindred spirits to go hang out at the Restaurant at the End of the Universe  and read Vogon Poetry  and gouge our eyes out while drinking Pan Galactic Gargle Blasters  makes you think about a lot of stuff  Hitchhiker s is a classic  and a perfect model for it s ilk in literature  A parody of the foibles of  life  instead of mankind it is  but much more  Filled with truly mind expanding concepts woven with comedic hyperbole  H2G2 follows the adventures of Everyman Arthur Dent as he is forced into the cosmos with only a housecoat  Salaciousness is kept to a minimum  so the humor never becomes crude or a strain for the reader  Enjoy dear friend   Tasteful and great comedy fills the pages this wonderful masterpiece  Few novels have ever made me laugh out loud and this is one of them  Science fiction and comedy seems an unlilkely pair but Adams Douglas has suceeded spectacularly in bringing out their hidden synergy  I haven t enjoyed a book this much in a long while  So fun  Like reading Monty Python  This book was completely different that I thought it would be  but not in a bad way  I love the sort of British humor that involves completely outlandish characters and plots and this book does a pretty good job of it  I highly recommend the audio version as well  Any book read in a British accent is better  I found it very sad that we prematurely lost Douglas Adams in 2001 at the age of only 49  I read the Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy when it was first distributed in the U S  and I still remember how much I enjoyed his droll  humorous  and sometimes just silly approach to science fiction  I read all the subsequent books in this series  as well as his others  and enjoyed them all immensely  Over the years  his prose has permeated the vernacular  Just think how many people respond with  42   when you ask them  What is the Answer to Life  the Universe and Everything   So read this  and all the books in the series  enjoy and  Don t Panic   Amaaaaaaaazing  42 Well  it s one of the classics isn t it  I always wanted to know why  so I picked it up  My synopsis  This Douglas Adams guy may be on to something I don t believe I ve ever laughed as hard at a book as I have this one  If you re a sci fi enthusiast  love british comedy  and really know where your towel is    then this book is for you File this book under  All Time Favorites  and call it a day  Absolutely adored it  The writing style took a moment to get used to  there was repetition  but after keeping with it I realized it was an intentional literary device  I laughed out loud at so many moments  What can I say that hasn t already been said about this masterpiece of science fiction  fantasy  humor  and just plain brilliance  Not much but I can say that this book will never grow old for me  I ve read it countless times  listen to the audio book read by Stephen Fry over and over  and laugh every time at the appropriate parts  and at some of the inappropriate ones  The Hitchhiker s Guide is a book that fans of fiction in general should at least try  I m sure it s not for everyone though  There are several sections of the book that are confusing to say the least but I love that about this book and the entire series  It is one of my top ten favorite books and I am sure it will always remain there  If you read this and don t like it  at least you can go away with a few interesting facts such as how useful a towel is  how to hitchhike the galaxy for less than thirty Altarian dollars a day  who the smartest beings on Earth actually are  the purpose of Earth  and the answer to life  the universe  and everything  And let s not forget Vogon poetry  the Infinite Improbability Drive  Marvin  Arthur  Ford Prefect  and Thursdays  Just read it  An amusing  and quick  experience  and an easy way to inflate my total number of books for the 2015 Goodreads Challenge   Long on my to read list  made all that much more easy to get through thanks to 5 5 hour audiobook read by Stephen Fry  Do you know a better way to pass the workday than by listening to Stephen Fry read a book  Because I don t  Of course  it wouldn t nearly be as enjoyable without Mr  Adams  Pythonesque take on space  time and the meaning of life  But everyone else has read it already  so there s really nothing else for me to add   Wonderful read Having only seen the film  I wasn t sure what to expect  I got a ton of enjoyment out of this book and cannot wait to read the next installment  The only complaint was I read it too fast  Funny and imaginative  Plus  I think my life is similar to that of Arthur Dent  everyone around me seems insane  and they all seem to agree that their nonsensical world view makes sense  I need more Douglas Adams like people to come into my lilfe  I read all his books in less than 2 days  One the greatest syfy books to have been written  Everyone should read this book  its strange  exciting  fun and well worth any time and money invested into it  Fun Reading this book entails one simple yet intricate factor which many books  similar to it  fail to accomplish  Creativity  Well  no that isn t exactly right  It entails a myriad of factors which make it unique  and a tad bit eccentric  The comedic intervals of the story kept the book perpetually entertaining and refreshing  whenever things seemed to feel prolonged  which rarely happened  a simple quote or action  of comedic value  would lighten the entire atmosphere of the chapter  making it feel ever the more rewarding when you reached the end  Another word   bizarre  can be connotated to this book  the answer to life  the highest level of intelligence on Earth  and the absurdly    coincidental    improbabilities in the story are all understated by the yet another word  mindboggling  This is the first book I ve read of Douglas Adams  and it surely won t be the last  If you ve ever wondered  or even fathomed the irregularities of life  by any means  this book is for you  This book in a lot of ways was my introduction to science fiction and I absolutely loved it  Sometime we don t always have to make sense  and sometimes the stories we read don t need to have things make any sense either  but sometimes that s all we need  just some good old fashion nonsensical fun and imagination  If you thought that maybe common sense was the only way to create a book  then you obviously need stop living under your crummy old rock and read some real creativity The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy by Adam Douglas  is probably considered on of the greatest science fiction books of all time  and for one very good reason  it doesn t make any sense  The Earth being destroyed for a galactic freeway  aliens that torture people with their poetry  depressed robots  spaceships with the power of improbability  there is nothing in this book that follows the laws of physics or nature  but that s what makes it so brilliant  because it goes beyond the normal creativity of literature and turns it into a mind boggling star swirling treasure trove of lovable characters and plot devices  Adam obviously knew that what he was doing didn t make any sense  but then again  he knew exactly what he was doing My only complaint was that the book was too short  sure it was part of a trilogy  but the book was only about 250 pages long  and some of the chapters were shorter than others  some spanning only two pages  I thought that maybe Adam could have created more places for our heroes to travel too  more crazy humans or more other worldly devices  but I suppose those are only nitpicks Overall  I give the book 4 5 5  it was a great piece of literature that I truly recommend to all readers of sci fi or just plain readers  This is one of the funniest stories I have ever read  Well written  intriguing characters  with a plot that doesn t slow down  It s truly a classic  Highly recommended  I don t really know how to begin to review this book since all words seem to fail me  I found this book rather odd in the sense that there seemed to be no aim to it  no impending quest or foreseeable future other than surviving the immeasurable  well actually quite measurable with the a computer that can calculate an improbability drive which is voiced by a rather too cheerful computer called Eddie  odds that is often against the earth man Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect This book is rather nonsensical  the things that happen and keep happening seem to make no sense what so ever and have no real logic  at least to the third smartest being on planet earth  The first being     well mice  While it might seem very strange  Adams writes this book in a way that is so logical that you could not help but reexamine your intelligence in comparison to the mice in your life I found this book entertaining and at times I found myself laughing out loud many times  The book is written in satirical manner with everything from God to    the meaning of the universe and everything   which happens to be 42  Adams has included improbability drive spaceship called  The heart of Gold   a manically depressed robot with genuine people s personality  an alien man with three arms and two heads  and so many other rather ridiculous creations that make this book such a freaking delight to read I LOVED this book and when I say I actually mean this is officially my new favorite book  even more than the Fellow Ship of the Ring which I am currently reading I give this book 5 out of 5 cupcakes and a a very big recommendation for anyone who loves books  I will admit I was skeptical  because I ve never been interested in sci fi  However  the humor and perspective in this story make it a great read  I d recommend it to anyone Favorite quotes     he never appeared to have a reason for anything he did at all  he had turned unfathomably into an art form  He attacked everything in life with a mixture of extraordinary genius and naive incompetence and it was often difficult to tell which was which      pg 111    and a long sullen silence settled over a billion hungry worlds  disturbed only by the pen scratchings of scholars as they labored into the night over smug little treatises on the value of a planned political economy      pg 116 What the photon is it     pg 124 Oh  the Paranoid Android       pg  136    Brockian Ultra Cricket  a curious game which involved suddenly hitting for no readily apparent reason and then running away        pg 166 Molest me not with this pocket calculator stuff     pg 168    with the sort of grin that would get most people locked away in a room with soft walls     pg 190 This book was a real big adventure  yea  That s it  The most hilarious read I ve ever had  I m looking forward to finishing the rest of this series   It was great  I really want to read the rest of the series sometime  OK  I ve read this many times since I was a teenager  and it s difficult to give this anything other than five stars  What I did enjoy this time round  first time in about a decade I reckon  was despite being able to practically recite large chunks of the book  finding new jokes or others much funnier  So while aged 14 the thoughts of the whale was the funniest thing in the book  and possibly ever   this time round I was laughing on the train with the bureaucratic procedures of the planning   indeed talking about this at work  another colleague could recite this by memory word for word And that s what s great about it   it s as much a series of sketches  with far more hits than any flatter ones   and the sort of book that stays fresh with repeated readings  At this age  a great mixture of funny and comfort reading  OK  so some bits may look slightly strange to first time readers on a kindle  the sci fi of the guide is heading towards retro  But Don t Panic  It s still ace  I m confused  I m confused and interested in the best of ways   Don t Panic        most of the people living on it were unhappy for pretty much all of the time  Many solutions were suggested for this problem  but most of these were largely concerned with the movement of small green pieces of paper  which was odd because on the whole it wasn t the small green pieces of paper that were unhappy   Time is an illusion  Lunchtime doubly so    Space   it says     is big  Really big  You just won t believe how vastly  hugely  mindbogglingly big it is  I mean  you may think it s a long way down the road to the chemist s  but that s just peanuts to space      Life  Don t talk to me about life   Forty two    The Answer to the Great Question  of Life  the Universe and Everything     man had always assumed that he was more intelligent than dolphins because he had achieved so much    whilst all the dolphins had ever done was muck about in the water having a good time  But conversely  the dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent than man  for precisely the same reasons   Mostly harmless   What can I say  other than that this is one of my all time favorite books  Whenever I feel down in life  I pick up this classic  and I automatically feel better  It s funny and clever  and just so incredibly smart and wonderful that my soul just feels giddy as I read it  This is one of those books that I want to highlight almost every line to revisit and enjoy over and over again  I d highly recommend this book to anyone  because I think almost anyone will enjoy it  I can t tell you how much I LOVE this book  My dad first introduced me to the story in his darkroom  as we listened to the BBC radio production of the HGTTG  After reading the book  the vivid images of the actors portraying a Vulgan captain jump into my head  I can t help but smiling   Tell me what you think of my poetry       absolutely wacky and fun  Witty humor and brilliant segways  I get all the references now haha  A great sci fi novel that everyone who just wants a good laugh and clever writing do pick this up  Don t take this seriously man it s a fun book  One Thursday at lunchtime the Earth gets unexpectedly demolished to make way for a new hyperspace bypass  For Arthur Dent  who has only just had his house demolished that morning  this seems already to be more than he can cope with  Sadly  however  the weekend has only just begun  and the galaxy is a very strange and startling place The Hitchhiker s Guide To The Galaxy is the first book within Douglas Adam s classic and well loved  trilogy in five parts  Hitchhiker s compendium This book is for anyone with a good sense of humour and for those who think they will never like science fiction  However  if dry British wit is not appealing to you  this book may not be your best choice There are four others in the trilogy  I know  I know   And Adams has also written a particularly funny couple of books about a holistic detective named Dirk Gently  well worth a read   9  fiction full of humor  original  interesting  positive  awareness  thinking out of the box A fast  hilarious read  This book is the most fast paced of all the Hitchikers series and it is a must read for those who love fantasy  science fiction and comedy  It s not actually a parody but a story in it s own right  but it parodies a lot of the themes inherent in science fiction  It s also endlessly quotable  The quirkiest science fiction ever written  Douglas Adams in his true genius style brings forwards all that s crazy and alien  Right from the first page where Earth is about to get demolished readers get a perspective of the  speckness  of our world making us ready for the hyper space jumps of Ford Prefect and Arthur dent  A sheer delight for fans of science fiction and dry British humor  Epic  Ever since I have picked up a copy of the HHTG I have been a sucker for Adams  ludicrous  and ridiculous  storytelling  This is a story that will make you laugh out loud in the most inconvenient places and at the most unwanted times  The book itself is wonderfully written  Adams sometimes pushes the language to its barriers  but comes out victorious every time  His skilfully crafted metaphors are a treat every time you stumble across them   view spoiler   The ships were floating in the sky in a way that bricks do not  is a wonderful example    hide spoiler  Sadly  the series loses some of its strength with every book  but never enough to give you the chance to put it down  All in all a fantastic start of one of the best series ever   I can summarize this book in two words  Brilliantly funny  This is yet another book I waited far too long to read  It was laugh out loud funny  I can only hope the others are half as good as this one   yay  This book is ridiculous and utterly amazing  I love his sense of humor  and his ability to be clever  Very good indeed I really need to read more of Douglas Adams  His writing is dense in the sense that a good percentage of his sentences are absolute jewels of humor  or cleverness  or profound but probably still humorous statements  and really need to be unpacked instead of just browsed over quickly  Because of this I don t know that I would ever get bored from re reading him  It s also easy to miss  unless you re actually paying attention instead of reading quickly and assuming guessing what is going to be said next   Fan fan fan fan fan fan  Douglas Adams is a fantastic  funny author who is a great world builder for his books  This was definitely no exception  The clever way he portrays the destruction of the planet and the characters  following adventure into the cosmos kept a smile on my face the whole way through  It was a pretty light read but certainly a funny one  I d easily recommend this book to anybody looking for something fairly short  of course  it has sequels  and definitely fun to read  Non so come mai non ho mai considerato questo romanzo prima d ora  Forse perche pensavo fosse solo fantascienza  e la fantascienza non e proprio un genere che amo Poi quasi per caso ho iniziato a leggerlo    e l ho finito in un soffio  E l ho adorato Solo una parola per descriverlo  GENIALE Non vedo l ora di proseguire con gli altri della serie  Despite recommendations  I had been putting off reading this  I am not a fan of tongue in cheek humor or absurd worlds and it had been likened to a couple of authors I did not find humorous  So  I was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked this  Arthur Dent is yanked off earth by his friend Ford Perfect  space alien  just before it is demolished to make way for a galactic highway  So begins an hilarious adventure hopping around space  joining up with a couple of thieves on the run and trying to solve the great questions of life  the universe and everything  Nothing is as it seems  I particularly liked Marvin the depressed robot  I burst out laughing several times and am looking to read the rest of the series   SPOILERS This is the first book that I have read for the new 2014 year  I have always heard more than great things about the Hitchhiker s books  So  I gave it a whirl  I still have the other 4 books to read   I like this book a lot  the characters are funny  Adam s talks about insanely absurd but relatable topics  For example  when he writes   Ford Prefect always found it hardest to understand about humans was their habit of continually stating and repeating the very obvious  as in  It s a nice day  or  You re very tall   I find Adams humor refreshing because he can still ask important questions  but he makes it humorous so we are intrigued  I find it hilarious that the Vogons destroyed Earth 5 minutes before the question to the almighty answer was revealed  I find it hilarious that once everyone knew the answer to the universe  42   they then needed to know the question  And then when they are that close to unleashing the correct question  the planet Earth  created solely for 10 million years just to unfold this Question  was suddenly destroyed by no purpose tyrannical Vogons Even if we had the question or the answer  could we interpret it or even use it  Well  I am going to begin The Restaurant at the End of the Universe  I ll let anyone who s listening know when I ve finished that one  Brilliant satire  Is a really good book   it envolves critics   crazy theories   science with the necessary ton of humor  Douglas Adams does an outstanding job of using the third person omniscient point of view  He never focuses on just one character  and just when you start to think he is  boom  he changes it  He has a unique sense of humor  that is vastly ranged  He makes jokes that some might say are  unethical   but they are nonetheless funny  I am not the kind of person that likes fictitious books  but this is one of my all time favorite books  This book will leave you begging for more  This is a must read for all science nerds  geeks  or enthusiasts  Lastly  always remember to bring your towel    Hephaestus  rating system  5 Stars  The book went above and beyond my expectations  delivering a tremendous literary understanding while not sacrificing the pacing of a compelling story 4 Stars  The book was everything I had hoped it would be  delivering a terrific story while not blowing my mind 3 Stars  The book was average   which does NOT mean bad  The book may have been well written  but the story was nothing special 2 Stars  The book was below average  It did not meet my expectations and was an unfortunate flop  I wouldn t read it again  but didn t necessarily hate reading it 1 Star  The book was the biggest letdown  It was not fun to read in the slightest  and may have even caused me to stop reading only partially through  This book is everything  and if you go your life with out reading it then you aren t really living  An absolute classic   Either one would put the book down in first few pages  or would be very engaged and continue page after page  The story is intricate  and beautifully woven  involving inter  intra galactic worlds  employing science and of course probability  D   you ll understand why I put that imoji while reading the book This sci fi book takes some of the major metaphysics questions  or at times put some  if deeply thought  in its own way    pertaining to cosmology  universe  epistemology in a humour  which is imaginative  innovative  and illuminating on the subject Right from addressing philosophical questions to attending idiosyncrasies of each character to the description of each one of them   in books lingua   is humorous  very humorous  really humorous  humorously humorous Not so famous reviewed facts  from the book  that comes to ones astonishment or curiosity 1  Mind it we earthmen are the third most intelligent beings on Earth  and not the most  and that too only on Earth   And universe also has some hyper intelligent beings  who we on Earth assume to be guinea pigs for our lab experiments 2  You might have had new improved earth with Africa having glaciers with elegantly sculpted contours  soaring pinnacles of ice  deep majestic ravines if by the stroke of destiny Earthman Arthur Dent died in the earth s reduction to infinite fragments  then drifting around in an empty space Atlast I think we on Earth also have people trained in Vogonian singing  poetry  no offence   D If you don t know about it  just Google  Vogon Poetry  Loved it   So funny   Like Monty Python in space  I won t say that The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is the  best  book I ve ever read  because it s admittedly not very literary    But it is one of the most entertaining books I ve ever read  and that has to count for something  right  Mind blowing     quite all the way Only a few books can make everyone laugh out loud while reading  This is one of those I must say I m in love with Douglas Adams  style of writing and his imagination   both simply unmatched  He indeed can beautifully bring out his characters  emotions   expressions to words And the fun part is     the whole book   the crafty  and some unpronounceable  names of the characters  their dialogues overflowing with stupidity  curiosity and childish stubbornness   blubber  the extraterrestrial  rather extra galactic  concepts  The Guide s bewildering definitions   everything drifts me to another parallel Universe And his peculiar manner of stretching the words  it makes it sooooooo easier to get drowned in the unimaginable outer space I am going to read this book again   and if I d not be satisfied even then  then perhaps thrice     and so on But it was after I finished this story  that I realized that Adams is not done with just one Hitchhiker s Too excited to read the other parts now  I loved this book  It was such a fast read for me  which is rare because I am a slow reader  There was no dull part o the book which is why I read it relatively fast  The book was so cleverly written  The dialogue was witty  the characters  places and history was creative and the overall story was outrageously ridiculous and hilarious  I can see why this book is spoken so highly of   What starts off as science gibberish  keeps growing on you with every turning page  Humorous  mysterious and thoroughly a great read  One of those books which makes you laugh out loud  Do not watch the movie  it sucks  read this book instead  My favourite author of all times is Douglas Adams and I can not say absolutely nothing negative about his entire work opus  If you want to laugh and be educated at the same time  read it  The words are so precise  chosen with such care  You can not believe the imagination of author  it feels like from another world  He makes fun of everything and everyone  but you really can not be offended  you can only laugh until you drop dead  I will only write in superlatives when it comes to Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  Hail to this book  ONE OF THE BEST SERIES I HAVE EVER READ  It s stupid  repetitive  enlightening  and stuffed with irony  hilarity  and unpredictability  This book follows no laws of literature and the last book shattered all trust I had of the unspoken promise between author and reader to not destroy every single character in the book  Sorry  spoilers  This is the absolute best  Fantastic language use  horrific fun So so so funny  I had no idea that this book was the origin of so many cultural references that I never really got until now  And right when I finished reading it  one of my friends brought a towel to a Halloween party and went as a hitchhiker  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams is a wacky  zany  hilarious story of the misadventures of a motley crew of interstellar hitchhikers  Arthur Dent  the protagonist  an average human from London  has his world turned upside down  and later destroyed  when he learns of the existence of aliens  Even more surprisingly  he learns that his longtime friend  Ford Prefect  is also an alien  Ford recently discovered that the Earth was scheduled to be demolished by the Vogon alien race in order to make space for an intergalactic highway  Just before the Earth is demolished  Ford manages to extract Arthur and himself from the Earth by hitching a ride with one of the passing Vogon ships  However  they are soon kicked off of the ship and left to die in deep space   Despite the astronomically improbable odds  the pair are picked up by a passing spaceship  Ford and Arthur make their way to the bridge  where they meet the crew of the ship  Coincidentally  the pilot was an old acquaintance of Arthur s  a girl whom he met at a party years earlier  The second person on the ship just happens to be Ford s cousin  Zaphod Beeblebrox  an egocentric  ridiculous alien from a planet orbiting Betelgeuse   Together  the crew sets out to find the ancient planet of Magrathea  Billions of years ago  Magrathea was the center of the galactic economy  The Magratheans specialized in personalized planet construction  They built custom made planets for the super rich  The only problem was that nobody now knew where Magrathea lay  and the story passed into the obscurity of legend  However  despite the odds  once again  they find the ancient planet nestled away in the Horsehead Nebula  After descending on the planet  Zaphod finds a way into the interior of the planet  where the Magratheans were believed to have lived  The group learns that the Earth was in fact commissioned by a race of super intelligent beings who  on Earth  took the form of white mice  The mice ran the planet in secrecy for billions of years  ever since the creation of the Earth In fact  the entire planet and everything on it was one huge supercomputer  designed to compute the answer to  Life  the Universe  and Everything   However  just seconds before the 5 billion year program was complete  the Earth was destroyed  Back on Magrathea  the group learns of this remarkable story  They set out once again  this time to help the Magratheans discover the meaning of  Life  the Universe  and Everything   Douglas Adams creates a universe full of wacky characters  incredible coincidences  and unbelievable events  The plot he weaves is incredibly detailed  and even the most insignificant event turns out to have a huge impact on the plot  I would recommend this book to anyone who loves a fun filled  interesting  riveting book  or anyone who is just looking for a good laugh  No matter what your preferences  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy delivers  Do not read in public  You ll look like an idiot guffawing out of the blue  This is the funniest stuff I ve ever read  and I was raised a Monty Python fanatic so you know where I m coming from  And it s a great story to boot  I ve read the 4 books in the trilogy  haven t read Mostly Harmless yet  Seriously I have been begged by friends to read The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy for years  I initially tried to watch the movie and got bored and never finished it years ago  This book is the equivalent of watching a dark comedy  I laughed out loud several times and though the lack of character development by the two leads  numerous information dumps  and the issue with reading the footnotes on my Kindle were problematic  I did not lower my rating for the book and just kept it at five stars For those that don t know  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy was created as a radio comedy broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 1978  it was later adapted to other formats  and over several years it gradually became an international multi media phenomenon The plot of this book is kind of all over the place but it works if you don t delve too deeply into things  The main characters are Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect  Arthur is an earthling from England and Ford is an alien who conducts research for The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  Along the way we meet some other characters but in my opinion Arthur and Ford are the two main characters  When we initially meet Arthur we have him arguing against having his house bulldozed and is whisked away by Ford  What happens afterwards is just a really good time I will just say that usually if a book had the problems I mentioned above I would rate it probably a 2 5 or 3  However  the dark comedy aspect of this book saves it  It goes from drama to humor and a fuse of both at certain times that you feel sad and then want to laugh First  we are pretty light in terms of character development for Arthur and Ford  I still don t get Ford s motivation to help and save Arthur  Also we don t really get a chance to know Arthur since we have so much other stuff happening Second  the book is broken up by excerpts from the Guide with explanations of aliens or terms  It was a clever way to info dump readers but after the first few times the novelty wore off Third  since I was reading this book via my Kindle there are some footnotes to this book that when I clicked on them took me right away to the footnote  However  when I would try to click back I couldn t  So I had to go back and find my place each and every time which got on my nerves This book was really funny to me and I enjoyed it  I know that there are additional books in this series and maybe when I have time I will read and finish them I love the original TV series of Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  it is something I grew up with and have watched multiple times  So much so that when reading the book in my head I read out the parts that are the same in both exactly as they are done in the show  Which made the bits that aren t in the show really stand out for me  However I enjoyed those bits too  as it gave insight into things such as minor characters thoughts like the council worker trying to knock down Arthur s house and how he was related to Genghis Khan  Basically this book can be summed up as absurd  hilarious and completely British  which are three of my favourite ways to describe things  There are times when Douglas Adams says quite profound things  or things that should be quite important such as the fact that Arthur and Ford  when going through every point in space in time as a result of being picked up by the improbability drive  startled some bacteria which jumped together and started life in the universe  But because this is not important to the immediate plot he just brushed over it in a couple of sentences  Which is great because Adams is inviting you to analyse and make deep meanings from his book  and there is a lot of social commentary in this book that is immensely insightful and relevant  and yet laughing at the same time at any attempt to make meaning of his book  Probably the funniest book I ve ever read  Well written  extremely inventive and short  which is better for this type of humorous novel  Well   I just finished reading the strangest book I ve ever read  Yes  it was a very good book with a whimsical  unique writing style   but at the same time  I ve never been so bewildered by a plot in my life The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is one of those peculiar novels that makes fun of its subject matter and yet is serious at the same time  Well  as serious as Douglas Adams can be  In this story  he makes jest at the core elements of science fiction  including space travel  aliens  distant planets  intergalactic war   and he tries to make the reader feel that they are ordinary and even rather silly  At the same time  he addresses philosophical questions that have haunted men for centuries  What is the meaning of life  What is my purpose  From whence did we all come  But his answers are rather more fanciful and imaginative than realistic    The story begins with the clumsy  unsettlingly normal Arthur Dent who is saved by his friend Ford Prefect just seconds before earth is demolished to create a galactic freeway  In truth  Prefect is a researcher for the newly revised Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  Together  they roam the galaxy with an unforgettable motley crew  including the president of the galaxy who has two heads and a clinically depressed robot named Marvin  Along the way  they escape from the torture of alien poetry  meet the man who designed Norway  find themselves interrogated by the smartest creatures in the universe    mice    All while searching for the question to the answer 42  If you want an enjoyable  witty read  I recommend that you pick up The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  Adams  expertise of taking a simple concept and giving it a new meaning is what has secured his book as one of the most exceptional science fiction novels of the twentieth century I definitely give if 5 stars for ingenuity     My favourite book of all time  Douglas Adams  you were a genius  we are not worthy  On the day of the demolition of the Earth  Arthur Dent was picked up from the planet by his friend  Ford Prefect  an alien researcher working incognito on the revised version of  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  The plot is rather simple  but I like the way the author  Douglas Adams  put the words together  they are sarcastic and funny  His writing style  along with complete nonsense  set the tone of the story  and somehow made sense  I was awestruck by the answer to the ultimate question  and I found it profound beyond human wisdom I really love this book  and definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys Sci Fi and humor  This is a rare chance to experience hitchhiking in the galaxy  and I wouldn t miss it for anything  can t stop LOL  I listened to this book rather than read it  I have done alot of reading during the Bout of Books readathon  and my poor eyes needed a break  I had actually read this book already  but it was years ago  and I wanted to relive it  I remember first watching the TV series with my Dad when I was very young  and I also remember being unimpressed with the movie when it came out  but nothing compares with the book The audiobook was read by Stephen Fry  and he was amazing  His voice is a pleasure to listen to  and he made the story come alive for me  This book is weird and wonderful  making me laugh out loud the whole way through  Douglas Adams was clearly mad  and I love him for it  This book will have you hooked from the chaos that is the end of the earth  to the improbability of finding a long lost planet  and all the way to the Answer to the Great Question of Life  the Universe and Everything If you are a stranger to this franchise  then pick up the book or the audiobook  It is a relatively short read   listen  and it will have you in stitches Whatever you do though  make sure you grab your towel  and don t panic  Douglas Adams brought introduced humor into science fiction with this first book in the series  It s well crafted  shrewdly hilarious look at the improbable journey of Arthur Dent and his well prepared friend  Ford Prefect  After earth is destroyed by space by pass  the main character ends up on a quest to regain his home planet with little more than the help of Ford s guide to the galaxy  You ll laugh and keep turning the pages and then want more   of which there is  This book is simply hilarious  It is silly  doesn t make too much sense  and one of the funniest books I ve read  Short too  which is always a plus   Comical  imaginative and ever so British  Who wouldn t want a cuppa tea on a spaceship   Arthur Dent was prepared for another ordinary day on Earth  So  when his day begins with contractors showing up to demolish his home to make way for a new bypass  he is ill equipped to deal with this emergency  However  when the Vogons show up shortly after to demolish our planet and make way for a new hyperspace bypass  Arthur begins to suspect that the Universe does in fact make sense  it s just not very friendly  Thus  Arthur finds himself traveling the galaxies in his bathrobe with his friend  Ford Prefect  who turns out to be from a planet around Betelgeuse and not from Guildford as he usually claimed  With a start like this  it s anybody s guess where Arthur will end up next  There is a theory which states that if anybody ever discovers exactly what the Universe is for and why it is here  it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable  There is another theory which states that this has already happened  This quote from book two in the excellent Hitchhiker series  Restaurant at the End of the Universe   nicely explains the entire series  Reading Douglas Adams is like trying to follow a mad little gnome through a vast three dimensional puzzle  There are so many levels to enjoy his works on  I hardly know where to start  I ve read the complete set  in hardback  more than once  and even read the whole first book out loud to another  Nor is this the only work by Mr  Adams that I have  also in hardback   I own the BBC mini series version  and find plenty of occasions in daily life where a handy Adams  quote suits the moment quite nicely  So you KNOW I m dedicated   or committable depending on your viewpoint  Wonko the Sane knows just where I m coming from  I m sure How can I NOT recommend this book  You learn the Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life  the Universe  and Everything  See God s Final Words to us in huge  flaming letters  Witness the destruction of Earth    more than once  Learn how to Fly  meet two minor deities  stop for a quick bite at the Restaurant at the End of the Universe  visit an alternate Earth  find out what really happened to Elvis  and explore all the eccentricities of human nature  as well as the galaxy at large This first in the series was an instant favorite with me for its dry wit and wonderful metaphors alone  Reading the whole set will give you a complete picture  and they should be read in order  although this may not necessarily make anything clearer  Douglas Adams was either a genius  or hopelessly insane    possibly both  You ll have to judge for yourself  as humor is a very subjective thing  For example  many of the finer points of British society aren t familiar to the majority of American readers  so they miss a lot of humorous moments or end up confused  Admittedly  Douglas Adams really did run on his track and really didn t find it necessary to make himself clear about much of anything    especially deadlines  While the potential for confusion is relatively high for a fantasy fiction novel  just remember     DON T PANIC   Eventually  things will work themselves out and become clear  although not necessarily more reassuring  Travel the galaxies with Ford and Arthur and enjoy the holiday  For a more comfortable and safe journey  just remember these important traveling tips    Don t forget your towel And  always make sure you are kind to all the petunias you may meet along the way  Curiously enough  the only thing that went through the mind of the bowl of petunias as it fell was   Oh no  Not again   Many people have speculated that if we knew exactly why the bowl of petunias had thought that  we would know a lot more about the nature of the Universe than we do now   From this book I learned the answer to everything is 42  If you doubt this  let me make you aware that Fox Mulder  from The X Files  lived in apartment  42  Also  42 is one of the several numbers used in the TV show LOST And   Buzz Lightyear s ship was called 42  Coincidence  Not likely   Technically  this was read to Carina  actually  it is the book Cabot chose to read to Carina in utero  knowing it was one of my favorite books and that it wouldn t matter if I fell asleep while he read  Douglas Adams paints an absurd picture of the universe   and indeed life as we know it   in Hitchhiker s Guide  now a major motion picture  When the earth is destroyed to make room for an intergalactic superhighway  everyman Arthur Dent is sent on an adventure to solve the riddles of the galaxy  Through this adventure  Adams tackles language  intelligence  religion  and the most vague forms of philosophy in a delightfully farcical fashion  Hitchhiker s Guide is a comic adventure that stands apart from its contemporaries as a cult favorite  Fans of Monty Python s Flying Circus and similar comic stylings will appreciate Douglas Adams  sense of humor   One of the funniest books I ve ever read  I wonder if it is too dated for new audiences  No matter  like any great work  and this is pulpy sci fi humour at its greatest   it will appeal for years to come  Especially to nerdy kids like myself who think this is the natural evolution of Mad   I just listened to this on CD   or rather the radio show that started all this nonsense  It gave me goosebumps listening to the theme song  I think Adams was brilliant and a smart and funny man but I don t think he ever managed anything as good as this first volume  Got to love Marvin  son of Eeyore  Science fiction meets absurd comedy that stays witty and entertaining  highly recommended   morsom   genial    A brilliant  quirky book  so well done in the original BBC Radio series and far less well done in the subsequent TV series and film  thought there were things I liked in each interpretation  You must read the whole trilogy of four books      Enjoy     You really  really  should read this book  I have read and enjoyed most of Douglas Adams  books  and this one was my introduction to his weird and very English world of sci fi  Not sure I d enjoy them quite the same nowadays  but when I was a mere youth I devoured them  and so have fond memories   The TV series was good too  but the film wasn t   Douglas Adams  adaptation of his radio series is a satirical  humorous book that keeps you on the edge of your seat at every word   the only thing that went through the mind of the bowl of petunias as it fell was Oh no  not again    It all began with the destruction of Arthur Dents house  to the explosion of the Earth  then a search for an improbable planet Magrathea in a probability space ship  Adams provides throughout his book a sense of humour  even in the most dramatic and serious of times  The characters are wonderfully strange  from  an ape descendant earthling  Arthur always wanting a cuppa  to the other extreme of a depressed suicidal robot Marvin who is a source of a good laugh To anyone who is looking for a good book written by a highly intelligent humorous man  I highly recommend it along with the rest of the series  My little brother would be proud  I ve finally ready and loved The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams  listening to the brilliantly and extremely funny audio narration by Stephen Fry  I don t know if I d have enjoyed the written book as much as the audio  but the whole thing is a ridiculously imaginative masterpiece  Early in the book  I gave up figuring out the math and science part of this  and just resigned myself to the author s imagination  Things got easier after that  All this frolicking about space between galaxies and black holes and planets was hurting my brain  Adams is imaginative  hilarious  and extremely smart  As someone new to the genre of science fiction  I LOVED this book and every ounce of imagination that went into it  What a loss to science  literature and the world that he was gone way before his time at just 49    As a tribute to him  I plan to read all his books What I loved most about The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  The humor  and even though it s not a comedy  it s hard to take anyone or anything seriously when the story is oh so outlandish and fun  Seconds before our beloved Earth is splintered  Arthur Dent  who had much smaller worries at the time such as his house getting flattened by a bulldozer  is the one and only survivor  thanks to his good old friend Ford Prefect  Ford  who had pretend for 15 years to be an out of work actor  is actually from      that s right  Beetle Juice  He is a man of few  yes you guessed it  very funny   words  and in charge of getting Arthur to a  safe  place and getting that new revision of The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy published and turned in  or something like that  Anyway  after we leave poor planet earth  I m holding on to my seat and trying hard to follow  but much as Arthur  my usual expressions are   What     I don t understand     What happened just now    My favorite characters   thanks to the brilliant narration by Stephen Fry   are Ford Prefect  Arthur Dent and Marvin  the depressed robot  and last but not least  the second most powerful brilliant computer on earth  Deep Thought  Hopping around in the galaxy was a lot more fun with these characters about  and while I still feel partially lost about what just happened in that galaxy   and not shy to admit it   the necessary components of  I love this book  were there  And while science fiction really doesn t float my boat  I think this book can serve anyone a good dose of entertainment from a creative genius  Read this book  Expand your horizon  Explore the galaxy  Be as lost and confused as Arthur Dent but go along with Douglas Adams and you may just never think about interstellar journeys in the same way again   This book was so great and funny even though this had to be about the third time I ve read this book  It s one of my favorites all time because of Adams  liberal application of non sequitur humor and absurdity  The movie is pretty good as well  but there s really no way to capture every bit of the book s humor as the narrative itself is very  very witty and clever  This book challenges the word serious  warning people not to take anything much too seriously  as  the universe is a big place   The answer to life is 42  but first you have to know the question  The author narrates it as an observer of sorts  making general observations about the human race that makes it seem like just another of the universe s stupid species  Overall  Adams  take on science fiction is easily one of the best spoofs ever  as it makes fun of  futuristic  inventions and advances  I love it and would recommend it to absolutely anyone I know  in fact  I might already have  In trying to save his home arthur dent discovers that not only is his home about to be destroyed but so is his entire planet  once leaving the planet he struggles in trying to understand the universe that surrounds him and the way to survive in the big universe  although it is a science fiction story it is told in such a comedic way that even students who don t normally care for sci fi works could enjoy   Amazing and interesting and hilarious  Loved it  Very  very funny and very well told  My mind has been expanded  A bit  diverse in its style  I like it  The history of The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is now so complicated that every time I tell it I contradict myself  and whenever I do get it right I m misquoted  So the publication of this omnibus edition seemed like a good opportunity to set the record straight  or at least firmly crooked   Douglas Adams This is probably one of the most quotable books on the planet   and the solar system  It s also one of the funniest novel series I ve had the joy to read in years  Having boycotted it in high school due to an apathy for the sci fi genre  I picked it up as an adult and couldn t put it down  This is a must read for the sarcastic and witty friend  teacher  student  lover  or paraplegic lawyer in your life    One Thursday  Arthur Dent woke up to see bulldozers surrounding his house  After finding out that they were there to tear down his house in order to make a highway  the craziest thing happens   a big ship of Vogons come to tear down the Earth to make an intergalactic highway  That Thursday  everything changes  as the most improbable things happen   The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is a hilarious book with a reason to laugh on every page  Re reading the Hitchhikers series  Still fun  42  Let s say 4 5 stars I reread this book because I am undertaking a novel where I wanted the humor to have a similar tone  This reading would serve as inspiration  Since the last time I read this series was in my teens  I thought it merited a second look The teenage me loved this series  finding the tone and unfolding of events to be arch and wonky The older me  well  I can see through some of the narrative tricks and the book sags in places  Now  it s still just such a fine piece of fiction with its humor veering from peacock strut to ninja stealth  Adams knows how to turn a phrase and the banter is just so gregarious and winsome But he is sometimes too hot for tangents  Yes  I know most of the tangents pay off later  but the narrative coherency takes a beating here and there With the book I m writing  I want to make sure the main character is not lost in the spectacle of the wit and cosmic nature of the book s trappings  Arthur  sadly doesn t fair so well  He is bland and fades into the background for most of the novel  Yes  I realize the series will eventually evolve him  but it s still disappointing to see such a skeletal character as mere placeholder in such a lofty book Quick Observations  Including additional information as footnotes is distracting and all could be eliminated without any enjoyment being robbed from the telling The author really dislikes cheery futuristic doors that whish open and close A paranoid and depressing robot golden  More scenes  please Mice could never be more menacing than here Button pushing cracked me up in this tale For a book about hitchhiking through the interstellar vastness  there was a lack of wonder or variety in the settings  If one is thumbing through the cosmos  I d expect a space bar  exotic alien jungle  lavishly expensive sets  but this one felt sparse As I raced to the end  the humor flowed consistently throughout  I struggle with this in my own work as it seems my humor cuts out whenever I approach the climax  As if the apex of the story needs to be all serious and such  Well  this book reminded me that should be an area to focus on The book did what it was supposed to do  it invigorated my desire to write funny  It also made me wonder what a space opera might read like if I ever stopped writing fantasies and took the interstellar plunge  I can guarantee one thing  it sure as Jupiter would feature a space bar  Maybe even in its opening scene  hilarious and fantastic  everything a book needs to be  Quirky   And mostly harmless DAdams is prone to riffing on weird subjects in the middle of the narrative and it s these snide remarks which  more than anything else in the book make it an enjoyable experience There are few actual laugh out loud moments but it does give you a constant smirk with which to annoy your friends  All in all  a wonderful read  Short and sharp  Hilarious and dead serious at the same time  Reminds one of Alice In Wonderland This book is amazing almost beyond 5 star ratings   It does  in fact  take place beyond the stars that we see in the sky   The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is a fantastic science fiction story that is far better than any other than I have read  It includes the best type of humor  humor in the dialogue   not only slapstick    and the writing style used by Adams in this book and the next four in his  Trilogy of Five   yes   Trilogy of Five   is spectacular  I recommend this book to everyone who is able to obtain it from any place in the Universe Notes  This book is written by a British author  to clarify certain contexts  Additionally  within the story  in universe   there is a book titled The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  which has never been published on Earth and is different from the actual book that has been reviewed here  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is a hilarious adventure of a group of unlikely travelers on a journey to find an impossible universal treasure  The book expands the world view as the galaxy is full of alien population  and earth is just a tiny planet to be forgotten as a gravel in a sea of sand  showing how fragile and unimportant humans are  ironic to what we think we are Pros Hilarious  Absolutely Hilarious  The book is filled with ironic jokes  metaphors taken too seriously  awkward moments  and dark humor  The humor in the book definitely applies more for teenagers and adults  which is great  There are yet so many moments in the book that kept me laughing even after I finished  and even though the story plot isn t that great  which I will elaborate later on  this book is a guaranteed read and gig sort of literature  Each character has their own reasonings and perspectives which the author successfully expressed  and although the book has a great amount of idiots  in this case  two dimensional characters  it is always interesting to see the multi dimensional charcters spoiler  the mouse interacting with them  One of my favorite scenes is when the president of the galaxy stole the ship out of completely no where and flew away from the whole galaxy s attention  The plot twist was so unexpected I had to temporarily put down my kindle and simply stare into the distance  questioning myself the meaning of life  Just to reaffirm  that question has been firmly answered in the book Cons Story   It s missing a story  The whole book seemed to be a collection of periodic jokes which I do enjoy   yet with a weak connection to the main story  The progression seemed to be fairly slow and lacking the energy of putting the sequence into action  However  the pros of hilarious plot lines does seem to counter balance that  however some more advanced readers might think otherwise Verdict  5 out of 5 stars The book is an enjoyment to read  a must read book in my teenage life  The jokes are well placed and would greatly enlighten the mood of my dull school life  The story may have been a bit lacking but that could be strengthened as the series continues  In my great shame I have never actually read the entire series  I ve read the first book before and maybe the second  so now I m starting over again and I m so glad that I have This book is quick witted  entertaining and makes you think just enough to stay interested and amused  It is very easy to tell from his sense of humor and delivery style that Douglas Adams is British through and through  I find him truly delightful and I can t wait to read all of the books  My best friend and I were obsessed with this at school   we d have hours of fun reciting whole chunks of text and laughing hysterically at the mention of a towel    Well  it made sense to us  Quirky  inventive  utterly brilliant   such a shame Douglas Adams died so young  I first came to this book as the Radio production  An uncle gave it to me on cassette  and I was hooked  I got the book   read it until it disintigrated   bought another and so on  Initially  I identified with Arthur  an earthling trying to understand that big wide universe  Like the whale I wondered if it would be friends with me  Then I found myself siding with Ford Prefect  then Trillion  Now  as I find more grey hairs than I would like  I m more like Slarty Bardfast than I d care to admit  Brilliant  Brilliant  Brilliant  x3 and I m still not sure that suffices I cannot stress how great this book is  It is a Must Read Before You Die I loved this audiobook  The writing and content were subtly hilarious and the narrator was perfect  An absolutely hilarious journey through the universe fantastically written  This novel takes you on a journey like no other following the adventures of four fairly unlikely friends and a manically depressed robot  If you have the time read this  If you don t have the time  you should still undoubtedly read this   Don t Panic  Actually don t get this book  if you can find it get the thick one that has all the books in one volume  I ve reread the whole series a total of 11 times now  It s something you can just pickup  turn to any page  and get a good laugh at  I HIGHLY recommend this book to all you light hearted folk So cooool xD1  It was like reading a lighter version of Doctor Who xD2  Such a fun read 3  Lovely characters 4  Loved the humor 5  Loved the writing 6  It was a silly book but whatever xD7  Don t read if you re not into silly space and alien stuff  I heard part of this book on tape before I read it  Loved both  Don t know how I missed it as a teen  and in fact  my 18 year old son recommended it  Douglas Adams  hilarious combination of writing in sublime understatement and frequent asides of pickety details make me think he d make a terrific interstellar soulmate for Neil Gaiman  Terry Pratchett  and P  G  Wodehouse  Well worth the wait  Oh  the language  The humour  Loved it  Highly suggest the audiobook narrated by Stephen Fry  The humor and writing style is thoroughly entertaining  My only problem with the book is that it is too short  not enough happens in this one book  Total brain candy  When I want to read something that is going to lift my spirits and make me laugh out loud   and yet make me think    I pick up any of the Hitchhiker s guide books I learned that despite pushing around little pieces of green paper  even the ones with digital watches aren t very happy  If you want funny and science fiction at the same time this is the book for you  The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy By Douglas Adams is a hilarious novel that tells the stroy of an earthling named Arthur Dent  Arthur Dent is a normal earthling when he figures out his friend  Ford  is an alien from Beetlguese and that the world will be vaporized  He meets many people through wacky encounters and funny happenings  I loved this book and I think anyone who is old enough to get the jokes and doesn t hate sci fi will absolutely love this novel  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is a book writing by Douglas Adams  The book is filled with simple and complex humor  The book starts off In a small town which the two main characters are set off and explained  The book really begins after  view spoiler  the main characters house gets demolished and the earth is destroyed in two separate events   hide spoiler   The main character Arther Dent and Ford Prefect find the President of the Galaxy by very UN probable chance  view spoiler  After Zaphod Beeblebrox President of the Galaxy steals the ship named  Heart of Gold  we picks up the Arther and Ford  To the fact that Zaphod Beeblebrox stole the incredible  Heart of Gold  he became no longer to President of the Galaxy   hide spoiler   The book so far was being seeming extremely impossible chance of events that make sense in a weird way  view spoiler   The random group of people seem to be all related in different ways makes them work in the story sense  And the story s that continue is just strange as the transition to the answer of the universe  42   hide spoiler   The Book is a great read and I recommend it to everyone  So funny  I love this sense of humor  There are so many incredible quotes from this book  Just one of the quotes  After a fairly shaky start to the day  Arthur s mind was beginning to re assemble itself from the shellshocked fragments the previous day had lefthim with  He had found a Nutri Matic machine which had provided himwith a plastic cup filled with a liquid that was almost  but not quite  entirelyunlike tea  The way it functioned was very interesting  When the Drinkbutton was pressed it made an instant but highly detailed examination ofthe subject s taste buds  a spectroscopic analysis of the subject s metabolismand then sent tiny experimental signals down the neural pathways to thetaste centres of the subject s brain to see what was likely to go down well However  no one knew quite why it did this because it invariably delivereda cupful of liquid that was almost  but not quite  entirely unlike tea  TheNutri Matic was designed and manufactured by the Sirius Cybernetics Cor poration whose complaints department now covers all the major land massesof the first three planets in the Sirius Tau Star system   Like most readers of The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  I came to the book at the recommendation of friends who were devoted to Douglas Adams  books  After several years of being told that I needed to read this series  I finally picked them up and loved what I found  This book is full of humor and interesting characters that quickly drew me into the fascinating world that Adams created  The book is a wonderful combination of space exploration  adventure  and comedy  Funny and very entretaining   Man had always assumed that he was more intelligent than dolphins because he had achieved so much   the wheel  New York  wars and so on   while all the dolphins had ever done was muck about in the water having a good time  But conversely  the dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent than man  for precisely the same reasons    This book is brilliant  Witty  ironic  well imagined  Pokes fun at human nature in a way that only aliens could come up with   While this book wasn t quite as openly hilarious comparatively to great titles like The Princess Bride  its underlying dry dark humor was fantastic  It wasn t really a book i ever burst out laughing to  but there were chuckles  and the dripping irony kept an odd smile on my face the whole time  The style of writing took some getting used to  around five pages or so to truly pick up on the language  which isn t much  If you haven t as of yet read about the great Zaphod Beeblebrox  or the wise Slarty Bartfast  then please  read this   This is one of my favorite books to pick up if I need to be cheered up  Douglas Adams is a hilarious  It is such a quotable book as are many of his others  though this one will always have a special place in my heart as it was my first Douglas Adams book  I can see why a lot of people would dislike it  I see a number of reviews have 1 star  it is an acquired taste  However if you are willing to be silly for a little while and aren t looking for a literary work of art then this book will entertain you  and surely on its most basic level a book is simply entertainment DO NOT WATCH THE MOVIE IT IS HORRENDOUS  This is my all time favorite book  It is witty and comical and all of those magnificent things  Also  however  it rather pokes fun at the sci fi genre  so if you re an easily offended Star Trek Wars Whatever fan  please do not read this book  Everyone else  jump in  More to come later  I m new to this review thing and it s weird to put into words how I feel about these books    The first time I tried to read this book years ago I didn t really understand what I was getting myself into  You see I took the book far too seriously  and didn t really understand dry British humor at that point in my life  Suffice it to say that I didn t make it very far in the book all those years ago This time I had a feeling that I would enjoy the book much more  having developed more of a taste for British humor  as well as for things that are kind of off the wall  But  because of my prior experience with the book I decided to listen to the audiobook this time around  I had heard from several people that the audiobook was excellent  and I have to say that they were right There s something to be said for listening to a book being read by someone of the same nationality as the author  It made even more sense to listen to the book after learning that it originally began as a BBC comedy in 1978  and was later developed into this book as well as the sequels Many times while listening to this audiobook I found myself laughing out loud at the precarious situations  and the background stories as to how those situations arose  Arthur Dent s character is just priceless  and there is so much to love about the interactions between him and Ford Prefect Little tidbits of information are given to the reader  or in this case  the listener  and you really have to pay attention to them  because they all come into play later in the book  For instance  I love the parallel stories between what the construction workers do to Arthur s house and what the Vogons do to Earth I can t believe that I held off for so long in reading this book  yet I am glad that I waited until I was fully able to appreciate the humor  It is off the wall  unusual and irreverent  but it is a bundle of fun along the way The narrator of this audiobook was very pleasant to listen to  and I would recommend this to anyone who has an interest in humorous science fiction stories  Oh  My  God  I wasn t sure if I was going to like this book or not  I m a huge sci fi fan  but I tend to like my fiction to make a little sense  at least  That being said  I LOVED this book  I may not have agreed with everything Adams was trying to convey  but I adored the insanity  It s like someone threw Deadpool into Doctor Who  I mean  I now know the answer to life  a computer is singing to me  mice rule the world  and I don t know what the fudge is going on and I don t care because I m laughing my arse off   This book is bloody brilliant and it was about time I read it  It s clever  laugh out loud funny  and just over all an amazing book  Some of my favorite parts were the bit about Vogon poetry  Marvin the robot  and Deep Thought the computer  I m definitely going to read the others in the series because if they are even half as good as this its worth it  The wackiest  most hillarious book ever written   hats off to the imagination and wit of adams douglas  Looking forward to the sequels now     When reading this book  discard away every possible piece of logic and reason   the world runs in the mind and in one s imagination  and in there  anything goes  This book makes that pretty clear Love it  love it  love it very much  Although written in the latter years of the last century  Adams  tour de force  once relatively visible  at least among anglophiles  nw  sadly  appears to be a literary artifact  I read this a couple of times when it first came out and it so perfectly captured the mood of the 70 s  The humor was dry and satirical and the plot was so unpredictable    there was no way of knowing just what Arthur Dent would have to deal with in the next chapter  Just thinking about it makes me want to read it again  I thought that the hitchhiker s guide to the galaxy was a great book with diverse characters  and amazing and elaborate plot  and a great writing style  The author opens the book in a great fashion and then continues to hold your attention  He has made great alien races and expertly portrays them and describes them so well you think your there  I read the first book and it absolutely sucked me in with the witty humor and the amazing characters  I have read the first three books and still love the humor the series continues to offer  Hilarious  get ready to laught your ass off periode Four stars  FOUR  I apologize  My friend s must have misclicked while being consumed by the ravenous bugblatter beast of traal   In my experience reading science fiction is often hit or miss  some books are so imaginative and well written they stick in my mind for weeks after reading  Others feel like a chore to read and seems to have a disconnect between the author s imagination and what s on the page  In my opinion The Hitchhiker s Guide to Galaxy is a book that was ahead of its time  smart  engrossing  and just plain funny  In fantasy and sci fi novels  the authors often have mythologies  histories  and unique environments to introduce to the reader  This book is unique in that Adams uses The Guide to acquaint the reader with the framework of the Galaxy I don t think I would be mistaken if I claimed Adams was a genius  He wrote about eBooks  touch screens  space travel  and so much more  Before Adams wrote this book  he presented it as a radio program  and then he worked as a scripted editor for Doctor  then presented the manuscript to the publishers Pan Books  While it is not uncommon for authors to predict reality in their science fiction  Adams seemed to have set a precedent You may remember the movie The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  starring Martin Freeman  released in 2005  Personally think the movie holds up pretty well in comparison to the book  I do understand some of the rage people have for book to movie adaptations  but I do believe this on the few adaptations that did it well enough  I say  well enough   because directors  producers  or whomever will always end up changing something and its impossible create a perfect adaptation   There are definitely a few changes but the plot and essence of the story is upheld  which could be because Adams wrote the latest version of script himself The number 42 will never be the same again  What can I say  I ve probably read this book 20 times  I did a sixth grade book report on it  where I tried to convey the hilarity of the Vogon ships hanging  much in the same way a brick does not  It fell flat But the book doesn t  Douglas Adams had a wry  bewildered  tender way of viewing the world that resonates with me as much now  at 34  as it did at 11  Definitely LOVE the humor  I am struck by how the author naturally presents his vision imagination through a brilliant and witty selection of words  Also  the philosophical bits are quite amusing as well  Universal puzzles are never boring  Haha  10 10 would read the sequels  I really enjoyed reading this book  Completely thought provoking and hilarious  Douglas Adams was a genius and his writing style was really pleasurable  I really liked it   Amazing book  Contains one of my favorite scenes in all of literature    a blue whale manifested over some remote planet who has just enough time to work his way through  cogito ergo sum  before suddenly being faced with impending death as gravity pulls him toward the ground  Brilliant  Funny  I played the text adventure game as a kid  I am dating myself with that quote    but I was a really young kid     so I knew the story but I didn t read it until I was an adult  It is very smart and witty  I couldn t stop laughing out loud  I was disappointed by the movie but the book is great  Was the complete opposite of want i thought it was  a non fictional encyclopedia  but was much much more entertaining and had a lot more of a narrative than i hoped for so when i started reading i literally fell asleep while reading it for i had read for so long each night  Althought it may be hard to imagine  the first time I heard of  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  was when the trailers for the movie started to air on tv  Sci Fi was a genre that I jsut didn t read  After I watched the movie  and loved it  I wanted to read the book to see how similar and different it was  Time passed and books came and went  byt  The Guide  always seemed to be next on my list I finally read it and I wish I had not waited so long  It is everything I expected it to be and more  I have introduced my friends to the amazing world of Douglas Adams and more fans are being added as quickly as I can find them  His clever  sometimes scalding hot  wit and humor is quite unlike any other I have read  The only disappointment I have is that it ended way too soon and  since I bought the special movie edition of the book  that Douglas did not get to live long enough to see the film he had worked so hard for  A fantastic world and wonderful characters  alive and strange yet strangely familiar   The Hitchhiker s guide to the Galaxy  encourages us to think  to question  to laugh  and to remember that things may not be as simple as they seem but that doesn t have to be a bad thing  so Don t Panic   Moc hezka kniha a urcite to neni naposled co ji ctu  What a book    how did I miss this   Sacrilege    One of the most entertaining books I have ever read  Just don t watch the movie  the movie is rubbish  Douglas Adams  adaptation of his own BBC radio series was a smash hit  and remains one of my favorite novels  Where long introductions were unusual on radio  here they could be extended to whole chapters for his own amusement  and always to the same amusement in his readers  He also added a lot of new wordplay and literary nuance  which led many to mistake this for the original work and the radio show to be the spinoff  But from the destruction of a house  to the destruction of the earth  to the search for the meaning of life in a spaceship that is fueled by improbability  Adams created an unparalleled work of sensible nonsense  a novel with a spirit funny and charming even at its most critical   and it is quite mean  to culture  technology  philosophy  religion  politics  and anything else it can so much as pun off of  The characters are wonderful  from Arthur  the ape descendent earthling  and his simple desire for a cup of tea  to the two headed hedonistic president of the universe  You ll find an overwhelming desire to explore Adams  cosmos just to meet more of the people who populate it  and hear the hilarious things they ll say about it  There is at least one clever line or observation on every page of this paperback  This first book stands out as the brightest in the  trilogy  of five books  but if you fall for his style of humor  you ll love the rest of his works  The biggest flaw in Douglas Adams  writing is that there isn t more of it  the movie is the best i used to watch it all the time and i finally got around tk finishing this book  it was great Brilliantly funny     Douglas Adams is the philosopher s comedian  Wonderfully   humourously insightful    One of my favourite books of all time  one of the best ever written  in the genre   and much in the book series that didn t make it to the TV show or movie     though I ve heard the radio plays have even more content  definitely curious to explore that   I love this book  Parts of it are so brilliant and it is hilarious   I have been meaning to read The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams for quite a while now  When I purchased it  I was sure I would quite enjoy the book due to the many positive reviews my friends gave it  as well as I was familiar with the author s writing style  The reason knew the writing style of Douglas Adams without reading his books was that every night I would go on this website  Goodreads  and find a quote that I enjoyed  Sadly  I do not have a list of these quotes  but quite a large amount of them are by Douglas Adams  He is truly a wonderful writer  and it is very evident in the Hitchhiker s Guide due to the way Adams creates his characters  personalities  the many little bits of blunt  British humor expertly inserted into the adventure  and the way the story flowed was astoundingly smooth and fast paced  Throughout the entire book  Adams made every situation  no matter how dire  seem like a passing thought to the characters  who are basically the most indifferent ones I have ever read in a book  yet have the most personality  I understand this might sound a bit contradicting  Let me explain The book is written in 3rd person  Therefore one does not have access to all of the character s thoughts  the only insight the reader has of their thoughts is what they say out loud and the few times Adams decides to actually say what each person is thinking  which is always humorous   For this same reason  the reader also only knows what the characters are doing while they are together  or when a bit of action takes place  Those two things are usually synonymous with each other  so whenever the characters are together  there is action  This develops the characters very well  because the reader can see how the character reacts to many different situations  Adams was very clever in this respect The Hitchhiker s Guide is well known for being a very funny book  In this  it does not disappoint  In many cases  it has actually gone above many people s expectations  The amount of humor Adams inserts into every situation is great  and the jokes never got old  In fact  Adams never really used jokes to get his humor across  It was just there  easily accessible  just waiting for someone to read it and chuckle  For example   Mr  Prosser shook his finger at him a bit  then stopped and put it away again   Adams  pg  9  The humor is not such that one would laugh out loud   although there are times it is  but makes one smile  It just makes the book overall much more pleasant to read The way this story flows from one event to the other seems surreal and totally and completely natural at the same time  At one point  Arthur Dent  the main character  is on Earth  The next  he is in a spaceship  The flow of these events is very logical  and it does make perfect sense  Yet the way that everything happens is very fast paced in this way  as well as how the characters respond to this change  The characters respond to such massive change such as being teleported onto a space ship with great ease  and a sense of just not letting the information actually go to their head  instead they just roll with the events and let what happens happen  And that s really how one should treat this book while reading it  Just read it  have fun  and accept things as they happen Overall  this was my favorite book I have ever had the pleasure of reading  The characters are very well developed and thought out  the book is beautifully interlaced with great humor  and the story flowed very smoothly and was fast paced  The book was a fun read  and never got boring  I recommend this book to any and everyone in the mood to add some fun to their day  This book  This book  Douglas Adams is a pure genius  The way he strings his words together is similar to the way Tolkien did except with Tolkien  who used words to create pieces of art  Adams uses them as more of a plaything  I was laughing with every turn of the page  An important feature of the book is that there is a lot of random deviation from the main plot   which is entirely absent altogether  You heard me right   Or rather read me right  There is literally no plot  Just a bunch of aliens hijacking a gigantic  state of the art spaceship and flying to a planet that was in charge of making other custom made planets for rich aliens  all because the current President of the Galaxy somehow knew in his messed up brain where it would be  And then there s suddenly a sperm whale who falls to his tragic death on said planet  As it turns out the inhabitants of this planet also created the planet Earth  in order to find the Question to the Ultimate Answer  which according to the second smartest computer in the universe  is 42  Some dude even got an award for making Norway  Good for him Like WTF just happened   LOL that s literally Arthur through the whole book   Imagine not having read the book and then reading all that  Like  WTF I legitimately tried to keep up with all the details of all the various names of all the various aliens   But I failed miserably so I decided to stop trying altogether  And in the end it really isn t all that important to remember every single name of every single thing mentioned  Plus I have a bad memory  BUT damn this book  You have literally no idea what s happening half the time but hell is it awesome  It s just the indescribable style that Adams uses  If it were written by anyone else  it d probably suck so hard   One of the funniest books I ve ever had the pleasure to read   A friend of mine gave this to me way back in High School because I enjoyed British comedy  I laughed so hard while reading that couldn t see the page through the tears in my eyes  Recently I picked it up to read again  half afraid that the  magic  would have faded as I grew up  Nope  I still laugh until it hurts  This is British slapstick humor at its finest   One of my all time favourite books  Not because it s the best book ever written  but   I just grew up with this series  Funny  re reading it now  and reading Terry Pratchett at last  I could see either of Douglas Adams  which he was still around to write more   and Terry Pratchett writing each other s books     This book is something everyone  and I mean EVERYONE  should read at least once in their life time  Although I suggest having a few Pan Galactic Gargle Blasters before hand  It tells the story of Arthur Dent  how his house is to be knocked down  and how   in 12 minutes   the Earth is to be destroyed  Also  it takes bits and pieces out of the book  The Hitch Hiker s Guide to the Galaxy   which over took the Encyclopaedia Galactica  as you read  you shall find out why   This book takes off many things in day to day life  Councils  humans  computers  Philosophers  and    Mice  It even tells you the answer  42  But that s not very helpful because there doesn t seem to be a question  The only bad thing about this book  is that you never find out who got the bruised upper arm  My suggestion is  READ IT   Absolutely love Douglas Adams  trilogy  He was a stunning author   Amazing and so funny  I loved the characters and the humour  The Monty Python of intergalatic silliness  A classic in the genre  This book inspires the alter ego of every serious writer to shed conformity and look at the world through a child s eye  Because when our bureaucracies and foibles are stripped naked you get a romp like this  Dry witty humor that pierces conformity like a stake through the heart  If you like satire  this is a must read  This is an absolutely hilarious book  and one of my all time favorites  When the Earth is destroyed to make room for a new galactic highway  Arthur and Ford hitch a ride onto a spaceship and start their way through a series of increasingly hilarious events  while try to find the answer to life  the universe and everything  which was contained in the Earth  Adams  style is so out there that everything from the mundane to the amazing becomes part of a huge joke  Nice read  good story  Too bad it s so short  Around 30  of the book is an afterward of how the movie was made  My favorite character was Marvis the deppressed robot  I found it hilarious because most of the time I feel like him  it s a parody of the wretched teenager some of us carry inside  The best fiction I have ever read  Douglas Adams does wonders and brings forth a fascinatingly silly look at The Universe  I would definitely recommend this book and please  don t watch the film  it does no justice to the book  radio or tv series   I go back to this book again and again when I just want a lighthearted  hilarious read  If you have a British  dry  sense of humor  this is the book for you  It begins when the main character is horrified to realize that his house is to be demolished to make room for a new freeway  Little does he know  that unknown aliens have decided to demolish the Earth to make room for an intergalactic freeway  He is narrowly saved by his friend Ford Prefect who happens to be an alien himself  and spends the rest of the book is his pajamas  trying to figure out the universe that he has found himself in  I have only two things to say  Don t Panic  And don t forget your towel   It s hard to review a book that had  if not a major impact on one s life  was at the very least a favorite book  associated with good memories and happy times from one s childhood  Rereading this as an adult  at a distance of some thirty or more years  it holds up well  although I was aware of some things that probably seemed quite reasonable at the time  but are not so true anymore Digital watches aren t really a thing any more  Computers are different now  The idea of computer programmers showing up with leather bound notebooks is quaint  Trillian s role is less of a full character  and more window dressing  which bums me out  Calling people  baby   especially when men do it to other men  seems redolent of the early 70s  more Austin Powers than anything real Still and all  it s tightly written  hilarious  sharp  witty comedy  It s paced just right  it never drags  it hurtles along at a breakneck pace  That alone would give it 4 stars in my rating  Does it deserve a fifth I think it does  but mainly because of the place it holds in my life  and my history  and those of many others  Part of the problem of course is that for a certain generation of geek  this book is a touchstone  And it s conception within that context is rather more boring than the book actually is  tired  an unexamined trope  an overused reference point But the book itself  Still fresh  still funny  still exciting  So  while I wouldn t necessarily say this book was  life changing   which is my criteria for 5 stars  it was  actually  way back when  And may still be today  if I was 11  So on that basis  sort of a temporally retroactive review  I give it my highest rating If you happen to know an intelligent 11 year old  with a slightly bent sense of humor  give them this book  They ll enjoy the heck out of it  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams is like that old Reese s Peanut Butter Cups advertising campaign  You know  the one where the peanut butter and chocolate lovers clumsily bump into each other  You ve got peanut butter on my chocolate  You ve got chocolate in my peanut butter   they exclaim before finding out just how delicious the combination turns out to be Replace peanut butter and chocolate with science fiction and humor and you get Douglas Adams  brilliant The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy Read the rest of my review on the Used Books Blog This book is probably my favorite book  Ever  I don t like writing reviews so I m going to make this short  I loved this book  The main thing that endeared this book to me was Adams  offbeat humor  it s not really the dialogue that s funny  which was what made the film decidedly less funny  so much as the other parts of the book Overall  it was awesome  Etc   Absurdamente divertido  Hitchhikers s Guide to Galaxy     I loved it so much that i broke my snobbish rule of not giving a book five stars albeit how much i like it and for the love of me  i can t be critical about this book  You don t pick and prod at something that is so  precious  You just stand back and behold  sit back and experience  let it take yourself by the hand and take you around the world that is so different and yet so absolutely homelike  You hardly feel a disconnect   in my case atleast  And the prose   It is like a wacky friend you forgot you had If you haven t read it yet  what are you waiting for  The Vogons  You know that old question  what book would you take with you if you were trapped on a desert island  Well  my first pick would be a book on survival training  But my second pick would be  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy   I know I could spend the rest of my life reading this book  because I ve already read it more times than I could count  and I m never tired of it It s hard to overstate my love of this book  It s influenced my sense of humor and writing style and everything in between  It also introduced me as a kid to concepts like quantum theory and alternate realities  so it shaped my interest in science  Okay  so now let s get to the actual book   Hitchhiker s  is about the end of the world  and what comes next  Arthur Dent is your average human living a mediocre life until he wakes up to find someone trying to bulldoze his house to make way for a bypass  highway for Americans   Just when he thinks he s got that solved  aliens come along and destroy the Earth to make way for an intergalactic bypass  Fortunately  Arthur manages to escape when he discovers his best friend is actually an intergalactic hitchhiker who hitches a ride on the demolition fleet before Earth s destruction From there  Arthur finds himself traveling the Galaxy with the two headed president of the Galaxy and another Earthling woman he once fell in love with  trying to find the answer to the ultimate question of Life  the Universe and Everything  He discovers that Earth was actually an experiment to find the meaning of life  and his brain holds the key  I won t say much more to spoil it  but it gets crazier from there The characters are all brilliant  and funny  and inspire the most hilarious and insane scenes that the comedy crackles off the page  He also has an amazing imagination  creating other planets and species that are wholly original and also fun  Like Magrathea  a planet that runs a company to build custom planets  Or the Jartravartid  a species with so many arms that they invented deodorant before the wheel  Part of Adams  humor is based on the idea that the problems of Earth are universal  Even in outer space  politicians are corrupt  technology is confusing and malfunctions  and parking garages smell like urine The only flaw in the book is that it was originally written as a radio series where Douglas Adams was making it up as he went along  so the story doesn t have a consistent narrative  It tends to jump from one scene to the next as a series of skits rather than a story with an arc  But I love that style It s hilarious  imaginative  and glorious  So   read it  It s almost unnecessary to write reviews for some books  I can only say to someone who hasn t read this series  it will open your mind like a a gold crowbar wrapped in quantum hand dyed silk  pour humour and ideas into your brain like some kind of cosmic champagne  and make you laugh it out of your nose before it gently turns you around  pats you on the shoulder and shoves you out the door to face the world   It took me a while to get into it  I read it in English and  honestly  it was rather confusing at first for me    But then I just went with the flow and I have to say it was a great surprise that I got to love it so much  It s such a funny book with so many great quotes  I totally recommend it and I m definitely going to read the other ones  Absolutely hilarious read  It was like Monty Python meets Dr  Who  Douglas Adams has a very clever sense of humor as he takes the reader on a journey across the Universe  guided by  improbability   And  when the answer to  Life  the Universe  and Everything  turns out to be  42   you just have to laugh and shake your head  For all you know  Mr  Adams might be right  What can I say  you either love Adams s wacky humor and riffs   or you don t  I am firmly in the first camp  Arthur gave the rest of the pub another wan smile  The rest of the pub frowned at him  A man waved at him to stop smiling at them and mind his own business   A towel   is about the most massively useful thing an interstellar hitchhiker can have  Partly it has great practical value  You can wrap it around you for warmth as you bound across the cold moons of Jaglan Beta  you can lie on it on the brilliant marble sanded beaches of Santraginus V    you can sleep under it beneath the stars which shine so redly on the desert world of Kakrafoon  use it to sail a miniraft down the slow heavy River Moth  wet it for use in hand to hand combat  wrap it around your head to ward off noxious fumes or avoid the gaze of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal  a mind bogglingly stupid animal  it assumes that if you can t see it  it can t see you   you can wave your towel in emergencies as a distress signal  and of course dry yourself off with it if it still seems to be clean enough   The barman looked   at Ford  He suddenly shivered   he experienced a momentary sensation that he didn t understand because no one on Earth had ever experienced it before  In moments of great stress  every life form that exists gives out a tiny subliminal signal  This signal simply communicates an exact and almost pathetic sense of how far that being is from the place of his birth  On Earth it is never possible to be farther than sixteen thousand miles from your birthplace  which really isn t very far  so such signals are too minute to be noticed  Ford Prefect was at this moment under great stress  and he was born six hundred light years away       You barbarians  he yelled   I ll sue the council for every penny it s got  I ll have you hung  drawn and quartered  And whipped  And boiled   until   until you ve had enough          you d better be prepared for the jump into hyperspace  It s unpleasantly like being drunk   What s so unpleasant about being drunk   You ask a glass of water       man had always assumed that he was more intelligent than dolphins because he had achieved so much  the wheel  New York  wars  and so on  while all the dolphins had ever done was muck about in the water having a good time  But conversely  the dolphins had always believed that they were more intelligent that man  for precisely the same reasons   In fact  there was only one species on the planet more intelligent than dolphins  and they spend a lot of their time in behavioral research laboratories running around inside wheels and conducting frighteningly elegant and subtle experiments on man    Narrator  Stephen Fry Great job  of course   it is Stephen Fry  after all I have no idea why I never got around to reading this fun book  There s nothing I could possibly add to the other 12 000  reviews on this site  I ve been hearing references to this book for decades and never knew where they came from    life  the universe and everything    42   Some I m not sure which came first  the reference or the book  Someone just told me Ford Prefix was a Ford model in Britain Now I ll understand the occasional     and thanks for all the fish  on parting with friends  Absolutely crazy  Don t forget the towel  My rating  42 Awesome chnd rwz pysh bry wlyn br b wjh  Satire  ashn shdm  t qbl z wn Hty yn khlmh rw nshnydh bwd w jyy hm ndydh bwdm

love love love this book  Doughlas Adams has the most kickass sense of humor ever  This book is extremely funny  small lines here and there that set you off and then everyone treats you like a maniac

but I just couldn t get past the first few pages  It s a classic  at least in the sci fi world  so I had to give it a whirl My ThoughtsSo when I was growing up  I had a brother  well  I still have a brother      who was really into science fiction things  He loves computers  games  Star Wars  Star Trek  etc   etc     and he loved reading  I was never really a reader when I was growing up  Sure  I had my favourite series books  but I wasn t one to just camp out in a pile of blankets and spend the whole day with my nose in a book  if only I could fast forward 20 years      My brother  on the other hand  read plenty of books  Science Fiction books  His bookshelf really wasn t one that I found myself wanting to borrow books from  Until he moved  Then  I got my borrowing act on and borrowed a few nerdy things from him    including his copy of The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  Of course  that being said  the book stayed on my shelf for YEARS  I tried reading it once in a while  but just never got past the first page  When I came across the audiobooks for the series  a k a  the  trilogy  in  five  parts   I thought I d give them a whirl  I was driving  so I figured I d be stuck for a while listening to it  so maybe  just maybe I d get into it Let s just say I m quite happy to have listened to this audiobook because it was AWESOME There are certain books that I expect to be British  That is  when I read them  I have a British accent going in my head  Don t mock me  It s my thing  When I started listening to Douglas Adams narrate THHGTTG  I thought   YES  This is exactly how I wanted it to be read   Being the writer of the book  Adams knew exactly where to put emphasis  where to put pauses  and where to start yelling uncontrollably  Listening to the audiobook was an experience and a half The book was quite enjoyable  When I think of  science fiction  I always think it s going to be hard to read    but it really isn t  I guess you could get some books that are a little too technical  or a little too out there  but this book was just really enjoyable  The characters were fascinating and funny  especially the main character  Arthur Dent  The whole introduction of him getting up every day to lay in front of a bulldozer that s going to destroy his house was quite funny    especially because the reader has no idea what he s prepping himself for as he s bustling around his home Of course  then someone comes along    Ford Prefect  i e  An alien who took human form and wanted a name that blended in with the rest  Obviously  taking the name of a popular British car was the way to go      who takes Arthur for a beer  in quite the hilarious scene with the guy who wants to tear his house down  because something is happening  In fact  the world is about to end From there  Adams takes his readers on a roller coaster ride full of absolute hilarity that when you finish listening to the book  there s no way you can consider NOT reading the rest in the series  In fact  I m more than thrilled to have the rest of the series to listen to  Science fiction lover or not  this is a book not to be missed    it s quirky  fun  and hilarious  If you can t get the Douglas Adams version  Stephen Fry narrates another version and I m sure it is just as fantastic Who Should Read This BookWell  since I listened to the audiobook version  I would say if you need something to keep you alert and laughing  give this one a listen  It was hilarious from start to finish and very smartly written  If you re a fan of sci fi  or looking to read some classic sci fi that s not so serious  this one is great Read more reviews on my blog  Reading In Winter    I first read this book long  long ago  I don t know how old I was  but I was quite young and ready to move beyond Ramona the Pest  So I timidly ventured upstairs in the library to the grown up books  where I d been many times before  of course  but just to find my parents after I finished in the children s section  this time I was a patron of those books   This book was one of the first grown up books I read  Of course   grown up book  could be debated  All I remembered now was that I liked it And having now read it as an adult  I still like it  It s hilarious  A friend was reading it  and she said that this was totally my sense of humor  My goodness  she was right  a little twisted  a little bizarre  and a lot of sci fi  I wonder if it played any role in shaping my sense of humor  but probably not   it s probably just coincidence  Or a perfect match  Or something  But I love this book  The mice will see you now   HA     Smart comedy is always the best kind of comedy  Full of interesting facts about earth and a different vision about the things you could consider very common  For the people who already saw the movie  the plot is lightly different and the kind of comedy is always fairly different  An extraordinary and humorous view on the Universe and all its life forms  Very trippy   I vaguely knew what to expect diving into this book  I was aware of the humour and premise  However  I did not expect this book to challenge my vocabulary and comprehension skills  I don t know if I was tired or not very intelligent but it definitely took me a while to get used to the writing style  WHAT I LOVED ABOUT IT   first and obviously the humour  super nerdy  super witty  and super British  loved it   the ridiculousness of it all  it also took me a while to  get on board  with this book  don t panic and just let it happen    the book s tendency to flip things on their heads for a different perspective  such as flipping the answer and question  the rats and humans  the unassuming buffoon who has the capacity to unlock life s secrets and life s secrets  secrets    and final mentions to Eddie the computer  the Vogon guard  and the two cops at the end  WHAT I DIDN T FAVOUR ABOUT IT   we don t really get to know the characters to necessarily root for them  especially our main protagonist and more so with Trillian  could be too early in the series  i don t know  but i m definitely checking out the next book find out    i didn t really feel much of a plot line from it  more like multiple gags and jokes stitched together  however  it wasn t a massive concern since i was having too much fun to give a crap  I was not expecting for this book to be as thought provoking as it was for me  I thought it was simply going to be a fun book that ll make me laugh  However the thing about satire is that it tends to creep into your psyche and convey a message while making you laugh  Before you know it  you re learning something  Going back to my mention about having difficulty with my comprehension  I started reading out loud and that helped immensely  But I couldn t read the whole book out loud as much as I wanted to cause I don t like sore jaws  dry throats  and people thinking that I talk to myself  Actually  that last one doesn t really bother me  I talked to myself out loud about talking to myself  Then I thought  this is a lot of fun reading aloud  You know what would be a really good idea  A radio show  Definitely my cup of something that vaguely tastes like tea  END   The HGTG is the best I ve read in my life it is extremely funny and gets 5 stars from me  It s about Aurther Dent who lives on earth he finds the planet must be destroyed to make way for a bypass and manages to escape by the nick of his teeth I highly advise you read this you ll be doing yourself a favour    creative writing I think The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is the third most quoted book  after The Bible and The Huge Book of Quotes  My favourite quote is quite simply   Space is big  Really big  You just won t believe how vastly hugely mindboggingly big it is   A quote that is always forgotten when it comes to contemporary science fiction where spaceships fly next to each other  and soon it all just becomes two dimensional The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is my favourite science fiction AND philosophical AND comedy novel of all time  Adams manages to capture the great question of life  the Universe  and Everything giving us an answer that suites our absurd universe with a sense of ironic fulfilment   forty two    and he takes the human condition with a pinch of salt by making our problems tiny and unimportant compared to the confusing laws and rules of the galaxy It is a book I would recommend to anyone from any demographic who seeks possible questions to the deep vastness of space and our minds  I would also tell them about Marvin the Paranoid Android  Always the depressed robot  This is a wonderful story of a man who just happens to be an intergalactic hitchhiker but not by choice  It s witty  funny  quirky and full of fun  Douglas Adams does a great job with making a fun story that tickles the funny bone  I listened to this on audiobook during a particularly long road trip with my family  a typically dramatic event  go by with minimal fighting from the backseat  A must read  4 5 5The beginning and the ending were brilliant  but some of the stuff in the middle was muddled and seemed to have no direction  as if the author had a lot of amazing ideas but didn t know how to tie them into a cohesive story And those cops at the end were so Monty Python  I wish we would have seen more  The universe is a joke  Even before I was shown the meaning of life in a dream at 17  then promptly forgot it because I thought I smelled pancakes   I knew this to be true  and yet  I have always felt a need to search for the truth  that nebulous  ill treated creature  Adams has always been  to me  to be a welcome companion in that journey  Between the search for meaning and the recognition that it s all a joke in poor taste lies Douglas Adams  and  luckily for us  he doesn t seem to mind if you lie there with him  He s a tall guy  but he ll make room For all his crazed unpredictability  Adams is a powerful rationalist  His humor comes from his attempts to really think through all the things we take for granted  It turns out it takes little more than a moment s questioning to burst our preconceptions at the seams  yet rarely does this stop us from treating the most ludicrous things as if they were perfectly reasonable It is no surprise that famed atheist Richard Dawkins found a friend and ally in Adams  What is surprising is that people often fail to see the rather consistent and reasonable philosophy laid out by Adams  quips and absurdities  His approach is much more personable  and less embittered  than Dawkins   which is why I think of Adams as a better face for rational materialism  which is a polite was of saying  atheism   Reading his books  it s not hard to see that Dawkins is tired of arguing with uninformed idiots who can t even recognize when a point has actually been made  Adams  humanism  however  stretched much further than the contention between those who believe  and those who don t We see it from his protagonists  who are not elitist intellectuals  they re not even especially bright  but damn it  they re trying  By showing a universe that makes no sense and having his characters constantly question it  Adams is subtly hinting that this is the natural human state  and the fact that we laugh and sympathize shows that it must be true It s all a joke  it s all ridiculous  The absurdists might find this depressing  but they re just a bunch of narcissists  anyhow  Demanding the world make sense and give you purpose is rather self centered when it already contains toasted paninis  attractive people in bathing suits  and Euler s Identity  I say let s sit down at the bar with the rabbi  the priest  and the frog and try to get a song going  Or at least recognize that it s okay to laugh at ourselves now and again  It s not the end of the world It s just is a joke  but some of us are in on it  Much like many a friend who has heard I hadn t read this book  I got yet another expression of shock as recently as this month at such a declaration  Luckily  this one allowed me to borrow her book on the condition that I both read it and enjoy it  Too happily did I proceed to do as prescribed  Can t believe I have gone this long not having read Douglas Adams  A treasure  Towels will forever hold a deeper meaning in my life   Amazing book  If you don t enjoy this you must be dead inside  This guy crazy man   d You have to like nonsensical sense of humor to like this book  but I do  so I loved it  I couldn t keep chuckling as I was reading it  drawing stares from fellow commuters on the train to work and back  and questions from my husband about what s so funny about this book  Reminds me of one of some of Stanislaw Lem s stories I read long time ago  Similarly witty  The Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy by Douglas Adams is the beginning of a whole series  This book was a great book to read it starts off slow and gradually speeds up  The book kept you interested by always having something exciting or interesting going to happen from earth getting blown up to meting a three headed man called Zaphod beeblebrox  The story was laid out very well but was a small bit predictable near the end  Like when the rats wanted Arthurs brain because the thought it had the answer to the ultimate question  Laugh out loud funny and a brilliant polemic on the nonsense that is the red tape world  I loved every page  Someday I m going to have to read the rest of the books  I read this book every few years and each time I do  I laugh out loud  It is the only book that I know of that can make me do this  If you are a Monty Python fan  this book will be up your alley   This is what Monty Python feels like when transformed into text Douglas being the seventh samurai of the bunch  it stands to reason  This was a good novel to end my Worldswithoutend com read it again challenge  It was just as fun and had the same dry British humor I remember as a teen  For the life of me I don t know why I never went on to read the rest of the novels in this series  I guess I will have to do it now  Terrible Fun     Never go anywhere without your towel  Before reading this book  I had watched the movie with my dad  its our new favorite movie to watch together now   and I REALLY loved it  So that year for Christmas my dad got the book  but since he s not a big reader  he gave it to me  and I have to say  it was just as good as the movie  if not  even better    I found that reading the book after the movie  I noticed that the movie was basically the same as the book  which is good  in fact  I think all movies based off books should be like this  Anyway  I really enjoyed it and it gave you some philosophical things to think about on your down time for sure    Computer  what s the answer to life  the universe and everything        42   Ah  I love you Douglas Adams p   There isn t enough books like this on the shelves and this is why I adore this novel  It s just so spontaneous and jam packed full of crazy ideas and thoughts that s you find out more about the universe on every page  Adams  imagination is frustratingly amazing and I am not surprised at why the book is such a hit  La Guida galattica per gli autostoppisti e il primo della  triologia in cinque parti  omonima scritta da Douglas Adams nel 1979  come risultato della trasposizione delle prime quattro puntate della serie radiofonica  trasmessa con lo stesso nome  da lui condotta per una radio londinese E  l autore piu conosciuto di quel genere letterario che prenede il nome di Fantascienza Umoristica Trama di Guida galattica per AutostoppistiArthur Dent e un essere umano comune  Vive da solo in una piccola citta inglese  lavora per una radio  cerca la donna della sua vita  Ha una vita equilibrata  va al pub a bere con gli amici  trova abbastanza soddisfazione nel lavoro    E il suo miglior amico e un aspirante attore che si chiama Ford Perfect  una persona un po strana ma simpatica La vita di Arthur Dent viene turbata da 3 fatti  avvenuti tutti lo stesso giorno  il primo e che il comune in cui risiede vuole demolire la sua casa per farci passare una tangenziale  il secondo e lo scoprire che il suo amico Ford Perfect non e un essere umano ma un alieno proveniente da Betelgeuse 5  la terza e che i Vogon  una specie galattica di burocrati che regge a tutti gli effetti il Governo Galattico ha deciso di demolire la Terra per farci passare una tangenziale galattica Ford riesce a salvare Arthur facendo l autostop sulla nave Vogon  comincia il vagabondaggio dei due nell Universo  illuminati dai consigli della Guida Galattica per gli Autostoppisti   Un libro capolavoro  anche per chi non e attirato dalla Fantascienza in senso stretto  E  un libro divertente e con un buon ritmo  scritto con sarcasmo e ironia ben al di sopra della media inglese Se per caso avete visto il film sceneggiato dallo stesso Douglas Adams  non potetevi perdervi questa geniale serie di libri    Le disavventure di Arthur Dent   Co  non riusciranno mai a stancarvi  This book was just weirdly awesome It made me laugh a lot It was so fun to read  but also it made me think about us  as human kind I loved it  that s it I m definitely going to purchase the next one And remember guys  don t panic   I really loved this book  It was hilarious all the way through and I m ashamed I hadn t read it sooner  I will look for more of his books  My favorite part     Vogon poetry is of course the third worst in the Universe  The second worst is that of the Azgoths of Kria  Durina a recitation by their Poet Master Grunthos the Flatulent of his poem  Ode to Small Lump of Green Putty I Found in My Armpit One Midsummer Morning  four of his audience died of internal hemorrhaging  and the President of the Mid Galactic Arts Nobbling Council survived by gnawing one of his own legs off  Grunthos is reported to have been  disappointed  by the poem s reception  and was about to embark on a reading of his twelve book epic entitled My Favorite Bedtime Gurgles when his own major intestine  in a desperate attempt to save life and civilization  leaped straight up through his neck and throttled his brain    Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is good science fiction book  I liked this book very much  Story starts with Demolition of Earth by Aliens  In last minute man named Arthur Dent has been extracted from Earth by his friend named Ford Prefect actually hitchhiker  a person who travel through out galaxy   Ford and Arthur travels in an vogan s Spaceship and Vogan are responsible for Earth destruction  Few moment later Ford and Arthur has been thrown out from ship  Rest of the story tell how they survived and finds the true reason for Earth destruction  I listened to audible version of this book read by Stephen Fry  Stephen minic every character in book that really nice  This book is very nicely written  I recommend this book to everyone  Its worth reading it   Series recommended to me my last summer as a camper  Amazing  I devoured the first four books in less than two weeks  Hilarious  intelligent  interesting  page turning laugh out loud goodness  Totally awesome  Later found some of his non HG2G stuff to be slightly less awesome  But still  great author   Pure insanity multiplied by randomness equals Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy  Now this is one of those books that is designed to make no since at all  I love this book  yes I m just pure gushing now  I can t help it  I love that it s a joke  Even if the characters are not meant to be too bright  I can t help but like them  Let s see you have a three armed  two headed  president  then there s the depressed Robot  the best friend who turned out to be an alien  Trillian another earthling  and poor Arthur with his towel in the middle of it all  This cast of characters is one of my favorites in a book series   O guia do mochileiro das galaxiasO livro mais absurdamente nonsense  genial  engracado  original e fora dos padroes que ja li  A cada pagina  uma enxurrada de ideias que parecem sair de uma mente com sindrome de deficit de atencao que conta uma estoria de ficcao cientifica sobre um terraqueo viajando pelo universo em situacoes de improbabilidade infinita  My dad bought me a copy of this book in the 90s  I was only a kid then  and I never understood old peoples  obsession with this book until I saw the movie in 2005  Judge me if you will  but that was when I realized how awesome Douglas Adams was  and I finally read the book  listened the audio book  read by Douglas Adams  so awesome   and started reading more of Douglas Adams  work It s hilarious and clever  and you can read it in a few sittings  What are you waiting for   I listened to this while on vacation  I love this entire series  but this was the first time I did the audio book  and it was interesting listening to the author s voice  Some author s can read  and some can not  I m glad that Douglas Adams could I wonder  are there bookstores in heaven  Are there book signings  I love witty science stuff  Its even better with a side of sarcasm and situational irony  It blows my mind just a little bit to consider Earth the way it is portrayed by Adams  I regret that the book ends with so many unresolved plots  but I enjoyed it so much that I ve already got the sequels on hold  WARNING POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEADMany people seem to have the misconception that this series is nothing more than a comically cynic look at the univere  But in reality it is so much more  I feel that Adams  captured the completely unpredictable nature of the universe in these books  the absolute insanity of it all that is widely ignored  He also gives exaggerated examples of all the different ways of dealing the universe  There s Arthur whom ignored the vast majority of it and instead focused on the trivial things  these things weren t fate of the universe important but they were important moments in his life  Zaphod and Ford didn t take life at all seriously  their primary goal was to have fun  even at the cost of the universe  There was Trillian whose life could have gone a million different ways and had to settle for one  never really knowing if she chose right  And there was Marvin whom was too focused on all the bad things of the universe to notice what was good  The mice took life too seriously  and wasted seemingly an eternity on a project that was destroyed  And there was Arrajj dont think I spelled that right  who wasted his lifes angrey and trying to avenge what had happen by complete coincidence  And so many other characters it would take forever to list  Overall I think that Adams  message was one of  whatever happens  happens  and  not to panic about it  as it s likely the fate of the universe did not depend on it  so not to take life to seriously but not to waste it on mindless pleasures  to try and do something with your life  but to remember to have fun with it at the end of the day  This may not be what Adams  intended message was  but it is what I got from it  And I think it s really something to think about   Douglas Adams  twisted brand of wit and humor propel this book to a wacky  five star conclusion at the End of the Universe  His best work by far  The wildly wacky novel that features Thursdays you can t get the handle of and teaches the importance of towels  The plot involves aliens and the last human s journey after Earth is destroyed  If you haven t read it yet  you are in for a treat Read my full review at Carstairs Considers  I really liked this book  It was so random  and often didn t make sense  but that s the way my brain works  Actually  that s the way my brain and my brother s brain work  my brother s more so than mine  Reading this hit close to home  as it was like talking to my brother when he s in one of his creative moods  It made me laugh  and got me strange looks for laughing at a book  Which is nothing new  I really recommend it  Even though this review had really nothing to do with what s in the book  Guess you ll have to read it to found out really  What a wild  wacky  fun book Not science fiction  not fantasy  just crazy fun A lot like Monty Python  Very British humor Why did I wait so long to read this  One of my favorite books  It s only flaw  in my opinion  is that occasionally it gets a little TOO silly  But most of the time  it s a fun and balanced look at life   specifically  what about it is silly in the galaxy wise scheme of things  and what about it is important  And it produces so many classic quotes and moments that it just can t be beat  Oh my god    Where to begin   That is one common way to begin the review of a book that you either love so much that you d do anything to read it all over again  no matter how many times you ve already read it before  or of one that you detest so much that you would puke at the very site of the cover  Fortunately  this belongs to the former category This book has literally made me respect the written word more  It has that effect  Humor  sci fi  creativity  it all peaks here  I have read  or rather heard  the books  the radio series and watched the movie because the style is one that cannot be imitated  Douglas Adams literally did himself proud  Whether you are a sci fi buff or not  this is a must read  The blurb will tell you what you need to know about the book  this review is just that extra nudge to send you in that direction  I absolutely loved this book  now I am hooked on the series  It is a hilarious book with lots of funny scenes  I enjoyed it because it took ordinary things in our world and added funny stories to go with them  It also compared the problems of the main protagonist  Arthur Dent  to things on a larger scale  It also has a very tangled and developed plot good enough to keep you hooked  This is a good book for anybody to read because of its sheer humor and good plot  but it is especially a good read for anybody who feels depressed because you can compare all your problems with the Galaxy s problems  The last time I read this was back in primary school  so that makes it a VERY long time ago now  but thanks to watching the BBC adaptation so many times over the years everything feels so familiar and just like second nature to me It s the small things like the guide entries that make this novel so endearing as well as the simply quirky and well  let s be honest  silly scenes that dot this particular book  What other book has a Paranoid Android  an old man by the name of Slartibartfast that lovingly creates fjords and a super computer that calculates the answer to the question Life  the Universe and Everything as 42   Sheer brilliance  And not to mention quintessentially British   I think that anyone with even a remote interest in Science Fiction or surrealist fantasy should give this a go  Guaranteed to give you a good laugh and some good advice as well  No matter how bad the situation is DON T PANIC and make sure you always carry a good bath towel around with you 5 stars  Douglas Adams possessed one of my all time favorite minds  ever  Hitchhiker s Guide may come off as just another silly science fiction read  but if one looks beneath the surface  the literary merit begins to jump out  The sarcasm is thick and elegantly written  if one doesn t pay attention  they will fall for Douglas Adams  tricks as often as the characters in the story  As far as a pleasure read  I thoroughly enjoyed it  The vocabulary is not too dense to be enjoyed  yet challenges the mind  Imagination is allowed to roam free with this novel  and that is something I find pleasing when reading not only for fun  but also for academic purposes  As far as literary merit  Adams  play on words  raucous humor  and sarcastic commentary of the human race make up a text chock full of academia and challenge  If you haven t read it  don t discard it just because you aren t into Sci Fi  Warning  You may find yourself laughing out loud  Mackenzie S  The man was genius  Mostly harmless    A cutting  comic diamond with smart doses of absurdism  and even hints of nihlism  Endlessly clever and quotable  great commentary on modern life  Makes me wish I was British  I had no idea what this book was about going into it  It was recommended to me by a friend  I started reading it and was taken aback by the sheer randomness  is that a word  of the story  As I got further into the story  I started enjoying it much more  I want to order the next books of the series and finish the series  I recommend this book to any who enjoys laughing out loud  I can t remember how many times I ve laughed out loud and my boyfriend wanted to know what was so funny   Mostly harmless   From the very first page  no book has ever done such a convincing job in pointing out the complete and utter insignificance of  well  everything  When I first read this treatise of sci fi satire and existential comedy at the tender age of 11  I turned into a wisecracking cynic overnight  with a powerful and absolute purpose to tell everyone I met that the universe is entirely out to play a cruel joke on all of us  The misadventures of ordinary Earthling Arthur Dent  Betelgeusian travel researcher and hitchhiker Ford Prefect  and the egocentric two headed Zaphod Beeblebrox as they come to grips in a cosmos where the only good advice is  don t panic  simply refuses to get old    in fact  the book has just gotten increasingly more entertaining in the 13 years since I first read it  Throw in a pharmacist in an existential crisis  a miserable robot that finds serving humans depressing  and a planetary architect named Slartibartfast  his name s not important  and you ve got a classic tale that s always excruciatingly dry  yet always explosively hilarious in all the right places  And of course  with side discussions from the most sarcastic travel book in the universe  we may all learn how big space actually is  and how it s really not that big of a deal  Favorite Quotes  there are a LOT of them  most of them from the Guide   In the days of the Galactic Empire  men were REAL men  women were REAL women  and large fuzzy creatures from Alpha Centauri were REAL fuzzy creatures from Alpha Centauri  Ford Prefect   Time is an illusion  Lunchtime doubly so   A towel is about the most massively useful thing an interstellar hitchhiker can have  Partly  it has great practical value    you can wrap it around you for warmth as you bound across the cold moons of Jaglan Beta  you can lie on it on the brilliant marble sanded beaches of Santraginus V  inhaling the heady sea vapors  you can sleep under it beneath the stars which shine so redly on the desert world of Kakrafoon  use it to sail a mini raft down the slow heavy river Moth  wet it for use in hand to hand combat  wrap it around your head to ward off noxious fumes or to avoid the gaze of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal  a mindbogglingly stupid animal  it assumes that if you can t see it  it can t see you    daft as a bush  but very ravenous   you can wave your towel as a distress signal in case of emergencies  and of course dry yourself off with it if still seems to be clean enough   For instance  on the planet Earth  man had always assumed that he was more intelligent than the dolphins because he had achieved so much    the wheel  New York  wars  and so on    whilst all the dolphins had ever done was muck about in the water and have a good time  But conversely  the dolphins always believed they were far more intelligent than man for precisely the same reasons  The last ever dolphin message was misinterpreted as a surprisingly sophisticated attempt to do a double backwards somersault through a hoop whilst whistling the  Star Spangled Banner   but in fact the message was this   So long  and thanks for all the fish   The history of every major galactic civilization seems to pass through three distinct and recognizable phases  those of Survival  Inquiry  and Sophistication  otherwise known as the How  Why  and Where phases  For instance  the first phase is characterized by the question How Do We Eat  the second being Why Do We Eat  and the third by the question  Where Shall We Have Lunch   I ve probably read this a dozen times by now and I still haven t gotten tired of it  There s not much else to say about Douglas Adams  genius that really hasn t been inhaled  exhaled  rinsed  and repeated  And there are seriously too many quotes I could cite that made me laugh out loud I just hope I still have my towel as I read the rest of his  trilogy   Love this book every time I read it  Funny  creative  disturbing   memorable   beautiful SF I ve read all the books in the series  my favourite is  Good bye and Thanks for all the Fish   I LOVE this book   Probably my favourite book of all time  It is effortlessly smart and hilarious  With no doubt at all  the funniest book I have ever read  This one is probably in my top 10 books of all time  NPR  National Public Radio  used to run a series  Survival guide   where they wouldask famous people  what book would you take with you if you were to stuck in a desert  or sea  for a long time   Since Iam not a famous person they didn t ask me  but I will answer anyway  This will surely make it to my list  I will even look forward to getting lost in a desert with some good books so I can finish them uninterrupted    Funny and intelligent  Very entertaining book  I first came across this as a broadcast on BBC radio and loved it  then the books came out and I read them avidly  This is a splendidly silly world with all current life problems pumped up to the galactic scale  A house to be demolished for a bypass on a planet to be demolished for a spaceway and a paranoid android with a brain the size of a planet and nothing to do but make tea  All this and more of our problems taken to bizarre but logical conclusions  Loose yourself in a galaxy gone mad but above all DON T PANIC  i am currently on page 56 of this bok so far arthur has been held hostage by evil creatures called vogons who are currently reading the third worst poetry in the universe to him the other character ford  who happened to be an alien  is dying of pure horror  than the vogons decided to throw them in to open space just for the heck of it  A quick  very fun read  Still a classic     this book is great  It reads the same way that Vogon poetry doesn t   A lot of fun  but too short  I m on to the second one right now  More later   The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is a fun  action filled  science fiction novel by Douglas Adams  The book starts in England where Arthur Dent s house is being destroyed to make way for a superhighway  Later that day in an ironic twist the Earth is destroyed to make way for a galactic highway  However  Arthur and his alien friend Ford Prefect  escape to space and there have many insanely enjoyable adventures in space  This book is one in a trilogy of four books  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  The Restaurant at the End of the Universe  Life the Universe and Everything  and So Long and Thanks for All the Fish  So if you re ever want to read some hilarious  science fiction I would highly recommend reading these books  Hysterical  Loved it  This is one of those rare books that you can read in one day  laugh a lot and realise that the author is not very concerned on writing an ultra important book or something like this  But then you also realise that this is going to stay forever in your brain s database  Just like a classic that it was not supposed to be Algumas das minhas partes favoritas        todos os planetas habitados por humanoides  reptiloides  peixoides  arvoides ambulantes e tons de azul superinteligentes  haveria tambem um planeta habitado exclusivamente por seres vivos esferografoides  E era para esse planeta que iam todas as esferograficas perdidas               Entao vou lhe dar uma coisa pra distrair sua cabeca    Nao vai dar certo   disse Marvin   Minha mente e tao excepcionalmente grande que uma parte dela vai continuar se preocupando        devido a um erro colossal de escala  toda frota foi acidentalmente engolida por um cachorrinho          Nao existe mais NENHUM BIG MAC  Desmaiou  The meaning of life is 42 Today I finished reading a book called The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy which is a book about 2 men finding earth destroyed and have to hitchhike their way to another planet  This book is very diverse from other books in the fact that they are hitchhiking space ships and learning at the same time  This also have a little aspect of racism because the aliens treat the two men like slaves and do not show respect  I thought that this book was handling many different aspects of the world well   It s partly the curiosity  partly a sense of adventure  but mostly I think it s the fame and the money     Brilliant  This book was hilarious  It reminds me quite a bit of Monty Python and the Holy Grail  One minute the main characters are about to die or get hurt  when all of a sudden  against tremendous odds  they are miraculously saved by something or other  The funniest book I have yet read  I fell from my bed laughing  It would be great fun if the universe turned out to be as mentioned in the book    Satire  humor  fictional universe    Adams is a damn genius  What s not to love  To add to it since reading  i have also Just finished listening to the audio performance by Stephen Fry and it is top 3 most entertaining audio books ever  Brings it all to life  I m heading to the restaurant At the end of the universe next    I have never found a better combination of humor and sci fi than in the works of Douglas Adams  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy had me laughing the whole way through  It has Monty Python comedy mixed with the logic of Doctor Who and a twist that makes it its own Poor Arthur has a mix of the worst and the best luck in the entire universe  He gets into a countless number of near death experiences  All in one day his planet is destroyed  he is forced to listen to the third worst poetry in the universe  and he gets thrown out into space to die by the Vogons who read that poetry  Of course he always manages to survive  partly because of his alien friend  Ford  who is actually from a planet somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse  and partly because of an amazing amount of luck that never seems to run out Ford s past is a mystery that is slowly unraveled as the story goes on  He is an alien from Betelgeuse  who is a traveling researcher for The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  He went to Earth to update the Guide s entry on the planet  He planned to stay for a week or two  but got left there  accidently  for fifteen years  There are many more things to learn about Ford  but putting them here would spoil parts of the ending There are several other interesting characters that Arthur meets  Zaphod Beeblebrox is the ex president of the Galaxy  and he has a huge ego problem  Marvin is a seriously depressed android  And finally  Trillian is another human who was stolen years ago from Arthur by none other than Zaphod The story centers on Arthur after he is rescued from his exploding home planet of Earth  It follows his travels as he and Ford are picked up by Vogons  cast out by the Vogons  and then picked up again  by the ex president of the Galaxy in a stolen starship fitted with the first ever Infinite Improbability Drive  Anyone can imagine that the rest of the story can only get more bizarre The narration does tend to jump from story to story  and many of these jumps seem completely random and even wasted space  but they do all tie into the book eventually  Even the spontaneously created whale that was alive for only a minute or two has it s purpose The biggest theme of this novel is the idea that the improbable is always still possible  If it weren t  Arthur and Ford would have died within the first 30 pages in the book  This classic work of science fiction will appeal to anyone who enjoys intelligent humor  It is an essential part of any geek If you want to learn the answer to the ultimate question of  Life  the Universe  and Everything   and see the marvels of the universe for less than thirty Altairian dollars a day  you must read this book  and follow two simple rules   Don t panic  and  Always remember where your towel is   I love this book  I read it over and over  If I m going to an interview or such and I need something to read but am nervous I ll take this book because its so familiar This is an original book   which is not very common The humour is wonderful   and so many bits I find myself quoting  I m a fan of Douglas Adams  humerous works  they resonate with me  and although they are all good I like this one the best  Funny  Offbeat  Witty Good for YA and Adult readers  Also good for those who enjoy BBC shows like  Doctor Who    Red Dwarf   and  Neverwhere   A decidedly sideways look at the classic storyline of the Earth being destroyed with only a couple of humans surviving in a universe full of strange and previously unknown aliens  Highly funny and entertaining  this series  main character is about as unlikely to be a hero as possible and continues to be so throughout the books  He is interested in a good cup of tea and not overly worried about the grotesque and cruel Vorgs who blew up the Earth nor the superintelligent interdimensional beings  AKA mice  who designed the Earth as the best supercomuter ever in the first place Recommended for those who enjoy Night Watch  The Player of Games  Dune  The Moon is a Harsh Mistress  and 2001  A Space Odyssey  blazed through this book  great science fiction  hilarious  entertaining  cannot wait to read the next   loved it   ordered next 4 books I grew up being told little bits of wisdom like the facts that I should always have my towel and that the answer to the ultimate question of life  the universe and everything was 42  but had never read the book I borrowed the BBC mini series from my aunt and watched the whole thing last year while my wife was out of the country and loved it So then when I got my sony reader for christmas  one of the books that came on it was an excerpt of the first few pages of Hitchhiker s Guide  I read the excerpt and then that was the first book I downloaded  And I finished reading about 2 weeks ago And oh my god  I loved it  I don t really think of myself as the kind of nerd who worships those books or anything  but it s just a really good book  and has instantly become one of my favorites  I also found it kind of cool that I read it on an electronic reader that feels kind of like the actual book within the book of Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  One of the best books I read during my high school years  and one of my first introductions to the British sense of humor  besides Monty Python   Plus you ve gotta love the  4 books in the trilogy  premise  Read  em all  Great book Such and enjoyable read and makes the reader to start living the world in it   This book is the best book I have read in a long time   It has a straightforward plot that is very funny  yet it seems something is hidden  The book also gives a charm to everything  even electronics   view spoiler  I found it funny when the car committed suicide as the depressed robot was talking to it  It was a very nice way to escape from a conflict  even though it wasn t purposeful by the main characters   hide spoiler   This book also makes you feel like the main character   view spoiler  as you have this feeling of the book going to fast  the character is experiencing new things very quickly  as well   hide spoiler   This reminds me of working too fast in a class  you feel flustered at the end  but you are still informed  I would recommend this book to readers who feel they don t have too much time at their hands this book moves pretty fast  but keeps you well told  or anybody that likes sci fi  as this book takes a  view spoiler  comedic approach  hide spoiler   to sci fi  Questo libro e bellissimo    Avvincente  emozionante  affascinate  ma soprattutto esilarante    Veramente spassoso a ogni pagina     Insomma mi pare piu che evidente come mai la Guida galattica per gli autostoppisti vende parecchio di piu dell Enciclopedia galattica     http   www naufragio it iltempodilegg    42  That s the ultimate answer for life  the universe and everything else but  what was the question again  This book is funny  very light reading and full of flashbacks and pauses where the book transforms into the Guide  so the reader will have to pay attention to those little pieces of information in order to understand the whole  Loved this first book  This is my favorite book  and book  trilogy   in the whole wide world  I only get to say that in one review  and here it is  Douglas Adams  characteristic sense of humor is built into his writing style  Sometimes the joke is the syntax of a sentence itself  Occasionally  a footnote will take up the majority of the page  He is very good at coming up with new and apt figures of speech rather than using worn out metaphors   The ships hung in the sky in much the same way that bricks don t  This is a journey through space  It comes to the unsettling conclusion that the Universe  as a whole  doesn t make sense  Then it cheerfully accepts the absurdity of existence  and it empowered me to do the same   The characters are memorable and entertaining  This is one of the books that I will come back to over and over when I need cheering up  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is the almost unbelievably unique story of Arthur Dent  Arthur Dent  who s house and planet have just been destroyed  Despite truly mind bogglingly impossible odds  his best friend  Ford Prefect  is an alien hitch hiker who has been stranded on the backwater  middle of nowhere planet called Earth  Able to hitch a ride aboard one of the vessels sent to destroy Earth  Arthur and Ford are able to escape within seconds of the planet s destruction  The two proceed to meet  despite astronomical odds against them  negated with an improbability drive on board a space ship  the two are able to hitch a ride on The Heart of Gold  which has just been stolen by the president of the universe  who Ford also happened to know personally  The story follows the group of space travelers as they find mythical planets  depressed androids  Earth ruling mice  and machines that don t understand the meaning of tea The pros Douglass Adams shows unending wit throughout the entire story  criticizing society  government  and strange things we all do  It forces the reader to take a good  often hard look at the world around them and laugh at it  He frequently remarks on the absurdity of the lives we all live  This story is also completely unique  it goes beyond earthly archetypes and preconceptions  When dealing with unearthly life  you cannot expect earthly tradition to make any sense The cons One of my few complaints about this book is the length  This book is a fraction of the story is could have been  This is mostly due to Adams being notoriously bad at meeting deadlines  He has said that he enjoys the whooshing sound a deadline makes as it flies by  This issue  however  is addressed with the several sequels written  My only other complaint is that the story doesn t seem to have been planned out in advance  and was written as Adams was typing it  While no damage is made to the story s continuity  it does lead to a bad habit of putting in details of what happened in the past into the story just before they become relevant  Funniest thing I have ever read  Too funny in a completely moronic way not to give it five stars  Always good for a laugh no matter how often I read the series  Malato  geniale  ilare  intollerabilmente divertente  imprevedibile    Quali altri aggettivi potrei usare per descrivere questo libro L ho comprato dopo aver ricevuto piu e piu consigli positivi  quasi per accontentare gli altri  piuttosto che me  a me le cose demenziali  e per di piu fantascientifiche  non sono mai andate giu Altro che demenziale  questo libro e ironia pura  E per di piu mai scontata Ho letto le avventure di Arthur  Ford  Zaphod  Marvin e Trillian in un soffio  fermandomi dopo alcuni periodi ridendo da sola come una scema  Perche questo libro fa ridere  Fa ridere DAVVERO  Sembra incredibile  eppure e cosi  le spiegazioni della Guida sono superbe  e dietro ai ragionamenti piu irrazionali si nasconde spesso una incredibile consequenzialita logica  ci si potrebbe perdere  stando dietro ai vaneggiamenti plausibilissimi di Adams  Vorrei citare episodi e personaggi  ma sono convinta che questo libro vada letto a scatola chiusa  avendo cosi l opportunita di rimanerne ancora piu folgorati E ricordate  42 surprisingly enlightening  Normaal lees ik boeken niet meer dan een keer  maar voor The Hitchchiker s guide to the Galaxy maakte ik graag een uitzondering  Het blijft een briljant en hilarisch stukje literatuur dat niet mag ontbreken in een geeky boekenkast  Zelfs nu moest ik luidop lachen met de rare hersenkronkels van de auteur  de passages uit de hitchhiker s guide en de geniale dialogen  Mijn favoriet  personages  blijven natuurlijk de depressieve robot Marvin en de orgastische deuren in The Heart of Gold   This was my first time reading The hithchiker s guide to the galaxy  and I am currently making my way through the series  Douglas Adams clearly had a huge mind  to be able to come up with such an amazing and comedic sci fi book  and no doubt  series   Although this book is full of humour  it is also a satirical piece  satirises governments  military  capitalism and organised religion  It s highly entertaining  making me laugh out loud  while still providing interesting commentary on  life  the universe  and everything    The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams is the first book in a five book series  It follows a man named Arthur Dent and his friend Ford Perfect as they make their across the galaxy to find the answer the ultimate question to life  the universe and everything  Well they made their journey they came across the President of the Galaxy Zaphod and his girlfriend Trillian  Who was also the most wanted man in the galaxy for stealing the first ever improbability drive spaceship Heart of Gold  In the end they found out what the answer was and a secret about Erath that no one would see coming  This was a great book that brought great comedy with it Douglas Adams did a great job showing how Arthur is out of place in this galaxy and now sees that no one thinks Earth was barley worth mentioning it in the book inside of the book  This all changed when Arthur and Ford found out that Erath was not a planet but a computer  This may all sound serious but Adams makes this book very funny  From the way he describes everything that the main charters encounters and the randomness of their adventure  He even took the time to call out rival writers  His charters are super funny with each with a traits that are original  Arthur at first seems like a normal guy  but turns out to be an idiot with no common sense  Ford is all about having fun and is clam in most situations even when facing death  Zaphod has two heads but makes Arthur look like Einstein and never thinks about what he does  Trillian is normal and takes a motherly approach to the rest of the cast  This book couldn t be more unique in the sci fi genre mixing the story telling of Star Wars and the comedy of an Adam Sandler movie perfectly together  Anyone who enjoys sci fi or a good laugh should read this book  Hitchhikers will rank as one of the best books written about sci fi  It s one of those books everyone should read before they die and should be read in schools   I absolutely loved this book  I enjoyed reading about Adams  view of the future and what would happen if Earth was destroyed  The characters were very relatable  even if most of them were aliens  and the plot was exciting  A must read for everyone  even if science fiction isn t your thing  Definitely glad I bought all 5 at once because this one ended way too soon  Absolutely one of my new favorites  Awesomely funny    Hilarious Papierovu knihu som citala dvakrat a teraz som si ju vypocula ako audioknihu vo vybornom podani Vojtu Dyka  Jeho prednes  v ktorom kazdu postavu nahovoril inym hlasom  bol skvely  Dostal ma najma hlas Prostetnika Vogona Jelca  ktory znel presne ako jemny a blahosklonny Kaja Gott pocas svojho 1738  interview    A modern day classic for a reason  1 2015  I reread this  and I forget how    well    writerly it is  Often  what sticks with me about HGTTG are the visuals and the easy quotes  as if I keep a cartoon version  or Monty Python sketch version  of the series in my head  When I read it  however  I see Adams writing in the same vein as P G  Wodehouse or Jerome K  Jerome  just with a focus on science fiction  I forget that there s a lot of wonderful language  My favorite quote this time was this one   One of the major difficulties Trillian experienced in her relationship with Zaphod was learning to distinguish between him pretending to be stupid just to get people off their guard  pretending to be stupid because he couldn t be bothered to think and wanted someone else to do it for him  pretending to be outrageously stupid to hide the fact that he actually didn t understand what was going on  and really being genuinely stupid  He was renowned for being amazingly clever and quite clearly was so   but not all the time  which obviously worried him  hence the act  He preffered people to be puzzled rather than contemptuous  This above all appeared to Trillian to be genuinely stupid  but she could no longer be bothered to argue about it Sadly  the ending falls flat  You get an action scene  of all things  with some alien cops  a quick denouement  and then it s off the Restaurant at the End of the Universe  To understand this book  curl up in a bed with a fuzzy pet  dog or cat  as long as they love you   the person you love  no sex   your favorite movie  and a cup of hot chocolate  and smile  This novel just makes you feel better about everything  as does the movie  but it doesn t capture it as much as the novel    hilarious Get the audiobook  it essentially twice as funny then  This book was actually  and I don t regularly use this word  a delight to read  This is everything I love about science fiction  the universality of the human experience despite the location in space or time  the simultaneous fear and advancement of technology  but with depressed robots  spluttering Englishmen  and sentences like  The ships hung in the sky in much the same way that bricks don t   It s definitely one of those books that I can t believe I haven t read before  and also a book that I m deeply saddened to have seen the movie first   Douglas Adams has always been held as one of my top five authors  Adams originally came up with the plot of HGG when he was hitchhiking through Europe  He later made it into a radio show in England  and eventually it found its way into a novel While the series of HGG becomes a bit tired  more reviews to follow  the first book should be on everyone s read before they die list  The writing is whimsical and light and while it would be easy for the characters to lack any depth Adams makes them all the more real The main characters of HGG are Arthur  a Earthman who at the beginning of the novel is trying to save his house from being demolished for an express way  Ironically enough  the Earth is also about to be demolished to make way for an express way  Thankfully Arthur s friend  Ford Prefect  is actually an intergalactic hitchhiker and bums a ride on the ship that is destroying the Earth  This is just how the story begins  The plot becomes a lot more convoluted from there This is a definite must read book   even if it is just to mention at parties  o o this is good book like woah good and silly  Nao precisei de mais do que 10 paginas pra ter certeza que esse e um dos melhores livros que ja li Simplesmente genial  I liked this book so much that I read it twice in one week once  That almost never happens to me with books  even the ones I love to death If you like British humor  bizarre circumstances  and the idea of a President of The Galaxy that s a stoner and a bit of a troll  Zaphod Beeblebrox 2016    you re going to love this book  Even if you generally hate sci fi  or don t have much exposure to it  read this book anyways  You ll thank me later  Great f n book   Title says it all  I enjoyed the ride  and want to read more of Adams work  Great book in its description of space time continuum  and building the picture of how large our universe is  Heard the movie wasn t the greatest  though    It is an important popular fact that things are not always what they seem  For instance  on planet earth man had always assumed that he was more intelligent than dolphins because he had achieved so much   the wheel  New York  wars and so on   while all the dolphins had ever done was muck about in the water having a good time  But conversely  the dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent than man   for precisely the same reasons   Best book ever  A true classic  A book I ll read again The best word to describe The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is funny  The plot  the devices  the characters  everything works on humor  Not much time right now  just going to say it was I had a blast with this 5 stars A classic  you have to read this one if you like satire and humor  but it does have that British humor vibe going  One of the stupidest  funniest books i ve read  I saw the film first and found it quirky  While I was browsing in my online library  I chanced on this book and thought   Y not   The book is far more funny than the film I have to say  The British sense of humour might seem dry to many  but I am used to the British sense of humor by watching Keeping Up Appearances etc  Imagine one day your on Planet Earth fighting for your house and the next moment you are in a space ship  Your best friend is an alien who shoves the Hitchhiker s Guide into your hands  That scene made me laugh a lot along with the suicidal robot  Oh dear Lord    The book is funny  quirky and unusual    just what a book is suppose to offer to its readers  Fun  quick read  Having seen the latest film adaptation of this beforehand I knew most of what to expect  but still highly enjoyable   Tsitaty  Arturu samomu bylo okolo tridtsati  on byl vysok  temnovolos i vechno ne

Reread in May 2015 to prepare for some H2G2 inspired beer event nonsense  I can almost repeat some parts word for word now  While definitely a product of the early 1980s  H2G2 still works  Our 2015 Philly Beer Week event at the Grey Lodge Pub looks like it both allow old time H2G2 fans to geek out while also creating some ones who never heard of it in any of its incarnations   Mind blowing   the Universe  The characters expressed that what if there is indeed a guide to the universe  What would it say to you   well  that is my secret   D This isn t a secret here however  and you will need to read it to know just what this resplendent guide is Is it licentious  Is it pure  Is it scientific  hmm I love the queer attitudes and sayings  He was raw and funny What this book did for me  there is no understanding  It is like a leap towards something fresh and wonderful  Something everyone tried to do  but never accomplished  I loved it  It made all the theories and revelations melt into your heart  with the warmest sense of moving forward  It didn t say much about love  which is exactly the pin point of  blowing Taymara away   Why  I understand love is lovely to mention about  but we never grasp it totally  that s why we write so much of it  with the intention of icing it  I cannot  I tried writing about it too  but there is something awfully lost and missing from the connections of every line  Maybe  while you are surrounded by it in its totality it becomes part of you  more than what you need it to be  Some people write to augment it  I don t   D I loved this  because Ford and Arthur reminded me of features in my heart  They reminded me of everything else the World is  except LOVE between souls  Not going down that path  haha  I am not scared  but I refuse This is what they said  well some of the pieces that stood out walk on  walk on   with hope in your heart   D  nice no    DDON T PANIC   Say it  say it  Isn t it enough to see that a garden is beautiful without having to believe that there are fairies at the bottom of it too   D  well  yes  How just when you think life can t possibly get any worse it suddenly does   I think most will think this as negative  but this is wonderful  haha   D  DAll I want to do is make your day nicer and nicer and nicer  this is purely friendship    Trillian had come to suspect that the main reason he had had such a wild and successful life was that he never really understood the significance of anything he did   Tell me  isn t that true sometimes  if not most  m brother    DFord said exactly as he felt  and that I believed was creative  Too many times we feel disconnected  and we don t ever say it  Go on  I dare you https   www youtube com watch v M9K3K     just a song I was playing while writing it   D  D  these are just thoughts off the bench Yours truly and ever blossoming Taymara  Goodness  turns out my ebook was half a  making of  story of the film adaptation   and I had no idea I had finished the book until I read the last word  And it s AMAZING how unlike an  ending  the actual end of a book can feel when you don t realize you re nearing the finish  With a physical book  you always know   and even with a standard ebook  you know you re finishing   but here I thought I had like 30  to go so the end really didn t seem like the end  Weird indeedRegardless  it s a fantastic book  Extremely original  wonderfully humorous  and just a whole lot of fun to read  I m already hunting down the rest of the series  THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST HILARIOUS BOOKS I HAVE EVER READ         PEOPLE  PLEASE CONTENUE READING THIS SERIES            IT IS COMPLETELY AWESOME            Not exactly sure how often I ve read The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy but I decided it was time for me to re read the entire five book trilogy  which I believe I ve only read in its entirety once before   This first book was a quick read because it s so damn enjoyable  Douglas Adams is a brilliant writer  e g   The ships hung in the sky in much the same way that bricks don t    and since I ve seen both the 1981 BBC miniseries starring Simon Jones and the 2005 film starring Martin Freeman this novel just flows very easily The novel follows the hapless human Arthur Dent as he is whisked away from Earth moments before it is demolished to make way for an intergalactic expressway  He is saved by his friend  Ford Prefect  who has been stranded on Earth for several years  when Ford first arrived from Betelgeuse he accidentally chose a name he thought would help him blend in with  what he assumed was the local lifeforms   Ford was on Earth researching an entry for the eponymous guidebook  a wondrous machine with the words  DON T PANIC  written on the front Meanwhile  across the universe  President of the Galaxy  and Ford s cousin   Zaphod Beeblebrox steals the Heart of Gold  a new spaceship that runs on something called an Improbability Drive  His companion  Trillian is actually the only other human in the universe since Tricia McMillan left Earth years before when Zaphod charmed her leaving Arthur without anyone to take back to his flat  Thanks to the Improbability Drive  the four all meet again and with the help of Marvin the Paranoid Android have some crazy adventures across the galaxy  nearing dying seventeen times  Adams is very witty in his writing and the book sets up an amazing story  even giving us the answer to life  the universe and everything  Spoiler  It s 42  Double spoiler  The question this is an answer to isn t revealed until later in the series    I loved re reading this novel for the  I m assuming  fourth time  however  as you ll see shortly  I had a real hard time getting into the second novel  The Restaurant at the End of the Universe    I read it year ago  loved it and wish I still had a copy to re read This book is amazing  very funny and entertaining  It will most likely keep you reading for a very long time  Anyone who is a fan of narration satire and comedic science fiction will greatly enjoy this book  The plot is mainly just about an English man and his alien friend wandering around the universe causing mishap and trouble the whole time  If you are looking for an uplifting comedy series  this is a great book for you Reviewed by  Dane M   Wooster HS I cannot express how impressed I am with this book  It was a bit hard to wrap my head around the fact that the Earth really is The Matrix  but i didn t have to think about it for long because the book was so exciting the throughout the whole thing  If you don t like SiFi books however  don t read this book   Even though it is written amazingly  there is no doubt that this book is very SiFi and a little bit geeky  All in all  I really enjoyed this book and can t wait to read the other four in the series  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is a hilariously funny book to read  The story was great  the characters were not lacking of humor and description  and the setting was awesome  As a fan of science fiction  this book really had me interested and sometimes it was hard to put down  A truly classic book  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is a book that deserves all the praise it gets  I would love to keep hearing the adventures of Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect  I hope I can see the movie one day  Classic comic novel I ve read listened to any number of times  Very inventive story and comic scenes  great characters  Much of it has become part of the cultural idiom  What is the answer to life  the universe and everything  42  Now if we just knew what the true question was  The series of books derives from a BBC radio play  which though better hearing actors speak the lines the books are still excellent  It s my first time reading this book ever  I was already familiar with the general story because I ve seen the Martin Freeman movie  It s so fun  Douglas Adams is great at breaking away from the main narrative and telling little tales that enrich and build the little universe that he s set up  It s always engaging and never boring  I m sure I ll read it many more times in the future and continue to find new neat things  What a great experience  One of my all time favorite books  I listended to the audiobook this time  I had read it many years back   It is JUST AWESOME     Quarantadue    urlo Loonquawl    Questo e tutto cio che sai dire dopo un lavoro di sette milioni e mezzo di anni     Ho controllato molto approfonditamente    disse il computer    e questa e sicuramente la risposta  Ad essere sinceri  penso che il problema sia che voi non abbiate mai saputo veramente qual e la domanda   E geniale  Per forza che leggendo prima il secondo non mi era piaciuto  non c avevo capito nulla  Iniziate da questo e poi  se volete  leggete tutta la saga  e non ve ne pentirete  Vi assicuro che la parola per descrivere Adams e una ed una sola    geniale PS  Andro in giro per una settimana a ripetere quarantadue  Kaan Deniz VolkanL9 4The Hitchhiker s guide to the galaxyDouglas Adams DON T PANIC      Most important rule of hitchhikers  Find out the cheapest way to travel universe  Humans are not as intelligent as mice  There are many aliens and not all of them are good  What would you do if you left home planet  earth  The biggest computer of the universe tells the answer to the biggest question of the universe  To find the answers and more   The hitchhiker s guide to the galaxy  is the book you are looking for The ones who like science fiction should read this book  The hitchhiker s guide to the galaxy is considered to be a classical for science fiction  Also  there is a significant resemblance between Douglas Adams and Terry Prattchet  If you read Prattchet and liked it  Douglas Adams is the right writer for you  Our characters move throughout the universe and many spaceships  They are basically hitchhiking through the universe  stealing ships and much more and all of these are happening about 2000 years after Jesus s death  First time I heard the name  I wanted to read it but I was too little to read it  Then  I watched to movie to have an idea about it  When my father told me that book was far better than movie  I started to search one of the classics of science fiction  Then I forgot to read it  Sometime later  I saw it at Utku s hand and I told to myself  I have to read this book   Next day I went to a bookshop and bought a copy  I was so curious that I couldn t stop reading  It really deserves its name  You go to the different words by reading  It makes you forget the world and hitchhike through the universe  What if you have to leave the Earth with a stranger  an alien from far far away who is writing the most sold and best book of the universe  what could happen  If the name of the book is  the hitchhikers guider to the galaxy  than a lot could and would happen  Zapphold  President of the universe  is trying to find out who messed his head up  Ford is trying to write the new audition of  the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy   Arthur  earthman  is feeling homesick  Marvin  a robot with personality  is looking for ways to get rid of depression  A perfectly written book that doesn t need any change or improvement  Just perfect  You won t feel any frustrations while reading this book  Anybody can read it easily   Douglas Adams has his unique way of writing and creating  Like Marvin  a robot with human brain but 100 times bigger  He can calculate anything in milliseconds but because he has a personality  he is depressed  He feels completely alienated and lonely  No one understands him  Zapphold is a crazy genius  He does whatever he wants at the moment without thinking the consequences  The answer is 42 but question is unknown  With his completely unique and fantastic way  Adams makes you want to read the whole book in one night  This series was AMAZING  It had unusual but still hilarious aspects  but also had a strong and intriguing story line  Every book in the series was a little more creative  exciting and funny than all the rest  The laughter and adventure in this series is something that you will NEVER forget  Douglas Adams is clever and inventive in his writing of this series  it has the weirdest components and ridiculous plot  but not too much so  If you like having a good time  books and adventure  then this book is a must read  I ve been wanting to read it for many years now and I finally got round to it and I loved it  this book is brilliant  I love the style of the writing it was like someone was in your head telling the story  I could almost hear the voice of the narrator I don t really know what to say about this book  it s jam packed full of the bizarre and wonderful that keeps you smiling with delight and bafflement throughout  This book is short and sweet and starts and ends quickly  it goes off on little amusing tandems which add to the creativity and wit that this book oozes Definitely a read for anybody that has an imagination and who is looking for a fun book to read 5 starts  Arthur Dent is having a pretty bad day  even before the Earth gets demolished to make way for a hyperspace bypass  And then it gets worse  Much  much worse  Not the worst of which is finding out that his best friend is in fact an alien from a planet somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse  Equipped with a towel  a little yellow fish and a book  Arthur must navigate the universe with an assortment of the unreliable oddities of the universe  such as Ford Prefect and Zaphod Beeblebrox  Luckily for him  the fish is very good at languages  and the book is The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy I m going to start by saying this is one of the weirdest books I have ever read  It is as if the aim of the entire book was that the author decided he wanted to take the reader on a joyride of craziness  Now that being said  I absolutely loved it  The writing style is  to be honest  pretty out of the ordinary  and it took me about the first quarter of the book to get used to  Once that s settled though  the book is just fun  Punctuated with extracts from the Guide  the book touches everything from the meaning of life and the intelligence of mice to the British love of tea and the impossibility of the Improbability drive  The book is amazing if you re looking for a light  quick read and a whole mine of quotable one liners  and while it s a great way to relax  there isn t much in terms of a plot or a story  Yeah  it s there  but this book is to be read for its oddity and its humour  not for a particularly riveting story  I m going to end by badly quoting Adams himself   something along the lines of   The trilogy  has a long beginning  a long conclusion  and not all that much in between  Tl dr  Very funny  an oddity of a book  not much of a plot to it  a ton of one liners  How do I give this five stars when I also gave five to an epic like The Stand The guide knows what it is   a fun and light hearted romp through space that speaks worlds about our culture in friendly if not compassionately critical terms What does that mean  It means this book is a lot of fun to read  I am almost glad that I waited until adulthood to finally give it a try Adams writes with poor joy  You can see the characters bouncing on the page  And Mel brooks would be proud of the dialogue  All in all   I guess now I have to read the whole series  I m not a huge science fiction fan  but this was a quick read and hard to put down  I hope the others in the series continue the quality and most importantly the fun and joy  I listened to the audiobook as read by Stephen Fry  and I m so glad I did  Absolute perfection  I think it is true  We are a computer program with organic matter to figure out the big question  Also I want a towl  Douglas Adams is a strange British man and a self proclaimed   radical Atheist   Or at least he was  Unfortunately for the world he died of a sudden heart attack in 2001 leaving behind a legacy that will insure his immortality  at least among the nerds of world  He is best known for his Hitchhiker s Series that started as a radio show in which Douglas wrote the episodes  The show became an international hit in the 70s and made it s way to several medias including the book series and movie Americans are most familiar  This first book was world shattering   Forgive me   We are introduced to Arthur Dent  Fate s whipping boy  who s house is about to demolished and he only recently learned of this because the announcement was on a board in a forgotten dark basement  While daring the bulldozer he is pulled away by his best friend Ford Perfect because  oh the irony  the earth is scheduled to be demolished  These first pages should instantly hook any reader because it is a perfected form of Adam s writing and unique view on thing  The only way to describe his writing is someone whose had too much sugar and decided to write as many comedic things that came out of their hands even to point of risking being long winded  You can see this in the footnotes that can range from a single word to two pages  and yet are equally as hilarious without ever seeming to hinder the flow of the story  The only other time I have found a similar style was in Good Omens a more recent book  but it s writing seem more control and story driven  The remarkable thing is the jokes never feel forced despite the style closely resembling Monty Python  the narration takes a third person who sounds like a causal observer from a planet other than earth who has been more exposed to the working of universe  It is this outside view that allows most of the jokes that aren t reserved to Earth and it s inhabitants  The gold of these books comes from the irony we are shown about other planets in this universe  Don t believe me  The most quoted line comes from a super computer designed by an ancient race on a distant planet to find out the answer to life  the universe and everything  And after running it s billion something program it comes up with 42  The question  Well  it takes a grander computer and another book to find that out  I highly recommend this series  if you see it in the science fiction section of your book store  I implore you  pick it up and read the first chapter  If you aren t repealed by it  it s worth the buy and read  If you re like me and was mildly curiosity don t be surprised to find yourself a fan Here s wishing you good tea and good reads LongHair What more can be said about this book  If you find your house being bulldozed and the Earth about to be blown up to make room for an Intergalactic highway  you will really wish you had read this book  Just in case you don t have time to read the book  make sure you wear your bathrobe and carry a towel at all times  Keep an eye out for aliens in your local pub and you ll be fine  The Earth seems just as normal as it always has been  except for one man  Ford Prefect  Seconds before the Earth is due to be destroyed  he and his Earth friend  Arthur Dent  get picked up on a ship  However  the race that leads the ship doesn t like hitchhiking visitors  so they are brought to the leader  He reads some of his terrible poetry for them  and they get tossed out of the air locks  They are in space for 29 seconds  before  at an improbability factor of 2 to the power of 276 709 against  they get picked up by the brand new Heart of Gold  powered by the revolutionary Improbability Drive  They get attacked by an ancient planet making planet  they make it out alive  and they head to a restaurant at the end of the universe  This book is top notch writing  The two authors of Hitchiker and Funny Story have similar styles of writing  which is a good thing  except in this story the perspective constantly switches between Ford and Arthur  That element makes it very interesting  since you get to see how they perceive each other  This comes in close second to Funny Story  and not by much either  If this were to happen one day  I d follow every step in this book  provided I have a secretly alien friend    The Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy  by Douglas Adams is the closest thing I have to a bible  Absolutely brilliant  this book is so richly packed with comedy  science  fantasy and even good advice  that it can make you laugh out loud and reflect on quantum theory  at the same time Eventually you start to contemplate the possibility that the compellingly logical but surreal other world  that the author creates for us  is as likely to be describing how the universe really works as any other magical story  that mankind has come up with Even more compelling  unlike some of the more fantastic religious concepts that have been dreamt up so far   The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy   as least  uses all the laws of physics and advanced mathematics as the yarn that weaves the fabric of its reality  As a result I suspect that Mr Adams would probably rightly claim  that his fantastic version of reality is at least  slightly more probable  For me Douglas Adams was  quite simply  a genius Rory Cantwell The combination of comedy and fantasy makes it a unique book among others in my shelf  I ve a strong affinity for Science  Fiction  and science in general  but there are times when the actual science aspect of something just doesn t matter anymore  Philip K  Dick constantly did that  usually using the bits of future technology as nothing more than a plot device  or  at times  incorporating them into the characters themselves  And then there s something like this  a mind melting and bending and reconstructing piece that flashes back and forth between galaxies and realities with the push of a single button  It s in the same vein of science as minor backdrop  but it takes that a bit further  Actual planets are named  fantastic bits of technology that were only theoretical at the time are called into play to act as something more than just a plot driver  This is a man who did a staggering number of drugs  wrote for Doctor Who  and created one of the greatest pieces of science fiction in any reality it pops up in  And it s really bloody funny Just going through the first book  have the whole thing in a big omnibus  may review the others later  I d be giggling incessantly at the quips and scenarios that it presented  Being only 150 pages  give or take a few  it manages to create an entire galaxy the Earth is ignorant of as well as star ships and manuals to navigate the expanse on only about 15 quid  I d had a liking for Science Fiction stories  as I said previously  but this was the novel that made me want to actually attempt to write them  to shove as much of the ridiculous that the universe could hold onto the page and maybe make it spin off into the absolutely unbelievable  And yet I didn t care about that  it was all meant to be nothing more than a good laugh   A great friend of my have recommended this book  And that wasn t without good reasons  It s lovely to see how you can look at the world with a point of view that is not like a conditioned human being  It caused a big smile for a perfect sunday afternoon   I cannot rave enough about Adams  cleverness in this incredible book and subsequent series  His smart plot line is interspersed with sly  backhanded jokes at his characters  expenses  and his witty syntax makes every page a riot to read  Adams has this incredibly imaginative power to make intergalactic scenarios outrageously mundane and mundane scenarios epic  He capitalizes on the trivial and blows the reader s mind with profound philosophical snippets that are easily missed if one isn t paying close attention  Ingenious and refreshing  Adams  masterpiece s  are unforgettable   I laughed out loud a lot at this book in public and got a lot of funny looks  Obviously my favourite  I write these reviews for myself so I can remember how I felt about books  It seems like I probably won t need to remind myself of something etched in my mind but whatever  I liked it  It s good  I hadn t read this in 25 years  and I had totally forgotten just how fantastic it is Also  I totally get the Stephen Fry narrator love  Amazing performance  This book is hilarious  I have to say that it s one of my favorites  The author s writing style is great  Sarcastic  witty  and offbeat  he creates a universe that is filled with strange creatures and ideas  I really can t recommend this book enough  It seems like this book is either love or hate though  For me  it was love It s also heavily referenced in pop culture So go read it  Now  I have read this book so many times  I ve also listened to the audiobook quite a bit    when I was in middle school  I duped myself a copy from the library  and used to listen to it at night and fall asleep to it  As a result  I have massive amounts of it memorized  although I tend to remember some bits more than others  probably the parts at the beginnings of each tape   I haven t listened to it or re read it in a while though  so when I saw it as a free e audiobook download from my library  I jumped back on it  It was as good as I remembered  Space is big  You just won t believe how vastly  hugely  mind bogglingly big it is  I mean  you may think it s a long way down the road to the chemist s  but that s just peanuts to space  For those who haven t read the book  watched any of the adaptations  listened to the radio broadcast or the audiobook  narrated fabulously by Stephen Fry   here s your basic plot  Earthman Arthur Dent is forcibly removed from planet Earth  mere moments before its demolition  by his friend Ford Prefect  who turns out to be from Betelguese  They meet up with a chick named Trillian and the two headed president of the galaxy  Zaphod Beeblebox  who have stolen a brand new spaceship called the Heart of Gold  which gets its power from its Improbability Drive    which makes some weird shit happen What struck me most about this book on my one millionth experience with it  is nothing really happens  The major conflict mystery is not so major  and we never really have any moments of  oh  what s going to happen to our heroes now  But that really  really doesn t matter  but the narration and dialogue is some of the funniest shit ever committed to paper  And no matter how many times you read it or listen it  it never loses its power  Can I say it s Less than Amazing   Douglas Opened my mind to different dimensions with this Book   R I P Doug   and I can t wait to get my hands on the rest of the series soon    I ve been there  I mean out there  all over the galaxy  Not quite  actually  It s just that when I was looking at the stars that night  I noticed something sparkling  and was relieved that it was not a vampire and something fell in a thud  it looked like a miniature spaceship  peculiarly designed like the missing left shoe of Shaq  And it was what I thought it was  Imagine the thrill I had when I crept from a nearby bush to observe in silence this little spacecraft  I get tingles at the edge of my fingers when little  Lego like  beings came out of its tiny round door  They seemed harmless  partly because of their stature and partly because one of them is carrying the latest edition of the guide I know that guide anywhere  even if his model is the latest  It s newest feature includes its ability to fit any being s arm and projecting a holographic representation of a planet  alien  food  both edible and nonedible  and recipes including how adding lemon can heighten your sensation when you drink the pangalactic gargle blaster  These are fine features for the guide that small aliens like these one would find handy  They used to have an extra room in their spaceship just for the guide which meant more energy needed to launch and smaller other rooms  they had to fuse the cockpit and the toilet  traveling then was unenjoyable and was only done when necessary   The only flaw of this guide  all thanks for the editor s decision to cut the budget so that they can have more sushi every night  is that projections were 6ft tall  hence tiny aliens need to land to nearby planets just so they can access the guide  I stepped out of hiding  Greeted them with a hula dance and showed them my prized possession  my towel  what were you thinking     They gave me a Babel fish and we instantly became friends  Then they offered to shrink me to their size only if I m willing to travel with them  Who can refuse  I didn t  I spent my last summer before college travelling around  went to these tiny dots of a planet the Hubble scope will never see  I ate crumbs and enjoyed pools of pangalactic gargle blaster splashes on windshields  so my food is always free since nobody bothers to put a price on these  We nearly escaped the Vogons by posing as their fungi between their toes and felt relieved when they opt not to recite their latest poem  I did all this and more and all that time  mom thought I was in a remote village planting potatoes  They brought me home and re sized me back  I did the hula for the nth time and gave the Babel fish back  I dare not tell my mom of my little adventure and stuck out with the story that potatoes were my thing  I was grateful to have known about this guy named Arthur Dent  So happy to have read his travel book and yearned to have my own HHGTTG  So happy that Earth is back and that the fjords are still in place  If it weren t for this  I wouldn t dare dance the hula for aliens and be freaked out if a fish tried to live inside my ear  I wouldn t mind not knowing the ultimate answer to life  the universe and everything but will mind anything that sparkles in the sky  Who knows  maybe someone would pick up my signal  the one that is coming from my electronic thumb which is connected to my very own HHGTTG  PS  And maybe someday find the place where DNA went and offer him a drink and maybe if I m lucky he d share the secret of 42   Douglas Adams  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy chronicles the journey of Arthur Dent  as he unwillingly hitchhikes through the multiverse with his Beetlejuicean ally Ford Prefect  after the demolition of his home  his planet  the last place in the universe to get a good cup of tea  Douglas Adams in this book weaves plot  character  romance  humour  and action into a mess of parody and satire bringing together seemingly incoherent plot points into cogent storyline  Adams  greatest narrative apparatus is the omniscient narrator who forms the back bone of the tale  The narrator in many ways becomes the voice of the Guide the famous interstellar handbook for crossing the galaxy causing the inanimate book to become its own character  and form a meta effect in reading the book  This amazing sci fi book not only provided a plethora of laughter  but it really gave me something to deeply reflect upon  our society today  Is our society being controlled and manipulated  like the Earth  1 was being in the book  Will our beloved planet suffer from a similar catastrophic consequence   One of the finest and certainly the funniest series ever written  Shame the movies never managed to do it justice  Very funny and very clever  Will read again one day   This has got to be the funniest book I have ever read  And I know because I have read all the P G  Woodhouse books  This takes comedy not only to the next planet  but to the next universe  The story has no limits which means it has an Alice s Adventures in Wonderland form of randomness  But instead of fantasy its sci fi  I read this book any day over and over again  Annual Re read  Honestly one of my favourite books of all time  my favourite feature being that you can open it at any page and just start reading   this method makes the story even more enjoyable  Delightful and hilarious  with a certain tinge of the nonsensical   Absolutely LOVED these books  Any one who has wondered what is out there  should read these books  The antics alone are enough to be entertaining  The thought provoking meaning of life is always stirring in the back of my mind  and this series added more to my imagination  Forever will I miss the unwritten Douglas Adam s writings  I like to say that he just jumped ship  Hitchhiker s Guide had me hooked from the first encounter with Ford  I really did love everything about this book  From poetry that is painful and the significance of the number 42  Hitchhiker s Guide literally had me in tears from laughter in some parts  It was so perfectly British and witty that I d recommend it to everyone  Seriously  great book   I love British humor so much  This book was hilarious and dry and Stephen Fry is a perfect narrator   The general consensus of this book is that it s a  love it or hate it  title  mainly for the reason that some find it hard to get over the silliness factor  or see at as  just a bunch of fellows messing around in space   To be blunt  anyone who receives the books as merely this is pretty closed minded and despite how intelligent they may think they are  the book is flying way over their heads It s funny for the same reason why The Big Lebowski is funny  The links to Monty Python are accurate  but not precise  The book comes at you with 80s Scifi and 80s humour  and it s great   Time is an illusion  Lunchtime doubly so  In times when humor is reduced to double entendre and cliches  I hold Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  in this much polluted cultural zeitgeist  on same par as I hold meditation It is a book one couldn t believe exist  simply because the rare amalgamation of wit humor and philosophy  I could go on on about Zaphod Beeblebrox  who seems to me an equivalent of screwed up  drug addict  excessively tattooed hipster  Or about less significant characters like the sperm whale which springs into existence and the interesting questions it asks  But I ll rather just conclude with some lines which some clairvoyances and display of wit   Not only is it a wholly remarkable book  it is also a highly successful one  more popular than the Celestial Home Care Omnibus  better selling than Fifty three More Things to Do in Zero Gravity  and more controversial than Oolon Colluphid s trilogy of philosophical blockbusters  Where God Went Wrong  Some More of God s Greatest Mistakes and Who Is This God Person Anyway Some witty stereotyping   he was also a direct male line descendant of Genghis Khan  though intervening generations and racial mixing had so juggled his genes that he had no discernible Mongoloid characteristics  and the only vestiges left in Mr  L  Prosser of his mighty ancestry were a pronounced stoutness about the tum and a predilection for little fur hats On the ever talking human   At first Ford had formed a theory to account for this strange behavior  If human beings don t keep exercising their lips  he thought  their mouths probably seize up  After a few months  consideration and observation he abandoned this theory in favor of a new one  If they don t keep on exercising their lips  he thought  their brains start working On dangerous poetry   Vogon poetry is of course the third worst in the Universe  The second worst is that of the Azgoths of Kria  During a recitation by their Poet Master Grunthos the Flatulent of his poem  Ode to a Small Lump of Green Putty I Found in My Armpit One Midsummer Morning  four of his audience died of internal hemorrhaging  and the President of the Mid Galactic Arts Nobbling Council survived by gnawing one of his own legs off  Grunthos is reported to have been  disappointed  by the poem s reception  and was about to embark on a reading of his twelve book epic entitled My Favorite Bathtime Gurgles when his own major intestine  in a desperate attempt to save life and civilization  leaped straight up through his neck and throttled his brain On perception   It is an important and popular fact that things are not always what they seem  For instance  on the planet Earth  man had always assumed that he was more intelligent than dolphins because he had achieved so much  the wheel  New York  wars and so on  while all the dolphins had ever done was muck about in the water having a good time  But conversely  the dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent than man  for precisely the same reasons I ll stop  Go have a read and revive what humor and wit is like  Can there be any other books that can make me enjoy the mad science and at the same time laugh this much   I love this book    I started this book because of a preview for a movie of the same title that I remembered seeing when I was about ten  It was a very   strange preview  and so when I heard that it was based off of a book  I wanted to see if the book would be worth reading  It most definitely is  This book is easy to read and pokes fun at traditional science fiction along the way  The humor found in the satire is completely deadpan  which makes it all the more fun to read  Adams does a great job of delivering this book  A very entertaining read  This review is harmless  well mostly harmless For any misappropriation taking place in this universe or any other  real or imaginary  because of reviewing the second book first and first book second  I shall not be held responsible  Because  disclaimer seems to be the best way to get out of the accusation for any misfortune one brings  Now since we have that sorted out  we get back to The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  I am yet not very sure if I am reviewing the book inside the book or the book which talks about the book inside the book  In any case I am pretty sure that hundred odd mice living on the second last planet on the penultimate planetary system in the ultimate galaxy on my left hand side are in consensus with me that every man once in his life must eat Prawns  And  since we are all for equality and prawns are not that expensive we generalize that statement to women too  Also  since we have been fighting tooth and nail for animal rights  it will be completely unnerving to someone in this universe if we restricted all the animal forms out of this generalization  Except for Prawns  because certain planets  if they exist  are still to come to terms with cannibalism  Now that we have that sorted  lets get back to The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy  It is certainly amazing  how we always converge back to this book for no apparent reason  Some Apes on certain planet researching on attractive forces of objects believe this book to be a black hole for attention span and interest   once pulled in  it can not escape  But  then they also believe they should not be called Apes  What to say  Apes will be Apes  While the attractive forces are common knowledge among Apes  it is widely published as  The Secret   But then Apes do not read that book  But then Apes do not read any book  Probably we do not publish any book for Apes  I am pretty sure that will be unnerving to someone on the planet which has yet not come to terms with cannibalism  So the book is not necessarily a guide to hitchhiking in the galaxy if you read from start to end  But then this book never asks you to read it from start to end  in fact it doesn t even ask you to read it from end to start or for that case in any particular order  But since the reading habit of most humanoids are in rudimentary state it is suggested you may read it start to end  If you reach the end  you have certainly liked it  If you did not  don t come crying to me when you have no clue what to do on getting lost while hitchhiking between time and space  You asked for it   A brilliant book  reminds me of Rincewind   Brilliant  Entertaining  The first time I read this  I was finally emerging from a Star Wars obsession and learning that science fiction can be funny and brilliant  rather than dull and poorly written   The last time I read it  I had just finished watching some of the Doctor Who episodes that Adams wrote  Turns out  Hitchhiker s Guide was initially conceived as a Doctor Who story  but after getting rejected  Adams reworked it as a radio play  and later  as a novel  with Ford Prefect and Zaphod Beeblebrox standing in for Tom Baker s Doctor  What can I say about this book  It s officially been my favorite book for about 20 years now  but I can t come up with the words to review it  All I can say is that reading Adams  work forever reshaped  or perhaps warped  my brain and changed the way I thought about  space  writing and comedy  As a someone who plays around with writing myself  I can honestly say that no other book has had a greater impact on my style than this one  My best writing contains  hints  shades and notes of Adams  my worst writing typically comes from trying to sound too much like him  The only down side to the Guide series is that it  like the life of its brilliant writer  ended far too soon  I sincerely believe that Douglas Adams is one of the best things that could ever happen to humoristic literature  His unbelievable analogies  comparisons and descriptions are hilariously ridiculous and yet you somehow manage to imagine what he was describing  As a huge sci fi fan  I simply adore this book  I would recommend it to anyone who I know enjoys this type of books  though I understand that Douglas isn t an author anyone would enjoy because of his peculiar style  For some he s just abnormal  for others he s extraordinary  This book will take you on a strange adventure  but even though it s so unusual  as long as you DON T PANIC and carry a towel  I promise it will be mostly harmless  DON T PANIC  Ingenious  hilarious  over the top funny  I was riding transit to work at the time I first read this  and this is the first book that made me laugh out loud  in public  The lady next to me leaned far away         but I was in hysterics  A landmark in scifi humor fusion  Alas  Doug Adams left us tragically in 2001  By the by  he also wrote for Monty Python s Flying Circus and Dr  Who  to give you an idea of the tone of his writing  Don t forget your towel  This is one of the most hilarious books i ve ever read  The storyline is good  but it hardly even matters because the writing is just so great and I probably laughed out loud at least once on every page of this book  The book mocks everything and everyone without seeming intentionally offensive just for shock value  This is defintely a book that I think everybody should read  even if it s just so you won t feel left out whenever people have a  42  in joke  Extremely amazing  As expected  a fun  quirky intergalactic adventure  I was already a fan of the movie but the book was better  Definitely  It s been a while  re  years  since I ve watched the film  I m almost tempted to stop what I m doing and pop in the DVD and do a comparison because that s the type of thing I like to do  In mezzo a letture un po  piu impegnate  un gioiellino cosi si fa apprezzare in tutto il suo splendore  anche per chi  come me  la fantascienza non la manda giu facilmente  Ironico  sarcastico  di un umorismo raro che mi ha fatto sorridere piu volte nella lettura  evento    non scontato  non volgare  Semplicemente geniale  Intriso di arguta satira e dalla doppia chiave di lettura  umoristica e attuale  fantascientifica e filosofica  Costellato di personaggi assurdi ma familiari  come il geniale robottino Marvin dotato di  Carattere da Persona Vera  depressa  da cui il Paranoid Android dei Radiohead  o il capitano Zaphod Beeblebrox  da cui il comandante Zapp Brannigan di Futurama   l inetto Presidente Galattico  ma tanto  secondo la Guida  il presidente ha solo la funzione di provocare scandali per distogliere l attenzione dal vero potere   no   Insomma un libro davvero memorabile  cosi pieno di frasi geniali che e tutta un unica nota a margine Peccato per la qualita dell  edizione  carina esteticamente  ma tra le pagine l inchiostro manca in alcuni punti rendendo alcune lettere incomplete e qualche segno di punteggiatura latitante  Poi le pagine sono tagliate male e grossolanamente  This book has used very simple language to interest many readers  The way that Adams is able to capture the imagery in his book with simple phrases and words is inspired  Many authors feel it is necessary to use complicated language for their book to be recognized  but Adams has proven that his wit and understanding of the human intellect  a simple  accessible  book can be just as good  if not better  than one with language that is difficult to comprehend  One of my favorite lines in this book is   Arthur slapped his arms about himself to try and get his circulation a little more enthusiastic about its job   showing that by personifying Arthur s circulation Adams has allowed us to see this simple motion in an easily understandable way while using interesting and beautiful language  As we get older  children are expected to read more complicated books and can sometimes forget the joys of reading  This book was an enjoyable brake from the norm of teen novels  One way to evaluate a book is to see which age group can read it  and I believe that Adams has done a fantastic job at making his novel available and interesting to young children through adults  If not the most in depth of novels  this book can still be read multiple times  which is fun to see what you get out of it at different ages  I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who is looking to enjoy an easy  but interesting novel   So long and thanks for all the fish  Softest place in my heart for this book   chr byd bh khtby khh yh lHZh hm zmyn ndhshtmsh w z khndh rwdh brm khrd 5 strh ndm z

42  Witty  funny  sarcastic  humorous and wildly entertaining   Extremely creative  Never read anything like it  Definitely have to read the rest of the books  Definitely kept me wanting more  I am so glad I finally decided to pick up this book  I really really really love this book  It is just so brilliant and hilarious and spectacular and awesome and    on and on  It is so mind blowing and so  free   Douglas must have had fun writing this book     3 Re read  My rating was a 4 2 But rounded it up to a 5     It is so much harder than it appears to write clever humour  and write it well  And  really  this book is a must read simply because of how absurdly funny it is  Not to mention how much of Hg2g has permeated modern society  babel fish  deep thought  and 42 anyone   This is inspired lunacy at its best  timelessly entertaining  I can understand why some people would find it whimsically annoying  but I challenge them to write something more light heartedly humorous and simultaneously deviously clever than this And  for the true hardcore fans  you should try the text adventure game of H2g2  It ll take the rest of your life for you to finish it  Hilarious  fun read Sensitive copmen  improbability  murky robots  Never laughed so hard reading a book   I don t remember when I first read the actual book  but I remember listening to the original radio show on a road trip with my father when I was five or six  There was probably no help for my sense of humor after that  The brilliance of Douglas Adams is how he keeps up the tone and the pace of the humor so that no matter how ridiculous it is  it all somehow seems plausible  The explanation of the Babelfish  or the miraculous creation of the Infinite Improbability Drive  are fun examples  but nothing beats the so absurd it s true feeling to the description of the beauraucracy of the Vogons  The asides to the narrator or The Guide  while wildly tangential  always manage to flow naturally out of the narrative  Lodged between the two large front teeth of British Humour  i e  Monty Python and Terry Pratchett   this good natured lump of parsley had me laughing out loud  With so many memorable images and lines  this is a classic for any sci fi fan If I had one gripe  it s that I was so wrapped up in the questions and events of the story that I missed the main plot  The ending caught me by surprise  Like others  I expected more closure on the question of the Ultimate Question I have to subtract 0 25 stars for Douglas Adams making the antagonist s story more interesting than the protagonist s  Rounding up  5 stars from me  view spoiler  When the book was over  I though   Oh no  I don t really need to read the others to complete this story  do I   I ve heard the others are not as good as this first book of the collection  It took me some thinking to realize that the book actually had ended as it should have As I see it  our protagonist is Arthur Dent  What does he want  To be able to live his life in peace  So who is or are the antagonist s  First is the councilman who wants to demolish his house  then it s the Vogons who demolish his planet  then it s Zaphod  the planet maker Slartibarfast  and things go on and on until we realize that it s been the mice s planning all along that s been blocking our hero from getting the peace he desires And what grand plan is stopping Arthur from living the quiet life  It s the search for the Ultimate Question  See  I believe that this story does not need to deliver the Ultimate Question  because it s not the mice s story  They re the true antagonists  It s Artie Dent that we re supposed to recognize as the protagonist The book ends when the antagonists are defeated  the hero gets what he wants  I think it s great  but as I said above  the ending suffered from my complete interest in the 42 Ultimate Question storyline  which was never Arthur s interest at all   hide spoiler   When uncanny imagination marries genuine humor  a book like this happens  The ideas are so rich they almost surpass humanity and lift our perspectives on a grand universe level  The characters also have become quite legendary for their unique sets of personalities  Read it must if you want to know the ultimate truth of the universe  Yes  At last the truth has been told  Sure you won t be disappointed  Vogan Poetry     Vogon poetry is the third worst in the Universe  The second worst is that of the Azgoths of Kria  During a recitation by their Poet Master Grunthos the Flatulent  of his poem  Ode to a Small Lump of Green Putty I Found in My Armpit One Midsummer Morning  four of his audience members died of internal hemorrhaging  and the president of the Mid Galactic Arts Nobbling Council  survived by gnawing one of his own legs off    The very worst poetry in the universe died along with its creator  Paula Nancy Millstone Jennings of Sussex    in the destruction of the planet Earth  Yes I have lived through Poetry written by someone from Sussex  this is Factually correct     lol  www ceciliayu com It was a fun read  Marvin is hilarious  I loved both the blatant and subtle humor delivered by Adams  Douglas Adamsin itsensa lukemana kirjasta loytyi paljon sellaisia asioita joiden savya itse lukiessa ei ollut tulkinnut niin  Valilla Adamsin aaninayttely eri kohtiin toimi erittain hyvin  parissa kohtaa tuntui kuin olisi naurahtanut vahingossa omille vitseilleen  vaikka hyvia olivatkin  Lampimia ajatuksia  Hieno kokemus  I found out about the book series from a friend but I only managed to start reading it as soon as I saw the movie   which was fantastic  by the way  Sure  some hardcore fans would have argued on and on about how Hollywood has wrought a disaster out of a legendary series but  to me  the film was fantastic  It was hilarious and intelligent and sarcastic  I couldn t stop laughing the whole time  Truth be told  not a lot of people in my circle understood British humor  but I would be darned if I don t laugh every time I rewatch that film  So  yes  I laughed all throughout the movie and decided  you know what  I ll finally read that book   So I did I didn t quite know what I was expecting  Sure  a lot of the elements in the movie were based off the book so I found it easier to imagine how things were going along  I simply didn t expect to read a book so crazy sarcastic and hilarious  I loved each and every bit of it  It may not make a lot of sense because it talks of aliens and telepathic fishes  crazy presidents and intelligent rodents  It even laughs at physics and existentialism  then goes off and predicts the existence of digitized books simply because it can  I love it and I can t get enough of it  If you re a huge fan of British humor then  by all means  pick this one up and go on an intergalactic adventure whilst drunk    because you can  I adored this book  It took a while to read b c it was rather long and it wasn t predictable  So  so funny too  There s this great part about a guy who lives forever and whose only goal in life is to go around and insult every single living thing in the universe  We meet him in the beginning of the book insulting our lead character and then halfway through insulting him again  He looks down at his clipboard and is like   wait  did I already get you   That had me laughing for DAYS   An absolute classic  and Mr  Adams was a brilliant writer  Read for a second time as some of the original radio show cast are touring Hitchhikers to theatres  and my venue happens to be one of them  Read in an evening and a morning  with regular laugh along moments and amazement at how relevant the book actually is  One down  three to go and loving every sentence  Love this book  One of the most hilarious books I have ever read  Unintentionally  it is very disarming  It comes out of nowhere  knocks you prone  then stands you back up to follow the story  Several times I found myself literally laughing out loud while reading  something I do not do frequently  as I am very self conscious  One of my favorite quips    The Total Perspective Vortex derives its picture of the whole Universe on the principle of extrapolated matter analyses To explain    since every piece of matter in the Universe is in some way affected by every other piece of matter in the Universe  it is in theory possible to extrapolate the whole of creation    every sun  every planet  their orbits  their composition and their economic and social history from  say  one small piece of fairy cake  The man who invented the Total Perspective Vortex did so basically in order to annoy his wife   Pretty amazingly hilarious  Deserves rereading  A genius type of verbal slapstick comedy where all and none of it makes any sense  Through the impossible fabrication of false universes  exploits in space time travel  and maniacal discourse of irrelevant alien races  it poses very human questions that one subconsciously ponders on a daily basis  Somehow throughout its absurdity   and I can t think of a better way to summarize it  it presents the reader with the realization that it s everything you ve unwittingly believed about everything  It stands as an atheist s admission to the futility of life but also warrants it s existence through humor and camaraderie  An awesome and hilarious book  Very clever  Douglas Adams really knows where his towel is  Probably my favourite ever book I had watched the movie many years ago and finally got around to reading the books  Not only was I glad the book varied slightly from the movie but even the jokes I did know I found my self laughing aloud as Adams delivery is so brilliant  I can t wait to see wait his other books have in store  This book totally blew my mind  Douglas Adams is so effortlessly funny and his whitty humour is refreshing and that this book makes it into my top five easily  His character development is very good as most the characters are intriguing and humoured me endlessly  Adams style of writing makes this book what it is as a modern classic as it a timeless piece of writing  This is the first book of this series and it successfully builds a curious anticipation to see what our unlikely bunch of hero s will get up to in the books to come  The constant sarcastic tone and satiric points of view makes this books very eccentric plot work well   One of the most hilarious books I have ever read  Yet  despite the humor  it was also able to maintain deep  insightful philosophical musing  The humor helped show Adam s opinion of a world that is ridiculousness and nonsensical  One of the best parts of this book is when the philosophers of the universe use a computer to seek the  answer to the universe   After 7 million years it answers simply 42  It then further elaborates that the philosophers never indicates what the question was  Stories like this are almost a satire on people who pretend to have a clue about what is going Ion in the world  Overall  this combination of hilarity and intellectualism makes this book a must read  5 out of 5  This book is absolutely marvelous  It s funnier than  The Scarlet Letter   It s longer than  Chicken Little   It s less poetic than  Green Eggs and Ham   And above all  it doesn t have near as many Greeks in it  well  anything by Homer  for instance  It is an incredible book  Based on the BBC radio series of the same name  this book follows the adventures of one Arthur Dent who  after discovering that his home and his planet are about to be destroyed to make room for highways  helps an odd humanoid from Betelgeuse name Ford Prfect write a book This book  I swear to God  had me convulsing and near throwing up  I was laughing so hard  It s just freaking funny     It even made my grandpa laugh  and he s Amish  illiterate  and dead  I have honestly never read or heard of a funnier book than HHGG  and the reason behind that is probably because such a thing does not exist So  read this book  If you can t read  have someone read it out loud to you  If you don t have any friends who will read it to you  buy the book on tape  If you can t afford the book on tape  for heaven s sake sell your computer and buy it  If you re computer s an old Commadore and even when you sell it  you still don t have enough money  sell your semen to a sperm bank and move to distant planet where you can prepare sandwiches until a long lost friend shows up with your child she created using your sperm that she found at some distant sperm bank  I don t care how you do it  Go get this book   This book made me laugh like no other  The jokes are funny and witty and I loooved it  I m ashamed of myself for taking 33 years to read this  It was absolutely hilarious and completely insane  and I loved every page of it  Looking forward to reading the next 4 chapters in the trilogy  Possibly the most delectably clever book in all existence   This book is one of the funniest books I have ever read  Douglas Adams is such a good author  and I could not stop laughing while reading these books   I have a compendium   I would recommend these books to anyone thirteen and up  For the most part it s an almost perfect book with a funny and  for the most part  witty book  Even the ending which left off on a cliff hanger still felt like a vision that the author had  The is was 4 people explore the universe on a ship called the heart of gold  Ones the president of the Galaxy two are from earth  which has been vaporized   and one is an alien who is an editor of a book call the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy  One of the few problems this book has is it feels something that is foreshadowing need to be repeated several time through the book which makes it so its not really surprising when it happens  A must read for anyone who wants to learn the meaning of life the universe and everything  My whole family and many friends have read  re read  listened to and watched the Hitchhiker Trilogy  just wonderful  I have listened to Douglas reading his books countless times  TV series was suitably faithful to the books and watch that again and again  movie was disappointing  expected much though   Thank you Douglas Adams  who loved the sound of deadlines rushing by Edit  Just found out my town has a club named after Zaphod Beeblebrox and it is known as The Nightclub at the Edge of the Universe  And they feature Pan Galactic Gargle Blasters  Ahhhh  I m laughing so hard right now  Too bad I don t go to clubs End of update The book was hilarious and Stephen Fry was phenomenal on the audiobook  I can totally see why this is a classic  Too bad the movie came in below par   Funny  Satirical  Ironic BookA great novel that shouldn t work but does  It s satirical view to the universe coupled with an interesting storyline and plenty of comedy make it a must read for Sci fi enthusiasts like myself  Funniest book I ve ever read  I could not stop laughing the entire way through  Adams has a true way with words that will leave readers in stitches  Cryptically funny   Douglas Adams  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is a beautiful piece of comedy  It is one of the first of its kind  a pioneer of literature  The book  revolving around the incredibly improbable misadventures of a young man named Arthur Dent and his extra terrestrial cohorts  is all around excellently written  The lovable characters are written in such a way where readers can easily relate to them and their troubles  The intricate yet sitcom like plot allows for a comedic element and a strong plot  Through these elements  Douglas Adams often voices his opinions on modern day society and modern issues  including ignorance  greed  and tolerance  Overall  I felt that the book was an excellent mixture of comedy  exceptional characterization  and a wonderfully convoluted plot  This book was definitely different from any book I ve read before  It was just so hilarious  and I definitely laughed out loud at least 20 times over the course of the story   view spoiler   From the mice to 42  to literally dying of shame  to the importance of a towel  the marketing division of the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation  a clinically depressed robot  and everything in between  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy was all in all really fantastic  It is perfect if you want a nice laugh with a nice helping of science fiction on the side    hide spoiler   This never gets boring no matter how many times you read  A brilliant satire on humanity and well  of course  a hitch hiker s guide to galaxy  Oh my word what a hilarious book  Couldn t stop laughing as I read it    I don t know why it took me so long to read it  since it s such a short book and it s absolutely amazing  I must have pulled funny faces at my book on multiple occasions because of the absurdity of it all  but that s just one of the aspects of what makes it so great  It s clever and hilarious and wonderfully written and I would recommend it to pretty much everyone   I loved this book and those following it  The movie didn t do justice to the book  However  the BBC television series from 1980s with Simon Jones as Arthur Dent contains the characters that I see in my mind now when I re read this story  This series was exceptional  Everything this author wrote was well worth reading more than once  The introduction to my all time favourite series  Hilarious  brilliant  amazing  42  Full review attached to the hitchhikers  compendium reread One of my all time favorite books  And The Long Dark Teatime of the Soul is my favorite title  perhaps ever  Thanks Mary Russell  for reminding me of Douglas Adams   This book is like a really twisted Alice in Wonderland for adults  in space  I m not usually a fan of the bizarre and the ridiculous  but this book somehow kept me laughing and cringing and slack jawed all the way through  and now I am itching for the sequel  It s also great to finally have some better context for all the cultural stuff   42 is the answer to the universe  for example   even if it hardly makes more sense now than it did before I read this  Great fun  If you share Adams  sense of humour  his Hitchhikers books are something that will stay with you  Relatively few books have a lasting impact on the language  but  Don t Panic  and  42  took on a whole new meaning  The radio series was brilliant  in my view  and the books stayed true to the script  as far as possible  Forget the TV series and the movie  Adams  humour works best in the imagination  funny and clever  One of my favorite books  Adams shows us that even in an inexplicable  absolutely absurd universe  there s still reason for happiness  A little corny  but hey  things get corny when you love something as much as I love this book  AWSOMENESS  I think it s safe to say that Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is one of the most beloved books of the 20th century  There are few authors out there who have fans annually celebrating his birthday by taking a towel with them everywhere they go  There are very few books out there I can nearly recite from cover to cover  I ve read this book almost on a yearly basis ever since I picked up a tattered softcover book as a child  I just finished it again a couple of days ago by listening to Stephen Fry s excellent audiobook reading for the first time Douglas Adams is a writer where you either adore him or you hate him  and the people who do hate him are generally people with a poor sense of humor or are entirely devoid of a sense of humor  The story follows an ordinary man who is thrust into this interstellar adventure after the Earth is destroyed  Stuffy literary types expect some profound philosophical journey where Arthur finds his humanity or whatever bullcrap you say in a Literature class to please the teacher  they are instead disheartened when it doesn t occur  Why  Because there s no depth to the novel  The novel exists to make fun of humanity and have you laugh about it in the process  and heaven forbid you have fun reading a novel Question  So  should you read the book Answer  42 Pretty hilarious stuff   REREAD This edition has publicity clippings and other hilarious material from the Douglas Adams archive  and it was a delightful way to reminisce on its success   which happened before I was even born  What a amazing little book  3 Douglas Adams at his very best      Laugh out loud funny and always clever another of my much loved book collection  Adams original masterpiece  you will quite literally love it or hate it  Adams style of writing is just too chaotic and involved for some people  usually thick people  but it s that very quality that makes him stand out as a writer  He humorously covers many difficult subjects involved in general day to day life  and gives us the tools to deal with them  Hitchhikers the world over can relate to the sage advice in this book  and so can anyone who has ever faced a seemingly insurmountable problem  It s quintessentially British and that may confuse readers of other nationalities because we are very odd  and often too polite for our own good  Nonetheless it certainly gives you an insight into the methodology and mannerisms of people from all different walks of life  I could babble on using all the usual adjectives  funny  inspiring  thought provoking etc  etc  but instead I shall leave you with this quote which summarises the style of the book very well   Myself  I d trust him to the end of the Earth   said Ford   Oh yes   said Arthur   and how far s that    About twelve minutes away   said Ford   Come on  I need a drink   Just finished 2011 Book  1  It is not  however  my first time to read the book  It is  without a doubt  a classic humorous tale  Where else can you read about the total destruction of the earth  and not really care    Also  the book gives us the answer to the ultimate question of life  the universe and everything  Pretty cool If you haven t read this before  go get this now and read it  Laughed so much while reading this  Must read if you want to laugh out loud   loved loved loved it   It was absolutely brilliant   and I had the audio book read by the brilliant Stephen Fry as well 4 stars for the witty story that will now make me even more weary of mice    and though marvin is self pitying and depressed  i so want to give him a hug  loved this page Turner and I can t wait to start on the others in the series 1 full star for the brilliant Stephen Fry  admittedly when he started in the beginning  it appeared as if he was just warming up     but when he did   It was so hilarious   read it on its own   then read it with the audio book    The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas AdamsTwo beings stand before a computer  descendants of the original builders who have been raised specifically for this moment  Seven million years ago  the computer promised to solve the question of  Life  the universe  everything   And it s finally the day  The computer boots online  stirs their excitement  and announces that the meaning of life is  forty two   Solving nothing  Well  what did they expect The main theme of Hitchhiker to me is that life is absurd  Life is ridiculous  life is funny  and I know of no other book this side of Catch 22 that captures that fact so completely or so enjoyably  And for something like life  forty two  is as legitimate of an  official  answer as anything else  Ultimately  the meaning of life varies from individual to individual  If there is an official answer  it might as well be  forty two  for all we know about it   Please note that this is not to profess nihilism One of the most fascinating things about Hitchhiker is its love of philosophy  defined here as the search for truth  In the universe of Douglass Adams  the truth is always hidden  always just one step away  The characters are always trying to discover the truth  and that is what makes them so relatable  Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy and philosophy might as well be synonymous  and a few books have even been written completely dedicated to analyzing the philosophy that Adams lays out in this series But aside from its ponderings on the ultimate point of everything  the book is also very funny  The writing is great  Prose that manages to make all of the ridiculous things within this book believable  which demands a lot of skill  There were so many funny parts to this book  from the pocket watches to the dolphins to my personal favorite  The sperm whale  Human beings have an inherent desire for truth  but it doesn t mean that we can t laugh while on that trip  one that we may never finish  But also one we ll never stop trying to finish  And that kind of insight is what makes Hitchhiker such an excellent book  The book that influenced a generation  and changed the way we viewed the world  Not only that  but suddenly it was cool to be a sci fi buff   I d had the nickname  Asimov  at school at one point  This year I re read the entire five volume series and was slightly disappointed  I found that quite troubling until I realised why that was  It was because we were living in a post Hitchhiker s Guide world  The mind blowingly inventive and witty situations that Douglas Adams wrote changed the face of popular science fiction irrevocably  I d grown up on  serious  sci fi authors like Asimov and Clarke  Along came Adams  and suddenly he made the whole genre mainstream in a way that it had been when Jules Verne and H G  Wells were breaking the mould back in the 1800s  For an author to  invalidate  or change the paradigm of an entire universe or genre of writing is the ultimate achievement  He changed the genre in the same way that the Beatles changed pop music  or the Impressionists changed art  It takes the most extraordinary talent to achieve that  This book got me back into reading again  Before this book I hadn t sat down and read real book for purposes other than education in a long time  but once I cracked open this book I just couldn t stop  The writing spoke to me in a way that was simultaneously intelligent and nonsensical  a feat I thought near impossible  The characters are presented in a dry and average manner which just makes all their quirks and oddities all the more humorous  All in all I really enjoyed this book and simply couldn t put it down once I had started it  Adams was definitely an incredibly talented author and it s a shame he s not still around to continue on writing  I d heard a lot about this book  but had never interested me to the point of picking it up  Finally  stranded in the beach with little else to read I gave it a try  I almost put it down and closed it forever  never to pick it up again  at least five times  At several points of the book I didn t know if I was reading the work of a genius  the work of a madman or trash  But I kept reading  By the end I d had quite a few laughs and was gripped by the underlying arguments of the book  When I finished my mind was refreshed and I asked  Why not  What is life if not the most unlikely outcome in the Universe  perhaps we should ask the improbability generator  Plus  it has so many quotes that apply to every day life A fun read that really pushes the limits and gives us a glimpse of the Qorld upside down  A great fast read  Fantastically funny book  By far the best comedy that I ve read  Full of humor and witty sentences tied together to make the universe of Douglas Adam s imagination real and inviting  I love this book  cannot believe that I had not read it  I laughed all the way through this book   Rereading the Increasingly Inaccurately Named Trilogy on the Kindle  because well  the Kindle really IS the Guide  with a different name  I was struck my two thoughts as I reread the set  one  I d forgotten how short the books actually were  and two  poor Arthur  his life just sucks  Now every time they mention Zaphod  or Ford for that matter  I can t help but see the expressions of the movie actors  Owen Wilson  I think  and    Mos Def    which isn t necessarily a bad thing  I grew up on this series and it s nice to go back to it again years later and still find that it s just that damn good  Only regret is that they are so amazingly short  and I m a long doorstop of a novel kinda reader  that it feels like just when I m getting into the book it s over  But that s just me  I think  It s also making me want to reread my Dirk Gently s books  too  but I think those are still packed away somewhere  they re first Am  editions and therefore in with my other first editions and signed books   Love all his books but this one is really the one that started that love affair  You can t help but be drawn in by his wordplay and visual descriptions  In addition  his rendering on the workings of the universe and philosophical musings are unintentionally provoking and simultaneously silly  Gotta love a split intelligence like his  This is far from the first time I ve been through The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  but it is the first time I ve listened to it Everything that made me enjoy the book to begin with is still there giving this a 5 stars rating right away  Stephen Fry  however  does an absolutely splendid job narrating the book and certainly qualifies for 5 stars on his own A wonderful  fun  and well narrated audio book  The best there is  The best there ever will be   I read this book as an assignment from one of my students    Ms  Smith  you will never get half of the allusions we make if you have not read Hitchhiker s Guide    This book had me laughing out loud    at one point  even in tears    at the smart aleck social commentary  Highly recommended  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is a fantastically fun and interesting book written by the late Douglas Adams  This book focuses on Arthur  a human from planet earth who experiences some very interesting and life changing situations in the most improbable and hilarious ways possible  This book  considering it is from 1979  is amazingly relevant and scarily accurate about the  known  subjects which it touches on  Overall  I would highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good laugh and can keep an open mind about humans and some of the  admittedly  odd behaviors that we have  Douglas Adams kept me laughing throughout  at times at myself and others at the wonderful characters which he has created  It is books such as this  short  200 something pages   funny  and a pretty easy read which reinforce reading as something that I really need to do more of  thanks to Jennifer Cochrane and Kevin Tuck for that   I would highly recommend this book though  The humor throughout is great and depending on your personality  you may be left pondering life as you know it and what the  important things  are Check it out  note  this is a series so only do so if you are willing to read them all  or at least the first two  as I am currently doing  A fantastical journey that definietly requires a sense of humor  Logical versus illogical  and many points inbetween  This book helped me to cultivate the idea of trying to understand someone else s standpoint  why not invalidating my own  I found the characterization hysterical  so much that it made me wish I was one of the characters  This book was born out of the radio show from BBC  I discovered this book thru the Science Fiction Book Club years go  there is no series like this in sci fi  Great story idea  great writing and great characters created by Douglas Adams  Author Dent is an everyday average man who gets to go on a wild ride with Ford Prefect  what sci fi geek would love to be in Author Dents shoes  I highly recommend this book  Five stars are not enough  extremely funny  I love the Brits I like Douglas Adams  writing style which invokes the use of a plethora of nonsensical words in combination with run on sentences and outlandish ideas to create a delightful medley of humor and wit I also enjoy referring to my closer friends as Vogons when they force me to listen to their poetry  One of the best books I have ever read  At first  I hated this book  But then about halfway through  I finally caught on to Douglas Adams  fantastic sense of humour  Yes  I m ashamed it took me that long to catch on  but now I can honestly say The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is unlike any other book I have read before  It s ironic  witty and it subtly pokes fun at a lot of science fiction cliches Aside from being laugh out loud funny in spots  the plot moves along quite nicely  The book is only a little over 100 pages  yet more happens in those 100 pages than in the over 700 pages of Brisingr  Douglas Adams  easy to read  pared down style is a truly refreshing break from the exhausting descriptions of most sci fi fantasy novels  His dialogue is also what sets him apart  I read it aloud and it actually sounded how real people speak Of course my favourite part of the novel was the unforgettable characters  Ford Perfect  Zaphod Beeblebrox  Slartibartifast and many others are very memorable and will never truly leave you  They re quirky  unique and  at times  utterly hilarious  which is what makes them stand out so much  The characters are just one of the many reasons to read this great novel I give this book 5 5 stars  Read by Stephen Fry  3 You know how it is when you re reading  say Homer s Odyssey  and you feel completely smart   philosophical   Well  for as long as I was reading  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy   I ve felt sheer awesome just knowing I had it in my bag  You know  it s like every element of galactic awesomeness were all gathered up in one piece of fiction  see  there s  counts on fingers  1 A total human klutz  who happens to showcase sheer genius at the most unexpected moments 2 A very funny  clever  charming alien with a very interesting satchel 3 A two headed three armed very self conscious humanoid who doesn t have a clue on anything he does 4 A maniacally depressed robot  whom I m now head over heels into  5 A very interesting new perspective on towels All I m saying is  I ve never read a book so awesomely wittily hilarious  As a matter of fact  if I was to meet Douglas Adams  it would be just like   Man  you re awesome   and then I d remember there s a couple of stuff I d have to disagree with him over  like all the stuff related to the origin of the universe   the theory of evolution   so  But still  such disagreement would have nothing to do with how awesome I think this book is  P S  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is nothing but a cool funny book with no literary depth  psychological  emotional insight whatsoever  I loved everything about this book  it s extremely clever  and it s so ridiculous that you can t help but laugh  Not only is it funny  but it s a great story  with lots of twists  At the end of the Earth  the main character Arthur s best friend  Ford  takes him to a bar and they hitchhike into space  After the command   Energize the demolition beams   is given  the Vogons are heard over the PA system saying  I don t know  apathetic bloody planet  I ve no sympathy at all  After that  there was a great silence  and Ford and Perfect appear in one of the cabins in the Vogon ship that has destroyed Earth  Parts of thee book are excepts from the actual Hitchhiker s Guide To The Galaxy  and they give advice and information on things introduced in the book  When Ford speaks of certain aliens or creatures  the book is referenced and gives exposition so you aren t completely lost  it is extremely witty  too   When Arthur asks   What s this fish doing in my ear    Ford replies   It s a Babel fish  Look it up in the book if you d like   The guide then reads  The Babel fish is small  yellow and leechlike  and probably the oddest thing in the universe   Even when the book is extremely dark and cynical  it can still  somehow  make you laugh  When they speak of the answer to life  which is the biggest question to exist in the actual world  the answer they are given is nothing but a simple   42   The computer that they ask the question to finally comes up with the answer after seven and a half million years  it announces  You re really not going to like it   After wondering what the answer could be for half the book  it is casually given as Forty Two  This book is very interesting and sarcastic  and would be great for any reader who enjoys a bit of dry humor  I love this book and the way it is written  It is hilarious  witty  quirky and just wonderful  I blame school for not giving me enough time to sit back and read this wonderful book by Douglas Adams  I also blame my poor intelligence for finding it tough to understand the humor of this book  It s the first science fiction I ve read as far as I know and I am happy to have completed buying the five books  Psyched  A wonderfully crazy and exquisitely British sci fi novel whose influence on today s fiction  and humor in general  can t be denied   Quite  inconsistent as it is  it s a must read for all the fans of the genre Featured in my Top 5 Weird Science Fiction Novels  http   www youtube com watch v WZMHFb    Perfection  Fun and funny  Read this one several years ago  a very fun  light read  I must quote the wise words of Macklemore on this one   This is fucking A w e s o m e    I can see myself rereading this book a gazillion times more  The late Douglas Adams defines humor at its finest  Ordering leather bound hardcover editions online as I read this for the first time on PDF format  I ve never worshiped a literature this much in my entire existence  And I am so glad I came upon it  Pure brilliance  This is another one of those books where I m just amazed by the author s creativity  Plus  it s laugh out loud funny A mind blowing science fiction masterpiece  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is such an entertaining and though provoking read  I m now thouroughly convinced that Douglas Adams was the one of most brilliant authors ever  His writing is cryptic  eccentric  humorous  clever  and wildly unique all at the same time  after all    The entire time I was reading  I could not help but think how much fun he must have had sprouting all the ridiculous  nonsensical  and clever af notions that fill the book  Anyway  I cannot wait to see what the rest of the series holds and as long as it is as good as this fantastic work of fiction  I know I am going to enjoy every word of it   Sempre acreditei e defendi o pensamento de que o bom humor e uma das caracteristicas mais proeminentes das pessoas verdadeiramente brilhantes  E O Guia do Mochileiro das Galaxias so serviu para reafirmar essa ideia  Eu comprei a colecao inteira  a trilogia de cinco livros  como diz na capa  ha uns cinco anos  Sempre que dava inicio a leitura do primeiro volume  era obrigada a interrompe la ainda nas primeiras paginas por motivos de forca maior  entenda por isso  leituras obrigatorias da faculdade ou da pos   Enquanto isso  a serie ficava ali  me encarando da estante  aguardando o momento em que finalmente seria lida  E  ah  se arrependimento matasse  Ah  se eu nao tivesse passado outros titulos na frente deste na minha eterna e enorme fila de livros  Teria conferido a genialidade de Adams muito antes e descoberto que O Guia do Mochileiro das Galaxias nao so e um fascinante sci fi com um texto afiado  cuja ironia da o tom a narrativa  como tambem e um otimo antidoto para o baixo astral e a depressao  Em um dia como outro qualquer  Arthur Dent acorda e recebe a noticia de que sua casa esta prestes a ser demolida  Mas seu amigo  Ford Prefect  um ser de outro planeta que viveu durante anos disfarcado de um ator desempregado na Terra  a fim de colher informacoes para a nova edicao do Guia do Mochileiro das Galaxias   nao poderia estar menos preocupado  afinal a Terra sera demolida  Contudo  antes da destruicao  ambos conseguem escapar pegando carona em uma nave alienigena  Ford leva Arthur consigo para uma aventura surreal pelo espaco exterior  na qual se deparam com figuras bizarras e se metem em situacoes perigosas  absurdas e hilariantes  Viajando pelos lugares mais remotos do espaco ao lado de Ford  Arthur vai parar  literalmente  nos confins do universo  Dentre toalhas  golfinhos e esferograficas  leia pra poder entender  e um bocado de personagens carismaticos  Adams satiriza  de maneira inteligente  as instituicoes sociais  bem como o proprio comportamento humano  e descobrimos que o sistema e a populacao sao falhos em qualquer lugar do universo   Politica  arte  burocracia  ganancia  consumo  industria  midia  publicidade sao alguns dos temas contemplados  por meio de metaforas geniais  nesta narrativa leve  bem humorada e deliciosa  O talento de Douglas Adams para contar uma historia era impressionante  o escritor faleceu em 2001   Talvez seja um dos livros mais inventivos que ja tive o prazer de ter em maos  A imaginacao e criatividade do autor sao  na falta de outra palavra menos hiperbolica  transcendentais  Hilarious  clever  outstandingly uniquely memorable  First time I read this  teens   I remember actually falling off the couch guffawing unrestrainedly  Second time years later  not so drastic  not surprised  but still smiling  not so much if you try to keep on with sequels  Film disappointing  perhaps because special effects now out dated  When awoke today to

the forefront of crisis reaction decades later    I d say permanent favorite  Adams rates may To Read shelf  especially when a new friend is reading Dirk Gently  1   Read in the 1980s  Crazy and amazing  This book is too much for those normal people  Join us  So long  and thanks for all the fish  42  Dis book be like what  The hitchhikers guide to the galaxy will forever be known as a classic for children of all generations  In many parts of this hilarious novel I would think to myself how does Douglas Adams come up with these amazing  creative  and mind boggling ideas  Arthur Dents unbelievable story is told masterfully and will leave you begging for the next book  Honestly  what can be written about this book that hasn t been said already  I read this as a teenager  and I remember finding a lot of it really funny  but overall found the book rather disjointed and jumping topics and settings with such rapidity it was work just to keep up  That said  I think it s essential reading for any teenager if you want to get many pop culture references in the past 30 years  Because I read this back then  I knew Radiohead s  Paranoid Android  was inspired by this  However  I d forgotten some of the details  such as Zaphod always saying   OK Computer  every time he wants to talk to it  duh   And lines from this book have become iconic  whether it s the  So long  and thanks for all the fish  message the dolphins send to the humans before they vacate the planet  or the number 42  Now  reading it as an adult  I laughed all over again  and still found it disjointed and all over the place  but it occurred to me partway through that that s the point  Douglas Adams  masterwork is a sci fi version of Alice s Adventures in Wonderland  as I ve said many a time  my favourite book of all time  and we all know how loopy and disjointed THAT book is  It s meant to unsettle you  to throw you into the chaotic world in which poor Arthur Dent now finds himself  Ford is as hilarious as ever  as is Zaphod  and I m so happy I reread it  The one thing that baffled me upon rereading it now is that I never moved on to the next book in the series  But I ll make up for that by doing so now      This is a classic  I ve never read anything else like it   everything that happens is so absurd and seemingly random  but Adams does a masterful job of making minor details relevant 100 pages later and keeping the reader entertained with a liberal dose of humor and wit  The first time I read this was years and years ago and certain details have stuck with me   the answer is 42  but what is the question  Don t Panic  Slartibartfast  possibly the best name ever   The dolphins saying  Goodbye and thanks for all the fish   Earth getting destroyed in a matter of minutes  Reading it a second time was a treat   I loved rediscovering it all again and finding gems that I d forgotten about  such as when Adams breaks the narrative to tell the reader that to avoid causing undue stress  he wants them to know that all the characters survive a life threatening situation and come out unharmed except someone gets a bruised upper arm  The mystery is who got the bruise  because it s unimportant and therefore shouldn t cause much worry for the reader   yet after all that he never tells you who ended up with the bruised arm  I can t say enough about this book except that there s no excuse not to read it   it s very short  easy to read  and hysterical  Okay  actually 4 5 out of 5 First read this when it originally came out This was immensely amusing and damn smart  too  there were delightful twists and turns and clever little plot nudges  It took care of any complaints about contrived coincidences with the Improbability Drive  I did wonder how a humanoid would work with those two heads  but all in all  I loved it  I don t think mice rule the earth  however  according to the internet  cats do   HomeIf there s one thing that s been with me since the year dot  it s science fiction  While Star Wars filled my head up with spaceships and ideas of telekinetic power  it was Douglas Adams that led me to the serious questions that scientists were asking  Are asking  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is meant to be a comedy and yet wound between the one liners and the absurd astronomical notions is a profundity that often borders on the philosophical The Hitchhiker s Guide has manifested itself in many guises  There the TV series  which has dated horribly  but still has some nice bits  especially the animated book sequences  The original radio series however is for me the best thing audio recording ever produced  I can quote most of both series  I ve listened to them that many times  There is also the computer game  a text based version also written by Adams and hugely popular  There was even a stage play of The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  We don t talk about the film  We never talk about the film Then there s the novels  Again  I have been reading these books since I was a teenager  listened to them being read by Stephen Moore and Douglas Adams until the tapes broke  I can quote large sections of them  they hold wonder to me  like Lewis Carroll or Harry Potter do for others  But also because Douglas Adams was a master at writing lean  wonderfully constructed sentences  Like the book s opening lines This is the story of  The Hitch Hiker s Guide to the Galaxy   Perhaps the most remarkable  certainly the most successful book  ever to come out of the great publishing corporations of Ursa Minor  More popular than  The Celestial Homecare Omnibus   better selling than  Fifty Three More Things To Do In Zero Gravity   and more controversial than Oolon Colluphid s trilogy of philosophical blockbusters   Where God Went Wrong    Some More Of God s Greatest Mistakes   and  Who Is This God Person Anyway   The first few books in the trilogy are the most coherent version of the story Douglas Adams was trying to tell  It became less coherent as the trilogy spilled over into four and five books  but certainly the first three are the definitive Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy Science fiction is at its best when it is using the distant future to comment upon present day issues and the Hitchhiker s Guide is no exception  Planet Earth is demolished to make way for a hyperspace bypass and the last remaining human being  Arthur Dent  travels across the galaxy encountering bureaucrats and lunatics wherever he goes  The Hitchhiker s Guide is essentially the narrator of the story  or at least the book s chorus  frequent interrupting the plot with examples from the guidebook s pages The idea of a personal guidebook seemed farfetched when the Hitchhiker s Guide began its life in the late 70s and yet now with smart phones the phenomenon is almost ubiquitous  The Hitchhiker s Guide also features the Babel Fish  a fish that translates any language for you from inside your ear  There is now Babel Fish translation software freely available on the internet  Arthur C Clarke and Isaac Asimov are credited with predicting much of future technology  As George Orwell knew  predicting the future is ultimately useless  yet Douglas Adams got so much right about the technological advancement of the last thirty years  And more than that  he helped shape its future course The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy had a powerful effect on my mind when I first read it all those years ago and remains so today  Douglas Adams taught me the principal of reducio ad absurdo  of testing principles by reducing them to the level of the absurd  It s a useful skill to have  But mostly Douglas Adams and the Hitchhiker s Guide just make me laugh  They re very funny books and all quite short and the philosophical aspects are so subtly done that you barely even notice they re there  The prose rips off the tongue and the grand absurd ideas warm your brain like the spreading glow from a glass of brandy  Like Sherlock Holmes or P G Wodehouse  they re a treat  Read them and luxuriate  Es una locura de principio a fin  pero bastante divertido    One of my absolute favorite books of all time  I read it for the first time when I was 9  and I ve read it at least 3 times a year ever since  It s fun  it s creative  it s entertaining  and it completely influenced how I saw the world growing up   O tipo de livro que  se voce se permitir  precisara parar pra respirar de tanto rir Usando de um humor sarcastico e inteligente  o autor zomba de nossa sociedade capitalista e de nossas prioridades ao jogar um pacato cidadao ingles em um universo de loucura e bizarrices Repleto de personagens marcantes  tipo o Marvel  fara com que o leitor lembre pra sempre de suas passagens  Tanto que gerou uma data comemorativa no twitter  O Dia da Toalha  If you were a sci fi geek in Junior High High School in the  80s and  90s it wasn t even a choice  You were issued a copy Puns  witty banter  and a look at the absurdist nature of galactic society  Futurama is the closest anyone has come since  and they are pretty open about the inspiration  The universe is a joke  This is the theme that Douglas Adam s book  The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy  seems to portray  In the book  the author manages to make completely logical statements  in a very humorous way  Boring things seem almost exhilarating through his descriptions and point of view  One example of this my be the creation of an infinite probability drive from a hot cup of tea  The author also manages adds a healthy dose of strange humor to the book  such as the simple assertion that vogon poetry can be lethal  Throughout the book  Douglas Adams also manages to keep the readers attention by adding small  simple pockets of humor evenly throughout the book  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is recommended for anyone with a sense of humor  and an enjoyment of the strange  This book is written in a very unique fashion  and it is very fun to read  An odd science fiction adventure  I feel it is either a book you will either love or hate with no in between opinion about it  I still recommend trying it out  Despite having read this several times now  it still makes me laugh out loud  I m a huge fan of the extremely talented Douglas Adams and his wonderful view of the world  Arthur Dent is a hero for the ages  and I haven t yet found a better answer to the question of life  the universe and everything than 42   This is the March book for the Book Club that I belong to but it s a book I have read many times over the years  Absolutely brilliant  funny and inventive  Remarkably now we have the equivalent of the Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy in the Internet  e books and tablets  so Douglas Adams was a bit of a visionary as well as an extremely talented writer  All the books in the series are recommended  it s a trilogy in four parts  as are the Dirk Gently Holistic Detective Agency series  This book rocked my world in high school  I felt like I found something I d been looking for in my reading life  Shortly after finishing this series  I moved on to Robert Aspirin s  Myth  books and then Terry Pratchett s Discworld novels  This mix of fantasy  or sci fi  and humor remain one of my favorite guilty pleasure reads  and this is where it began  Don t forget your towel  Books We re Thankful For  I am thankful for The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy because this book is out of this world and many more   This book is available at the EGSC Library  Good book  but amazingly I think the movie covered everything in the book  Read it several times  Very funny stuff if you like absurd humor   Great Book One of my all time favorites  and a quick reminder of how movies always fall short  A must read for anyone  The book reflects on humans  self importance and ego centrisism  It tells us  rightfully  that we are only an obscure creatures made of carbon hydrogen molecules on the most obscure little planet on the outskirts of the Universe  One of the few books that has  literally  made me me laugh out loud  And fall off my chair  laughing  And laugh until I cried and couldn t breathe and my stomach hurt      OK  it was a beanbag  But the principle is still the same     the sequence above Magrathea where Eddie the ship s computer just gives up  starts singing You ll Never Walk Alone while the crew rush around trying to save themselves from being blown to shit  The juxtaposition of YNWA lines and dialogue is just ridiculously funny   As someone who really likes speculative fiction  I was a little ashamed at myself for not having read this for some time  and after I saw it at a yard sale for 25 cents  and committing the cardinal sin of having seen the film first  there weren t anymore excuses  And it was lovely  As funny as it was interesting from a sci fi perspective  Adams has perfect the art of lite science fiction  Much has been written about this as it tends to be a book you love or hate  though the large majority is love  The allure of this book for me is straightforward  its plot elements are flippant to the point of pure silliness  How you respond to that notion will dictate whether you find Douglas Adams  writing to be bizarre or delightful  For me  it is Adams taking you on a clever  carefree ride through the universe where the rules and all their associated bureaucracy will be thoroughly mocked and occasionally disregarded  I love this book  My only regret was it took me so long to get around to reading it  I love the way Adams writes  the humor  the names and descriptions  and the overall light heartedness of this book  Who would have thought the end of the world would bring about so many amazing adventures  I wonder    just why did I miss reading out on this book all these years  Douglas Adams beats all other sci fi authors in his ability to realize the terrifying immensity   randomness of the universe and the insignificance of humanity in the overall scheme of things     in the most funniest manner possible   Truly awe inspiring  I am hooked  I am already onto the next book   The restaurant at the end of the universe   The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy  is about a man  a woman  and two aliens  They must travel through space after the destruction of earth  Of course  the universe isn t how we would think of it  The earth also isn t run by us    but you ll have to read to find out who    or what  Also in this book  is the answer to     The Universe and Everything   I d recommend this book to everyone who enjoys science fiction   One of the best books I ve ever read  Love the randomness and literary laughed out loud a couple of times  scarrying fellow train passengers  Now I know who made the Earth  I know what the whale thought as it fell  and I know that Hooloovoo is a superintelligent shade of the color blue  I love this book  Because you can clearly see that it was written by someone who saw around him and thought   This is ridiculous   So he made the universe an absurd  but the people inside the story is what it makes it more preposterous by their actions and what they say  I LOVED that   Lol HILARIOUS  AND LOTS OF FUN  Defs worth a read  Whaaat  I just  I can t  I mean  Whoa  What just happened  Despite the fact that The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is only a little bit over 200 pages  the book contains immense amount of events  characters  and information  The reading experience doesn t get any easier as the pacing of the plot equals to speed of light  Nevertheless  I have probably never read wackier  more British  hilarious  absurd book in my life  I can t think of any other book that could compete with this piece of literature with its kookiness  To be honest  I m just bamboozled and speechless by what I have just read  I m not sure even if I m able to write a review of the book  It was so bizarrely amazing  And that s the reason why I liked it so much First of all  I need to say how fantastic the humour was  Yes  it was very dry and British  but that s how I like my comedy  The humour arose from the situations and the dialogue  and I found myself laughing out loud quite many times  If I m completely honest  I can t remember how many times  Another thing what made The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy so funny is the complete absurdity  There are things happening that I couldn t ever have imagined  but which in fact could become reality  An example of this could be a babel fish   a fish which you put in your ear in order to understand any language spoken  or the fact that the Earth in fact was manufactured by some engineers  Douglas Adams s writing made it so easy to imagine all the events in your head  He included details and details of the environment and information about the world that many times I felt like I was overloaded with information  If Arthur Dent experienced the same  I really feel sorry for him  The world the author created is so complex  it made my head spin  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is one of those rare books that you can read over and over again and always something new which you can examine more closer  I definitely need another go with it  the are just so much included  I can see why others are just simply fascinated by the book while other s don t list it as one of their favourite books of all time  The book is very British  saturated with information and events while being extremely quick paced  this book isn t for everyone  Yet  I recommend it to all sci fi fans as it just is really mind blowing if you are into that kind of stuff  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy just might have become one of my favourite books  The deadly missile attack shortly to be launched by an ancient automatic defense system will result merely in the breakage of three coffee cups and a mouse cage  the bruising of somebody s upper arm  and the untimely creation and sudden demise of petunias and an innocent sperm whale  In order that some sense of mystery should be still preserved  no revelation will yet be made concerning whose upper arm sustained the bruise  This fact may be safely be made the subject of suspense since it is of no significance whatsoever   Douglas Adams put together a rather ridiculous  and enjoyable  read in The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  So let s talk plot  Arthur Dent s house is destroyed in the name of a new bypass  the earth is destroyed  and we are flung headlong into his journey across the universe and beyond  We meet an interesting cast of other life forms in his adventures  get some interesting snippets from the  hitchhikers guide   a book within a book    and snag quite a few quotable phrases in the process  Oh and we also get the answer to the meaning of life I would say the jokes are often tongue in cheek  but that would be the understatement of the year  The book is fantastically imaginative  the characters are vivid  and at the end  if you have a sense of humor  you ll realize it s just a commentary on everything being kind of outlandish and silly  Absolutely a fun read  Worth traversing at least once  In the beginning the Universe was created  This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move    Unique  The incorrectly named trilogy of the Hitchhiker s Guide is one of a kind  Adams makes a negative and emotional story easy to swallow and extremely enjoyable  I ate it up from the first chapter and to this day i can t get enough  Douglas Adams deserves all the praise he receives  Read it  Enjoy it  Than analyze it  there is great depth and though that can be extracted from this book  Repeat  Amazing  The ships hung in the sky much like bricks don t   This amazingly written  witty  comedy by Douglas Adams is filled with page by page hysteria  Arthur Dent is a British man who likes his normal life as a man who can t always get his brain wrapped around things  Then one day Arthur awakes to realize he is completely and utterly hungover  Later that day Vogons vaporize the earth for a galaxy freeway and Ford Prefect  one of Arthur s best and only friends saves him from the explosion of the earth  It s now up to Arthur  Ford  the president of the galaxy  the president of the galaxy s girlfriend and a highly depressed robot to guide their own adventures  Read this years ago  shortly after its first publication  Loved it  Reread it a few times since  Still loved it  Hadn t read it in years  until I recently decided to give the audiobook a try  Laughed all the way through  talked my husband  who absolutely does not read this kind of thing  into reading it and caught him laughing out loud  Now  for the big question  is it science fiction  STOP  Some books should never be classified  they are what they are  Other books may be compared to THGTTG  but it can t be compared to anything else  Except maybe Monty Python  Yeah  the genre is definitely Monty Python  After all these years  I m still careful never to travel without a towel  and the words  Don t Panic  scare me silly Oh  and about the narration  Stephen Fry  Need I say more  why dont we write like this in the arab world     we share the universe ahhhhhhhhhhhh  The imagination of the author and the way outer space is shown here is just amazing  The detailed lifestyle of various alien civilizations from a bacteria colony thriving on a Towel  yup  you read that right  to the tribes who are in a war from eternity  The open mindedness you need to show while reading this novel is on whole another level  The governing philosophies behind the Government of the Galaxy just blows your mind away  The randomness that you encounter when you travel through time and space on intergalactic level is cleverly shown   A Masterpiece   Prin apo liges meres egrapsa gia ton  Aphro ton Emeron  tou Mporis Bian oti einai apo ta pio diaskedastika pragmata ekho diabasei  Ti tukhe  mesa se toso mikro khroniko

missiles turn into a whale s carcass and a flowerpot is ultra funny  It is a good book even if they do swear a lot  That was just plain funny  I hope you enjoy this book as much as I did  It was laugh out loud funny  I had read this a million years ago  and as I listened to Stephen Fry s awesome narration  I remembered some of it  but there was lots of things I had forgotten  I enjoy the humor and wordplay  this is a book that is good for me to listen to    I read so fast  I might have missed some of the really clever stuff  Re read for the first time in probably 30 years  Discovered that I d forgotten pretty much all of it  Spent a lot of time laughing aloud  no doubt  to the alarm of the neighbors   It is a brilliant  clever parody that is also simply really well written  Have to re read the rest of the series now   I have been a huge fan of the Hitchhiker movie for a while but had never read the book Well folks the day has come  I have read the book  I one sitting really  as I couldn t bring myself to put the book down  Now this is the part where most people push their hipster glasses back up the bridge of the nose and declare  The book was better   and although generally I am one of those people    it is not the case here  Now before you rage quit my review let me say that I sincerely loved both  I look at the movie and the book as completely separate entities  The book was AMAZING  While the movie was AMAZING  So really I am just trying to say is the movie was just as awesome as the book   I thought about giving a full review  but by this time I am sure that everyone has read it or seen the movie so I will forgo that  But I will leave you with the fact that I took a  who do you write like  survey that analyzes your writing and it came back with I write like Douglas Adams    Which may mean that I need to start that novel I have always wanted to write     Arthur est sur le point d etre expulse de sa maison qui doit etre detruite pour permettre la construction d une deviation  Il refuse cette expulsion et decide donc de s allonger devant son pas de port pour empecher les demolisseurs de travailler  Mais ca  c etait sans compter sur le fait que la Terre est a l aube de sa propre destruction et que Ford  un habitant de Beltegeuse coince actuellement sur Terre  va emmener Arthur avec lui direction la Galaxie et ses nombreuses planetes inconnues des terriens Je ne suis pas fan de SF mais H2G2 est un des livres cultes du genre et cela faisait des annees que je voulais le lire  Autant vous dire que je n ai pas regrette mon choix car ce tome 1 m a convaincue de lire toute la serie  Ce livre  c est du grand n importe quoi et je me suis surprise plus d une fois a rire toute seule ou a sourire pendant ma lecture J ai passe un tres agreable moment avec tous ces personnages un peu loufoques et toutes ces situations ubuesques En bref   a lire de toute urgence meme si la SF n est pas votre style de predilection   One of my favorite books  I re read the whole series at least once a year  Loved this book  Listened to it as an audiobook and the English accent adds so much to the experience  Can t wait to read  or listen to  the next one  I ve heard about this book for years  but had no idea it was part of a  trilogy  until I finished the book and was aghast when it came to a rather abrupt end  Very excited now to have additional books to look forward to  The author takes you through time and space with humor and laughter and lighthearted sarcasm on an extremely enjoyable ride   I ve read it twice  the first time was about 4 5 years ago  so I needed a little reminder     I loved this book back then  and I still do  I just adore people who can think so randomly to write that much nonsence  It s just amazing   D I have to say  I was a bit sceptical about the Guide  I d heard a lot of people say it was good  but the only edition I d seen was all six novels in one and it didn t look all that interesting  just very  very long and hard to read Oh contrare The Guide is one of the fastest novels I ve read in a long  long time  It s a quick and easy read  always on the edge of your seat  Very effective writing  And the only time I have ever liked a book with such blatant deus ex machina  my arch nemesis Overall  don t be scared off of it because you don t like sci fi  or you aren t a nerd and only nerds read it  It s a good book  It s more than good  It s immensely amusing  though maybe not the most thought provoking   Another book the kids and I highly recommend  When someone asks me my favorite song  band  movie  etc   I usually have to give multiple choices  When it comes to novels  however  I have one clear favorite  and this is it  The Guide has a wonderful heart wrapped in pages and pages of amazing creativity and wit I read this early in high school  right when I needed something to teach me that no  I wasn t crazy  but rather it was the world around me that was absurd  I ll always owe Adams for that If you haven t read it  get it and read it now  You owe it to yourself  A great book if you re in the mood to laugh   Well  that was wonderful  funny  entertaining  and just a wee bit enlightening  I m not sure how I managed to go so long without having read this classic  By read  I meant listen to  The reading by Stephen Fry is fantastic   genius pure bloody genius    i knew this would be different when i read the line  The ships hung in the air in much the same way that bricks don t  i started listening to this on audiobook and was laughing my head off in the car   brilliant 42 xD For some reason I always forget books I adore when I add them to goodreads   Anyways I have been reading Hitchhikers for years  It has been one of my all time favorite books for many years  Not a lot can be said about this book but at the same time it deserves all the praise in the world for what it is  It is amusing  hysterical  and the best book to read when you re feeling blue  Your day can never be as bad as Arthur Dent s so it always manages to cheer me right up   this book is so good  it s funny and a really easy read  Satirical witty humor  crazy places  such a quirky atmosphere  and with the incredible ingenuity of Douglas  it all seem perfectly normal From cover to cover  it s impossible to put the book down  Even for a pee    And oh Jeez  You need to pee  I loved this book so much   I watched the movie when I was a kid and ever since  I got curious about the books but I never had a chance to read them  I recently bought the entire series and I highly recommend it to everyone who s into sci fi  It s funny  interesting and just the right amount of seriousness  Truly a classic  Ford was wildly excited  Arthur   he said   this is fantastic  We ve been picked up by a ship powered by the Infinite Improbability Drive  This is incredble  I heard rumours about it before  They were all officially denied  but they must have done it  They ve built the Improbablitiy Drive  Arthur  this is     Arthur  What s happening  Arthur had jammed himself against the door to the cubicle  trying to hold it closer  but it was ill fitting  Tiny furylittle hands were squeezing themselves through the cracks  their fingers were ink stained  tiny voices chattered insanely Arthur looked up  Ford   he said   there s an infinite number of monkeys outside who want to to talk to us about this script for Hamlet they ve worked out   Love it  You either love Adams  books or hate them  I love this one and devour the words  the style  the characters  the events and everything about it with repeated and unfailing relish  It is zany  humourous  well thought out and so well put together that you know you are reading a masterpiece from page one  A hilarious book  I especially loved all of the little notes through out it  It truly made it a fantastic read   I loved it   I don t know why it took me so long to start reading it  It was so bizarre and funny and so cynic  I mean  in how many books is the Earth destroyed with all its inhabitants to build a galactic highway which isn t necessary anymore  If you want to truly be transported to another world READ THIS BOOK  And bring a towel  Douglas Adams creates an amazing universe out of his pure wit and grace  It s a confusion  funny  and poignant satire of life  the universe  and everything  A scifi classic that will have you in stitches  This is the story of Arthur Dent  one of the last two humans left alive  technically four Earthlings remain  but two of them are mice  and that s a rather long story  after the tiny  seemingly insignificant planet known as Earth is demolished to make way for a new hyperspace bypass  Accompanied by his friend Ford  a researcher for galactic travel guides  Zaphod Beeblebrox  president of the galaxy currently on the run from space cops  and Trillian  an Earth girl Arthur once unsuccessfully tried to pick up at rather good party he attended in London  Arthur must navigate a galaxy far larger and far more unlikely than any he previously imagined  A genuinely hilarious book that attempts to answer the Great Questions of the Universe  such as  Why are we here    What is our purpose   and  Why were people so amazed by the first digital watches    I LOVED it  A parody as equal to today s times as much as when it was written  A very creative  humorous book that deftly dances around the weightier matters of life  Even though I m a very  very left brained person  I really enjoyed this foray into Douglas Adams  right brained mind  A true pleasure   The book s quintessential Englishness is enhanced by the author s wonderfully doleful  deadpan reading   I d read this book wayyyyyy back in grade eight  but I don t think I had a full appreciation of it back then  I re read it this year and then had to immediately read all of Douglas Adams other fiction  This  and all the Hitchhiker s books  is well written  intelligent  and funny  The editing is pristine too  by the way     Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the Western Spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun  Douglas Adams was brilliant  and his books are hilarious  Impossibilities abound  Plot twists are ridiculous  Characters are stereotypic  Yet it works  beautifully  This is the first book in his five book trilogy  an impossibility in itself  who else could pull it off   and it s a great read  Arthur Dent  of England  is forced to defend his house from being demolished for a highway bypass  but this becomes less important when he finds out his close friend  Ford Prefect  is actually an alien journalist  and that the planet earth is about to be demolished to make room for a hyperspace bypass  Luckily  Ford is a writer for The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  and the pair escape on a Vogon warship  The rest of the book is a series of bizarre coincidences that explain what the Earth was really for and who was really in charge  AND provides the answer to Life  the Universe  and Everything  Then they all nip off for a bite to eat and   well  that s in the next book in the trilogy  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is one of those books that makes you despair of writing anything of note ever It s that good Hilarious  wacky  and oddball don t even begin to describe the characters or the book itself  It s truly a modern classic and you owe it to yourself to read it right away  Obiazatel no k prochteniiu  Priiatnyi legkii iumor I put this book off for so many years  I had seen the movie when it came out  not knowing that it was based off of a book  and hated it  I finally picked the book up and began reading it and could not put it down  This book was hilarious and well written  What a great story  It s too bad the movie didn t do it justice  but they never really do  Can not believe I had not read this before  Waaaay better than the movie  ridiculously funny but also some very accurate remarks on the human race  great chemistry between characters  fluid dialog  sarcastic jokes  fun and accomplished plot  whats not to love   it even opens up your mind  gets you thinking about life in other galaxies   great read  Fantastic  Witty and entertaining  I read each book right after the other and loved every page  This was my introduction to sci fi and it wasn t at all what I thought sci fi to be  It has certainly opened me up to this genre and made me consider broader options for reading in the future HILARIOUS This is one book I d been meaning to read for a long time  and boy am I sorry I didn t read it sooner  I knew mostly what it was about  and had seen the movie  so the story wasn t all that surprising  What was surprising was the engaging way Adams had in his writing  The book is smart and humorous as well as entertaining  Who knew a towel could be so useful  And it s not a difficult read either  It s not overly sci fi fantasy  yet it touches on some very interesting philosophical concepts that will remain relevant for the foreseeable future  Cada pagina de este libro me hizo reir  Aunque sea sonreir pero lo logro  Se que es muy popular y que todo mundo lo ha leido pero no puedo negar que lo disfrute mucho y simplemente es hilarante  Sin duda terminare la serie  conveniente que la tengo en un solo libro  Y me alegra haberla leido en ingles porque siento que muchos chistes se habrian perdido  Ahora no olvidare jamas cargar con mi toalla  I read this probably 20 years ago  So on a re read for a BOM  which I listened to the library download instead of reading this time  I found I wasn t as crazy about it  It still was very fun  entertaining  and one of the best quirky humor  scifi read I ve ever read  I just am not as enamored of this genre as I was at 20 years old  I still would give it a 4 to 5 stars and lean to the 4  but leave my 5 star as it was my favorite  scifi quirkiness from youth  I am going to re read the rest because I have forgotten so much that it gives great fun on this re read  My favorite  go to  book  This book gave me such a good laugh  oh and also a new perspective of life  which made my life more enjoyable    Excellent   Funny  exciting  and phenomenally entertaining  Especially loved the idea that humans are only the third most intelligent species on the planet providing mice  the physical manifestation of hyper intelligent pandimensional beings  the experiment in which to find the Question to the Ultimately Answer of Life  the Universe  and Everything  The irrevernece in this idea and other aspects of the book abound meaning lots of witty quotable lines    So long and thanks for all the fish    Time is an illusion  Lunchtime doubly so    Curiously enough  the only thing that went through the mind of the bowl of petunias as it fell was Oh no  not again    which I always appreciate in a book  I d read it again right now  if I didn t have so many other books on my to read shelf      If you understand the humor and the way Douglas Adams is writing you ll love it  If you for some obscure reason don t  you ll hate it or feel it s a complete waste of words I myself loved this book  I have a beautiful copy with all the 5 book in it and I just began on the  The restaurant at the end of the universe  and I love that as well   The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is  to say the least  a very interesting book  To say the most  it is an epic  extra terrestrial Odyssey in which our Odysseus is Arthur Dent  the last surviving human  The book opens with Arthur protesting the destruction of his house  which is being removed to make room for a bypass  This parallels nicely with the impending destruction of Earth  for a similar reason  I appreciated the satire of that situation  I like this style that continues throughout the book  Arthur s friend Ford Prefect  resident of Betelgeuse and researcher for The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  removes Arthur and himself from Earth by hitching a ride on a passing spaceship  They are promptly ejected from the said spaceship and shot into the Infinite Improbability Drive  This was one of my favorite chapters of the book  as in the Improbability Drive  anything can happen  This let s the author express more eccentricities  such as the dialogue   Ford  you re turning into a penguin  Stop it   They escape the Improbability Drive only to land on the Starship Heart of Gold  Zaphod Beeblebrox is the captain of the Heart of Gold and accompanies Ford and Arthur further on their journeys  Arthur Dent is a plucky character  He copes amazingly well after having his world destroyed  It is also revealed that his brain holds the question to the life  the universe  and everything  His friend Ford is a good person  but has admittedly made some objectionable decisions  such as condensing the entire beauty of the earth into one sentence for the universe to reference  Mostly Harmless   Zaphod Beeblebrox was high on my list of favorite characters  second only to Marvin the robot  We ll talk about him later  Zaphod is a two headed alien  the President of the Universe  a rogue thief  and a raging egomaniac  As he says   If there s anything more important than my ego around  I want it caught and shot now   His two heads function independently so he can drink eat while he talks  which is always entertaining  Then there s Marvin  Marvin is my favorite  A manically depressed robot  What s not to like  When asked what s up  he responds morosely   I don t know  I ve never been there   Or when faced with opposition he counters with   Pardon me for breathing  which I never do anyway so I don t know why I bother to say it  oh God  I m so depressed   His permanently bleak outlook on life made him my favorite character  All in all  it was a great book  I would reccommend it to anyone ages 13 and up  because it gets a little cryptic at times which can be frustrating  It s good to remember that you don t need to understand everything in this book to enjoy it  I  for instance  do not understand more about the universe because I am at a loss as to why the only thought going through the falling bowl of petunias  mind was  Oh no  not again   That doesn t mean I can t enjoy the crackling wit and wicked fast dialogue that Adams displays  such as  Mr  Beeblebrox  sir   said the insect in awed wonder   you re so weird you should be in movies     Yeah   said Zaphod  patting the thing on a glittering pink wing   and you  baby  should be in real life  Cheers  Mr  Beeblebrox  Cheers  I received this audio book as a gift from a coworker  she had acquired it for  she says  a quarter at a flea market  Whatever the monetary value  however  this book is a little piece of history to me  It is perhaps the most tangible connection I will ever have to the BBC radio series of h2g2  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  as narrated by Stephen Moore is a wholly different experience than any other edition of Hitchhiker s  Of course  this is true of every edition of h2g2  it changed with each medium  anyone who has read the books and listened to the radio series  or seen the movie and read the books  knows what I m talking about   The difference in this case is that the story did not change  but suddenly it has a context  it s narrated by an Englishman Stephen Moore has a history with h2g2  he was not just some random English actor chosen for the role  And in fact  he is perfect as the narrator  Hitchhiker s takes on a life of its own under his narration I suppose I should at this point note that I enjoy audio books  Not everyone does  And it s true that they are largely hit or miss  the book requires a good narrator  or else it ruins your experience of the story  However  audio books are both an enjoyable and a practical experience  You can listen to audio books when ordinary reading is out of the question  trust me  reading and driving do not mix   So when I extol the virtues of this audio book  it is from the standpoint of someone who will actually listen to audio books  If you dislike audio books  or if you don t own a cassette player      I m not sure this one is good enough to make you change your mind If you like h2g2  however  I would definitely recommend listening to this if you ever get a chance  Even if you ve heard the radio series  this is slightly different  because it is the book  It s nice if you ve a quiet night at home with nothing much else to do  Make a cup of tea  pop this in the tape player  yes  those still exist   and press play  Although I was a bit late to reading the novel  as all of the six bound stories have been sitting on my bookshelf for ages  I am really glad that I finally picked it up and gave it a go  This is just what I expected  not more  not less  I cracked up plenty times and cannot wait to read more   Usually I read a book a little bit at a time over the course of a week or two  due to my lack of free time  This book filled me with the burning desire to keep reading so I finished it in two or three nights before bed  Its science fiction  but simple and funny science fiction  There are many parts I can remember and quote  Combined this makes for a great book that I could even consider re reading  which I NEVER do  A quick read    one of the funniest books I ve ever read  It doesn t take itself too seriously    one farfetched plot turn after the next  Never would have thought the Earth was created by wealthy mice for their personal use    I ll be reading the rest of the series fairly soon 4 10 2013 Made me laugh  Read the book first  then watched the movie  Simply one of the best things ever written  Read it  Then go on and read the others  Then go back and read them again  Douglas Adams had the rare ability peculiar to the genius of being at the same time deep and light hearted  of stating irrefutable truths in the funniest possible way and yet with such clarity that there is never the risk of the meaning being concealed by the joke It makes you wish that the universe was really and actually shaped that way  Arthur Dent escapes Earth s destruction  with the help of his alien friend Ford Prefect  and meets some zany characters  including the bad poetry writing Vogons  the man who built Earth and of course Marvin  Brilliant  Hilariously original  Laugh out loud humor  Influenced all light fantasy that came later  Not meant to be critiqued rationally  Ends abruptly  Sequels follow   read twice   I loved the Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  It was so easy to read and so hard to put down  I read it in one sitting  I loved how captivating it was  The plot was fast paced  The characters were intriguing and hilarious  The dialogue is comical and always has some sort of hidden truth between the lines  It s also a book about human nature  Overall  its a very interesting read  It s guaranteed that you won t put it down easily  I haven t read the sequels yet but I m going to  Boy oh boy  this was FUN  I now proudly own all the five books and I intend to finish them all soon because Towel Day is approaching  and also I want to be a  frood who really knows where his towel is    Great spoof  Great fun  For anyone who grew up with classic sci fi movies  Star Trek s multiple incarnations  pulp space operas or comic books  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is a must read  Absolutely brilliant and hilarious   laugh out loud funny  Adams was an amazing author  with such a unique voice and perspective on things  I cannot for the life of me stand science fiction novels  but I breezed through this one in a matter or days  I ve enjoyed reading the series  and hunger for more of his words   The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  widely regarded as one of the best British sci fi  comedy book ever  and it doesn t disappoint  As it s usually said in my reviews  most books will put me to sleep  and then I will have to do the rest of my homework in the middle of the night  But this book had my attention 100  of the time  a real masterpiece  This book is the most hilarious novel i ve read to date  and that s not saying much  The introduction sold me so much that I couldn t let go of it until it was finished  I really can t say much else read it  if you ve read it  read it again  Goodbye  First read this book in highschool  actually fell off the couch laughing at the title of the second worst poem ever written  As usual  the book is MUCH better than the movie   I tried reading this when I was younger  teens  and couldn t do it  I didn t get it  I was offended even  How naive of me  I know  blah blah blah  Well I picked it up again at the bookstore while I drank my coffee and laughed out loud as I was reading just the first few chapters  So i bought it and devoured it in a couple days  it reads very fast   I loved it  And I don t even feel like I m smart enough yet to fully enjoy it  I don t know how to explain the ways this book made me reflect on things we all take too seriously  it just did it and I m thankful  Glad I read it but I d only recommend it to certain people  Too serious people who are wrapped up in life would probably hate it  This season of my life was the perfect time for me to find Hitchhiker s Guide   Douglas Adams humor is not for everyone to be sure  but I thoroughly enjoyed his wit from beginning to end  Sometimes crude slapstick and other times intellectual  he managed to create an interesting balance to keep the reader completely off kilter If you haven t read The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galazy  I can only say that you will not be able to predict what is going to happen next in the story  I will highly recommend it though  Usually  I don t remember books very well  I have to review books right after I read them  or I wouldn t be able to tell you a damn thing about them  This book  however    I have the entire thing pretty much memorized  So much so  that I can t read the book anymore  I know every goddamn sentence by heart Here  let me quote from memory some Vogon poetry Oh freckled grunt buggleyThy mytriations are to meLike furgled brathey flapof warthog s beGroop  I emplore thee With crinkly bingle wormsAnd froopishly thrangle theeWith arm pit germsFor otherwise  I will rend theeWith my burgle crunchySee if I don t I m sure that is only slightly similar to the original  but you get the idea  I cannot get this shit out of my head  It s there to stay  I tells ya It s not because I have read the book so many times  even though  yes  I have read it more than 20 times  I m sure  It s because I once had a driving paper route  back in the early 90 s  and I played the audio version of this book in my car every morning  for like an entire year  Every morning I would hear the complete book  while delivering papers in my car  That s like 300 goddamn times  or more  that this book was pounded into my head  So yes  every fucking word of it has been permanently burned into my brain I say that  like it s a bad thing  It s not  I fucking loved it  I would read the book aloud  along with the tape  giggling like a goddamn school girl the entire time I distinctly remember one time  my wife woke me up  and asked  What the fuck is a  burgle crunchy    Apparently  I was reciting the goddamn book in my sleep  and kept tossing and turning  screaming   No  Not the burgle crunchy  Anything but the burgle crunchy  The book is about Arthur Dent  a rather lazy fellow  who spends the entirety of this book in his bathrobe and slippers  He is whisked away  into the cosmos by his best friend Ford Prefect  who gave himself the perfect Earth name  Because he thought the vehicle  the Ford Prefect  was the most dominant life form on the planet   who just happens to be an inter galactic hitchhiker who writes for the famed guide book The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  Once Arthur and his friend begin their journey through the cosmos  hilarity ensues  Well  to be fair  hilarity ensued from the very first page  but it really gets going once they re hitching rides through space And space    Whoa  Nelly  Let me tell you about space  It s big  Really big    So big  that    Again  pulling lines out of my head from this goddamn book Why is Arthur Dent so important to this story  Well  because his brain was part of a computer program to determine the answer to Life  the Universe and Everything  Okay  that s not entirely true  The program was actually trying to find the ultimate Question of Life  the universe and everything  Because  the pan dimensional mice already knew the answer to life  the universe and everything  It s  42   of course  Duh Does any of this make sense  I didn t think so  That s what makes it so bloody awesome  That  and Zaphod Beeblebrox  Because   He s just zis guy  you know   Simply put  it s my favorite book   Really enjoyed it  A good  short read  Now I understand why so many people love this book and this series  The plot  the characters and everything are simply hilarious  Books like this one  where the characters and lines are so smart  sarcastic and ironic are my favorite ones  and I just want to read it all over again Besides being such a fun read  Douglas Adams can make critics with some metaphores that are really good I recommend this book for everyone that enjoys a quick  fun and VERY sarcastic reading  Some of the things that happen may sound a little bit childish  and the physics stuff can be a little confusing  at least for me hahaha   but still is worth the reading One of the best book i ve read  It turned out to be enormously better than I d expected and after seeing a lecture by Adams some years later I bought a new copy and took the trip again  As different as they are  my introduction to H2G2 resembled my introduction to The Hobbit  Both were sent my way by people who were notoriously short of interest in reading and both people were effusive in their praise of the books  My curiosity was piqued and satisfied in both cases  As far out as H2G2 goes I felt right at home  it occasionally seemed as if I was reliving some of those conversations back in the college dorm lounge oh  so long ago  Surely my mates became the characters in the book upon graduation  Call it science fiction only if you must  I m still waiting to encounter something else in the same genre  Heartily recommended for those whose feet don t touch the floor with their full weight at all times   In retrospect  had Gracie Allen been a science fiction writer I bet her work would have resembled this   This is my all time favorite standard  My need something to fall back on read that I can always count on to make me laugh  smile  cry and tingle with excitement when I get to those really good parts  This series of books has its own cult following  It has changed the world  And it definitely changed me  Science fiction and comedy  Well  not my cup of tea  Unless Doug Adams is brewing it  I read the Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy many years ago and it completely changed my view about what a book should be  For one thing  I never thought that a science fiction novel could be comical  I thought they always had to be dark and philosophical  Thoroughly enjoyed it   Josh has been nagging me to read this one since before we even got married  Why did I put it off  Probably because I subconsciously knew I needed to wait until I was ready to make audio books a significant part of my life and thus listen to Stephen Fry narrate it   I adore Stephen Fry   What a fabulous book  It s unlike anything I ve read before and enjoyed the trip  Awesome   Couldn t stop laughing  D This is the funniest  most hilarious book I ve had the great fortune of coming across     Review based on audiobookI don t know why it took me so long to read this classic  I enjoyed this witty  comedic  ironic truism filled story of Aurther Dent and his journey following the demolision of Earth to make way for a space bypass  Disguised as a comedic science fiction novel  the Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is a profound and thought provoking unconventional guide to life  This review is valid for the entire Guide series  IMO the best in SF and humor there is  Probably the only one  Funny from beginning to the very end    Well  what can you say about the master of sci fi comedy  His books are hilarious  I was grinning right from the outset at the absurdity of the situations that the characters find themselves in  the banter back and forth and the general madness that you find yourself plonked right at the centre of It s the characters that truly make this series so well loved   a set of books that will always put a smile on my face  I love this hilarious sci fi What s the answer to life and everything   42 A great and fun read that will forever imbed its self in your head like a babble fish  I can see where Douglas Adams  books don t appeal to everyone  but happily  I fell into the group the loved the wild ride from Islington to the Restaurant at the End of the Universe  I am having a  summer book club  with my 14 year old son and am anxious to find out what he takes away from the book  Read this  It explaines everything  I started reading the novel on October 20  2015  I think that the overall theme of the book was adventurous and exploration  The reason I think this is the theme because the whole plot of the novel was the guys trying to go on an adventure after the Earth was demolished  They traveled from one planet to the other  and they discovered different species and aliens  The quote   One of the things Ford Prefect had always found hardest to understand about human beings was their habit of continually stating and repeating the obvious  as in It s a nice day  or You re very tall  or Oh dear you seem to have fallen down a thirty foot well  are you alright   signified the humor that is seen in the book  In the quote Ford Perfect is an Alien and is not from the planet Earth  The aliens in the book are not that intelligent  so he tries to make himself sound better  I would recommend this book because you will feel as though you went on an adventure with them  It is a very funny book   That was the worst ending to a book ever  Not that the ending itself was bad  mind you  it s just that the book ends in the middle of a conversation with no warning  and at the bottom of the page no less  If not for the advertisements printed on the reverse side of the last page  i d have thought that pages were missing  This is a wonderful book filled with hilarious British  dry comedy  The irony of the first chapter with the bypass that is to be built through Arthur Dent s house and the bypass that is to be built through earth is masterful  This book is especially entertaining and endearing because of the amount of character development  The juxtaposition between the upbeat  yet clueless Arthur Dent  and the solemn  but incredibly intelligent robot Marvin play off of each other wonderfully  There are many similar cases where characters play off of each other s differences in creative ways displaying the stark absurdity that Douglass Adams masterfully orchestrates  This is one of the most entertaining books I have ever read  yet it is also one of the most endearing and wonderful ones as well  The messages that Douglass Adams implants in this novel makes me reconsider my life  His masterful parodies are still accurate to this day and I would recommend this novel to anybody to read   I liked the series a lot  At first I only read the first book in Slovenian  but after that I reread whole series in original English Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy is a must read for any self respecting geek I wont repeat the story or the contest of the books since there are a lot of great reviews out there  and besides this is a book that everyone should read Some of its ideas  hichhikers guide    wikipedia  were groundbreaking at the time and I am amazed that I live at a time when some ideas that look like science fiction today can and will become reality in few short years  I can t wait to see what else that Duglas Adams wrote about comes to real life  Sometimes you read a book  you like it  but then as the weeks pass you feel like you missed something and you should have liked it more  So then you reread it and it just clicks and you realize you maybe just weren t in the right frame of mind for it the first time  because you absolutely loved it the second time  That is what happened in this case  I know this isn t a very good review  or even a review at all  So yeah  whatever  Amazing book  WARNING THERE ARE SPOILERS  You have been warned The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is one of my all time favorites and I recommend it to anyone who loves to read science fiction books  I absolutely loved this book  there was never a boring part and it was absolutely hilarious  There was everything from talking about how the president of the universe gate crashed a party  to missiles turning into a whale and a bowl of petunias  The book starts out on Earth  specifically England  and not too long after the start you find out that Arthur s house is going to be bulldozed over to make a bi pass ironically the Earth gets destroyed by Vogons to make a bi pass too  Luckily Ford and Arthur manage to catch a ride on the Vogon ship but get dropped off in a very inconvenient place  as in somewhere in space with no air  In a completely improbable situation Ford and Arthur had found themselves reduced by Trillian and Zaphod who happened to be traveling in a ship that was powered by improbability  The next stop was the lost planet of Magrathea where they find out some very important secrets  While reading this I was constantly on my toes wondering about what would happen next but the most interesting part was when Arthur was lead to the factory room  It explained a lot about what happened and why  Like how the Earth is secretly a computer trying to figure out the ultimate question  This book is the funniest book I have ever read  It s absolutely hilarious  I really love this book       I recommend it to anyone who likes sci fi and humor  Try to grasp your head around this awesome book    Just as funny and amazing as I remembered  Always worth the re read  The bit about humanity s obsession with digital watches was especially hilarious given the recent iWatch announcements    This book has an amazing sense of humor  He can take an extremely complex machine and give it the dumbest and funniest names ever  You can t get much better than that  Sadly Douglas is dead and that saddens me but his humor lives on this book has a good cliffhangar ending that leads straight into the next story  Dear Sarah Abrams of Irvine  Where ever you are  I hope you are happy and healthy  When we were 15  you lent me this book and started my habit of reading  I can safely say that this is probably the first book I read from cover to cover  Before that  I let my mild dyslexia and disdain for assigned reading keep me from enjoying books  If not for your suggestion of this dry British sci fi comedy  I would probably still be reading cliff notes  thanks again StephenTo everyone else  I gave this book 5 stars not because I think it is some masterpiece of english lit   but due to personal reasons already stated  I still find all five books of the Hitchhiker Trilogy to be very funny  Please  read them for Sarah s sake  I can t think of any other SF book which is this incredibly funny  in that droll British way that Americans can never emulate  In 5th grade I first read The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy and three of its sequels  but it s this book that stays most in memory  I ve always wanted to revisit Douglas Adams  story  even though I was a bit worried it might not be quite as brilliant as I remembered  but I can report that the audiobook narrated by English comedian and actor Stephen Fry is the perfect comic voice to capture the spirit of the book  Since the audiobook clocks in at just under six hours  I decided it would be a good companion for a day hike in the mountains an hour from Tokyo  Hopefully none of the other hikers were disturbed by the strange tall gaijin chuckling to himself on the trail The story  as most of    Read More  http   www fantasyliterature com revi    Practically every geek s source of mental orgasms  Quirky as ever    but what can you expect from Mr  Douglas aside from that Filled with humour  energy  other worldly ideas and the meaning of life  the universe and everything  yet  touches on central questions we ve always  secretly  had  A fun  for multiple  read for anyone who likes science fiction  science and or fiction  It took a minute to get into   but     I loved it  Hilarious  Once I realized it was not sci fi but rather a commentary on life  science  academia  the media  and culture in general  Or just the meaning of life on earth   Maybe that IS what good sci fi is  but I digress     The writing is no less than Amazing  Truly amazing  It was recommended that I read the audio book as performed by Stephen Fry  of Fry   Laurie fame etc   Great choice and highly enjoyable  It had me laughing out loud  Favorite Quotes   We are philosophers    Stress and social tension are now problems in all parts of the galaxy    one of my favorite series  In the book the Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  it starts out when Arthur Dent finds out that his friend  Ford Prefect  is actually an alien and that the Earth is going to be destroyed in a matter of minutes  Ford gets them into outer space  and they are about to die  but then they get rescued on a ship by Zaphod Beeblebrox  the President of the Galaxy  The rest of the story tells about their adventures in outer space  and the unusual  but funny  things that happen while travelling throughout outer space  The most interesting scene was when Arthur found out that his friend Ford was actually an alien who had been stranded on Earth for the past 15 years  and that they needed to get off of the planet because it was going to be demolished in a few minutes  I thought that this was an unusual  but very fun scene to put towards the beginning of the story  Even though the end of the world seems like a gloomy subject  Douglas Adams makes the topic funny to read  and that s what made it so interesting  seeing how he chose to portray the end of the world  I give this book 5 out of 5 stars because it was hard to ever stop reading  The author managed to fit in funny comments and sarcasm on every page  so I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys funny books  I also would recommend this to any fan of Science Fiction  because it does a good job of having advanced spaceships  and good aliens  I think that everyone should read this book  because it has many different aspects for everyone to find something they like about it   One of the greatest books I ve ever read  It changes how you view the universe Douglas Adams perfectly combines science  science fiction  comedy  satire  sarcasm  and philosophy The book has a great storylines that destroys everything you ve ever known and replaces it with a stellar new view of life   puns intended  I can t believe I waited this long to read it  Hitchhiker s is fabulous  I haven t laughed this much while reading ever   I refuse to prove that I exist   says God   for proof denies faith  and without faith I am nothing   But   says Man   the Babel fish is a dead giveaway  isn t it  It could not have evolved by chance  It proves that You exist  and so therefore  by Your own arguments  You don t  QED  Oh dear   says God   I hadn t thought of that   and promptly vanishes in a puff of logic     work of pure genius   Amazing  The book takes imagination to a different level  Hilarious read  out of the universe imagination  Forgot about this one   One of my favorite science fiction series of all time  What a beautiful far flung farce across the universe  Everyone needs a hero like Arthur Dent  a clinically depressed robot with the best sarcastic lines in space time  and a towel  In fact  I think the towel bit is probably a bit of genius on Adams  part   I can t think of anything more useful I ve read this book and the other three books in the trilogy    at least twice  maybe more  can t remember    highly re recommend it  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is a wholly remarkable book  Or so it says throughout The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  though one cannot say with accuracy wether or not The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy thinks so highly of itself This wholly remarkable book is  in fact  wholly remarkable  I seem to be talking in a cyclical fashion  but so does the author  Douglas Adams  In fact  it is quite unfortunate that I would only get to read this wholly remarkable author at the late age of 24  especially so when I saw the movie shortly after it came out Put in a more serious manner  this might be the best book in the galaxy  It could also be its worst  but either way there s no reason not to read it  It has quickly hiked to the top of my list of favorite books  The book is now a favourite  but let us not forget that The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is also a wholly remarkable book  funny humorous idiocy  Whether or not there is life outside of our solar system is an age old question  ever since humans have looked up at the night sky we have pondered that perhaps we aren t the only beings with the gift of life  Douglas Adams puts a wild and unique spin on the possibility of alien life in The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy that is both comedic and utterly ridiculous   The Hitchhiker s Guide is the first entry in Adams  pentalogy of the same name  though he refers to it as a trilogy in five parts   and its confusing plotline and humoristic method of storytelling set the stage for the convoluted and disconnected events in the remaining four parts  The series follows the misadventures of one of the final surviving members of the human race  Arthur Dent  after his home planet is destroyed  Nearly all of the conflicts are solved by random chance  many pertaining to the intentional use of statistical improbability as a means of space travel  but the way in which it is presented fits very well with the story   The author does a very good job of describing many aspects of the story  a good number of the descriptions are in the form of entries in the fictional guide after which the novel was named  Adams  sense of humour is very developed and he has a distinct method of storytelling that make it feel as if he has truly created his own universe  but for those unaccustomed to his style the story could be difficult to understand or uninteresting  I believe that people who are interested in outer space and extraterrestrial life would enjoy the book  but they would have to be able to look past the parts that are confusing or disconnected from the rest of the plotline that is rather shaky to begin with  All things said  The Hitchhiker s Guide is still my favorite book  but I can understand why other people would not enjoy it as much as I do  Simply  the funniest book ever   and maybe the deepest one  Fun book  On to part II  The Hitchhiker s Guide needs no introduction or recommendation from me  Douglas Adams was a unique talent and Hitchhiker s was a genre defining work that everybody with an interest in creative writing should read  Even if science fiction comedies aren t your cup of tea  Hitchhiker s should be read as an example of how to successfully break rules and play with language  There have been many imitators  Adams remains the master  one of the best books ever written      Last time I read this  I was just a kid  I just reread this again  and was surprised how well this held up  It was still very funny  and the odd little jokes  which I remember as random  actually all resolved themselves as integral parts of the story  This is my single favorite book of all time  The prose is playful and precise  saying exactly what it intends to and leaving vague exactly what it should  Adams has done more to define my worldview than any other author  exploring through science fiction the shape of humanity in the past and present  showing us as the confused hairless apes that we are  Where many books have attempted to address the question   Why are we here    Adams elects to respond with a resounding  Why wouldn t we be  A continuous refrain in his writing is the implication that non existence is as improbable as existence if we assume the universe to be sufficiently vast  and that our understanding of a thing is of no consequence to it  He treats the sense of curiosity and wonderment we have toward the rest of the universe as valid  intriguing  and amusing  especially in its folly  We have a difficult enough time understanding the instructions on Ikea furniture  and the universe is much larger than most tables  I find myself a much happier person having internalized the irreverence of his books  There s a certain Nietzsche esque freedom that comes from not bothering with objective universal meaning  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy by Fouglas Adams follows Arthur Dent  a normal human from earth  Few moments after being introduced  Arthur and his alien friend Ford Prefect have to escape from Earth before an alien race destroys the planet to make a space road  The book follows Arthur and Ford s adventures around the galaxy The book is a definite must read with weird and very funny humor that will take you by suprise at any moment  Quite possibly the funniest book in the entire universe  I say  possibly  because who knows what sort of madcap comedy they have cooked up somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse  I could go on and on about how funny it is  but I will spare you  I usually try to make a few jokes and jibes in my reviews  but there s no point  I am humbled in the presence of greatness  Funniest thing I ve ever read   Mostly harmless  Read the whole series during my teenage years after stumbling across the BBC show back in the 80 s  Has to be my favorite author of all time  Adams was taken from this world far too soon  Always have a towel handy   Really bummed I didn t read this before I saw the movie  because I would have loved to come into this with a blank canvas  but since it s been a while  and I don t remember anyone but Zooey  Trillion  I was able to reimagine most of it  Looooved it  Can t wait to finish to rest in the series  The guy eho wrote the Forward wasn t kidding when he said Adams is a genius  Then again  that might be me being narcissistic  because he writes like I think  Only way funnier  Much of the humor here is impossible to describe  this novel must be read to be appreciated  It seems like every single line holds a joke of some kind within it  One brilliant thing that Adams does is to step away from the action every so often to present interesting facts about the universe as recorded in the Hitchhiker s Guide  here we learn about Vogon poetry  the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal  Trans Galactic Gargle Blasters  and other fascinating tidbits about life in the crazy universe Adams created  He even gives the reader the ultimate answer to the question of Life  the Universe  and Everything in these pages I think the book was better than the movie even though I did like the movie Zanimljivo i brzo putovanje na kome tshete dobiti odgovor na vechito pitanje o poreklu Zemlje  odgovor o zhivotu  vaseljeni i svemu ostalom  i nauchiti vrednu lektsiju o interesovanju za lokalna deshavanja  bila ona na par metara od vas  ili na par svetlosnikh godina    i o tome kako za sve treba kriviti Sirijusku kibernetsku korporatsiju Topla preporuka za sve  This is easily one of the best books ever written  and given that I read up to 8 books a week  that means alot  The book is satirical  and cutting  Funny  and thoughtful  It is a book that every teenager needs to read  then read again once they ve grown up  It has only gotten better with age    An original  Beautiful floopingly wonderful  He invents new worlds and new language at the same time  and does wonders with lateral dining experiences  Intuitively counter intuitive and a soaring tour de force of humour in a universe which always has human frailty in pyjamas and a dressing gown at its centre  Its quintessentially English reference points  Krikkit  said dressing gown  road by passes  add gravity and prevent the reader becoming over excited or even weightless with laughter  We believe in improbability drives  grasp passages of time that are beyond any mathematically known equations  while ultimate questions are often asked  Answers however are straightforwardly incomprehensible  One can only hope that as his spirit left the treadmill in the LA gym  he walked a tranquil rainbow to join Trillian and every other more difficult to spell inhabitant of his imagination to an eternity of adventure and fun   Well  to be honest  I m not an avid book reader  I do read a lot   as in  PDFs of books  but not actual  physical books  This is the first one I had to read in a long while  and I was kind of bummed out to be forced to read it  but nonetheless  I did it anyways  Thanks  school So  why did I actually read it  Instead of just throwing it away  and looking up a Wikipedia article about it  Because it when the first sentence you read is   Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety two million miles is anutterly insignificant little blue green planet whose ape descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea   Yes  this book makes fun of the entire human race as an idea  And even I have to admit  digital watches are pretty cool So obviously  this is a comedic sci fi book  Let me sum it up for you One day  there was a man named Arthur Dent  Some pissers wanted to tear his house down  to build a giant bypass  while his house was conveniently blocking the way  Of course  after some arguments  some being clever  others just plain capitalism satire  a alien  whom conveniently looks like a human  named Ford Prefect  from the planet of Betelgeuse comes with the amazing idea of convincing Mr  Prosser  the construction man looking at Arthur s house in front of his nearly built bypass  to literally sit down in the mud where Arthur was lying  so he could wait  for Arthur to come back  after a good half hour at the pub  Conveniently  and ironically  such after that  an alien spaceship belonging to Vogons  who hate hitchhikers  such as Ford  and love singing horrible poetry  pretty much annihilates Earth to build an intergalactic bypass  Of course  after telling everyone politely  that there was a warning at the nearest planning department  on the planet Alpha Centauri And then everyone died  the end Oh wait  nevermind  Ford and Arthur happen to be on the Vogon spaceship  And get kicked out  after being punished with horrible poetry  and getting ejected into outer space  That s just a quick taste of the book  And due to it s cleverness and sense of wierd  Simon Pegg esque humor  that s why I love it  I highly recomend to anyone who thinks the number  42  is dandy  Just going to point that out  This along with the other four in the series have been in my TBR book case for about fifteen years  I set myself a challenge to read them all in September  I only ever saw snatches on the TV show  something I am rectifying thanks to YouTube  so didn t understand what all the fuss was about  Now I know  I loved this book  It is laugh out loud funny  insightful and very clever  A real classic  Brilliant    Loved the movie and I would love to read the rest of the series  AWESOME AND HILARIOUS  Don t Panic  You can Still Read IT   Also  don t worry  cause I know where my towel is   Arthur Dent s home is about to be demolished  Actually  both of his homes  the one on Earth  and Earth itself  Thankfully  while the rest of Earth s inhabitants are obliterated  Arthur s friend Ford Prefect turns out to be an alien from a small planet in the vicinity of Betelgeuse  They escape the destruction and set off into space  armed with  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  Douglas Adams brings us a hilarious  neatly put together story full of surprises  quotable moments  and memorable characters  I recommend it to anyone who needs a laugh or a great book  Please ignore the movie  Also  please ignore the BBC miniseries  The problem here is that these books cannot be made into films  The genius that was Douglas Adams was not his imagery  Sometimes it wasn t even his plot  But it was always his clever way of arranging words on a page  What other author has ever described something as hanging in the air the same way that bricks don t  For those of you who have not read this series of books  I will warn you that you must start here  This book begins with end  Yes  the earth is destroyed within the first couple chapters  Oh  and that s not a spoiler  The nonchalant way in which the destruction of the planet earth is handled sets the tone for the rest of the series  While it is science fiction  don t let that scare you off if you are not a sci fi fan  Yes it has spaceships  aliens  talking mice  improbability drives  and androids  However  none of these are dealt with in a traditional way  and the book itself is about a whole lot more  By the end of the first few chapters  there are only two humans left in the universe  yet this book  and the rest of the series  is really about us  humans  that is  and how maybe   just maybe  we aren t so insignifigant after all I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read sci fi  as well as anyone with an interest in religeon  politics  philosophy  social science  and dolphins   you ll see what I mean   Absolute belter of a fEUREURkin book    F  kin cracker of a read  begosh begorra  Whether one likes the book or not will seriously depend on what one thinks of the humour  It is definitely nerd humour  Who else would get  let alone appreciate  jokes concerning infinity  probability and monkeys typing Shakespeare  It is now official  I am a nerd  I liked the book  In fact  I actually laughed out loud at various moments  I liked the word play   It means we must be onto something    How soon can we get off it     I liked the non sequiturs that caught me by surprise  Arthur blinked at the screen and felt he was missing something important  Suddenly  he realized what it was   Is there any tea on this spaceship     and I am a fan of understatement  An expression of worry and concern failed to cross either of Zaphod s faces   This is a book that everyone I knew  who read books  was recommending to me 30  years ago  I failed to pick it up then because I didn t think I was going to like it  I can t remember why I thought that but  hey  it was 30  years ago  It showed up recently on a list of books recommended for me by this site  I am glad I took the advice Adams has been accused of writing as an excuse to string together a bunch of one liners  This didn t bother me as I loved a lot of his one liners   Ah   said Arthur   this is obviously some strange usage of the word safe that I wasn t previously aware of   I can think of lots of variations for this  like in reponse to  What are you doing  Nothing   a standard elementary school response   Or  Only by counting can humans demonstrate their independence of computers   Hmm  that s a new way of looking at it  especially for someone who has taught primary Math  On the other hand  though the premise was great  there wasn t a lot of plot and I didn t get the part about the Vl hungs and G Gravuntts  Maybe  by this point  Adams was starting to fall in love with his own cleverness which brings me to the two themes I could not ignore   egocentricity and word usage   I was able to ignore his pot shots at marketing  bureaucracy and government   These two are quite inter related  In the book  poets are accused of taking themselves far too seriously through their use of words  a fate worse than death is to have the Vogon captain read you poetry before death  but the same accusation can be leveled against philosophers  theologians  educational theorists  English Lit teachers  those of us who write book reviews and post them on the internet  and Douglas Adams  Adams is at least using his words for entertainment  So  in short  best parts for me were those featuring hapless Everyman  Arthur Dent  at the mercy of the universe  and the weakest were those featuring Deep Thought  I was a little bored there  I once saw a movie on the TV by the name of  The Hitchhikers guide to the Galaxy  and I have to admit  it was   and still is   in my opinion pretty bad of a movie  Due to my bad encounter with this books movie counterpart  I startet reading it  without very high expectations  Long story short  I read the book  I was overwhelmed   Don t usually read science fiction  but this author has a mind blowing touch  I read this book when I was far younger  and read it again  albeit intermittently  not too long ago  and my opinion remains unchanged  this book is amazing  see them there stars    It s the Belgium  Never before and perhaps never again will humor  satire  and sci fi be combined in such a hilarious and effective way  Arthur Dent the beloved everyman and his inadvertent quest lead to some of the most iconic and humorous places and situations in literature and the tangents and quips crafted by the narrator are so good that I m tempted to abandon this review due to being unable to do the book any justice  In fact  I ll do that  Just go read it  Fans of satire  humor  sci fi  fantasy  and witty Brits  and or their crafts  just leave Good Reads now and go read it so you may understand why I am speechless and merely spraying drivel in this textbox excitedly while thinking of it  Brilliant  Only one thing to say  Don t Panic  i can t even begin to describe how much this book and its author mean to me   This was the first science fiction book that I ever read  and it was a wonderful introduction in the genre  The amount of variety and creativity in the creatures  planets  and characters suggests either genius  insanity  or possibly both  For instance  there was one species of alien with eighteen or so arms  and the book states they were accredited to be the first species to discover aerosol deodorant before the wheel  Also the Point of View gun  which is used to make other people instantly see things your way  was believed to be created by a group of housewives while their husbands were busy watching television  This book is one of my fail safes when I need a good book to read     it is sharp  witty  unexpected  and hilarious  One of the greatest things about this book are the equal measures of readability and challenging aspects   there were a few words that I had to look up the definitions for  so it would be GREAT for younger readers  but none of the story line or wit was lost even without knowing the definitions of those words  This book is also a bit challenging due to the  foreignness  of it   references to  British  culture and or words that may confuse  but may also spur interest to investigate meaning  Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is a wonderful read  and completely appropriate for all readers  though probably too challenging for anyone younger than a high school age  The humour level may also be too  mature  for some readers who are used to more crass  obvious humour  Adams is a master of subtleness and sarcasm  Definitely a must read  I love all the books in this series  My favorite way to  read  them is via the audio books in which Douglas Adams  himself  narrates  He is wonderful  You get to hear all the humor implied in the text  It is dry English   Monty Python  style humor  after all   Klasnii pereklad  dorechi   What a book  Id say it was like prachett but in space but i d probably get a lot of people who complain  As a scfi person I much prefer it to prachett anyway  If your looking for a story to distract you this is the one  A loopy plot  random character and a narrator that goes off on tangents  Marvin has to be my all time favourite robot  How have I not read this book by now  Or seen the movie  I was vaguely aware that it existed  and missed loads of  42  and  I could never get the hang of Thursdays  puns from my friends  If you haven t read it  do so  ASAP  Provides handy tricks in case the world ends  Oh  and always pack a towel  The world has been destroyed to make way for an inter galactic hyperpass bypass      or something   If YOU are in two minds about reading this book  if you think it will be a waste of time   please read it anyway  It s 50 000  ish  words and it will make you laugh  You don t need to be a genius to read it  or even understand it  Just take in the words and laugh  A man should always know where his towel is   Might come in handy sometime  VW xD This book is so awesome across so many dimensions that this review cannot fathom to describe  One way to look at the book is purely in terms of its silly comic relief that it provides  but beyond that a closer look reveals a deep philosophical conversation that it has with the reader  There are tons of awesome quotes and situations that you ll remember throughout your life  If you aren t cracking up in laughter after reading a page worth of text  you lack the funny bones  I had just completed this audio book through a satisfying dictation by Stephen Fry  and Douglas Adams  verbalization of normal things is impressively humorous and insightful   this dichotomy lends itself to make an excellent summer read  I would have given this book four stars  due to the cliffhanger ending  which requires further reading of the series   but the language makes this entirely forgivable  HGG is a highly recommended work  I first read this a long time ago   it was really great to revisit as an audiobook   This is easily my favorite book ever written  Except for the other Hitchhiker s series books  of course  The series is just    perfect  Really it is  In every way  Except for the Mostly Harmless  which kind of ruined the absolutely perfect 4 book trilogy Adams had going  Not because it was bad  it just wasn t perfect  Anyway  enough rambling  If you haven t read this book  read it  It s amazing  It s so good I stole my sense of humor from it  That s quality you can trust   While the genre of Science Fiction isn t particularly known for its sense of humor  the Hitchhiker s Guide series by Douglas Adams is a prime example of how the format s unique characteristics can be used for humorous effect  With droll British humor and an absurdist streak to match anyone in the Galaxy  Adams is able to bring us a thrilling adventure through time and space that not only provides some genuine chuckles  maybe even guffaws  along the way  but also presents us with an awe inspiring picture of the universe  as well as an Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life  the Universe  and Everything   Checkout my review of Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy at my blog   Still amazing  Listened to the audiobook  which is done by Douglas Adams  I highly recommend it  This was a reread as I ve read the Ultimate Hitchiker s Guide before and it s probably my favorite book  Too short   There s an infinite number of monkeys outside who want to talk to us about this script for Hamlet they ve worked out Arthur Dent wakes up to find a construction crew outside his house  waiting to demolish it for a bypass  Little does he know  a Vogon construction fleet is outside his planet  waiting to demolish it for a hyperspace lane  Fortunately  Arthur s friend  an alien from a planet in the vicinity of Betelgeuse  Ford Prefect  lends a hand and the two hitchhike away from Earth moments before its destruction  This is their journey I Liked The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is a classic  the perfect blend of comedy and scifi fun  Adams is acutely aware of scifi stereotypes and what makes people laugh and has blended them to perfection Our protagonist hero  Arthur Dent  is a complete deconstruction of the  hero   the man who can elbow his way into everything and come out on top with ladies fondling him  Arthur is completely at the whims of chance and his friend  Ford  It s delightfully funny to see his reaction to being the third most intelligent life form on Earth and how positively useless he is to the Heart of Gold Ford Prefect is a delightful  sidekick   who ends up being way more helpful and useful than most sidekicks  It is he who saves Arthur Dent  it is he who attempts to find ways out of scrapes  it is he who sticks his neck out on the line Zaphod Beeblebrox is a kick in the pants to those who are interested even passingly in politics  I find it a riot how his job as president is to focus attention AWAY from those who have power  My absolute favorite line of his is  If there s anything more important than my ego around  I want it caught and shot now   Trillian is your stereotypical damsel in distress buxom lady  only she isn t either  A passing comment suggest she may be a physicist and a mathematician  far better than Arthur  whose only job is to  whine about Earth   my poor attempt to render the book s words  and restate the obvious  She is competent  adventurous  smart  and not another objectified woman  though she certainly wasn t ugly  her beauty is not the primary attribute she has  The story seems rather simplistic  but I found it a riot  which is what I believe was Adams intent  that  and a satire to our world   Arthur worrying about his house being destroyed when Earth is minutes from destruction makes him seem rather petty  seeing Zaphod race after Magrathea for the sole purpose of fame and money shows his shallowness and makes a funny statement to our constant pursuit of the purpose of life  Having mice manipulate humans shows how we are so eager to make ourselves more important than anyone else and our inability to see out of the box of our self importance I Didn t Like The ending is a bit abrupt and kind of hokey  But then  you really can t critique the ending  given what the purpose of the novel is  When I listened to the audiobook  I found it challenging to figure out the Hitchhiker s entries and the story Dialogue Sexual Situations Violence Mild profanities Trillian is Zaphod s girlfriend and travels with him on the Heart of Gold  Arthur attempted to go after her  but Zaphod whisked her away Earth is destroyed  Vogons torture people with their poetry Overall If you want to laugh  if you like British humor  if you have read a lot of cheesy 70 s scifi books  you need to read this book  Heck  if you like to laugh and like scifi  you at least need to try this out  It s funny  it knows what it is picking on  and it is clever  I also recommend listening to the audiobook where Douglas Adams himself reads the book  It s a delight to see how the author intends the book to be read  I ve heard about this book my whole life  well  as much of it as aI can recall   and had previously read bits and peices of it  So  somewhow  I ve always felt as though I had already read this book  which was just enough to keep me from actually reading it until my brother in law was kind enough point out that thinking one has read a book is just simply nonsensical  a lapse in logic he sought to correct by actually buying me a copy   Loved every eccentricity of it   Neat science fiction  naturally explained  funny  simple yet rich  This book has it all  This a book for those who like to laugh and like to laugh at simple things  Make no mistakes though  This is not for simple minded ones  Exquisite humor and hidden references  You ll need some mice moving a wheel on your brain to catch most of it  In case you lack of mice  try a babel fish on your ear  I heard its a wonder for understanding stuff    Beyond amazing   view spoiler  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams is a hilarious science fiction story  The whole book is covered in random  spontaneous theories about life  the universe  and everything  little excerpts from The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  the real one explaining what the next random thing is  and a bunch of things like dolphins and bowls of petunias that other books in the series make hilarious references to  Do you spend time writing stories with no real plot line  Ever tried to imagine what the universe really is  This book is for you    hide spoiler    Click that only if you need to  Don t judge it  it wasn t really meant to be read  You know  school stuff  Propably the only book i still remember several parts of  and still enjoy talking about  I read it one summer and was blown away  I couldn t put the book away  Sometimes my family was starring at me  for just bursting into laughter  But behind all the laughter and wittiness  I also found the book very philosophical Definitely a recommendation   and all of the other comedy sci fi  I ve ever read  will always be standing in the shadow of this one  Well done  Douglas Adams  book  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  part of his collection  The Ultimate Hitchhiker s Guide  is truly a science fiction classic  and I thoroughly enjoyed it  Douglas Adam s writing style is unique and humorous  easily touching subjects both mundane and philosophical in nature   In the beginning the Universe was created  This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move   This and other lines such as   The answer to the Great Question of Life  the Universe  and Everything is forty two    are iconic in popular culture for their whimsical outlook on deep existential issues  Overall  although Adams work lost me in its sprawling  random nature  its odd characters and humorous plot lines were immensely enjoyable to follow The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy has no clear theme  only an acknowledgement of the vastness of the Universe and the futility of defining and understanding it all  Douglas Adams  story is full of twists and turns that can be disorienting in the face of classic literature with clear meaning  Although these books all have story arcs and dynamic characters  they lack a cohesive meaning or purpose  And that is exactly the point  I believe  When you learn to simply go along with the story and let it take you where it will  this attitude becomes a theme in itself The characters are the heart of the books  being their only clear continuity  The first character we are introduced to  and one I often felt myself sympathizing with  is Arthur Dent  who is described as  about thirty as well as tall  dark haired and never quite at ease with himself   and characterized as an average  if boring  Englishman  The books start with the destruction of Earth to clear space for an interspace bypass  which Arthur escapes with his longtime friend Ford Prefect  who just so happens to be a field researcher for the Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy and from somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse  Ford Prefect is a random  unruly character who seems to appreciate  above all  a good drink  We are also introduced to Tricia McMillan  or  Trillian   an astrophysicist who escaped Earth s doom when she meets the President of the Universe  Zaphod Beeblebrox  Zaphod Beeblebrox is described as a brilliant  reckless two headed man  and he is a major character in much of the series Overall  I loved The Ultimate Hitchhiker s Guide and Douglas Adams  unique style of writing  It was truly a breath of fresh air  and I can safely recommend The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy and its continuations to any fan of science fiction  comedy  or classics in general  I really enjoyed this book  I thought it was smartly written and funny throughout  One annoying aspect of sci fi  I find at least  is the complete fabrication of ideas and species that don t have any relevance and are just to show something  normal  to aliens  Hitchhiker s Guide does that  but uses always in funny and irrelevant ways that add to the enjoyment  It seems completely random at times  but portions come together seamlessly at the conclusion  It is relentlessly funny  and the genius in this book is unparalleled by anything else I ve ever read  The humor comes not only from the writing style of Adams but the creative situations Adams devises in creating this story Arthur Dent isn t the greatest of protagonists from a traditional standpoint  but what makes it work is how Adams uses him  He is the device used to allow Adams show us this crazy Universe through the mind of another human  We get to see how we would view this Universe as well as how others in this Universe would view humans   I would fully recommend this book to everyone  Not only was it a hilarious book  but it was masterfully written  The writing in the book is almost sarcastic in nature  and it adds to the humor of the book  I also liked that it is also a higher level book  and the humor does not take away from the maturity of the story  All in all the author does a good job at creating an amazing  well written plot while throwing in hilarity of all sorts  If you love funny stories  I would recommend it  If you love science fiction and funny stories  then you must read   I can t believe I put off reading this for so long  Think with all the hype I just didn t want to be disappointed when I actually got to it  but I was surprised to find that it was even better than what I d heard  It s kind of hard to describe what exactly The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy really is  I tend to agree with some of the criticisms that there s not very much focus on plot development or story here and that mostly it s a collection of really witty  punny  and sarcastic observations about humanity and the universe  but that doesn t really detract anything from how clever it is  Adams wrote this at a time when really there was nothing comparable  It s hard to describe the exact flavor of Adams work  it s certainly unique  but it does echo a lot of things that modern readers should be familiar with  Imagine  if you will  throwing Monty Python  Kurt Vonnegut  specifically Slaughterhouse V   and Chuck Palahniuk in a blender   and that about captures it  In short  by the end  I found myself reading not to find out what happens  but just for the sheer pleasure of listening to Adams HItchhiker s is funny  light hearted in spite of the backdrop of the story being the destruction of the Earth  and extremely well crafted  Adams uses language masterfully  examining nuances and the connotation of words and facts about us that seems like an insanely chaotic metacognitive philosophical treatise with a thread of humor all the way through  To be sure  this book is nerdy and geeky in the extreme   I think a basic knowledge of physics is definitely required to fully appreciate all of the humor in here   even to appreciate all of the scientific creativity  Reading this as late as I have  I was astonished to see just how much of a cultural impact the book has had  from Babel fish to Deep Thought  Will definitely read again  This book is super fun  I also recommend the audiobook narrated by the author  He does a fantastic job  If you like a really imaginative story with done very quick wit  this is it   There is Arthur  the plucky and apathetic man from Earth who is hinted to be the protagonist  and his humanoid yet not of Earth friend named Ford  who has been stranded on Earth for fifteen years  It is either by random or chemical chance that these characters are met with Trillian and the President of the Galaxy  the former being more fit for the position than the latter  With them there is the mechanically depressed robot  Melvin  All of these characters  while having nothing in common other than being half willingly placed together in space  share one common goal  to make sense of the senseless chaos that is the Milky Way Galaxy   And so begins one of the funniest and most inappropriately labeled  trilogies  of all time    Arthur Dent  your average Englishman  who never got the hang of Thursdays  starts the day with his house being demolished and ends up traveling across the galaxy   A classic of modern humor and science fiction  the Hitchhiker s Guide set the bar for many series and authors to follow  I ve read this book dozens of times  and I still laugh out loud at parts of it  If you haven t yet read any Douglas Adams  I am very  very jealous of you  you ve quite a treat ahead of you  Adams  untimely death was one of the most traumatic experiences of my life  and to this day I still hopefully check the  A  section in science fiction whenever I walk through a bookstore in the vain hope that somehow  some way  another book in this series will miraculously appear  Douglas Adams has the greatest and strangest sense of humor I have had the pleasure of reading  Hysterical at times  eye rolling at others  and almost always ridiculous  the Hitchhiker s Guide series goes on my favorites list forever  If you can  get the audio version though  the one read by Adams himself  The  Best  Where to begin  What a brilliant piece of ridiculousness  It s so freeing to find witty humour in science fiction that s read so easily  I recently re read this book because I needed some relaxation away from other more serious apocalyptic novels  Now I think I might want to read it again  Read as part of The Hitch Hiker s Guide to the Galaxy  A Trilogy in Five Parts  For instance  on the planet Earth  man had always assumed that he was more intelligent than dolphins because he had achieved so much  the wheel  New York  wars and so on  whilst all the dolphins had ever done was muck about in the water having a good time  But conversely  the dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent than man  for precisely the same reasons  This book is absurd  It s at times nonsensical  But Don t Panic cause it s all part of a brilliant joke Douglas Adams has succeded in making a glorious masterpiece by combining two genres that I terribly enjoy  Science Fiction and Comedy You don t read this book for the plot  Or because it s depiction of the Universe and of the Galaxy is truly fascinating  You read it because it s bloody fun  Loved it  unique and brilliantly written  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is the first instalment of five in the Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy series  This book is what first got me  hitched  on Douglas Adam s books and this series in particular  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is a Science Fiction novel with a philosophical twist  It addresses abstract ideas in humorous ways  It addresses concepts such as an individual s insignificance to the vast expanse of the universe and no matter how important that person may seem  they are just a speck on a speck  which is a part of a speck  which is free falling along with billions of other specks  Along with the philosophical aspects  the actual storyline is very intriguing and sometimes humerous  It starts off right before the imminent destruction of earth and with a man named Arthur Dent  During the first pages of the book it describes how Arthur lives out his days  but his house is going to be bulldozed to make way for a bypass road in the near future  The book then cuts to a man named Ford Prefect  Arthur s friend  is the only one who is aware of the destruction of earth and  using some device  takes Arthur and hitches a ride on a nearby spaceship  From then on both Arthur and Ford embark on many adventures and misadventures which will change the course of history forever   After learning that the world was about to end  wouldn t anyone want to call his or her family  go have a drink or just cry  No  not for Arthur Dent  He gets on a spacecraft and travels the galaxy with aliens  In The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  the Earth has twelve minutes left  With just a towel  Arthur Dent and his friend Ford Prefect hitch a ride on the nearest spacecraft and begin the adventures of a lifetime  This book takes place in many different places  such as modern day Earth  Krikkit  or even the restaurant at the end of the universe  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is part of a series  but there is a version of the story called The Ultimate Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy that includes all five novels in one outrageous volume  They include The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  The Restaurant at the End of the Universe  Life  the Universe and Everything  So Long  and Thanks for All the Fish  and Mostly Harmless  These books  written by Douglas Adams  were originally a radio comedy broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 1978  but there have been many formats of this story  including stage shows and a Hollywood film  The author did a great job in creating humor for the readers  Douglas Adams wrote this book similarly to how one would talk  rather than the traditional way to write a book  In the book  Zaphod Beeblebrox says    If there s anything more important than my ego around  I want it caught and shot now   68   Adams  creative way of writing makes this book readable and enjoyable to all ages  In addition  Douglas Adams uses unique vocabulary that is unlike any other author  such as  mind bogglingly   53  I would recommend this book to people of all ages  from teenagers to parents to grandparents  This book is for people who would enjoy science fiction  comedy  or just a fun book to read  Douglas Adams wrote the book in a way that it could attract many different types of readers The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy has received many awards  such as Number one on the Sunday Times best seller list in 1979  Waterstone s Books Channel Four s list of the  One Hundred Greatest Books of the Century   at number 24 in 1996 and BBC s  Big Read   an attempt to find the  Nation s Best loved book   ranked it number four in 2003  These awards were very fitting for this book  and it is a book that has been loved for a long time and will continue to be enjoyed  Douglas Adams should be really nice guy to talk with  That s what I get from the first book of the series  I am really sorry to read this book this late but maybe it is the right time because if I had read it earlier  maybe I wouldn t be able to grab every detail  every funny dialogue and every pinch of imagination that good By so far  Zaphod is my favorite character I think  He is meaningless but revokes a feeling in you that he is also full of meanings  Arthur is a solid British guy in space and Ford is an experienced space traveller but they are all characters that you don t want to lose throughout the book  But the book is written in a so  happy  mood that you don t expect anything bad to happen to these characters I can t wait to finish the series   Why hadn t I read the hitchhiker s guide to the galaxy until now  The whole series  WHY   I need to pick up the physical copy and read it immediately  This was SOOOOO good  Satirical and full of humors  Brilliant   This book is one of the most interesting and hilarious books that I ve ever read  the whole series actually   I ve had a hard time writing this review as I just don t even know where to start  So  I ve decided to skip the  I think this  I think that  bullshit and get right to the parts that made me pee myself when I read them  Below are some crazy new vocabulary from the book and my favorite laugh out loud quotes VOCABSozzed  Diodes  Niggly  Myxomatosis  fjords  Don t ask me what they mean QUOTES CH 1 Some factual information for you  Have you any idea how much damage that bulldozer would suffer if I just let it roll straight over you   How much   said Arthur  None at all  said Mr Prosser   CH 6Now it is such a bizarrely improbable coincidence that anything so mindbogglingly useful could have evolved purely by chance that some thinkers have chosen to see it as the final and clinching proof of the non existence of God  The argument goes something like this  I refuse to prove that I exist   says God   for proof denies faith  and without faith I am nothing   But   says Man   The Babel fish is a dead giveaway  isn t it  It could not have evolved by chance  It proves you exist  and so therefore  by your own arguments  you don t  QED   Oh dear   says God   I hadn t thought of that   and promptly vanished in a puff of logic  Oh  that was easy   says Man  and for an encore goes on to prove that black is white and gets himself killed on the next zebra crossing Arthur grabbed hold of it and tried to stop his hands shaking  He pressed the entry for the relevant page  The screen flashed and swirled and resolved into a page of print  Arthur stared at it  It doesn t have an entry   he burst out Ford looked over his shoulder  Yes it does   he said   down there  see at the bottom of the screen  just under Eccentrica Gallumbits  the triple breasted whore of Eroticon 6  Arthur followed Ford s finger  and saw where it was pointing  For a moment it still didn t register  then his mind nearly blew up  What  Harmless  Is that all it s got to say  Harmless  One word  Ford shrugged  Well  there are a hundred billion stars in the Galaxy  and only a limited amount of space in the book s microprocessors   he said   and no one knew much about the Earth of course   Well for God s sake I hope you managed to rectify that a bit   Oh yes  well I managed to transmit a new entry off to the editor  He had to trim it a bit  but it s still an improvement   And what does it say now   asked Arthur  Mostly harmless   admitted Ford with a slightly embarrassed cough  Mostly harmless   shouted Arthur CH 9 Haaaauuurrgghhh      said Arthur as he felt his body softening and bending in unusual directions  Southend seems to be melting away     the stars are swirling     a dustbowl     my legs are drifting off into the sunset     my left arm s

cold loathing whilst his logic circuits chattered with disgust and tinkered with the concept of directing physical violence against it  Further circuits cut in saying  Why bother  What s the point  Nothing is worth getting involved in  Further circuits amused themselves by analysing the molecular components of the door  and the humanoids  brain cells  For a quick encore they measured the level of hydrogen emissions in the surrounding cubic parsec of space and then shut down again in boredom  A spasm of despair shook the robot s body as he turned  Come on   he droned   I ve been ordered to

with this pocket calculator stuff    Deep Thought And with that  I sign off  I managed to pick up the rest of the series at a recent book sale so I am looking forward to rediscovering them again  If you have just to read this book  or the series  I recommend you do  I have met people who do not like the book or find it funny  KAT  tsk tsk    but I suggest you give it a go  it s worth the risk  Toodles http   www bibliobabes ca March_2011C     DON T PANIC   Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy deserves to be classified as an American Classic  Although th e book doesn t have the most challenging vocab or plot  the book is riddled with irony and references to many famous people throughout history  I can now finally watch the movie  And hopefully as the saying goes  the book will always be better than the movie  I would recommend this to everybody  It always worries me when I attempt to read something with such a cult following  that is so ingrained in the culture I know without me really knowing too much about it  Normally  what happens is that I then don t like it and people shout at me Thankfully  I really enjoyed reading this one  I was actually expecting it to be more madcap than it was  it had far more story to it than I had anticipated  I really enjoyed the satire  the imagination  and seeing things as they originally were  42  thanks for all the fish  etc  Clearly  the cult part of it has passed me by now  so I can t say that I love it as much as the most passionate fans do  but I found it engaging  The creativity involved speaks to me  and I m interested to read the second book too  I remember first reading the original  guide  as a teenager in the early 80 s and laughing out loud  all by myself  in response to almost every line written  The entire thing is one big joke  filled with medium sized jokes  and then filled with one liner jokes  Page after page of dry sarcastic intellectual   Monty Python  or  Fletch  style humor  I ve read it again several times over the years  and still laugh out loud until tears squeeze out of my eyes and my face hurts  even though there is no one there to share the jokes with  it s just that good  Douglas Adams is a man who knows where his towel is Hah  I don teven like SciFi but this weird little book was laugh out loud entertaining  and the audio narration was perfect  Perfect book for middle  junior   young adult readers   Puoi trovare questa recensione anche sul mio blog      La siepe di moreIo ho un debole per i libri folli  ma cosi folli da poter essere nati solo perche la probabilita si e stancata di essere tanto prevedibilmente probabile e si e fatta un giro nell improbabilita  E meno male Di Guida galattica per gli autostoppisti posso dirvi che non contiene un oncia di quella normalita quotidiana tanto rassicurante per noi esseri umani  Infatti  il motto che attraversa tutto il romanzo  e che rende la Guida galattica per gli autostoppisti cosi apprezzata nell universo  e  non fatevi prendere dal panico Niente panico anche quando la vostra casa sta per essere demolita dall oggi al domani per far spazio a una tangenziale  Niente panico quando il vostro pianeta sta per essere demolito per far spazio a un autostrada iperspaziale  Niente panico quando da un pianeta leggendario vengono sparati due missili che distruggeranno la vostra navicella spaziale Si da il caso  infatti  che se non vi farete prendere dal panico  magari ne uscirete vivi  improbabile non e mica sinonimo di impossibile  a meno che non vi facciate prendere dal panico  naturalmente   Riuscirete a ricordarvi perfino di prendere un asciugamano  strumento indispensabile per l autostoppista  ma dove vai se l asciugamano non ce l hai    La guia del autoestopista galacticoNunca algo profundo se difrazo tan perfectamente de superficial  Hay que disfrutar del nonsense para disfrutar la Guia  por supuesto  Ah  y hay que tomarse muy muy poco en serio las grandes preguntas de la humanidad  el universo  la vida y todo lo demas Son 5 tomitos  el primero es genial  Luego decaen entre chispazos deslumbrantes   This was one of the funniest books I ve ever read and I m upset it took me this long to finally check it out  I d recommend it to anyone and everyone  Loved it  Etiquette  tag etagere bookshelf  du genre   1  ton_absurde 2  decor_espaceDefense de mon point de vue sur les attraits usuels les plus importants du livre Je suis tout a fait en accord avec les attraits usuels utilises par la professeure  En effet  Le Guide du voyageur galactique est un roman de science fiction avec un ton a la farce et des personnages tres originaux  Par contre  je crois qu il est possible d aller un peu plus en profondeur dans la qualification du roman  d ou le pourquoi je propose deux autres etiquettes  Certes  ce roman trempe dans l humour et la farce  mais plus precisement  dans l humour absurde qui est defini par des situations illogiques provoquant le rire  ce qui est exactement ce que l on retrouve dans ce roman  Papineau  2012   J ai donc rajoute une etiquette qui  selon moi  definirait bien mieux le ton  soit ton_absurde  Un autre attrait usuel qui  je pense  devrait etre privilegie comme attrait principal  est celui du decor  En effet  une grande partie du roman  si ce n est pas la majorite  se deroule dans l espace  un decor de predilection quant a la litterature de science fiction et qui caracterise non seulement bien le genre  mais surtout le livre  Rajouter cette etiquette qui n apparait pas dans celles de la professeure me semble donc important Je ne pense pas que le livre ait des faiblesses au niveau de certains attraits  Par contre  un feru de science fiction qui croit que ce genre se doit d etre serieux et qui ne voit pas la place de l humour  la satire et l absurde dans ce genre pourrait etre decu par ce roman  La lecture est legere  loin de la science fiction classique a la Asimov  et cela pourrait rebuter certains lecteurs  Un lecteur qui aime l humour  mais qui a rarement touche a la science fiction  pourrait etre agreablement surpris par ce livre  notamment du au ton du roman  mais aussi a cause des personnages qui sont tres originaux et excentriques  Ce serait  je crois  une belle transition vers ce genre  loved it  easy read  laugh out loud moments   unexpected twists  looking forward to embarking on the next installment for some more light relief blood  blood  blood  What did I just read This book    was hilarious  I guess I ll start there  Like  snorting all over every page hilarious  The entire book is a joke  More than that  life itself is a joke  And the solution  laugh at it  I think Douglas Adams is a genius  I honestly don t know how he did it  but this entire book seemed like a rocket ship tearing out of control that just happened to keep itself together enough to keep the plot moving  Literary conventions are put to shame  literalists would toss the book aside at the third page  and the overly religious would burn it at the 30th  But the philosopher would just chuckle knowingly Because this book  as wild  ridiculous  and improbable as it is  closely critiques all of our assumptions we have as a human race  We assume that we are the masters of our planet  that we are here for some purpose  that there is meaning in what we do  that we act with morality in mind  But what if  in a few minutes  our planet were just blown up to make way for a galactic bypass  What if we re not the most intelligent species on our planet  but dolphins have figured out that play is really far more worth it than work and war  and mice are actually performing experiments on us  What if we re nothing more than a couple billion cell collectives on an insignificant ball of rock living out our mundane carbon based lives And if you think about it    we really are just that So what did I just read  I don t know  but it was pretty fantastic  so much fun  that s pretty much all I can say about it I generally don t re read books  Usually I feel like my time would be better used just reading another book  instead of reading something that I ve already read  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is one of those books that I can re read without feeling like I ve wasted my time  It s funny  and just because I know what s coming doesn t make it any less so I decided to re read The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy because a while ago I made an attempt to read the whole series  That attempt ended with me finishing about 2 of the books  possibly starting the 3rd   I don t remember   A few years later  as a slightly older person  I feel like the absurdity really strikes a chord nowadays and I don t think I ll have a problem finishing the entire series this time What really gets me about Douglas Adams  writing is that it s thoroughly humorous  silly  and sometimes downright nonsensical  But if you take a moment to think about it you might find yourself drawing some interesting  possibly even intelligent sounding  philosophical conclusions  While I love any sci fi book that leads to those kinds of thoughts  something about a silly sci fi book that leads to those kinds of thoughts is even better    Un gran saludo a todas las formas de vida inteligente   y a todos los que andeis por ahi  Definitivamente el mejor libro que he leido este ano  y tal vez el mejor en los ultimos dos anos   el final se me hizo demasiado abierto  pero adecuado porque asi es la vida   Unas palabras dichas a la ligera pueden costar mas de una vida  pero no siempre se aprecia el problema en toda su envergadura  Su punto mas fuerte es la manera tan ligera y graciosa en que esta narrado  su punto mas debil es que realmente no logramos conocer a fondo a los personajes  aunque no al grado de que nos den enteramente igual y su pueda cambiar a uno por otro sin que a nadie le interese   Tenia usted derecho a hacer sugerencias o a presentar objeciones a su debido tiempo   A su debido tiempo  Grito Arthur  A su debido tiempo  La primera noticia que he tenido fue ayer  cuando vino un obrero a mi casa  Le pregunte si venia a limpiar las ventanas y me contesto que no  que venia a derribar mi casa        Pero mister Dent  los planos han estado expuestos en la oficina de planificacion local desde hace nueves meses  Ah claro  ayer por la tarde  en cuanto me entere  fui corriendo a verlos  No se ha excedido usted precisamente en llamar la atencion hacia ellos   Verdad que no  Me refiero a decirselo realmente a alguien  o algo asi  Pero los planos estaban a la vista     A la vista  Si incluso tuve que bajar al sotano para verlos Ahi esta el departamento de exposicion publica Con una linterna Bueno  probablemente se habia ido la luz Igual que en las escaleras Pero bueno  encontro el aviso  no  Si contesto Arthur   lo encontre  Estaba a la vista en el fondo de un archivador cerrado con llave colocado en un lavabo en desuso en cuya puerta habia un letrero que decia   Cuidado con el leopardo  Me encanto Marvin el robot depresivo  Al igual que Arthur Dent  Arthur Dent  presentandose a si mismo al estilo James Bond   y Ford Perfect  Trillian y Zaphod eran secundarios que aportaban a la historia sin resaltar ni desvanecerse   El tiempo es una ilusion  Y a la hora de comer  mas todavia   A pesar de que pasa muy poco tiempo desde el inicio hasta el final del libro  la trama no se siente ni excesivamente rapida  ni infernalmente lenta  Definitivamente este libro me hace desear mas tanto de la saga como del autor  que al comenzar a leerlo desconocia que fuera una saga   Cada momento  y las probabilidades que van mostrando esta genial   It doesn t matter how many times you read The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy it will never fail to thrill  excite  and induce bouts of almost uncontrollably laughter  Don t doubt that this is a story full of good humor and ingenuity I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this book   I loved the book  It was hilarious and well written  I am also aware of the fact that it s definitely not a book for the masses  Either you like it  or you hate it  There seems to be no middle ground  If you want to read it  be aware of the fact that you will not find answers in this book  it will not enlighten you  and you most definitely will not find a heart warming message in it  The whole book is nothing but a satire  a very good one        a big hello to all intelligent life forms everywhere    and to everyone else out there  the secret is to bang the rocks together  guys    One of the best books  SCI Fi and kid friendly  that I have ever read  What a blast it was to read this with my daughter  reading Holes was another incredible read   The comedy is LOL and we re excited to watch the movie and then start reading the next part of this exciting tome   I started with Number 10  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy because as fate would have it I was about to start reading it anyway when I began this expenditure  I couldn t have been more thrilled  This book has catapulted its way into my top ten favorite books of all time  My only complaint is that no one ever forced me to read this book sooner  Why when I was reading Dune  and the Gunslinger  did no one think to shove this one under my nose  Not only am I finally understanding many jokes and allusions that I wasn t before ex  Babel fishes  and the poor  unbeknownst kamikaze sperm whale  but I feel like I have now graduated to another plane of geekdom that I was only allowed to gaze up at before  Why  oh why  did Douglas Adams have to die  The man is brilliant at sarcastic  smart prose  Irony and wit simply salivate out of this book  Not being able to see this genius in person is right up there with not punching my ex in the face when I had the chance in regards to   Jaki s top ten most regretted things   Fandomania says that The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy   Is considered one of science fiction s most hilarious and classic books   It is required reading for anyone who considers themselves sci fi fans   I could go on to tell you that the main character is Arthur Dent  and I could give you a brief outline of what the story entails  but honestly I really shouldn t  If you have yet to read this book I would be doing a disservice to you by ruining any microsecond that you may have reveling in the discoveries that lash out at you on every page  Believe me  your brain will thank me  Ok  the simple review  This is my  One book on an island  book  I can t wait to read it again  Light  unserious  clever  clever  brilliant  silly  actually mind opening while still being still  adventurous and really really fun The most joyous use of language I ve ever read and that includes Tom Robbins  I want to not only reread this book  I want to have written this book The best  most fun book  I ve ever read  I read this book in the mid eighties  It has my favorite beginning to a book     Far out  on the unfashionable end of the western spiral arm of the universe  there lies a small unregarded yellow sun  Orbiting this sun at a distance of approximately 93 million miles  is a completely insignificant little blue green planet  whose ape descended life forms are so amazingly primative  they still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea      From the time I read that beginning I was hooked  It is funny  deep  silly  witty and will keep you smiling all the way through  THIS WAS AMAZING  I wish I could leave a witty  significant review  but no  so here I lovelovelove the way human condition is ironized  it s witty  amusing and also tender and full of understanding  Stuff to be understood is  it s important for people to reflect on the major questions of life  but it s paramount not to take them seriously  The characters are great  though more a means to an end than profound psychologies  I love how Arthur keeps up for a human whose planet has just been blown up  he s sarcastic  witty and bitterly amusing  Oh  and Marvin the Paranoid Android is delightful  The Infinite Improbabity Drive is the best thing that an author could come up with  ever  It makes way to ENDLESS plot changes which don t need an actual explanation  which  in fact  is pretty much what happens in real life  too  Not to mention the concept itself  which is brilliant  I think I also like the fact that this book could have proven to be very philosophical  but it didn t  Even after the forty two and the Question and the Answer and the truth about the purpose of Earth  which makes a lot of sense and might actually be true  I mean it is  the part about one single mechanism  at least  Adams brings MICE into the equation  I mean  really  Mice  In my view  this is a way of saying  huh  are you expecting to find out something interesting about Life  the Universe and Everything  Something immensely significant and fascinating  Here  have some mice   Mice were basically to us what 42 was to the first humans who built the super intelligent computer  Which works just fine for me  As far as human existence goes  this might as well be the most coherent answer we ll ever get I ve been wanting to read this book for about five years and I m a bit curious of what my reaction to it had been if I d have read it earlier  Back then when I still didn t know what I believe in  it would ve probably become some sort of bible for me  I think this happened now  too  Somehow  Without the religious implications  is that even possible  No  okay   I knew I would like it  I always did  If I had happened to own an Infinite Improbability Drive  I would ve probably had more success in reading it not very late Hm  Well  anyway  if aliens come to Earth and want to know things about humanity  we should definitely have them read this   I feel like the whole time you re reading you re trying to catch up with all the crazy things that are being said  and the glimpses of genius you do understand are the greatest bits you ll ever read in your life  Never could I think comedy and deep philosophical thinking could coexist so perfectly until I read the words of Douglas Adams  We need more Adams in the universe  though I m not sure how much they d enjoy that    This is one I ve meant to get around to for a long time  and I m glad I finally did  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is social commentary clothed in absurdist sci fi comedy  Which  if you re going to do social commentary  is the way I prefer it to be delivered  Hitchhiker s Guide is like a quest story without a quest  Its beauty lies in the absurdity of its events  characters  notes from the eponymous Guide which explains life across the universe  and the inside jokes for us Earthlings  The fun is in losing your  earthly  perspective and experiencing an outlook that goes beyond all of human accomplishment  Adams imagines life millions of years advanced from Earth and how even such an advanced civilization still wants to know the meaning of life  The story hits on all philosophical extremes  from pondering the meaning of existence to wondering whether existence even matters  There s also an interesting juxtaposition between organic life and robotic life that is hilarious and poses interesting questions about existence  Earth is often the butt of the joke in this story  but no matter how advanced the aliens are in this book  we see that their flaws  and sometimes their strengths  mirror our own  Definitely a story worth reading multiple times  Every page had me laughing out loud while reading in an empty room  It s a wonderful feeling when the written word causes this kind of reaction in me Five stars for Adams  ability to use comedy and a wild imagination to produce a thoughtful and hilarious take on existence   Really short  but thoroughly enjoyable  The writing style is fantastic   A clinically depressed robot  a know it all computer  a president of the galaxy with three heads and a man from earth just along for the ride is the basis of this hilarious story by Douglas Adams  Hitchhiker s Guide To The Galaxy  by Douglas Adams is one of his greatest books that uses comic relief  Syntax and Imagery to describe Arthur Dent s life after the destruction of Earth due to the need to make way for a galactic freeway  The author s style is formed by these three devices mainly and creates a really humorous tone through out the whole book  For example in chapter 7  Vogon poetry is the 3rd worst in the Universe   The very worst poetry of all perished along with its creator  Paula Nancy Millstone Jennings of Greenbridge  Essex  England  in the destruction of the Planet Earth   This line is one of many humorous lines in the book and is only a glimpse into Douglas Adams  style  First he uses comic relief a lot to keep even the most suspenseful scenes some what comical  For example on page 146  the man who helped create earth was describing why earth was built and says   Earthman  the planet you lived on was commissioned  paid for and run by mice   This line is one example of a suspenseful part of the book and he adds a twist to the book s plot  Second he uses Syntax all throughout the book in certain parts that add to the tone of the story  On page 30  The ships hung in the sky much the same way that bird s don t  And nothing happened   This line creates suspense because it is describing earth about to be destroyed which is an emotional part of the book to a reader that s on earth  Lastly he uses imagery to help paint a picture in the readers head and appeal to the senses  On page 140  The aircar sailed through the night   This use of imagery gives an image of the aircar just smoothly going through the sky by using the word  sailed   I really enjoyed this book  It is full of suspense followed by comic relief which is a key part to Douglas Adams  style  There multiple examples of him using these stylistic devises to portray his tone but i felt that imagery  comic relief and syntax where his strongest devices in this book   One of my personal favourites  Surreal  intelligent and very funny  Also incredibly British  Douglas Adams was a genius  If you don t like this book  you probably put your babel fish in the wrong hole  You are the reason that human beings are only the third most intelligent species on earth behind mice and dolphins  So long  and thanks for all the fish  Courtesy   Tom Listening to the audiobook of the Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy was an AMAZING experience  I love the way Stephen Fry told the story  I definitely recommend listening to this audiobook  it will blow your mind   D The funniest book I have ever read  Exactly one part genius and one part hilarious  I really need to read this again  42    This is one of the funniest and best books I have ever read  Even if the story wasn t that good it still would have been a very very VERY interesting book to read because of the language that is so perfectly thought through  It is hilarious   I would have loved the book even if it only contained a boring plot AND theese quotations  taken from the book     Arthur  Let s go somewhere  Trillian  Definitely  Where d you have in mind  Ford  I know this great restaurant at the end of the universe    One of the things Ford Prefect had always found hardest to understand about humans was their habit of continuously stating and repeating the very very obvious  as in It s a nice day  or You re very tall  or Oh dear you seem to have fallen down a thirty foot well  are you all right     Space is big  You just won t believe how vastly  hugely  mind  bogglingly big it is  I mean  you may think it s a long way down the road to the chemist s  but that s just peanuts to space Douglas Adams has a way of stating the obvious in the most entertaining way  I love his sense of humour  But not only does he have a great language  he also lets his crazy imagination run wild  which results in a great plot as well Read this book  I guarantee a laugh  FANTASTIC     The Hitchhiker s Guide To The Galaxy is simply Douglas Adams Monalisa  This book is by far my all time favorite  The right amount of everything  made the perfect comical sci fi adventure  Before reading it  life was sad      Then i bought a Digital Watch and everything is a rainbow   DDD For instance  on the planet Earth  man had always assumed that he was more intelligent than dolphins because he had achieved so much    the wheel  New York  wars and so on    whilst all the dolphins had ever done was muck about in the water having a good time  But conversely  the dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent than man    for precisely the same reasons    This book was really cool  It was a SciFi book and I needed a book for our fiction unit so I picked it up  Two of my friends rated it 5 stars and I loved it  It is a very unimaginable book where a dude almost gets his house knocked down but he lays in front of a bulldozer to stop it  This foreshadows that a Vogon ship is going to come and knock down and demolish Earth for a highway in space  They get picked up as hitchhikers by the vogon ship s cooks but get caught by the vogons  They get blasted out into space and in the approximately 30 seconds that they had to live they were picked up as hitchhikers from a ship called the heart of gold  This ship was a stolen ship by Zaphod Beeblebrox and they go on a journey to find this really weird planet that used to manufacture planets  I am not going to include any more spoilers because I want everyone to read it  Je to porad stejne genialni  SO GOOD  I can t believe that the last time I read this book was ten years ago  TEN YEARS  I had read it at 14 or 15 years old  sometime before the movie came out  I can t wait to read this to Conor  It is among the funniest books I ve ever read  and one that speaks to my nerdy little heart  I need to re read this more often  and I m going to finish off the series again  I still quote huge amounts of this book in my everyday life  and some of the things I ve been saying I don t believe I realized were from the book because so much time had passed since my last read  The only complaint I continue to have is Zaphod having two heads  I don t think he needed two   I loved this book  Hilarious   DThe Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is a really great read  especially if you read it while preparing for exams like I did  DThe Earth  one day  boils away into the universe and only one human is able to survive along with his alien friend  The book is all about their journey in the huge universe from one spaceship to another The characters in this book were fun to read  Dent  Trillian  Zaphod and Ford  all of them will keep you hooked to this book till you reach the last word  My favourite part characters were Eddie and Marvin  especially Marvin  the former being a computer and the latter a depressed robot  Marvin s character was like icing on the cake with his mechanical witty depressed remarks  Most of the my people have already read this book  but those who haven t  please try it and I am sure you ll love it as much as I did  In the end I would say that this book has the right amount of insanity to keep me sane    D Wow  Rarely do I laugh aloud when reading  but I found that I simply couldn t stop myself  I simply couldn t put this one down  A pinball adventure  not having the faintest clue what would happen next and thoroughly witty  I have this strange feeling that I might pick up this book again  in the not too distant future   who knows   None of the other books in the series  and by that comment  I mean the original four volume saga  pre  Mostly Harmless   come close to this lunatic slice of philosophical comic brilliance  You can see why this stamped itself onto the imagination of so many people   and why Douglas Adams is so missed  I had actually decided to read this book because I saw a friend of mine reading it one day in the library  I had asked her how it was and all she said was that it was good  though she is usually a sort of harsh critic on books so I thought it would be amazing and it was The category in which I put this book is the science fiction box  I found the category interesting when I had looked at it  as I had not read a science fiction book before  After reading it I think the book had been excellently executed  as I found that I could not put the book down over the past couple of days  One of my favourite quotes from this book is  A towel   The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  says  is about the most massively useful thing an interstellar hitchhiker can have         wrap it round your head to ward off noxious fumes or avoid the gaze of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal  such a mind boggingly stupid animal  it assumes that if you can t see it  it can t see you   you can wave your towel in emergencies as a distress signal  and of course dry yourself off with it if it still seems to be clean enough   From this book I think that my favourite quotes had come from  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy book  because randomly Ford or Arthur would look up something when they were in grave danger and it would produce  useful  information  Of course Ford would take the book s advice since he had been using it to survive as a hitchhiker for many years  but to Arthur it seemed like a whole bunch of random things a lunatic would have written  Although I found these  facts  quite interesting to read about I couldn t help but sometimes get a bit annoyed when Adams would put in 1 2 pages of random information about a particular animal or place when the novel was in the middle of a tense moment Something that I have learned from this novel is that you shouldn t take anything for granted  As Arthur Dent had taken everyday life for granted doing almost the same thing every day  but when the Earth had been destroyed to make way for a hyperspace bypass  Arthur had found that one of the things that he missed most was tea  As he had been in a totally different environment to anything before and he wanted to be comforted by something that was from earth  Though I think what the author was trying to say is that you should cherish the things you have in your life right now  even the minor things like a cup of tea because you will never know when they will be taken from you  A setting that was interesting to me was Magrathea  as the characters had been travelling for millions of miles to find this legendary planet that supposedly created custom planets for the richest people in the galaxy  Adams had actually described in much detail  he even went on to describe how the sun on Magrathea rose every day  I could vividly see the gigantic factory and the machines inside of it  Though what really interested me was Slartibartfast as he had the job of creating the fjords on earth when it was ordered by the mice millions of years ago  He actually had some sort attachment to them which I did not quite understand   If I was to suggest a Sci fi book to anyone  this would be my number 1 choice  Douglas Adam s does an A  job in melding drama with humor  This book spawned an immense sub culture and a melody of pop culture references  This is a must read book  What is there really to say about a book that takes liberty with the operation of the known universe  throw in characters definitely not one dimensional  well most anyway with the exception of the one dimensional characters   just joshing   and a guidebook one could only hope to own one day  I d say its one fun read  I finished it years ago  but recently read it again longing for a wacky good time  Wonderfully weird and absurd  And I m talking my favourite type  Monty Python s absurd  What can I say more Thank you for all the fish   En los remotos e inexplorados confines del arcaico extremo occidental de la espiral de la Galaxia  brilla un pequeno y despreciable sol amarillento  Para quien no sea muy afecto a leer ciencia ficcion  la perspectiva de leer una novela del genero quizas no sea muy halaguena  Sin embargo  La guia del autoestopista galactico es mas que un libro sobre viajes espaciales  alienigenas  seres pandimensionales y civilizaciones que se dedican a construir planetas  Al igual que muchos autores aclamados al paso de los siglos  Adams nos plantea la vieja pregunta que ha desvelado a los miles de millones de filosofos  profesionales y amateurs  que han tratado de iluminar a la humanidad   Cual es LA respuesta a la vida  el universo y todo lo demas Claro que lo interesante no es la pregunta  sino el viaje que hacemos al tratar de responderla  Al final  si la respondemos o no carece de importancia  pero la aventura  la alegria de recorrer el camino  y la venturosa experiencia de reirnos de la humanidad  es decir  de nosotros mismos  es lo mejor que nos regala el libro   MIND BLOWN  BRILLIANT CONCEPT  THE AUTHOR IS A GENIUS AND CREATES A LEGACY OF HIS OWN  My initial reaction after some pages of the book was like someone was speaking french to me  Literally because in the start it s difficult to get used to the scientifically used terms in the language but once I got used to it  it was freaking awesome  The author has invented such different concepts related to the universe that I had to take a bow to him  These kind of books come very rare and may not come again This book is about a scientific adventure across the universe Straight to the POSITIVES     Most sci fi and dystopian books usually start from the moment that something bad has happened to the earth or on the earth and the rest of book is what effect it has on the characters and what they do about it   Nah but not this book  This book starts and within the ten minutes the earth is destroyed  POOF  gone and the story starts from there  This was such a unique approach which left me praising the thinking of the author   This book has a great authentic and inventive humor  I never knew that robots and space computers could be that funny   It has aliens but they act so much human ISH and you feel more connected to them   This novel is basically named on a book called  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  which is like an encyclopedia of all the universe  There is a two word phrase printed on the front of the Hitchhiker s Guide   DON T PANIC     Some parts of that book is mentioned time to time in the book  Imagine reading that     You get to learn many different space names which are enjoyable and tongue twisting like who could have imagine that president of the galaxy will be called ZAPHOD BEEBLEBROX   I was lucky to have the edition of this book which has extra material on the making of the movie and there s a very interesting history behind that so I recommend to read this edition which I reviewed   I never thought that a science fiction book can get into my favorites HIGHLY RECOMMENDED IF YOU ARE READY NOT TO PANIC  D A brilliant story  brilliantly told  I watched the film halfway through reading the book  and so I couldn t get the images of the film out of my head when I was reading  The characters were much more powerful in the book and I am disappointed at how Zaphod Beeblebrox was shown in the film  I loved the little tidbits of galactic humour  from The Hitchhiker s Guide  and just in general description and dialogue  I know this is aimed at younger readers  but I found this book engaging and entertaining  Ano de publicacion  1979 Adams ya hablaba de Libros Electronicos  La buena Ciencia Ficcion es aquella que sabe adelantarse en el tiempo y preveer el futuro No solo se queda ahi  El lenguaje satirico lo usa de tal manera  hablando de cosas completamente dispares  para demostrar las pobrezas de la civilizacion como la conocemos en el presente  tanto del autor como del nuestro  Un libro en el que te reis desde el comienzo al final  en el que el sinsentido termina teniendo todo el sentido del mundo  formando una paradoja incomprensible      El hecho de terminarlo solo me hizo decirme   tengo que conseguir El restaurante del fin del mundo   Loved it     one of the many conversations that got suck in my mind I wish I had listen my mother when I was youngwhat did she say I don t know  I didn t listenmagic Hilarious  Still loving it  If you enjoy space  aliens  and dry  British humor  or should I say humour   then this is one of the funniest books you will ever read  I d already seen a TV and movie version of this so I wasn t sure how much I d get out of reading it too  but holy crap this book is funny  It s not often that I laugh out loud while reading  or annoy my friends and family by forcing them to listen as I recite passages  but with this book I just can t help it  Even the author s introduction is hilarious  Marvin the Paranoid Android is my favourite character  not that it d make him feel better to hear it  And I m sure I ll never look at a towel or a mouse quite the same way again  Really  there s no adequate way to describe this book except to say that if you like humour  even if you don t like science fiction  you must read it  The Hitch Hiker s Guide to the Galaxy  is just the first book of a  trilogy in five parts  and I ve now started on the second part  I m not sure if I ll read all five right away since the book is due back to the library     ummm     last week  but I ll definitely come back to it  Aprire la mente passando per la risata D A  e un genio  When his friend  Ford Prefect  tells him that the earth will be destroyed in order to make room for a hyper space bypass  Arthur Dent finds himself traveling through time and space with Ford  If you have not done so already  read The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy and see what kinds of adventures await Arthur and Ford  An hilarious viewpoint on how insignificant we are   compared to the infinte vastness of the Universe  You will love Authur Dent   Ford Prefect and Zaphod in this amazing rib ticking   thought provoking novel by Douglas Adams  This is another of the books that my brother   Harish   had left back at home and which I had the good fortune to get my hands on  I would love to re read this beautiful piece of work   Where to begin  I ll start off by saying that The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is one of the best novels I ve ever read  And I m not saying this in an offhanded  I really liked this book  sort of way  but instead in a  if I had to choose three books to take with me on a deserted island  this book would be two of them  sort of way  Never has there been a book with such a unique and care free story line  I mean  it s about a man whose secretly alien friend saves him from an exploding Earth by taking him hitchhiking across the galaxy in a ship run entirely off of improbability  which was stolen by the President of the Galaxy and his girlfriend  And it s not just the plot  The writing style and the way the characters are portrayed are hysterical  and singular in their ability to make even the most grave of situations funny  If ever there was a book geared to make you die laughing  this one s it  So you could say my recommendation is a positive one  In fact  I recommend this book to anyone who likes laughing  science  ridiculous story lines  or fun in general  Having said that  I should stress the fact that at times  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy can be a bit confusing and may need to be read more than once to clear up details of the plot  However  I personally have read the book more than three times and still find every bit of it hilarious  so no worries about it growing old   Found it in a box of books left by the curb on a Hoboken sidestreet  Since I d heard some of the BBC radio broadcast  and loved it  and had heard other good things about this series of books  I carried it with me over to Filippo s pizzeria started to read it  It was just as good as I d imagined it could be  I ll let you guess whether I meant the pizza or the book   The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams is an amusing science fantasy novel  It follows Arthur Dent  who wakes up with bulldozers about to demolish his house to make a bypass  This event is followed by the Earth being demolished by aliens to create a hyperspace bypass  and he and his friend  revealed to be an alien  hitchhike away just in time  What follows involves space travel  giant planets  liberal improbability and of course  universal truths about life  the universe  and everything  A large amount of the book is set aboard a certain spaceship called the  Heart of Gold  however it features multiple hostile planets and vessels  The book is written in third person  and in the past tense  The book is primarily to entertain and to amuse  I found The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy very amusing  I think it could have been improved by going into more detail about some of Adams  outlandish creations  such as The Hooloovoo and Slartibartfast s creations  I would and have read other books by the same author   It was inane and stupendously hilarious  I loved the manic depressive robot and the technology with a mind of its own  Unbelievable in terms of its imagination  Must read   Muy divertido   La parte de los delfines y los ratones es de lo mejor  jajaAhora a seguir con el restaurante del fin del mundo deg Very EntertainingVery funny and overheated  Enjoyed the characterisation although Marvin the suicidal robot did become a bit much by the end  DONT PANIC I am only halfway through  but this book had to be commented on  Arthur Dent is weird  He is just so weird  it almost seems fake  but it isn t  He has an odd habit of lying in front of his house in the mud to protect his house  Ford never seems to gail to make me laugh  because of his odd habit of telling Arthur things at the wrong time  like the fact the Vogons are about to level the earth  So far  I love this book  and I am looking forward to the next   42   I had heard about this book for a long time  and thought it sounded silly  It is    and I LOVED it  I loved the wonderful word play  the sarcasm and irony  and the dry humor  I actually didn t  read  this book  I listened to it on CD  read by Stephen Fry  and although I definitely want to read it and savor the sentences  I highly recommond listening to it on CD  Stephen Fry  Jeeves from Jeeves and Wooster  was the perfect narrator  and I laughed all the way through it  Laugh out loud funny and smart  Funny about what  I don t know  That s what s so smart about it  By the time I ve gotten done laughing I ve forgotten the joke  and have to go read it again It s like that ship they steal in one of the later books  which I m also about to reread   Totally frictionless  My mind slides ride off of it  But I love it Love it LOVE it It s like a slippery Babel fish going in and out my ear  Now I get it  Now it s gone  Come back  come back Guess I better reread it again most random book i ve ever read Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees     In what world does this book have actual meaning  I don t think there is one  I don t think there could be one  But that being said  you must immediately read this book  Immediately  Like now  Right now  Go find one and read it  Now  Jajajajajajajajajaja  buenisimo  te ries y te ries     Awesome book   Have read this before years ago   decided to grab it again   have only actually read the first 3 books out of the series  will eventually get the whole series read    Be warned  if you hate all Monty Python movies  you will hate this book  It has the same kind of strange  warped humor  If you enjoy that kind of humor you will get a kick out of this series This is a fun  mindless ride  If you expect something halfway serious you will be disappointed  but if you are willing just to be taken on a entertaining ride   hop aboard The basic storyline is this  Arthur Dent is told by his friend Ford Prefect that he is actually an alien  and that Earth is about to be destroyed to make way for a glactic overpass  Ford Perfect offers Arthur Dent the opportunity to come with him and be safe  Arthur has a hard time believing this but comes along  He discovers that Ford Perfect is an alien and a field researcher for the galactic travelogue  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy   Things get really strange and hillarious from there  Loved every single bit of it  Such  such fun  A highly recommended read for all those who haven t read it yet  Pick it up NOW  This is my  Desert Island Book  and if you haven t read it yet  what are you waiting for  the end of the world Douglas Adams was a studious writer  ever wanting to perfect his craft and it kept getting better and better with each read  First launched as a six part BBC Radio show  I first heard it on our beloved CBC one morning soon after  it flourished into a world loved masterpeice of writing  through print  television and finally his dream  into film  and still continues after his passing with the sixth book is that more prfoundly misnamed Trillogy  The Hitch Hiker s Guide to the Galaxy  by Douglas Admas  gone to Lunch  we know he s well watered I have read it at least twice a year since it came out  I listened to the audio of the TV shows over 100 times   til I wore the tapes out  I now have his audiobooks  in his own voice  in his own emotoins as only can be heard from the writer  a most have for you collection  I fall aslepp to it easiest  with the most pleasant dreams  I carried a copy of the 5 book Trilogy across Europe for three years  it will fill your dreams of what could be possible tomorrow  Thanks for all the laughter that is still to come DA Blaine561 I would say that no other author has had a greater impact on my own work as a writer than Douglas Adams  I was very young when I first heard the radio program for Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  but I immediately found myself enamored with the writing style  Dry  but silly  absurd and biting all the while maintaining a  mostly  coherent story The book lived up to the excellent radio production and added to it with new content and changes to the original story  Adams s technique for structuring multi layered jokes in a couple of sentences or hitting a funny note by finishing a single ordinary sentence in a way that I did not expect struck me as genius It has been decades since I first read Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy and to this day I will still find myself laughing at many of the scenes  The dialog between the characters is all exceptionally British but each character is subtly presented in the way their voices ring true despite the unbelievable content  Zaphod s self delusional aggrandizement  Ford flippant and laid back reactions and Arthur s anxious disbelief at everything and everyone he encounters At this point I can t think of very many of my friends that are unfamiliar with the books  and if I could  I would be forcing them to read it at gunpoint right now  Metaphorical gunpoint  as I don t actually own a gun  I think the the theme of The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams is that the world is unpredictable  The story takes place in many parts of the universe  The main characters are Arthur Dent  Ford Prefect  and Zaphod Beeblebrox  The book is about Arthur Dent s journey through space after he is unexpectedly saved from Earth s destruction by his human alien friend  Ford  who was stuck on Earth while researching for The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy   Fictional book    I really like this book  It a fun and quick read  I like how the author snuck in little jokes throughout the book  I would definitely recommend this book to a friend  My first science fiction book     Made me laugh a LOT Now i know the answer to the Life  the Universe and Everything  Too bad I do not know the question I love the ridiculous plot and the why Eartg was created part as its such a big question and the book gives a funny answer to such a serious topic Will be reading the next five after my exams     I just discovered why Hitchhiker has so many fans  It s hilarious  of course  Adams  talent for weaving together non sequiturs is unparalleled  It s incredibly imaginative  marrying the best of cosmology with the  intentional  worst of pulp science fiction  Best of all  at least so far as I m concerned   it s extraordinarily philosophical  chock full of logical jokes and wonderfully paradoxical arguments  But it makes its philosophical points parabolically  and with such a whimsical and funny touch  that the depth can easily be missed Some examples  the hilarious logical conundrum involving identity and substitution in which Ford Perfect entwines the bulldozer happy Mr  Prosser  the famous Babel Fish demonstration of the nonexistence of God  the sly allusion at the end of Chapter 9 to design arguments for the existence of God  the sperm whale s discovery of impermanence in life and personal identity  the parable about searching for undiscoverables that features Veet Voojagig s search for Planet Ballpoint Pen  the ontological nature of a world in which improbabilities become probable  the wrangle between humanists and technicians  and of course Deep Thought s search for the meaning of everything  which  among other issues  invites readers to think more about the propriety of questions than the virtue of answers I m glad I ve finally rectified a serious failing in my education by reading Hitchhikers  This one is a true classic  The humor is so good that my laughing was affecting my reading   Utterly hilarious and delightful  Definitely going to read more in this series  Probably my all time favourite book due to Adams  witty irreverent prose and its emphasis on science fiction while still remaining deeply silly  Funny  Sarcastic and wide open  The whole series is a fun and worth while read    It is scifi without loosing touch with our humanity  It is simple and light to read but profound and thought provoking on other levels   I loved this book  Definitely going to complete the series as soon as possible  The dialogue is witty and compelling  the ideas are fantastic  and the characters are perfectly suited to the tone of the book  This book has great hype for a reason  if it s been on your list for a while but you haven t read it yet like I hadn t for years  just do it  Totally worth your while  I never laughed so hard whilst reading a book  Although  I saw the movie  the book had nothing to do with it  It s something completely awesome in it s own way  yes but had a few alterations  Nevertheless  the book was HILARIOUS  I genuinely laughed so many times  Zaphod and Ford are so funny and Arthur   I only had Martin Freeman s interpretation in my head  so I kept imagining him as Arthur   was also truly funny  And although it s a book  some of the facts seemed so realistic and so possible  hey  maybe it is  that if someone said  hey  that exists   i d be like  oh   cool  I recommend it  if you want to have a laugh   D A necessary read for anyone who likes sci fi  It s a wonderful parody of everything that has ever been said to have flown through space and is entirely ridiculous  There is so much in this novel and series  It s easy to latch on to a single line and almost claim it as your own  There is a creature called a hooloovoo  that is only mentioned in two places in the entire series  but he became my favorite character  because he s a super intelegent shade of blue  The density of these jokes that are thrown in almost haphazardly is wonderfully insane  Life changing  but wait  hang on to your towel  I remember being assigned this book in high school and not really getting that interested in it  I have no idea why  though  because I loved every word of it when I read it again  This book  along with the rest of the  trilogy  can summarize everything you need to know about life  the Universe  and everything  Great  fun hilarious  Be cautious with this book if you read it  because it has the answer to Life  the Universe and Everything  IT IS HILARIOUS  I ve laughed by myself reading it on the train  It felt too short  I m really looking forward to checking out the rest  Laugh out loud is not just a saying  it s for real whenever I re read any of his books  I guess I ve been through all of them five times  Just the name Zaphod Beeblebrox  the president of the galaxy  gives me the giggles  And the rock band that s so loud they have to trigger their sounds from space   this is rare and wonderful stuff  It took me some time to finish this  This was mainly because school was hectic for the past month  and I just wasn t in the mood to read the book  I mean I tried to read it but I couldn t really understand it  And then yesterday I decided to watch some sci fi movies  Star Wars and Star Trek   After that I started craving for something related to outer space  travelling  and aliens  So I picked this book up and finished it within the day  The story was hilarious  and it sure got me think about the whole idea of intelligence outside our own little planet   how vast the universe was  and how things can be possible when one would put their mind to it  I think Ford was pretty lucky to take Arthur Dent with him  Most people would definitely freak out  but Arthur took it pretty well  or at least  a lot better than normal people would do   The characters were interesting  I got to like them all  And yes  including the Vogons  I d love to read the rest of Douglas Adams  series as soon as possible  But for now  I ll settle with watching the movie  Unique in its class   Humor at the end of the world      Ripristineremo la normalita appena saremo sicuri di cosa sia in ogni caso il normale  Grazie    Volevo leggerlo da una vita e finalmente mi sono degnata  Beh  inutile dire che avevo semplicemente perso tempo nel non leggerlo perche merita  tantissimo  Non sono un appassionata di fantascientifico  ma come dico sempre  se un autore e in grado di farmi appassionare ad un genere che non mi piace allora e un grande autore Stra consigliato  E  una lettura semplice e piacevole  come bere un bicchiere d acqua ed anche se non si ci capisce niente il bello e proprio questo Adesso per mera curiosita voglio vedere il film   e procurarmi il prima possibile i seguiti di questo ciclo  I first heard about The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy from a friend in middle school  This was around the year 1999  a time where most people were just getting familiar with the internet and worrying that Y2K was going to destroy the planet  Ahh  good times  Anyway  this girl was clearly much further along in her nerd development than I was  as she had already read this book a few times and knew all of the geeky inside jokes from it  When she told me that the answer to life  the universe and everything was 42  I looked at her with the disdain that only a 12 year old can muster and complained that she was making no sense  and therefore the book she read that in must be stupid  I was a real charmer in middle school    That s Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy man   she said   It s a classic  You gotta read it  I didn t think about the book much after that initial conversation  but from time to time the title would resurface  As I got older and became a bigger and bigger nerd  it became clear that I was missing out on something by not having read this book  Lots of my favorite TV shows referenced it and the internet abounded with nerdy hitchhiker jokes  I finally bought my copy of it a few years ago  and then promptly got distracted with other things and left it sitting on my shelf  collecting dust  I barely even remembered that I owned it until a week or so ago  when I decided to dust it off and finally see what all the fuss was about It s hard to give a concise summary of what Hitchhiker s Guide is about  because many parts of it are completely random  only tangentially related to the plot and rely on incredible coincidences  The main story focuses on Arthur Dent  a human who is rescued from earth mere minutes before its destruction by his friend Ford Prefect  who happens to be an alien in disguise  The pair embarks on a crazy adventure across space  meeting up with a strange cast of characters including Zaphod Beetlebrox  the president of the galaxy  Trillian  a woman Arthur once met at a party and Marvin  the very depressed robot There is a wonderful style to this book  Douglas Adams is an English writer  and that fantastically strange English humor leaps out at you from every page  The whole reading experience is very tongue in cheek  You are meant to laugh and shake your head as you move through it and embrace the absurd  The narrator is very much in on the joke with the reader  and often stops the action to give background information and speak to you directly about what s going on in the story  For example  at one point the narrator tells you the outcome of what s happening in the next chapter to avoid  stress and nervous tension  on the part of the reader  I have never read another book quite like this  and laughed aloud several times during my reading  By the end of the story  I was both slightly confused and completely convinced that this book was genius  Personally  I loved the book  However  I can see that this is one of those novels where you will either love it or hate it  It breaks the standard rules about how a book should be presented  but it s really all the more wonderful for its blatant flouting of conventions  There are five books in the Hitchhiker s  trilogy   six  if you count the one written after Adams s death by Eoin Colfer  and I will definitely be checking the rest of them out  All the nerds out there worth their salt have already read this book  but if you re one of the few who hasn t  what are you waiting for  Grab your towel and get going  It s a classic  You gotta read it   I was obsessed with these books as a kid   After somehow discovering the first and second I remember waiting with baited and bad breath for third and fourth to be released and read them all several times over  I also loved the BBC TV series  not to mention the radio serial that spawned them  although I found the recent film a bit of a disappointment  His later Dirk Gently series was great too  especially the second one  The Long  Dark Tea Time of the Soul  in which he actually recycled one of the plots he d used when he was a writer for Tom Baker s Dr Who  Absolutely hilarious  Douglas Adams is a brilliant writer  He does a great job of concocting a story with an eccentric group of characters experiencing increasingly improbably  hilarious  and downright random situations This book gets major bonus points for the always funny  entries  into the eponymous Hitchhiker s Guide  for its poking fun at philosophers  and for its great use of dolphins  mice  and sperm whales  I have to admit  I had no idea what this book was about before going into it  I had heard so many great things about it  Then it showed up on my summer reading options and I knew that I had to read it  This is one of most random books I have ever read  Yet it was so funny and clever  The characters in this novel were very well written and they also developed in a awesome way  The plot twist in this book were phenomenal and could not be seen from a mile away  This book was written just to make you laugh  I could see this being an animated T V  show for adults  I can not wait to watch the movie now  I truly loved this book  I found it a quick read and would recommend this book to anyone who likes adventure  silliness  and great writing  If you re going to read any of them just go ahead and by  The Ultimate Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy   It has all the major stories in the  trilogy  and its cheap for how much quality reading it contains I laughed out loud DOZENS of times while reading this book  The clever writing by Adams turns cliches on their heads and makes you realize how much lazy writing there is out there in almost every genre  The stories are not deep  They don t really pretend to be anything they re not  They re meant to entertain  and they do it amazingly well Toward the middle of the last  book  in the series I started to lose a little interest  but that s more due to hectic life schedules than a loss of desire to read it  Nikdy som necitala sibnutejsiu knihu  Zaujimalo by ma  na com autor fical  ked to pisal  Ale bolo to genialne  Vazne  vazne moc  Odporucam  3   Aj ta lod ma nenavidela    Co sa s nou stalo    Nenavidela ma len preto  ze som sa s nou rozpraval    Ako to myslis  Ako si s nou mohol hovorit    Jednoducho  Hrozne som sa nudil  trapila ma neznesitelna depresia  a tak som sa napojil na externy pocitacovy vstup  Mal som s jej palubnym pocitacom dlhu debatu o vesmire a svojom nazore nan    A co sa stalo    Spachala samovrazdu   I love this book  For years I ve been wanting to read it and I finally found the time to sit and read through it  It s funny  exciting  with lots of twists and turns on every page  Such a wild read  I d love to read the next books in the series  especially because of the cliffhanger  I couldn t put it down  I think I could recommend this book to almost anyone  it s an easy read  though confusing at times  and I think all ages could enjoy it   Amazingly fun and full of truth  The essence for me was to try not look so seriously on the world around me  I loved the way Ford and Zaphod acted   fast  never doubting  always finding a way even if it seemed a bad option at the moment  The world would be much more fun if more people were like them and it really needs such people  Or at least i do and i m making serious effort no to be  arterish  most of the time   The extraordinary look upon the galaxy and  face it  earth was the firs thing that grabed me when i started reading  It was fresh  bitter at some points and a lot different from anything i had seen so far  The most valuable thing about the book is that it makes you question everything you ve been taking for granted and stated  It rocks the borders of your perceptions  beliefs and it dares you to find the real meaning of life for you  to stand away from the common sense and to be real  different and alive  42 If you want to laugh out loud while contemplating the meaning of life  Hitchhiker s Guide is for you  Think Alice in Wonderland  Monty Python  and Shakespeare   Just a tour de force of utterly absurd storytelling  I love it  There is no holding back here  this is humour at its most absurd and strange  Brilliantly ludicrous ideas  the improbability drive  the depressed android  vargon poetry  It just goes on and on and I applaud Douglas Adams for writing this because I m sure he had more than a few funny looks when it first came out  It s brilliantly absurd and I recommend everyone give it a read  The movie is nowhere near as good  My all time favorite book  series   Douglas Adams is a brilliant writer  storyteller  I d seen the distinctive covers of the Hitchhiker s books floating around students  lockers when I first went into middle school  Long story short  I thought it was high school  then I drudged up a possibly constructed memory of reading one of the books in a car at a Sonic drive through  rare in Ohio   I wasn t sure what to make of it  then I found it in my local library and picked it up on a whim It introduced me to a way of writing sci fi that I had no concept of beforehand  Prior to this  reading sci fi basically meant reading William Gibson  who I was definitely too young for   or one of the Star Trek pocket novels  or similar  That sort of thing is fine in its own right  of course  On the other hand  Hitchhiker s showed me that this sort of writing could be funny  The impression I ve gained recently is that Douglas Adams wasn t so much interested in how things worked as much as the ramifications of them existing  although he was generally able to write up an entertaining explanation  Either way  it helped turn me on to science fiction  I also gained a better appreciation for the serious side of the genre as I began to see things Adams was making fun of Perhaps the later books in the series haven t aged as well  but the first three of the inaccurately named trilogy of five are all good reads  and this one holds special meaning to me  This book reminded me of the Bartimaeus Trilogy by Jonathan Stroud that I read when I was in grade school  I was surprised to find that I still like that wacky kind of writing style  When I finished the book  I immediately went back to the beginning and started to reread it  Thank goodness this is only the first in a series  otherwise the cliffhanger would drive me nuts  Pendiente resena En pocas palabras  uno de los mejores libros que he leido  Este ano  Tal vez tambien desde hace un ano  O dos  O cuarenta y dos Add  cabe mencionar que este es el libro numero 100 que he leido desde que ingrese a Goodreads   The movie is wonderful  Yes  I think all the casting was wonderful   the original Radio is priceless  the Infocom text adventure is a fond memory of mine  even if I had to use the Inivisiclues booklet to get through it  didn t everybody   but this book is just one of my all time favorites  It s got a middle that doesn t make a lot of sense  and frankly I think it s missing and ending at all besides simply escaping  but it s still a treasure to read it  The Hitchhiker s Guide is almost a state of mind  a pure point of view all its own  and it creates such a perspective on life that it s not to be ignored  Sometimes I love to dip in just to read one part or another  a single chapter here and there  and almost without fail  in this day and age of fantastic gadgetry  I love reading it as an ebook especially  New iPhone  Yep  read The Guide on it  iPad  Yep  read it there too  Heck  the iPad is practically how I imagine Arthur s Hitchhiker s guide to look in So Long  and Thanks for all the Fish I especially love the way the story has morphed and changed from version to version over the years  Each medium having it s own unique flavor of the story When the books initially came out  the Internet was barely alive  and now everyone who carries a smart phone may as well make sure they have their towel with them as well  because connected to the world wide web  we all have Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxies in our pockets all the time now  It s an example of science fiction gadgetry coming true in our lifetimes  Great humor that takes me back to a time when I was really starting to latch onto some really good books  and with this iPhone in my pocket  and yes  the iPad has  So Long and Thanks for all the Fish  engraved on the back of it  I feel like I carry an active piece of this story with me all the time If you haven t read it  please do  If you haven t read it in a while  give it another go  It s worth it  It s a short book  so it won t even take you that long  at least unless you find yourself like I do pouring over chapters  and re reading bits and pieces here and there  and delighting in the wonderful language that Douglas Adams made look so effortless   I have no idea why I ve never gotten around to reading this  other than the fact that I had been told I would love it so frequently that I sort of resented it  I carried that resentment through the first 40  of it or so  admitting to myself that it was indeed very humorous  but continually insisting that the plot and characters were leaving something to be desired  As soon as they got to Magrathea  I was hooked  The humor and tangents all led to something hilarious and satisfying while still maintaining the matter of fact but still so rudely mocking tone that makes this author so memorable and distinct  I can t wait to read more of his work  This novel is possibly the greatest  silliest  loveliest science fiction novel I ve ever read  Adams  wit is unrivaled  and the way his twists words and phrases to do his bidding is delightful  If Douglas Adams wrote the instruction manual to a three speed blender  I would buy it twice  read it constantly  and recommend it to my friends  I thoroughly enjoyed this book  I ve never read a story with such absurdity and laugh out loud humor  The Guide is so absorbing and entertaining  it takes barely any time at all to finish  If you ve only seen the movie  you re missing out on a lot  It s rare that a book like this is placed on a summer reading list for school  so I suggest it wholeheartedly  Douglas Adams  narrative voice takes some getting used to at first  because of the extreme sarcasm and humor  but it is well worth it  Please read this  So long  and thanks for all the fish  Maria G funny  witty  creative and simply extremely entertaining This was the most insanely crazy book I ve ever read  but it was awesome  It is bizarre  satirical and funny  I will definitely be checking out the rest of the series It is just one of those books you have to experience for yourself   the radio series was my first love  we had it on tape for long car journeys  but I have finally got round to the books  Finished in 3 days flat  This is one book I often find myself coming back to re read every once in a while  This time as an audiobook narrated by Stephen Fry  I think the satirical nature of the book and subtleties are much more apparently more I read it  It s excellent humor  Halfway through the book I already knew that this was going to be one of my favorite books  Excellent combination of sci fi  satire and my type of humor make it a book that I absolutely enjoyed reading  I doubt that I will go on and read the series though  since I don t wanna spoil my impression of the first book  Nor will I watch the movie  which seems even less of a bright idea  It is great just the way it is  The funniest existential novel of all time  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy captures the desire for certainty in a an essentially chaotic universe  Be it a bypass  a sperm whale  or a starship powered by the improbability drive  the universe challenges each of us to find purpose in the midst of sheer randomness   The only thing wrong with The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is when a friend reads it  and tries to talk like Douglas Adams for a week  Science fiction even my dad can read  Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is as much fun as it is funny  Quoted through space and time  HhGttG is a great hello to humor and scifi  Readers sympathize with Earthman Arthur Dent s search for a cup of tea  made considerably more difficult now that earth has been destroyed  as he ends up tagging along with Zaphod Beeblebrox  Trillian  and Ford Prefect as they fly a stolen ship through the Galaxy   Wacky but captivating  I wonder what the author was on when writing this book  I have been looking at some tops for best books in this area and this one was a constant in most of them  I had seen the movie  and thought it was pretty bad  so i was afraid of starting to read it and hate the book as well  Nevertheless  I read it and it was quite the experience  It was the only book i read in which i suddenly had to stop a bit to laugh out loud for huge periods of time  The most significant was the part of the whale   i laugh and kept thinking about it for about 15 minutes at least The only downside was that in the edition I was reading there was the after word about the film  which I started reading  Then I saw some spoilers and had to immediately ditch the book  I had seen the movie but it was a long time ago  it was so bad that i don t remember anything about it  i don t know why not putting the film stuff only on the fourth book  Still  I m pretty eager to start with the rest of the collection  My first audiobook  In any format  this book lives up to the hype   Picked up this book from a  help yourself shelf  in a hostel  when I was thousands of miles from home   and LOVED it  I then went on to read everything and anything by Douglas Adams that I could get my hands on  A large part of my love for Adams stemmed from the fact that he made everything seem like it was going to be OK  and it was comforting to think that I was only half a world away from home  rather than several galaxies   Tsialoto reviu http   knizhenjor com 2013 11 patevod   S s sigurnost top 3 na nai liubimite mi knigi  ev r  bez da znam koi sa drugite 2  Tolkova originalna  shantava i

culture  In many circles  say  I have a question   and someone is bound to yell out 42    And there s national Towel day  and Dr  Who seems to have a blast referring back to this book  mentioning a pleasant bloke he once knew   Arthur Dent   as well as referring to Vorganity as a religion  Fun stuff  transcending even British humor   a must read for any scifi comedy fan   Absolutely brilliant   Read this a long time ago and it was one of the books that brought about my love of reading  I read The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy in high school and remember thinking it was very funny  but I actually think I enjoyed it more on audio  Stephen Fry  who apparently is Jeeves in the BBC series Jeeves and Wooster  is hilarious reading this book   this has become one of the million reasons I must watch Jeeves and Wooster  I had always thought Hugh Laurie  who I also love  was Jeeves  but I guess he s Wooster  Anyway  I thought Fry s voice for Marvin  the depressed robot  was particularly funny  Fry is clearly a frood who really knows where his towel is Wikipedia is also telling me that Fry is the voice of the Guide in the movie adaptation  While Wikipedia may not be a reliable source for some information  I would think it was created as a tribute to the Hitchhiker s Guide  So unless I am mistaken  and they actually consider each other competitive sources for questionable information  I m trusting Wikipedia as the definitive resource for information about this book  including all adaptations  It does  however  bring up the important point that Wikipedia could benefit from a good  DON T PANIC  banner over its pages The audio version also made me realize how Monty Python Douglas Adams  humor is  I have never been able to make it through this entire series  as the humor gets stale to me after a while  It is similar to The Holy Grail in that it was funny at first  but after it had been retold and over quoted to me enough times  it was hard to remember why I liked it in the first place  As my friend  McKenzie  would say  it s like when people do impressions of Jim Carrey  I needed the 10 year break I took from it to be able to re visit it and laugh again The concept  aside from obviously being silly and weird  actually struck me as rather smart this time  If you take away the funny names and reverence for afternoon tea  the creation myth that the story develops seems to have just as much validity as any other explanation of how our planet got here  because when it comes down to it  I think Adams would say  you weren t there and you don t know   and how irrelevant that actually is to a genuine search for meaning  or  Life  the Universe  and Everything   if you would   Adams does an excellent job showing how ridiculous  petty  and small people really are  and I think he s only part joking   maybe not joking at all   how many roads must a man walk by If you re looking for the answer to the Question of Life  the Universe and Everything  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy might provide you with one  view spoiler   42  I mean   hide spoiler   but you won t make much sense of it because the answer lies in the question which remains a mystery  The book is a highly entertaining and an absolutely and fun space galactic adventure  I enjoyed the play on words  the sarcasm and the out of this world characters  They came across as silly but to me  that s what made this book so funny and enjoyable  I wonder what awaits Arthur and the crew at The Restaurant at the End of the Universe  Don t know why it took me so many years to finally read this  but I m glad I did  No se por que he tardado tanto en leerme este libro  No digo que el proceso de leerlo me haya llevado tiempo  No me llevo mas de un par de horas repartidas entre una semana  Lo que no entiendo es como no lo empece antes       Si puede hacerte reir hablandote de poesia alienigena lo hace  O de toallas  O de politica intergalactica  O de tramos de circunvalacion Porque por muy alienigenas que sean los personajes que nos presente todos son   Para leer la review entera http   leyendoencafeterias blogspot c    I don t know why I took so long to start reading this series  It s hysterical   And when you look at some of the things that Adams  labelled  as future inventions  and consider the reality of them now  its quite surreal This purchase was well worth the purchase  especially the Kindle edition with the forword by Russell T  Davies  Dr  Who  Torchwood  I m really looking forward to the rest of the series  I remember reading this book when I was in high school at a time when I was awkward  overly thoughtful  and full of pimples  Since that time  I ve read it twice and I ve suffered through both the BBC series and the movie version  What makes it great  I suppose it manages something very difficult  it s dark  laugh out loud funny  and the same time somehow uplifting  Since then I ve read the sequels  and Adams  The Long  Dark Tea Time of the Soul   if you like a good story  and sci fi  and irreverence  and comedy  and a romp through the universe  YOU must read this book So  pretty much everyone should  arguably the best look at how insignificant humans really are in the universe  If you know anyone who has any feelings of superiority because we  evolved   give them a copy of this and answer42  The book is FUN  That s the first word that comes to mind  It is hilarious and clever and so brilliant  Read more on kryppticbooks wordpress com One of the most entertaining books I ve ever read  Wow  Douglas Adams is truly a remarkable man  When reading his books I find myself tossed through an infinite universe were my mind is an awesome playground where anything is possible  The Hitchhiker s series is one of my favorites and definitely worth the time because they all are a relatively short read   Honestly this was a super fun  light hearted  and fantastic read  It was witty  clever  and I ll stop using so many adjectives  Douglas s characters were the highlight of the story  Each one had their own problems yet had great personalities  It really answered the questions of life  the universe  and everything   Frankie baby  we are made
