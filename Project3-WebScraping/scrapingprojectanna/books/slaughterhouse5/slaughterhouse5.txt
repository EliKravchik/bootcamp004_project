There are some terrible reviews of SH5 floating around Goodreads  but one particularly awful sentiment is that Slaughterhouse Five isn t anti war This is usually based on the following quote    It had to be done   Rumfoord told Billy  speaking of the destruction of Dresden  I know   said Billy  That s war   I know  I m not complaining  It must have been hell on the ground   It was   said Billy Pilgrim  Pity the men who had to do it   I do   You must have had mixed feelings  there on the ground   It was all right   said Billy   Everything is all right  and everybody has to do exactly what he does  I learned that on Tralfamadore  For context  Mr  Rumfoord is an old military historian described as  hateful and cruel  who wants to see weaklings like Billy exterminated On Tralfamadore  Billy was introduced to the revelation that all things happen exactly as they do  and that they will always happen that way  and that they will never happen any other way  Meaning  time is all at once  The aliens  incidentally  admit to destroying the universe in a comical accident fated far into the future  and they re very sorry  but so it goes     passive acceptanceThe entire story up to this point has been about Billy  buffeted like a powerless pathetic leaf in a storm  pushed this way and that by forces entirely outside his tiny purview  He lays catatonically in a hospital bed after the plane crash and the death of his wife  and all the time traveling back and forth from Dresden where toddlers and families and old grannies and anti war civilians were burned alive in a carefully organized inferno  so it goes   and Billy is about ready to agree to absolutely anything  It can t be prevented  It can t be helped You re powerless  after a while  What hope have we  or anyone caught in the middle of a war  or even the poor soldiers who are nothing but pawns and children  hence the children s crusade   to influence these gigantic  global events  Therefore  Billy agrees with the hateful  the cruel Mr  Rumfoord  who is revising his military history of WWII  having previously forgotten to mention the Dresden bombing  which cost twice as many innocent lives as the nuking of Hiroshima  Women and children  not evaporated instantly  but melted slowly by chemicals and liquid flame  their leftovers  according to Billy  lying in the street like blackened logs  or in piles of families who died together in their little homes  Incidentally  how can anything be pro war or anti war  Because being anti war is a bit like being anti conflict  anti death  and anti suffering  Is there a book that s pro these things  Is there a book that touches on the subject of war and is not against it We don t support wars  though we are sometimes forced to accept them  Anyone who thinks that the bombing of Dresden was necessary is delusional It s like saying   yo  look how they bombed these innocents   that shit was wrong  Let s go bomb some innocents  too  That s the sad truth of it  I miss Kurt Vonnegut He hasn t been gone all that long  Of course he isn t gone  yet he is gone  He has always been alive and he will always be dead  So it goes Slaughterhouse five is next to impossible to explain  let alone review  but here I am  And here I go What is it about It s about war It s about love and hate It s about post traumatic stress  It s about sanity and insanity It s about aliens  not the illegal kind  the spacey kind  It s about life It s about death so it goes  That s one thing Earthlings might learn to do  if they tried hard enough  Ignore the awful times and concentrate on the good ones   This is how I live my life  This is how I get through the day  Most days I am successful  some days I m not  Today is one of the  not  days  Like so many Americans these days  I feel I m in a rut  Like so many Americans I don t understand why I am where I am  This was not the plan  This was not what I had in mind       Oh poor me    boo hoo  This book  This book got me thinking  So much about life sucks  true  but not many of us want to give up on it that easy  Why  because of the  good ones   And what makes  good ones  is our ability to create and enjoy creating     at least I think so  Write it  Shoot it  Publish it  Crochet it  saute it  whatever  MAKE     Joss WhedonIf you make something  a painting  a poem  a novel  a good meal  a person     you continue to live even after death  I think that s what Mr  Vonnegut was getting at  Maybe At least that is how he has remained alive for me  I read this book first in 1999 when my grandfather passed away  It was a bit of a coincidence as his funeral occurred between a Primate Anatomy exam and a paper for my Experimental Fiction class on Slaughterhouse Five  I was frantically trying to remember the names of all kinds of bones when I picked this up in the other hand and tried to wrap my head around it Basically  Vonnegut has written the only Tralfamadorian novel I can think of  These beings  most undoubtedly inspired in Billy Pilgrim s head by the scattered science fiction plots of Kilgore Trout  experience time as a continuum that is constantly occurring   and when they look at time  even though in their version of history  the world is in a constant state of being destroyed for example  they choose to see the things that make them happy   the good moments  What Billy learns from these creatures is that each traumatic event that has happened in his life fits very precisely into a state of meticulous nature  It has always happened and always will happen and so it goes  on and on and on   What Billy Pilgrim truly experiences over and over in his life is Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome  He exists throughout his memories traveling back and forth with the knowledge of what will happen and how precise it all is  Dresden is bombed in every moment and his friend Derby is put in front of a firing squad  At every second  he is the only survivor of a plane wreck  he is getting married  and he is fighting a Children s Crusade  It s the only way he can look at the despair that has happened and make sense of it When my grandfather died and I read this  I felt as if it was just what I needed because I could escape back into time and remember the good memories of my grandfather   if they existed  even if in some fourth dimension  then he was just as dead as he was alive and eating peanut butter chocolate ice cream  At the same time my grandfather had a heart attack  I was watching him play cards with my grandma at the kitchen table  But which one to think of  Well  that was easy  Death can t be prevented and so it goes but you can always try to change which moment you live in  It s a little bit different than a memory and if you go far into it  you ll end up like Billy Pilgrim  which is to say  you will go insane because the rest of the world sees time as linear and counts seconds and minutes and hours Once and awhile  it doesn t hurt  I re read this again on the plane rides home and back before and after my grandmother s funeral on Monday and last night  My grandma was a strong and intelligent woman and she always read everything she saw  My recent memories of my grandmother were of her at the holidays  She always had her mind but her physical condition had deteriorated and she was dependent on oxygen  It made me sad to think of her like this a bit  It s really hard for me to think that my grandma is no more but then I tell myself   well  it s silly for me to keep crying on and on about this  My grandma is right now reading at 4am in her living room chair and I am a child creeping down the stairs hoping she s still up  She is telling me that one day I ll come around and like green onions  She is reminding me to keep my feet off of the davenport and about being  tickled  by something  She lives in a jungle of houseplants and watches musicals all of the time  always pointing out when some distant relative of mine appears briefly in The Greatest Show on Earth  My grandma can t be dead and be doing all of those things  can she  It doesn t make sense  She will always be alive in some moments just like I will always be seven and nine and twenty eight and perhaps past thirty and forty  So  she ll always be here I just wish I could dream about her  I finally read Vonnegut  I finally read a war novel  And after a long time I finally read something with so many GR ratings and a decent number of reviews which is precisely the reason I have nothing much to add to the already expressed views here  So I urge you to indulge me to state a personal anecdote  Thank You My Grandfather was a POW during Indo China war and remained in confinement for some six months  By the time I got to know about it I had already watched too many movies and crammed endless number of answers about when and where such n such war was fought  But I was naive and let s assume innocent and someone who was yet to learn to ask the right questions  So the fact that someone so close in the family had witness something I only read in schoolbooks was utterly fascinating for me  Thus began my streak of stupid questions Me  Did you kill someone  Did they torture you  Did you dig some sort of tunnel to escape  And so on My Grandpa gave this hearty laugh he is famous for and said that I m missing one important question  Why the war happened at first place  I thought for a while and answered  Because it always happens  I can t recall properly what he replied to that but it was something on the lines of this  I wish the answer changes when you ll grow up because as of now that s exactly how it is  War always happens  With books like Slaughterhouse Five  Schlachthof funf   it s not the writing which matters but simply the ideas and thoughts it carries which transgresses the literary boundaries and create a place in the heart of the readers as a humble reminder that Love happens  Hate happens  Life happens  Death happens  Peace happens  War happens and sometimes Shit happens  Every so often you read a book  a book that takes everything you thought created an excellent novel and tears it to pieces  it then sets it on fire and throws it out the window in a display of pure individual brilliance  That is how I felt when I read this jumbled and absurd  yet fantastic  novel  The book has no structure or at the very least a perceivable one  it s all over the place  But  it works so well  It cements the book s message and purpose underlining its meaning  Indeed  this book is an anti war novel  which is asserted  in part  through its random and confusing organisation  The story is  jumbled and jangled  such as the meaning of war  It appears pointless to the reader  again alluding to the meaning of war  It also suggests that after the war a soldier s life is in ruins and has no clear direction  which can be seen with the sad case of Billy Pilgrim  So it goes  Billy Pilgrim is a poor tortured soul who after the fire bombing of Dresden is in a state of flux  His mind cannot remain in the present and darts back and forth in time like the narrative  He was never the most assertive of men  and after the war became a shadow of his already meek self  The war has left him delusional  which is manifested by his abduction by aliens  This may or may not have happened  Vonnegut leaves it up to the reader to decide  What decision they make effects what genre the novel belongs to  Is it science fiction If Billy was abducted by aliens then this is sci fi  but if it is a figment of his imagination then this becomes something much deeper  It s up to the reader how they interpret it  but I personally believe that he wasn t abducted  I think he made it up  unconsciously  as a coping strategy for the effects of war  and that the author has used it as a tool to raise questions of the futility of free will  but more importantly to further establish the anti war theme  Vonnegut draws on a multitude of sources to establish this further  such as the presidential address of Truman  He ironically suggests that the A bomb  whilst devastating  is no worse than ordinary war  he points out the fact that the fire bombing of Dresden killed more than the nuking of Hiroshima  Through this he uses Billy Pilgrim s life as a metaphor for what war for the effects of war on the human state  So it goes  Vonnegut himself is a character within the narrative as the life of Billy Pilgrim is  in part  an autobiographical statement  The narrator addresses the reader and informs them of this  He tells them that this all happened more or less  This establishes the black humour towards war and the inconsequential deaths of those that are in it  Hence the motif  so it goes  at each  and every  mention of death whether large or small  He ends the book on the line  poo te weet   He even tells the reader he is going to do this  but at the same time demonstrates that there is nothing intelligible to be said about war  I warn you  if you ve not read this  it is one of the most bizarre books you will ever read  The main character time travels  in his mind  and has no real present state  The narrative initially appears random and completely confusing  But  once you reach the end you ll see this book for what it is  the most individual  and unique  statement against war that will ever be written  Review update   I just wanted to show off some pics of this gorgeous edition I bought  I just love the Folio Society  they print some damn fine books  There are only a few books that I ever really try to revisit  Sherlock Holmes and his stories are one  Some Shakespeare  And Slaughterhouse Five  I have read this book every year since my first reading almost ten years ago  I read it as an undergraduate  I read it as a graduate student  I ve written three or four papers about it  And  yes  I have tried to pawn this book off on as many people as I could over the years  You see  this book does something to me whenever I read it  It takes me places  Sure there is the time travel  other world element to the novel  but the places it takes me are not physical in nature  I can t rightly say that they are spiritual either  Basically  the best way I can describe it is where I am taken is if my heart  mind  soul  education  fears  desires  and dreams were all placed in a blender and set to liquefy  And then this slosh of material is constructed into whatever semblance of a structure can be created from this amalgam  This novel gets me to question not only life  but what it means that I was the lucky sperm to reach the egg  or that I was the lucky egg that was implanted  Oh dear  I fear I am convoluting what it is I am trying to say  Okay  here goes  This book questions war  It questions as to why humans feel it is imperative to destroy  It questions what it might be like to live a completely different life than the one you live now  But it doesn t try to give bullshit answers  In fact  it really doesn t try to give answers to anything  And since this book is based on actual experiences Vonnegut suffered during WWII  it might be better said that this novel is really a science fiction memoir Dammit  I am screwing this up  I cannot seem to say it is that I want to say  Enough already  Read the book  Or don t read the book  I know what it does to me  So it goes VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDEED  Why do I love this book  I love it because of the villains  Not just the obviously villainous Paul Lazzaro  although he s one of the great villains of modern fiction  During the hellishness of war all he can think about is his own petty need to avenge slights done to him  but the larger  less obvious villains in this book  the Tralfamdorians  They re not the type of villainous space aliens you see in most science fiction  arriving in flying saucers and hell bent on enslaving humanity  only to be stopped by some intrepid space cadet   Vonnegut hated being categorized as  science fiction  because most science fiction at the time was just juvenile male wish fulfillment  which he clearly was not interested in  In fact he kind of satirizes that kind of thing in this book   His aliens are much more fascinating than that The Tralfamdorians aren t much interested in Jesus Christ s message of universal love  They re more interested in the message of Charles Darwin  that beings die to improve the species   At least that s the message as they see it  Like I said they re villains   To them the idea of free will is silly   Well  villains can be right sometimes   The world is structured in a way that everything that happens is meant to happen and there s nothing we can do about it  Concern for human feelings is useless and therefore we shouldn t give a second thought to massacres and slaughter  Just say  and so it goes   and move on  This was certainly the feeling of the Nazis with their belief in the destiny of the everlasting Reich  or whatever the phrase is   and the Communists with their belief that the road to the future must be built on the corpses of the present   Stalin s most famous saying   One death is a tragedy  One million deaths is a statistic   To Billy  like Vonnegut  a witness to the slaughter at Dresden  they provide an escape  They put him in an enclosure where all his needs  material and sexual  are met and where he is protected from the poisonous gas outside  To mankind their philosophy provides an escape from moral responsibility  In the first chapter of the book Vonnegut tells his friend he is writing an anti war book  His friend responds that he  might as well write an anti glacier book   and Vonnegut kind of agrees with him  Wars  like glaciers  can t be stopped  And yet he wrote the book anyway  Yes  death is inevitable  but to Vonnegut humanity is also worth mourning  What happened to Edgar Derby is worth relating  and we should be moved by it  Vonnegut is not satisfied to sum up Edgar s death with the phrase   and so it goes   I love this book because Vonnegut conjures up this fascinating alien race with a view of life that provides an opportunity for escape  but then punctures the illusion by showing that it is as facile as it is attractive  Neither does a war bring glory nor does a win in one ensure the moral infallibility of an ideology over a conflicting one  Because  essentially  war justifies countering genocide by perpetrating more genocide  We all know that  right But no  we don t  We only think we do  And that is what Kurt Vonnegut wishes to tell his reader  in a calm  disinterested and emotionless voice in Slaughterhouse Five He informs us  in a matter of fact tone  that we don t know the first thing about a war and proceeds to explain to us what it really is  by fashioning a narrative as abstruse  disjointed and meaningless as war itself I must make a confession despite how morbid this may sound  I have a thing for war books because reading about the two World Wars which helped define our identity as a civilization in the last century is endlessly fascinating  And despite the horrendous nature of crimes against humanity that were committed in both  these two wars held up a mirror in front of us  helped us recognize our own failings as human beings and rectify our mistakes  Which is why I agree with Tan Twan Eng s views on World War II   Moments in time when the world is changing bring out the best and the worst in people  But Vonnegut neither eulogizes war nor seeks to make our hearts bleed for the unimaginable loss and suffering it brings  Instead  he gives the traditional perspective on war a new twist by giving us a prolonged glimpse into the mind of a prisoner of war who was  perhaps  able to survive the brunt of it all  by detaching himself from his own reality and seeking solace in dimensions which only existed inside his head  Billy Pilgrim s life or the way he viewed his own life in retrospect  appears to be as chaotic and nonsensical as the war he served in  It is the sheer absurdity of the concept of war that takes center stage in this highly experimental novel   how the unfortunate victims of it carry on with their broken lives with a perverse sense of humor in the face of mindless brutality and utter madness I definitely look forward to reading more of Vonnegut now  This was my first Vonnegut book  but it won t be my last Back in high school  a friend gave me a paperback copy of Breakfast Of Champions  and I leafed through it  amused at the drawings  but didn t read it   I think I was going through my Salinger stage    or perhaps it was my Dickens stage   Now I want to find it in my boxes of old things  I want to read more from this strange  misanthropic      genre busting  inventive and oddly soulful and philosophical author Slaughterhouse Five has expanded in my imagination  The more I think about it and revisit certain passages  the more I admire it and recognize it as a great 20th century novel  Vonnegut writes these deceptively simple declarative sentences  jumps around in time  introduces characters who won t reappear until much later  if at all   and sometimes stealthily buries the most moving and profound passages in the middle of some chapter that s  seemingly  about something else I won t bother with a plot summary  The main character is the sweetly named Billy Pilgrim  an optometrist with a wife and two children  As a tall  thin  sickly and generally incompetent American soldier and POW during WW2  he miraculously survived the firebombing of Dresden in 1945  After returning to America and continuing his life  he became  unstuck in time    time travelling various episodes  without any reason  Oh yeah  and at one point he was also abducted by aliens  Here is a picture of Dresden before the war  It was one of the most beautiful cities  often compared to Florence  And here is a picture after The book is a puzzle it s up to the reader to figure out  How much is  real   Are Billy s memories caused by the aliens  by his experiences in the war  If you survived being slaughtered because of being hidden in a slaughterhouse  wouldn t that kind of make you unhinged It takes a while to get used to the structure  which at first seems arbitrary  But the deeper you get into the book you realize it s anything but  There are moments in the narration that take you aback  such as this one in Chapter 8  And then it developed that Campbell was not going to go unanswered after all  Poor old Derby  the doomed high school teacher  lumbered to his feet for what was probably the finest moment in his life  There are almost no characters in this story  and almost no dramatic confrontations  because most of the people in it are so sick and so much the listless playthings of enormous forces  One of the main effects of war  after all  is that people are discouraged from being characters Right in the middle of a paragraph  the narrator brings up the very thing you re thinking about its characters  or non characters   the lack of dramatic incident and cause and effect  One of the main effects of war is that people are discouraged from being characters  Fascinating  How do you make sense of something as absurd and senseless as war  Does something like cause and effect even apply to this situation A page or two later  Vonnegut gives us this aside about the sci fi writer Kilgore Trout  who I believe shows up in some other books  Trout  incidentally  had written a book about a money tree  It had twenty dollar bills for leaves  Its flowers were government bonds  Its fruit was diamonds  It attracted human beings who killed each other around the roots and made very good fertilizer   So it goes What an absolutely dead on  if cynical  summation of the effects of a capitalist driven society And in an earlier section about the aliens on the planet Tralfamadore  we re given this  told to Billy by a Tralfamadorian  voice   There are no telegrams on Tralfamadore  But you re right  each clump of symbols is a brief  urgent message   describing a situation  a scene  We Tralfamadorians read them all at once  not one after the other  There isn t any particular relationship between all the messages  except that the author has chosen them carefully  so that  when seen all at once  they produce an image of life that is beautiful and surprising and deep  There is no beginning  no middle  no end  no suspense  no moral  no causes  no effects  What we love in our books are the depths of many marvelous moments seen all at one time  Every word I ve bolded applies to this book as well  In a way  many of them apply to life in general The phrase that Vonnegut uses when he mentions a death   of any sort   in the book is quite simple   So it goes   There s something so ordinary  resigned  and absurdly all accepting about these three little words  Sometimes the effect is annoying  sometimes funny  and sometimes just devastating  Pay attention  We ve been told how to read the book  When seen all at once  it  produces an image of life that is beautiful and surprising and deep  Indeed  Art is a profound act of optimism  especially in the face of acts of meaningless violence and slaughter  So it goes  The Florence of the ElbeKurt Vonnegut tells us in an epigraph   This is a novel somewhat in the telegraphic schizophrenic manner of tales of the planet Tralfamadore  where the flying saucers come from  Peace  This much is true  Stylistically  it s unique  It jumps all over the place  not to mention all over time The story telling is cumulative and simultaneous  rather than linear and sequential  Maybe this is the only appropriate way to tell a story about the firebombing of the open city  Dresden   the Florence of the Elbe   in which up to 135 000 Hansels and Gretels  mostly civilians  lost their lives or had them taken away  wiki records that the figure has been revised to 25 000  The  historian  David Irving seemed to promote the higher figure  not out of sympathy with the civilians  but in an attempt to establish a moral equivalence with the Holocaust  Even the facts are schizophrenic However  the precise number is not really relevant to the morality of the act  It was still a horror  whether or not the motive was to end the war and reduce further killing Dresden Frauenkirche after the bombing God Willing The War was a playground where the evil in humanity was unleashed  Religious people are entitled to ask  where was God God doesn t seem to be present in Vonnegut s narrative  Perhaps all that is left of him is the aside   Somewhere  a big dog barked  If you believe that God exists  was he sidelined in the theatre of war  Did he become all bark  and no bite On the other hand  if God doesn t exist  or he remains stolidly neutral  then what hope is there that good will prevail over evil Only  perhaps  that good people will somehow prevail over bad people  Or that bad acts  including war crimes  will be punished according to law  Accident Will Vonnegut s novel seems to acknowledge the horror  while at the same time revealing some reason for optimism In a delightful malapropism  the German cab driver  Gerhard Muller  to whom the novel is dedicated  says   I hope that we ll meet again in a world of peace and freedom in the taxi cab if the accident will  Instead of meeting again   God willing   he struggles for a suitable non theistic alternative  If  Fate permitting  is too theistic or determinist  what can you call it  other than  an    accident    If there is nobody who can mean it to happen  how can it be meant to happen Billy Pilgrim s ProgressThroughout the novel  the chief protagonist  Billy Pilgrim  a Joe Average  makes some sort of progress of his own  beyond Dresden and the War  He comes to realise that real life smells like both  mustard gas and roses  Vonnegut relies on the devices of science fiction as the foundation of his story and as the basis for hope It s almost as if there is a continuum of science  science fiction  fantasy  imagination  superstition and religion from which we have to construct our personal  social  spiritual and literary beliefs and styles Vonnegut positions  Slaughterhouse Five  all over this continuum as telegrams about  flying saucers  the negligibility of death and the true nature of time  Unstuck in TimeEven before the bombing  Billy Pilgrim comes  unstuck in time  Not only does this describe his experience of the world  it bonds him with the Tralfamadorians who kidnap him and return him by flying saucer to a zoo on their planet During these segments  the novel takes on the tone of  Gulliver s Travels   only it s more apparent that Billy is learning about himself and humanity by observing and listening to the Tralfamadorians The big difference is the comprehension of time  For Tralfamadorians  time doesn t pass  it doesn t cease  it is never gone  It remains  it stays  in perpetuity  only it is perpetuated both forward and backwards  When a person dies  he only appears to die  He is still very much alive in the past   all moments  past  present and future  always have existed  always will exist    It is just an illusion   that one moment follows another one  like beads on a string  and that once a moment is gone  it is gone forever  When a Tralfamadorian sees a corpse  all he thinks is that the dead person is in bad condition in the particular moment  but that the same person is just fine in plenty of other moments   Now  when I myself hear that somebody is dead  I simply shrug and say what the Tralfamadorians say about dead people  which is  So it goes    So It Goes When understood in this context  the expression  So it goes  isn t just resignation or acceptance of death  it s actually a celebration of life  Death doesn t mean that you have ceased to live  It just means that  in one moment out of many  albeit they are all compressed or sublated into the one moment   you no longer exist  but you still exist in all of the others Interestingly  Vonnegut adds to this passage the words  And so on   Again  it s a continuum  We re somewhere on it  we keep on and we keep going on Free BillyWhen time is collapsed on itself  there is no before and after  and therefore no cause and effect  All time is all time  It does not change  It does not lend itself to warnings or explanations  It simply is  Take it moment by moment  and you will find that we are all   bugs in amber  Billy Pilgrim adheres to a naive belief in Free Will  which is evidenced by the framed prayer on his office wall  God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change  courage to change the things I can  and wisdom always to tell the difference  The Tralfamadorians consider this amusing  because Earth is the only place in the universe that believes in Free Will Vonnegut reveals  Among the things Billy Pilgrim could not change were the past  the present  and the future  DeterminismVonnegut s view of Determinism is more problematic The absence of cause and effect is related to his explanation of time  Have you ever seen bugs trapped in amber  Well  here we are   trapped in the moment  There is no why   view spoiler  I wonder whether  ironically  this means that Billy Pilgrim was both stuck and unstuck in time   hide spoiler  If there is only one moment  albeit perpetual  the question  why  doesn t arise  Life is pure existence  It just is  It needn t be any more complicated than that It s not so much that what is happening or what has happened has been determined from outside It s more that it has already happened  and evidence of its occurrence is contained or preserved in the recorded moment  the amber  We can t change the record  because it s a document  simultaneously  of the coexistence of what humans have come to think of separately as the past  present and future What Remains to Be Done The Tralfamadorians do say that  every creature and plant in the universe is a machine  This is obviously consistent with a level of Determinism  but it s equally consistent with the view that we have already performed or done everything that could be expected of us It s already happened and it can t be changed  Even the end of the world  which was caused when somebody presses a button  Billy asks why they can t stop it being pressed  He always pressed it and he always will  We always let him and we always will let him  The moment is structured that way  It s not so much the Determinism  as the nature of Time Still  the question remains  is Gerhard s world of peace and freedom possible  Is there anything we can do about it  Will it happen of its own accord  Has it already happened  Has it already been preserved in amber If our attempts to do good might have no effect  should we at least avoid doing evil Brief  Urgent Messages in the Telegraphic Schizophrenic MannerIt turns out that the Tralfamadorians have books   brief clumps of symbols separated by stars   Slaughterhouse Five  is somewhat modeled on them  Perhaps the answers to the above questions are in these books     each clump of symbols is a brief  urgent message   describing a situation  a scene  We Tralfamadorians read them all at once  not one after the other   There isn t any particular relationship between all the messages  except that the author has chosen them carefully  so that  when seen all at once  they produce an image of life that is beautiful and surprising and deep   There is no beginning  no middle  no end  no suspense  no moral  no causes  no effects   What we love in our books are the depths of many marvelous moments seen all at one time  If we humans could think of  and enjoy  life  not just books  as many marvelous moments  all beautiful and surprising and deep  then perhaps there would be no evil  And nothing would hurt  Peace And so on  I ve only just finished this  literally minutes ago   look I had no idea this was going to be nearly so good  When he died last year I read some of his short stories  which were okay  but nothing to write home about  This was something else  A friend of mine I don t talk to any more by a strange form of mutual agreement   obligation  though  now I ve worked out how this all works  perhaps we ve found an alternative means of one way communication     was thinking of starting up a science fiction reading group for people who don t read science fiction  Now  this is exactly the sort of book that would be great for that  What I liked most about it was that the aliens did not have to be real   there was a bump on the head that could explain much  This is an interesting book and like many interesting books it can be read on many levels It is an anti war story that is both confronting and stunningly well written  I really loved the time travel sequences   how the novel told itself in much the same way that it wanted to explain what fourth dimensional living would be like  The structure of the story is very interesting   brilliantly clever  There is also a lot of very black humour   my favourite kind  Every time someone dies in the book   and it is about  in part  the bombing of Dresden  so there are plenty of opportunities for people to die   the narrator says   so it goes   If you had asked me before reading this if I would have thought this would work as a device I would have said that it definitely would not   that soon it would be a pain in the bum  But I would have been wrong  It was inspired   catching me in much the same way every time and making the deaths more  real  each time  Even when I knew they were coming their iteration was a mantra and one that worked for me in that it did focus my attention  This  even though the stated intention was to do the opposite There is  of course  a logical flaw in the aliens seeing all times but making the same mistakes every time which isn t really covered over by saying all times need to correspond to their inherent structure   but this is a novel and this was not a flaw that annoyed me enough to stop me reading This is a humorous book  it is a book that stops you reading and makes you think of the implications of what you are reading  It is a book that is not seeking bland  realism    at no time is the reader unaware that this is art  rather than  life   whatever that is    but this is its power   this is what takes the breath away  What is artifice comments on the real and shows it to as again as new I really had not expected this book to be nearly as good as it was  It is one of those books I ve always known was there  but thought it would be just another science fiction novel  This is anything but  just  anything  A remarkable book I might force my daughters to read  It took me a while to warm up to Vonnegut s laconic  sardonic  seemingly detached tone in the context of war in general and the 1945 bombing of Dresden in particular  Once the charm of his deceptively simple writing had won me over  though  I started to feel the powerful anti war message   delivered very effectively from the seemingly resigned and alienated perspective of a war veteran  The book s subtitle could have been   War as a Funny and Sad Way of Life   Anti war classic with a very humane little sci fi twist  A Tale Unstuck in Time26 May 2015 The thing that really captivates me about Vonnegut s writing is its the simplicity  In fact it is almost as if he is writing a book aimed at a much younger audience  sort of the age where they don t need pictures but still require simple sentences and a limited vocabulary   that is until he starts talking about men filling women with sperm and other concepts that some parents  such a mine  probably wouldn t want their eight or nine year old reading  I guess that is were a lot of Vonnegut s comedy lies and why I appreciate his writing  its simplicity and in turn its complexity  Vonnegut is certainly not a writer of children s fiction  particularly since his writing borders on the absurd  a philosophical concept that I would be surprised if children would even understand  at the age of eight I doubt many middle class children would have lived much of life to be able to appreciate its absurdity  Slaughterhouse Five is first and foremost a story about war  in particular the firebombing of Dresden in 1945  In fact the entire book revolves around that one event during World War II  and event which Vonnegut personally witnessed since he was a prisoner in Dresden at the time   His personal experience of the horror of war in the form of the firebombing adds quite a lot of weight to the telling of the story of Billy Pilgrim because in many cases he is able to describe Pilgrim s emotions from his own personal experience  However  Slaughterhouse Five is not just about the war  it is about quite a few other concepts as well  such as the absurdity of life  and the nature of time  as I will explain  People have debated about whether the bombing of Dresden was necessary ever since the event  though Vonnegut suggests in his book that the US government kept it hidden simply due to the utter destructiveness of it and the huge death toll that resulted  in fact he suggests the death toll in Dresden was almost twice as much as Hiroshima  though the official figures  according to Wikipedia  say otherwise   I have refrained from using the term atrocity simply because in the midst of total war it can be really difficult to judge whether an action was right or not  While we may believe now that there was nothing of military importance in Dresden at the time of the bombing  can we be certain that the Allies were aware of that during the war  This is debatable  and in many cases we can never be certain of the truth  Was Dresden simply an action by the Americans to literally bomb Germany back into the stone age to prevent them from ever being able to wage that type of war again  or did it happen through faulty intelligence  In the end we will never know  I ve actually been to Dresden  though it was only for a couple of hours  We were passing through on the train on our way to Berlin and we decided to jump off just to have a look around  I was particularly interested in seeing what the city that had become famous because of the firebombing looked like now  Unfortunately we didn t spend all that much time here  and ended up just wandering around a park where an elderly German man pointed out this large black cube and told us that it was called Frederick s List  and if with relieved ourselves on it then it would give us luck  Needless to say that we politely declined   Anyway  from what I remember of Dresden was that it is  like most parts of Germany  a fairly modern city with quite a lot of the old communist era apartments  Anyway  the Hauptbahnhof  main railway station  still looks like its 19th century original  Anyway  I would like to touch on a number of things that come out of this story  but before I do so I think I should give you a bit of a warning War Slaughterhouse Five is predominantly a war book  but while some suggest that it is an anti war book I don t necessarily believe that this is the case  Sure  Vonnegut is critical of many aspects of human nature  and no doubt considers war as horrific as many other aspects of our life  If you have read some of his other works you will note that he refers to the pilgrims that colonised North America as little more than sea pirates  Yet Vonnegut doesn t rant and rave as some authors do  or paint incredibly horrific pictures  but rather brings about the absurdity of the situation  Life  in Vonnegut s eyes  is absurd  and war is just another aspect of this absurdity  When I speak about absurdity I speak with the idea that it simply makes no sense  and in a way I agree   war simply makes no sense   it is stupid  pointless  and ends up causing more trouble that it is worth  Just look at invasion of Iraq  Vonnegut also calls his book the Children s Crusade  The term Children s Crusade comes from one of the Crusades during the Middle Ages when the children were given weapons and sent to march on Palestine  though apparently they all ended up being sold into slavery   children  remember  never talk to strangers  and never go with them if they invite you to go and liberate the promised land   The reason that the children were sent was because all of the able bodied men have already met their fate in the previous crusades so there were effectively nobody left  However  in World War II Vonnegut is referring to the idea that many of the American soldiers were little more than children  It was not that they were eight or nine  but rather that they were not mentally mature  It was much the same with the Vietnam War  and I even remember songs about how the average age of the combat soldier was 19  Okay  many 18 and 19 year olds believe that are adults and that they should be treated as adults  namely because the law says so  however many of them do not have the life experience that others of us have  To a thirty  or even forty  year old they are still children  It is also interesting how Vonnegut describes the American Army  He describes the soldiers as being clothed in ill fitting uniforms suggesting that the average combat soldiers are little more than a ragtag bunch  This is brought out a lot with Billy Pilgrim since by the end of the book his clothing is nothing short of absolutely bizarre  Vonnegut tells us how in former times the foot soldier would be dressed up in very colourful uniforms  which is not doubt the origin of the handsome man in uniform  however uniforms these days are very bland and boring  What Vonnegut doesn t seem to realise is that in the modern army the state provides everything to the soldier  where as in earlier times if you wanted decent equipment in the army  you had to pay for it out of your own pocket  Anyway  while I don t normally do quotes  I did want to quote this passage because I felt that the imagery was brilliant   Billy was marching with his hand on top of his head  and so were all the other Americans  Billy was hobbing up and down  Now he crashed into Richard Weary accidentally   I beg your pardon   he said     At each intersection Billy s group was joined by more Americans with their hands on top of their haloed heads  Billy had smiles for them all  They were moving like water  downhill all the time  and they flowed at last to a main highway on a valley s floor  Through the valley flowed a Mississippi of humiliated Americans  Tens of thousands of Americans shuffled eastward  their hands clasped on top of their heads  They sighed and groaned  Death So it goes  This is the most common phrase in the book  Whenever Vonnegut tells us about somebody who has died he will append it with that short sentence   so it goes  This is another example of the absurdity of his writing  To many of us death is shocking and horrifying  but to a naturalist world death is simply another part of the order of things  Death happens  people die  so it goes  In a way by using this little phrase he effectively dulls the impact of those hundreds of thousands of deaths that have occurred throughout history  Yet in a way  in our comfortable Western world  that is what death is to us  Sure  some guy over the other side of town is hit by a bus   so it goes  We might be shocked and horrified by it at first  but then our mind puts it to the back of its consciousness so that we no longer need to feel confronted by our own mortality  It is not so much Vonnegut trying to make light of death  but rather how we simply try to ignore it because our own mortality literally fills us with dread  Yet death in a sense is almost as absurd as war  Throughout the book we are told about this one soldier who was executed because he got caught stealing a teapot  so it goes  Yet we are told that every other surviving American  including Billy Pilgrim  returned from the war with spoils that they had looted from the dead  In fact the engagement ring that Billy s wife wears bears the diamond that Billy found in Dresden  Yet  despite all of this looting going on  the one soldier that is caught for stealing a teapot is executed  Mind you looting is a serious offence  and what wholesale looting demonstrates is a complete breakdown in law and order  Look what happened in Iraq when Saddam fled Bagdad   law and order completely broke down the the population ended stealing anything and everything that was bolted down Time When I was in Brisbane recently I was sitting in this club that was playing techno and was reading an article about philosophy on my mobile phone  the club was empty at the time  with the exception of me  the bartender  some guy dancing on the dancefloor  and a couple hidden in the corner   the reason being was that it was a Wednesday night   Anyway  one of the ideas that this article proposed was that time isn t linear  In fact it suggested that time exists in a way where it can all be viewed simultaneously  which is a concept called Eternalism  For those interested in the article you can find it here  For those interested in the nightclub it is called  The Beat  and its details can be found here  Anyway  the reason that I mentioned that  the article  not the nightclub  is because it reminded me of Vonnegut s concept of time in Slaughterhouse Five  The book begins with Billy Pilgrim becoming  unstuck in time   Basically he ceases to live life in a linear fashion and begins to experience all parts of his life from his birth to his death whenever he choses to experience them  In a sense he becomes immortal  Okay  his immortality is constrained by the period in which he is alive  but as the book progresses he begins to learn how to travel to various parts of his life when he chooses  He no longer lives life in a linear fashion  but his life becomes like a movie  For instance  with modern technology we can either watch a movie in its linear form  or we can watch whatever parts we want  We can watch the movie from the end to the beginning  and even random parts that to the casual observer looks completely absurd  Vonnegut even suggests this during the book as Billy watches a World War II movie about the Dresden bombing backwards  Instead of the materials being dug up  turned into bombs  loaded into planes to be dropped onto Dresden and destroying it  the bombers fly over Dresden  suck the bombs up turning Dresden from a ruined landscape to the city it was prior to the bombing  fly back to base to unload the bombs where they are subsequently dismantled and the contents buried in the ground where nobody can find them  What Vonnegut has done is that he has turned a tale of destruction into a tale of creation simply by reversing the footage  I should also mention the events on the planet of Tralfamadore  The thing about the Tralfamadorians is that they exist in time the same way that Billy exists in time  They don t live a linear existence but rather an existence where they can see all of time simultaneously  Billy s exposure to their world is what I suspect caused him to become unstuck in time  though he became unstuck long before he ever went to Tralfamadore  but that is because to the Tralfamadorians  and to Billy in particular  time does not exist in a linear function but rather can be seen all at once  Of course this does cause some problems because time becomes set  Vonnegut mentions that proverb about changing the things we can  accepting that which we cannot change  and having the wisdom to know the difference  The problem is that when time is not linear there is nothing to change   everything is set  However this is the problem when one lives a linear existence in this concept of time   we do not realise that time has been set and that we are simply observers  Because we cannot see the future  we live with this absurd belief that we actually have some control over the future  when in reality we do not  We are simply blind to that fact and we fool ourselves because the future is unknown to us and convince ourselves that we have power over how it eventuates  Needless to say that is not how I view time  but then again I am stuck in its linear progression much like I suspect everybody else who is reading this  When I heard  Slaughterhouse 5  was a novel about an American war prisoner in Dresden during World War Two  I was not expecting this And by this I mean an incredibly funny book  so preposterous in all the right ways   Slaughterhouse 5  follows Billy Pilgrim  American  soon to be optometrist  idiot  Billy has become  unstuck in time   and beings to perceive time as a continuum in which he can move about  jumping from moment to moment  because  all moments  past  present  and future  always have existed  always will exist  We jump about with Billy along his civilian life  his war memories or his time as an abductee in Tralfamadore  where he was a zoo exhibit  and where he learns about life  time and death  The underlying philosophy in the book is quite interesting  as is Billy s life War novels strive to show the horrors of war to the civilian public  but sometimes they get overly ideological  Vonnegut doesn t call any of the Germans  Nazis   a term reserved only for the American dissident Howard  who fully embraces it  and he does not present World War II as a crusade of white knights and heroes against the horrible Nazi Germans  It is a war like any war  and the bombing of Dresden is depicted as the horrible incident it was  regardless of its consequences against Nazism The novel melds the absurdity of Billy Pilgrim s life with the realism of the Dresden massacre  and somehow such a horrible matter fits perfectly with Vonnegut s humour  Perhaps because war  and the horrible bombings like Dresden or Hiroshima in particular  are so incredibly absurd themselves It is an awesome book  I just ate it all up in a siting  much like Billy s wife would   To  Slaughterhouse 5  I only have the highest compliment one can give to a book  I was sad it was over  So it goes  A Living Room capitalist entity was purchased

Slaughterhouse Five makes it difficult to take seriously  however  part of Vonnegut s magic is that this absurdity becomes impossible to ignore  and increasingly powerful as the narrative moves forward   It works itself not only into the narrative  where our protagonist becomes unstuck in time and is abducted by aliens  but also into questions about war  civilization  identity and theories of time  and how this impacts perceptions of life and death   Slaughterhouse Five didn t grab me right away  but as I continued to read  Vonnegut s explorations become more intriguing and insightful  I know I ve commented on Vonnegut s perspective on the world in other reviews  It s part of what contributes to the absurdity here  You wonder how Vonnegut made the leaps he did and when you think about them there s something completely rational about these leaps  which are taken to possibly irrational extremes   In any event  Slaughterhouse Five is a book I wouldn t hesitate to recommend  Vonnegut s unique perspective continues to be fresh and interesting   And so it goes   I picked this up while suffering from the flu this week  so I hope that my memory of this book won t be tainted by how miserable I m feeling  Equal parts comedy and poignant tragedy  its a story of effects of war like I ve never read before  I m still trying to decide if Billy Pilgrim was an ordinary man with a beautiful insanity  or a calmly resigned adventurer of time and space  I ll need to digest this book a little more before I can attempt to say for certain  People label this sci fi  Odd  I took all that to be just the main character s necessary escapism  mainly brought on by his traumatic war experiences  as silly as some of them are portrayed  khyly drdnk bwd  khyly  bh qshng tryn nHw mmkn

this  Such an interestingly written antiwar novel  I had no idea what this book was about going into it  but I was pleasantly surprised with time travel and aliens  although I m not sure you could classify it as science fiction  I was a little bit confused because the narrative is constantly jumping through time in his head  but when I finished I understood everything with absolute clarity  Even though this book has heavy themes  it was dealt in such a unique way that it lightened up the story without taking away from the tragic significance of war  I loved how this book made me question the concept of time  Does time really exist or is it just some man made thing   If you re looking for a passionately written antiwar novel thats strange  captivating  and powerful  look no further  I m definitely going to check out Vonnegut s other works   So it goes   144 times  And Billy had seen the greatest massacre in European history  which was the firebombing of Dresden  So it goes  So they were trying to re invent themselves and their universe  Science fiction was a big help That was the decoder It is a book written in the Tralfamadorian style    There isn t any particular relationship between all the messages  except that the author has chosen them carefully  so that  when seen all at once  they produce an image of life that is beautiful and surprising and deep  There is no beginning  no middle  no end  no suspense  no moral  no causes  no effects  What we love in our books are the depths of many marvelous moments seen all at one time  That is the why  The best way to read Slaughterhouse Five is all the pages at once  not one after the other  Which isn t as hard as it sounds  it s pretty short Here is one of the great trilogy of postmodern novels set in WWII but published during the Vietnam era  along with Catch 22  1961  and Gravity s Rainbow  1973   Vonnegut and Catch 22 author Joseph Heller both served in WWII  and both of their books are about things that happened  more or less   Gravity s Rainbow is something else entirely   Vonnegut in 1969 might as well be writing the manifesto of post modernism There are almost no characters in this story  and almost no dramatic confrontations  because most of the people in it are so sick and so much the playthings of enormous forces While modernist works like Ulysses and Mrs  Dalloway looked inward  getting further inside their characters  heads than anyone had before  postmodern works look out  they re about systems  great whopping conspiracies  Enormous forces Modern and postmodern novels tend to skip around chronologically  and they tend to be metafictional  Vonnegut accomplishes both at once by having his actual character skip around chronologically  Billy Pilgrim has become  spastic in time   sortof like Faulkner s autistic Benjy  the story unfolds as he experiences it  unstuck  jumping randomly around his own timeline  This includes  as you may have heard  the part where he s abducted and put in an alien zoo with a porn star  which is either a nice idea or a symptom of post traumatic stress disorder  like Septimus in Mrs  Dalloway Slaughterhouse Five is by far the most accessible of this postmodern war trilogy  It s a good choice for a first exposure to postmodernism  It s not that it s simpler or less smart than those other books  mostly it s just less of a pain in the ass  Although it is a bit of a challenge reading all the pages at once  I picked this up as part of my quest to fill in the gaps in my science fiction education  I knew it is considered a classic  and I now know the reason  I was also familiar with the wikipedia articles about the carpet bombing and firebombing on civilian cities in WWII  So it goes     From the very first line Vonnegut establishes the tone of the story as an eyewitness account of war atrocities and their destructive effect on the psyche of the persons involved  The  more or less  part of the truthfulness in this account  I think comes from the efforts of the author to transcend the cold facts and to find some meaning to the experience  and to present it as a science fiction parable  It is there  in the scene at the radio station   The master of ceremonies asked people to say what they thought the function of the novel might be in modem society  and one critic said   To provide touches of color in rooms with all white walls  I found the method of going backward and forward in time very effective  as well as the often emotionless delivery of facts  I have seen some critics of the novel pointing out the passive  fatalistic attitude of Billy Pilgrim  I can understand where they come from  but I found the message to be loudly and explicity anti war  Re read again for Banned Books week    for my book club   I cannot adequately express how much I love this book  If I were allowed to have only five books on my bookshelf  this one would have a safe   assured spot   2015      Just re read this again  because it is Banned Books Week    it still holds a warm   cherished place among my favorite books   2014      I really loved Slaughterhouse Five    not surprising because I m already a fan of Kurt Vonnegut  His books always touch on a variety of things  this one specifically emphasizing the horrors that man inflicts on man    everything  in war   The providence of being in an underground bunker during carpet bombing by US forces plays an important role here  just as it did in  The Book Thief    I find Vonnegut an amazing writer because his work is almost surprisingly simple to read  so succinct    a master of ironic understatement  Yet his observations are profound  his satire razor sharp  I think he s one of America s great contemporary writers and someone that everyone should read at least once  even if he s not your normal cup of tea    Original comments written in 2011   This is indeed a tough book to review  It s about time travel and aliens  and also war and life and death  It s cyclical  even repetitive  and certainly not linear  We know what happens in the last scene before Billy s story even begins  That s intentional  Tralfamadorian  and it s an effect that I can easily see would be annoying to some  But I thought that it was very effective  Slaughterhouse Five is described as an anti war novel  And it is  in a way  but not in the usual way  It s an expression of resigned dismay that war happens  that it s ugly  and that it will kill many  many people  Billy has accepted the Tralfamadorian perspective that things happen  and you can t stop or change events  But that doesn t mean that simply observing events pass you by is a moral alternative I listened to an audiobook read by Ethan Hawke  I thought he did a fine job narrating it  and I enjoyed the experience of listening to it ETA  I originally gave this book four stars when I reviewed it in April 2012  A year later  I ve bumped it up to five  Without my realizing it at the time  Slaughterhouse Five carved out a place in my mind and my heart  A year later  it s still living with me in a way very few books do after even a few days  much less a year    I have this disease late at night sometimes  involving alcohol and the telephone   I do not feel so all alone  Billy Pilgrim has come unstuck in time   He has seen birth and death many times  he says  and pays random visits to all events in between   Like so many Americans  she was trying to construct a life that made sense from things she found in gift shops   Ah yes  the building blocks of life that make sense to Americans  She upset Billy simply by being his mother  She made him feel embarassed and ungrateful and weak because she had gone to so much trouble to give him life and keep that life going  and Billy didn t really like life at all   This may well articulate that love hate mother thing  Hmmm  How nice to feel nothing  and still get full credit for being alive   There are people to lynch  Who  People not well connected  So it goes  Kilgore Trout s unpopularity was well deserved  His prose was frightful  Only his ideas were good   The United States has been Balkanized  has been divided into twenty petty nations so that it will never again be a threat to world peace   How s that for foreign policy   All the great chefs in th eworld are there  It s a beautiful ceremony   Just before the casket was closed  the mourners sprinkle parsley and paprika on the deceased   I like this image  Rumford was thinking in a military manner  that an inconvenient person  one whose death he wished for very much  for practical reasons  was suffering from a repulsive disease  Page 139 s address of revenge  brilliant  Yes  indeed this is one hell of an anti war book  I like what Howard W  Campbell has to say  I re read Slaughterhouse Five today  5 27 13   My daughter is doing a project on Vonnegut  and it felt appropriate seeing how today is Memorial Day  I think I first read Slaughterhouse Five in 1980  maybe  and this must be my fourth read through from start to finish  although I have putzed around in the book many a time over the years  It s a rich  rich novel for putzing around in I m pretty sure a lot of first time readers don t understand Slaughterhouse Five  I know I didn t get it the first couple of times I read it  no matter how much I loved it  The Tralfamadorians are fascinating creatures  and they stole their furniture for Billy Pilgrim s zoo habitat from the Sears and Roebuck warehouse in Iowa City  but we shouldn t believe everything they tell Billy  In fact  we probably shouldn t believe anything they tell Billy about time and free will and causality  And therein lies the problem with misunderstanding the book  Those Tralfamadorians are just too damn seductive Anyway  the book remains as true and as pertinent today as it was in 1969  And if you want proof  here s an interesting passage from a book by Kilgore Trout called The Gutless Wonder It was about a robot who had bad breath  who became popular after his halitosis was cured  But what made the story remarkable  since it was written in 1932  was that it predicted the wide spread use of burning jellied gasoline on human beings It was dropped on them from airplanes  Robots did the dropping  They had no conscience  and no circuits which would allow them to imagine what was happening to the people on the ground Trout s leading robot looked like a human being  and could talk and dance and so on  and go out with girls  And nobody held it against him that he dropped jellied gasoline on people  But they found his halitosis unforgivable  But then he cleared that up  and he was welcomed to the human race  Twas ever thus   says Mr  Natural    Vonnegut s odd voice   dry wit combines time tripping   human frailty to make this one of the best war books I ve ever read  Odd facts  time travel   aliens are randomly scattered through out the narrative which focuses on WWII from Billy Pilgrim s perspective  From worn down dreams to the horrific destruction of Dresden  Germany  we watch Pilgrim get shoved randomly through his life  Vonnegut obviously poured his soul into this one   showed us the forest  not just of war  but of a life  by presenting a random  singular tree at a time  It s an odd  sometimes disjointed show  but always interesting   usually quite entertaining  I consider it a must read for everyone  especially young folks who think war is glorious  Slaughterhouse Five  Billy Pilgrim has come unstuck in timeOriginally posted at Fantasy LiteratureSlaughterhouse Five  1969  is probably Kurt Vonnegut s most famous novel  and has been analyzed and debated by readers and critics alike for almost 50 years  It s been listed as one of the 100 best novels of the 20th century by several organizations  and it s fatalistic catchphrase  So it goes  is an iconic expression of Vonnegut s view of the death and destruction of World War II  embodied in the firebombing of Dresden that he survived as a POW in an underground slaughterhouse  The book has also been the subject of numerous attempts to ban it from libraries and literature courses as obscene or irreverent  which automatically piques my interest  and the US Supreme Court weighed in against censoring it based on content In many ways I think this book is a culmination of Vonnegut s views about the absurdity of war  the fundamental randomness of life  the lack of any divine being overlooking and directing people s lives  and finally the pathos that Vonnegut has for people living with the harmless lies that make their lives bearable  Over 20 years after reading his books in high school  I chose to revisit them this year by listening to audiobook versions of The Sirens of Titan  Mother Night  Cat s Cradle  and finally Slaughterhouse Five  For this book  Ethan Hawke is the narrator and he does a really nice job of capturing the resigned tone of Billy Pilgrim  who really doesn t understand the events of his life  and at the same time capturing the ironic but knowing tone of Vonnegut the author and narrator  who uses humor to tackle a subject like World War II that would otherwise be too painful to confront You can see the steady progression in his meta narrative  as he repeatedly explores his experiences of war and the absurdity of everyday life in fictional form  getting closer and more intimate until we are finally placed shivering in a pitch black slaughterhouse  huddled with other US and British POWs  as US bombers drop incendiary bombs onto the German city of Dresden  a very deliberate strategy to cause massive civilian casualties in order to crush the German spirit and hasten the end of the war  The same rationale was put forth for the US dropping atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki In Slaughterhouse Five  Vonnegut broke the rules of contemporary fiction and addressed the reader directly in the first chapter  stating  All this happened  more or less   Furthermore  he apologies for the book  saying  It is so short and jumbled and jangled  Sam  because there is nothing intelligent to say about a massacre  Everybody is supposed to be dead  to never say anything or want anything ever again   Vonnegut himself is the narrator of the story in chapter one  and it s not until chapter two that he switches to omniscient third person to tell the story of Billy Pilgrim  a hapless young man thrust into war with little idea what to do and no survival instinct whatsoever The most impressive literary technique employed by Vonnegut is the continual shifts between past and present since his protagonist Billy Pilgrim has got unstuck in time  It s not the first time that a story moves in such fashion  but perhaps the first in which the protagonist himself  not just the narrator  is slipping back and forth continually without any control of the process  From moment to moment Billy finds himself in Dresden as a soldier  as a young man growing up  in his prosaic postwar life with his wife and children in Ilium  NY as an optometrist  getting in a plane crash  losing his sanity and claiming to be put in a zoo by aliens from the planet Tralfamadore  who we also met in his novel The Sirens of Titan It is through the Tralfamadorians that Vonnegut is able to deliver his most important messages about time  fate  and the meaning  if any  of our lives  The Tralfamadorians live in four dimensions  so all moments in time are available to them  They don t see any purpose behind the random events of our lives  and are perplexed by human s insistence that everything needs a reason or explanation  Here are some relevant passages The most important thing I learned on Tralfamadore was that when a person dies he only appears to die  He is still very much alive in the past  so it is very silly for people to cry at his funeral  All moments  past  present and future  always have existed  always will exist  The Tralfamadorians can look at all the different moments just that way we can look at a stretch of the Rocky Mountains  for instance  They can see how permanent all the moments are  and they can look at any moment that interests them  It is just an illusion we have here on Earth that one moment follows another one  like beads on a string  and that once a moment is gone it is gone forever When a Tralfamadorian sees a corpse  all he thinks is that the dead person is in a bad condition in that particular moment  but that the same person is just fine in plenty of other moments  Now  when I myself hear that somebody is dead  I simply shrug and say what the Tralfamadorians say about dead people  which is  so it goes  All time is all time  It does not change  It does not lend itself to warnings or explanations  It simply is  Take it moment by moment  and you will find that we are all  as I ve said before  bugs in amber There is a lot of debate about what Vonnegut s message is in Slaughterhouse Five  Is it completely pessimistic and hopeless  That mankind will forever be deluded by his lies and continue to make war and visit misery on himself  You could certainly take that interpretation if you think that the fatalism and passivity of Billy Pilgrim are the same as that of Vonnegut  but I don t think that s right  Although the horrors of Dresden and World War II are kept one step removed as Billy flits back and forth in time  and we are constantly reminded that we cannot prevent death  I still think Vonnegut cares very much about how people should view their lives  He strongly condemns the cruelty and absurdity of war  as this quote illustrates I have told my sons that they are not under any circumstances to take part in massacres  and that the news of massacres of enemies is not to fill them with satisfaction or glee  I have also told them not to work for companies which make massacre machinery  and to express contempt for people who think we need machinery like that He also has a lot of sympathy for the plight of all people who are desperately seeking meaning in their lives  And for those who ve lived through a traumatic experience like war  perhaps it is best that they do not look back at all  if all that remains is pain  Instead  they should focus on the happier moments of their lives And Lot s wife  of course  was told not to look back where all those people and their homes had been  But she did look back  and I love her for that  because it was so human  So she was turned into a pillar of salt  So it goes  People aren t supposed to look back  I m certainly not going to do it anymore If I am going to spend eternity visiting this moment and that  I m grateful that so many of those moments are nice I found this quote below particularly poignant  and something that really sums up Vonnegut s view not only of life and how to live it  but the purpose of art as well  including books  It s rare for him to spell it out  but this was very succinct There isn t any particular relationship between the messages  except that the author has chosen them carefully  so that  when seen all at once  they produce an image of life that is beautiful and surprising and deep  There is no beginning  no middle  no end  no suspense  no moral  no causes  no effects  What we love in our books are the depths of many marvelous moments seen all at one time  lmslkh lkhms ll mryky

synbH dwman klbun Dl  Breaking with my usual habit of giving what I like to think are clear  well reasoned explanations of why I did or didn t like a particular book  I m giving  Slaughterhouse Five  five stars with little elaboration  I ll simply say that this was my first time revisiting the book since first reading it in high school  and part of the reason for my high rating is that it held up incredibly well    something I can say of few books I loved as a teenager Kurt Vonnegut s writing simply touches my reptilian brain stem in a way few authors  books do  I don t know that I love  Slaughterhouse Five  as much as I do  Breakfast of Champions     one s favorite Vonnegut book is often the one he read first  and for me that was  Breakfast     but it s still a great book In  Slaughterhouse Five   Vonnegut makes mention that one of his recurring characters  science fiction author Kilgore Trout  has great ideas but is a terrible writer  Fortunately for his readers  Vonnegut both had great ideas and was a wonderful writer  His exploration of the life of a character who spends his entire existence bouncing among various highlights of his life    becoming  in Vonnegut s parlance  unstuck in time    is consistently creative and insightful  One may be tempted to criticize Vonnegut for making Billy Pilgrim an overly passive character  for never having him take control of his life or fight back  but such passivity makes complete sense for someone who realizes he has no free will    that the story of his life  and death  has already been written and nothing he does will alter it Despite its dark subject matter   Slaughterhouse Five  is occasionally quite funny  and not just sardonically so  Having forgotten the scene from my first reading of  Slaughterhouse Five   I laughed out loud at Kilgore Trout convincing a less than brilliant woman at a party that all of his novels are completely true    that it would be a violation of the law for him to write a story that was untrue It turns out I said more about  Slaughterhouse Five  than I intended to  Be glad  though  that I managed to write this whole review without saying  so it goes   Well  until now  So it goes   Shells were bursting in the treetops with terrific bangs showering down knives and needles and razorblades  Little lumps of lead in copper jackets were crisscrossing the woods under the shellbursts  zipping along much faster than sound  War is a wonderful thing   it presents a man with madness  And madness is even more wonderful thing   it allows a man to travel in time  to go through space to distant planets  to see things others can t see   Why anything  Because this moment simply is  Have you ever seen bugs trapped in amber    Yes    Well  here we are    trapped in the amber of this moment  There is no why   So it goes   I enjoyed reading about Dresden because I went there a few years ago and they were still rebuilding the city  I also have a picture of how the lights glow on the river like Billy Pilgrim spoke of  This was one of my all time favorite places in Germany  A proper review to follow     And because I have the sense of humor of a ten year old  I thought that I would throw this one in for fun    You re welcome     And even if wars didn t keep coming like glaciers  there would still be plain old death  Except no one really dies  because time  as we see  doesn t flow in a linear fashion  Everything which is about to happen has happened already and everything which has happened in the past can happen again if you want it to  All you gotta do is  have the ability to see in four dimensions and consider Time as a platter dish in front of you  Pick whatever makes you happy and forget about the rest  Sounds simple enough eh Billy Pilgrim just about the friendliest name  hated his life  not because of the brutal war that he had to experience or the inequitable hatred that he was subject to  but because he was tired of all the travelling back and forth in time  because he was disinterested in about everything  and above all  because he couldn t attach any meaning to his life or any other s life for that matter  He was like a pale  withered pebble lying by the road because it has nowhere else to be Tragic  yes  Comic  yes  But this story is much much more  It really is inexplicable how Vonnegut has said a million things and not a single thing all at once through this masterpiece  Oh and some extra credit points for this There is one other book  that can teach you everything you need to know about life    it s The Brothers Karamazov by Fyodor Dostoyevsky  but that s not enough anymore If you happen to read this review  stop right here and go pick up this book  You won t regret it     and so it goes   I pretty much thought this book was brilliant  I ve read it twice now and I shall read it again  It is difficult to write about  and read about  a subject of horror  Because  c mon  that s what it is  If the earth in Dresden becomes a veritable tomb for stinking  rotting corpses  and the few survivors have to spray fire into the holes to incinerate the rot because it is physically impossible to smell and touch the rot without hacking all your guts out   well  that s horrific  Yet Vonnegut mangages to write about such experiences with a certain degree of humor  he can look straight at a subject but give the reader enough breathing space and entertainment that he or she does not have to throw the book aside in total disgust  Vonnegut can get you to think  not by standing on a soapbox  but by placing an object before you and saying   Well  here it is   And then  sliding his hands in his pockets   What do you think of it    Somber  filthy  spectacular  Tremendous  hilarious  real  Sharp  frank satire in the face of all that gets our blood boiling  war  Christianity  poverty  you name it  The absurdity of it all  It ll have you rolling on the floor  soiling yourself  laughing silly  I still have belly aches  And the descriptions  Forget lengthy winding paragraphs  How about short lines that zing you in the teeth  And never any pomp  any pretense  just pure story   It is so short and jumbled and jangled  Sam  because there is nothing intelligent to say about a massacre  Everybody is supposed to be dead  to never say anything or want anything ever again  Everything is supposed to be very quiet after a massacre  and it always is  except for the birds  And what do the birds say  All there is to say about a massacre  things like  Poo tee weet   Ha livros que tenho a certeza de que lerei na minha vida  Mesmo nao sabendo quando  ou onde  em que circunstancias  ha livros que tenho a certeza que nao posso deixar de ler  Este e era um deles Billy Pilgrim atravessa as fronteiras do tempo  Billy Pilgrim e optometrista  Billy Pilgrim combate em Dresden na Segunda Guerra Mundial  Billy Pilgrim e raptado por aliens  Billy Pilgrim e das personagens mais tontas que ja pude conhecer Misturando ficcao com alguma autobiografia  pauta se essencialmente pela satira  pelo humor negro  mas ao mesmo tempo  tem ideias que me deixaram fascinada  bem como a propria construcao do enredo  Billy avanca e recua na vida  nao acompanhamos uma linha do tempo linear  antes as linhas se sobrepoem  tanto Billy esta na guerra como esta no consultorio a atender clientes  Um livro anti guerra  que mostra muito bem a loucura e insanidade que a caracterizam mas tambem a inocencia com que a guerra e vivida  E um livro muito inteligente em todos os sentidos  ate na escolha dos titulos o livro e brilhante  e a melhor parte e sem duvida em Dresden  E tenho de dizer que o Billy e uma personagem completamente parva  faz sentido com o contexto  mas se fosse num outro livro levar me ia a exasperacao  na certa Houve partes que tive de ler mais de uma vez  pela mensagem que queriam passar e que achei brilhantes  A ideia de que as pessoas nao morrem  continuam a existir mas num tempo diferente  que ainda perduram algures  E tambem  a dada altura  quando a guerra nos e descrita de tras para a frente  esta foi das minhas partes favoritas  When the bombers got back to their base  the steel cylinders were taken from the racks and shipped back to the United States of America  where factories were operating night and day  dismantling the cylinders  separating the dangerous contents into minerals  Touchingly  it was mainly women who did this work  The minerals were then shipped to specialists in remote areas  It was their business to put them into the ground  to hide them cleverly  so they would never hurt anybody again  Recomendo vivamente    Benvenuto a bordo  signor Pilgrim  disse l altoparlante   Nessuna domanda   Billy si passo la lingua sulle labbra  penso un momento  e infine chiese   Perche io     Questa e proprio una domanda da terrestre  signor Pilgrim  Perche  lei   Perche  noi  allora  Perche  qualsiasi cosa   Perche questo momento semplicemente  e   Non ha mai visto degli insetti nell ambra    Chi e Bill Pilgrim  Vonnegut nel suo libro da diverse risposte  o almeno io ne ho trovate due  La prima  quella letterale  e che Bill Pilgram e un uomo fortunato perche ha scoperto di poter viaggiare nel tempo   view spoiler  Sostiene infatti di essere stato rapito dagli extraterrestri di Trafalmador all eta di 42 anni e  grazie a loro  di aver conosciuto la vera natura del tempo  gli istanti non si succedono uno dietro l altro perdendosi per sempre  ma sono cristallizzati ed eterni  La conseguenza di questa scoperta e la possibilita di viaggiare nel tempo  spostandosi da un istante a un altro  con al consapevoelzza che le cose brutte accadono e sempre accadranno perche non e possibile impedirle  ma lo stesso vale per i momenti belli  Dunque per evitare una situazione sgradevole basta spostarsi nel tempo  Bill e diventato bravissimo  puo sopportare la guerra e la prigionia proprio perche di tanto in tanto si allontana per tornare alla sua infanzia o per rivivere la sua luna di miele oppure torna a Trafalmador dove l attende la bellissima Montana Wildhack  anche lei rapita dai trafalmadoriani e  donata  a Bill per fargli compagnia durante la sua permanenza sul pianeta   ogni tanto Bill passa dalla padella alla brace e si ritrova in momenti poco felici della propria vita  ad esempio la sua morte o quella della moglie o il ricovero in un ospedale per veterani a causa della difficolta di re inseririsi nella societa al suo ritorno dalla guerra  Ma cosi va la vita    hide spoiler  Questa prima risposta pero a me non convince  mi rendo conto che l interpretazione cui sono giunta e strettamente connessa con la mia formazione universitaria e quindi c e anche una certa rigidita nel cercare sistematicamente tutte le conferme alla mia seconda ipotesi  ignorando o scartando quei dati che magari la mettono in crisi    view spoiler  Secondo me i racconti di Bill Pilgrim sono solo delle allucinazioni consolatorie a cui egli ricorre per rendere gestibili situazioni emotivamente stressanti  Questa interpretazione per me e stata chiara sin dall inizio e  considerando i vari racconti come dei deliri  non ho avuto difficolta a seguire Bill nei vari viaggi nel tempo che  guarda caso  si verificano ogni volta Bill si trova in una situazione che mette a serio rischio il suo equilibrio mentale  Bill  del resto  e solo un bambino che si trova in guerra  Cosa fanno i bambini piccoli per appianare le incongruenze e affrontare le difficolta  Spesso aggiustano le situazioni sgradevoli dando loro un senso magico  chiamando in causa esseri fatati che possono dare un senso a cio che sembra non averne  Quando iniziano i deliri di Bill  Secondo me quando viene ricoverato nell ospedale dei veterani per shock postraumatico da stress  riesce a tollerare la prospettiva di vivere con una donna che non ama perche viaggiando nel tempo scopre che non sara poi cosi male e  comunque  puo sempre tornare su Trafalmadore dove l aspetta Montana con il loro bambino  La soluzione di Bill  e il suggerimento di Vonnegut  e di concentrarsi sui momenti belli della vita e di ritornare ad essi con la mente  Anche alcuni elementi del racconto mi fanno propendere per l ipotesi del delirio  ad esempio il dialogo tra Bill e la guardia che lo accoglie al campo di concentramento e uguale a quello tra Bill e i trafalmadoriani che lo rapiscono per portarlo su Trafalmadore    hide spoiler   Sa   disse  noi  qui  la guerra abbiamo dovuto immaginarcela  e io immaginavo che a farla fossero uomini abbastanza anziani come noi  Avevamo dimenticato che a fare le guerre sono i ragazzini  Quando ho visto quelle facce appena rase  e stato uno shock   Dio mio  Dio mio   mi sono detto  questa e la crociata dei bambini    Forse e il caso che metta termine ai miei di deliri  Sicuramente  Mattatoio n  5 non e un romanzo di fantascienza  nel capitolo introduttivo  Vonnegut ce lo dice chiaramente  E  un romanzo sulla guerra  su cosa significa combattere  uccidere e vedere quotidianamente delle atrocita e su quanto sia difficile dimenticare tutto per tornare alla banalita della vita  Vonnegut lo sapeva e ci ha messo piu di vent anni per trovare una forma adeguata per comunicare la sua esperienza di soldato e lo ha fatto proprio durante un altra guerra insensata  la guerra del Vietnam  E  anche un romanzo ottimista  non e possibile impedire all uomo di distruggersi   Cosi va la vita   ma possiamo rendere migliore la nostra vita se riusciamo a valorizzare i momenti belli    Noi sappiamo come finisce l universo     disse la guida  e la Terra non ha nulla a che vedere in questo  salvo che vien spazzata via anche lei    Come    come finisce l universo   disse Billy   Lo facciamo saltar per aria  sperimentando nuovi combustibili per i nostri dischi volanti  Un pilota collaudatore tralfamadoriano preme un bottone d avvio  e l intero universo scompare   Cosi va la vita   Se voi sapete tutto questo   disse Billy  non avete modo di prevenirlo  Non potete impedire al pilota di premere il bottone    Lui l ha  sempre  premuto  e lo premera  sempre   Noi glielo lasciamo  sempre  premere  e glielo lasceremo  sempre   Il momento e  strutturato  in quel modo    Cosi     disse Billy andando a tastoni  immagino che anche l idea di impedire la guerra sulla Terra sia stupida    Naturalmente    Ma voi vivete in pace  su questo pianeta    Oggi si  Altri giorni abbiamo guerre terribili come voi non ne avete mai viste o lette  Non possiamo farci niente  e cosi ci limitiamo a non guardarle  Le ignoriamo  Passiamo l eternita guardando alcuni momenti gradevoli    come oggi allo zoo  Non e un momento piacevole    Si    C e una cosa che i terrestri potrebbero imparare a fare  se si sforzassero davvero  ignorare i periodi brutti  e concentrarsi su quelli belli    Um  disse Billy Pilgrim    Slaughterhouse Five has some really interesting and innovative perspectives on the concept of time  I was really happy to see the mention of aliens in this novel due to its ensuing exploration of ideas from an entirely different point of view  Vonnegut writes in a way that pieces together various storylines and short snippets of fiction to create a comprehensive book    in a way  quite cleverly  that allows its structure to mirror its content  A quick read  a fascinating read  I look forward

survive the the Battle of the Bulge and the fire bombing of Dresden  where he was held as a prisoner of war in a former slaughterhouse   After the war  he spends some time in a mental institution and finds it difficult to live a normal life  but he manages to get married and become an optometrist  and later on in life he is convinced he was abducted by aliens This is a novel about the trauma of war and its effects on the human brain  The war events are gruesome even though the language used to describe them is quite vague  Instead of description in detail  we get metaphors and it is fitting as  for those of us who did not live through war  it is impossible to truly understand its horrors  The author  however  did go through it and his personal experience is the inspiration behind this part of the novel Pilgrim s life after war is shaped by PTSD and this leads to some weird but fun to read events  I will not describe any of these events  but I will mention that the ideas of free will and responsibility come up Long story short  I like the back and forth between the past and the present  this is something that I enjoy quite a lot and I also use in my own writing   the link to some philosophical ideas  such as Hobbes   man is wolf to man  and those who have read The Leviathan know what it means   the story  and the writing  Vonnegut is a great  great  great writer  Just in case I did not make myself clear  he is a great writer  D Ultimamente  quasi per casualita  mi imbatto e leggo opere dedicate alla guerra  La maggior parte di esse la condanna e ne disvela il dolore  la truculenza  la profonda ingiustizia Mattatoio Ndeg 5 parla della follia della guerra  O meglio  e la rappresentazione della follia della guerra  della sua insensatezza  Vonnegut  usando i topoi della science fiction  alieni  viaggi temporali   ci offre uno sguardo distaccato ed al contempo tragico dell insensatezza della guerra e dell esistenza umana  Uno strano ibrido tra le memorie di Primo Levi  Se questo e un uomo La tregua  e il  teatro dell assurdo  di Ionesco e Beckett  E dovrebbe apparire accanto a loro nelle librerie di testo nelle scuole  I enjoy Kurt Vonnegut a lot  Especially with the other three novels I ve read of his  Cat s Cradle  Breakfast of Champions  and Sirens of Titan This one didn t really do it for me as much  And arguably  this is touted as his most important novel  I guess that s so  as the insanity of war is most prevalent here  The story centers around Billy Pilgrim  who has become unstuck in time  thanks to his abduction by aliens  They have taught him the concept of time  which they have special insight into as they are able to see a fourth dimension  This isn t really much of a spoiler  but it was the great part of the book for me  so maybe it s best if you let the story lead you to it  view spoiler  It was this aspect of the novel that really won me over  and something that I will carry forth probably for the rest of my days  To appreciate each moment in the past as if it were right there in the present  just may be the perfect antedote to depression or grief  Assuming you only visit the postitive moments  of course   hide spoiler  Storywise  characterwise  I found the novel not quite so gripping  and worthy of two to three stars  But to take something away from this like I have  deserves 4 to 5  I m making a very strong exception to the rule here and I m totally ignoring any shortfallings  When I finished the novel I was bent on giving this 2 stars  but I think it s amazing for it to affect me regardless  So amazing  5  it is  I picked this up because I was looking at this website that had pictures of literary tattoos and an extraordinary number of people had  Everything was beautiful and nothing hurt  tattoos  I was like   What is so great about this quote that all these people had it permanently inked on their bodies   Turns out  the quote is kind of a non sequitur  I mean  I m sure you can figure out a way in which it s deeply integral to the book s themes or whatever  but in terms of the narrative  it just appears as a thought the main character has and then is never mentioned again  Another popular tattoo from S 5 on that website is  So it goes   which makes a lot more sense to me because Vonnegut writes it every single time he mentions death  Nothing like a nice little momento mori on your forearm  right I gave this book five stars because it is hella deep  The plot jumps around different times like crazy  but everything feels connected  which is quite a feat in terms of writing ability  Some people may think the whole alien abduction thing is sort of stupid  but I d be lying if I said this book didn t really make me think about the nature of time and human suffering   And Lot s wife  of course  was told not to look back where all those people and their homes had been  But she did look back  and I love her for that  because it was so human So she was turned into a pillar of salt  So it goes    Chapter 1  Slaughterhouse Five I meant to write how I love this book more every time I read it  Mary O Hare and Roland Weary and the Children s Crusade  but I went in search of something I read Vonnegut saying once and fell down a rabbit hole of conversations between him and Joseph Heller  and spent just as much time there as I did reading the book itself  Which   just the fact that these two were friends should mean that some days the world manages things OK Their interview with Playboy in 1992 is as good a place as any to start  but where I wound up was at the review mentioned briefly there  Vonnegut s review of Heller s Something Happened  where Vonnegut says this about the molasses like cautiousness of accepting certain books as important ones   To accept a new myth about ourselves is to simplify our memories   and to place our stamp of approval on what might become an epitaph for our era in the shorthand of history  This  in my opinion  is why critics often condemn our most significant books and poems and plays when they first appear  while praising feebler creations  The birth of a new myth fills them with primitive dread  for myths are so effective  And Vonnegut  like Heller  is no feeble creation  They write jokes  yes  and one writes science fiction  but all the best jokes are dangerous  because they re truthful  and all the successful jokes start as a threat to someone or something  And science fiction  well Rosewater was twice as smart as Billy  but he and Billy were dealing with similar crises in similar ways  They had both found life meaningless  partly because of what they had seen in the war  Rosewater  for instance  had shot a fourteen year old fireman  mistaking him for a German soldier  So it goes  And Billy had seen the greatest massacre in European history  which was the firebombing of Dresden  So it goes  So they were trying to re invent themselves and their universe  Science fiction was a big help In the same interview in McSweeney s  sans Heller this time  Vonnegut says he avoids irony  that he doesn t like people saying one thing and meaning the other  and it stopped me right there  I had to think about that  because I would have always pegged books like Catch 22  like Slaughterhouse Five with praise for their irony  But I think there s something to that  What they do works like irony in that it points out the absurdity  but it works so much better because it s not saying one thing and meaning the opposite  it s saying one thing and meaning it for real   it only seems like the opposite when it doesn t sound like what we expect to hear  So you can have epitaphs like Billy Pilgrim s   Everything was beautiful and nothing hurt   and it doesn t cut to your heart because it means the opposite  it cuts because of the sadness that in one real way it s true  And I don t know  I m just thinking out loud here  but that s what I like about Vonnegut  about Heller  their two books like twins in all the ways twins are alike and different  There s no moral written into their stories  It s just the way things were  and you dig around in them  and you unearth from them the things you need to carry with you One of my favorite lines Vonnegut ever wrote is from God Bless You  Mr  Rosewater   in true Vonnegut form  the same Rosewater as above  It goes Hello  babies  Welcome to Earth  It s hot in the summer and cold in the winter  It s round and wet and crowded  At the outside  babies  you ve got about a hundred years here  There s only one rule that I know of  babies     God damn it  you ve got to be kind  And yet  babies  all of this happened  more or less Chapter 1  Slaughterhouse Five  again It is so short and jumbled and jangled  Sam  because there is nothing intelligent to say about a massacre  Everybody is supposed to be dead  to never say anything or want anything ever again  Everything is supposed to be very quiet after a massacre  and it always is  except for the birds And what do the birds say  All there is to say about a massacre  things like  Poo tee weet    In this re read  Slaughter House Five is still the seminal eye opening experience that I thought it was when I first read it in the seventies  While there was certainly comedic qualities  it is actually Vonnegut s most serious work with the possible exception of Mother Night  Vonnegut has taken his own war experiences and examined them with eye of a man who have questioned too long and has never found answers but realizes that the non answers may be the answer  This novel is one of the greatest anti war novels ever  Yet Vonnegut is wise enough to state within the same novel that he may as well written an anti glacier novel  A must read for everyone on the planet  A book all Earthlings should read  A book for people interested in more than just three dimensional reality  Thank you Kurt Vonnegut for re establishing my thoughts on the futility of war and my love of flying saucers  I was not aware of Kurt Vonnegut when he passed away last year  I hadn t read a single book of his  and that situation remained until a few weeks ago when  after watching a documentary on another fallen hero  Hunter S  Thompson  I decided to buy some of the books I had intended to a long time ago and never did  So in went Catch 22  South of No North  The Cheese Monkeys  and Slaughterhouse Five  And out I walked looking like a  cult classic  wannabe late to the party Slaughterhouse Five is the first of the four that I ve read and I find that kind of sad  because now the others have such a high bar to flip towards that surely they ll trip and stumble  But we ll wait and see  In any case I  like just about every other person on the planet that has read Vonnegut it seems  found it wonderful  It s told from the perspective of a man named Billy Pilgrim  who becomes  unstuck in time  following an aeroplane crash in his late life  This leads to a narrative that jumps back and forth throughout a few major settings of his life  his brief experience as a chaplain s aide in World War II  as a prisoner of war in a Dresden slaughterhouse  number five  giving its title to the book  during the famous firebombing  postwar with his fat  millionaire heiress wife  and as an elder man who spreads the word of his fatalist philosophy  developed as a result of his being kidnapped by an alien race As you may have guessed by that last item  there are a couple of science fiction elements in the book  but not enough that it falls into the dreaded void that might have seen a lot of people ignore it out of their pig minded refusal to read genre fiction  The literary mechanism of time travel can t really be called science fiction  as it there is no grand machine  and it is never known if it occurs only in Billy Pilgrim s mind  The alien race that picks up Billy and helps him understand his time shifting is unavoidably going to be thought of as sci fi  but they could just as easily have been a group of monks  So there s really no reason to be a literature snob  there s ideas like this in all genre fiction  A major theme in the book is the concept of time and space as related to death  The aliens  Tralfamadorians  that help Billy  and display him in a zoo with a porno star  incidentally  can see in the fourth dimension  time  and therefore can visit any point of their life at any time  As a result of their unique sight  they believe that the body exists forever  when a body dies  it merely stops existing in that time and place  but continues to exist in other times and places where it was still alive  This fatalist worldview is something that Billy preaches later in life  which ends up amassing him a public profile that leads to his death at the hands of a revenge loving fellow slaughterhouse refugee  The famous quote of  so it goes  is the standard response from the Tralfamadorians  and also the narrator  whenever death occurs Slaughterhouse five has been called an anti war book  in fact  the back cover claims it to be the most famous anti war book every made  which I find hard to believe   but I think it is more of a comment on the human condition  the way that we operate in ways so perpendicular to what we know is what we want as a result of our modern environment  That it is mostly set in a warzone doesn t really mean that it is anti war  I think Vonnegut has used war as an extreme example of the silliness of humankind s value system  Without sounding like a hippy  I d recommend it to anyone who thinks that work is life  or that politics is life  or that religion is life  I found it brilliant as a piece of literature  brilliant as a story  and brilliant as a different view on the problem of modern life  khtb slkh khnh shmrh pnj rw dws dshtm   mn khtb hyy khh rj  bh jng nwshth shdh rw khyly dws drm m yn khtb tfwt hy zydy b khtb hy jngy khh z nwysndh hy dygh khwndh bwdm dsht yn khtb rw wnh gt

modernist book  maddeningly fun to read  and deeply rewarding to all readers  The montage of the story is brilliant and helped the book be a page turner    not because of its cheap thrills but of how exciting the writer s techniques were  and the various timelines  Fighting the urge to flat out cry at some parts was proof to how transformative and powerful Vonnegut s words can be  as seemingly simple and effortless as they might read  I couldn t help but sympathize  and empathize  with our boy Billy Pilgrim  whom by him we recount the events of the Dresden bombing at the Second World War  an event that had double the casualties of Hiroshima yet remained an unknown secret for years  and still is relatively unfamiliar  So it goes  Livro magnifico  Confesso que ao inicio me pareceu deveras estranho  mas conforme fui avancando fui ficando rendida a historia  Atraves de muito humor negro e usando um fundo de ficcao cientifica  com viagens entre passado e futuro e entre dois planetas   Kurt Vonnegut apresenta nos uma historia bem real sobre a inevitabilidade da vida e das suas reviravoltas  E e assim   Po zamyslu eto dna iz luchshikh knig kotorye ia kogda libo chital

eio tak vazhno vam prochest    Slaughterhouse Five is ambitious  It is honest  It is brutal  and it is funny  Vonnegut draws on his personal experience as a POW in World War 2 to write a detailed narrative of what POW life was like leading up to and during the Allied fire bombing of Dresden  But that s only a third of the story  The rest of the story the protagonist jumps around in time to life before and after he joined the army  and ultimately his mental breakdown and delusions of being abducted by aliens  I know this sounds campy  but Vonnegut does it masterfully  I m a stickler about giving out five star ratings  but this story completely deserves all five  Billy Pilgrim is obviously suffering from post traumatic stress  and as such no matter where he is or what he s doing he can never completely escape the horror he experienced in Dresden  This combined with Vonnegut s gallow s humor of describing death with a nonchalant   So it goes   at least once per page  makes the story complex and rich and multilayered  The gorgeous yet haunting descriptions Vonnegut gives of Dresden s moonscape in the morning after the bombs  details like his guards walking around with their mouths open like a barbershop quartet in a silent movie  The ways in which this unexpectedly attacks Pilgrim s psyche at unguarded moments later in life is amazingly well crafted  Also being able to use an  alien  philosophy of presentness and appreciating both the present moment and life as a whole  sets this work apart from the rest  A wonderful story  amazingly told  Everyone should read this at least once  http   joshuarigsby com Kurt Vonnegut recently died  A number of interviews with him are posted as videos on the web  If you ve never heard him speak  check them out Indicative of the kind of person he was is a comment he wrote once that has stuck with me  A Midwesterner  Vonnegut was raised in Indianapolis  a fact of which he was proud  he said  because his town was the first in the country to convict and execute a white for murdering an indian  Of course  Kurt opposed the death penalty  He wasn t very fond of Indianapolis either That kind of humor  humor with a humane core  runs throughout his books  Slaughterhouse Five  a memoir of his time as a prisoner of war in Dresden  fictionalized as that of the Everyman  Billy Pilgrim  is perhaps his best and most extreme  Although it links to some of the perennial characters who appear in many of his novels  the book is a good place to start if you haven t already  Afterwards  you might want to read his other war based novels  Mother Night and Bluebeard Vonnegut was passionately  and actively  opposed to war and the causes of war  I was introduced to Mr  Vonnegut when I first read his terrific short story    2 B R 0 2 B    In no more than 17 virtual pages  I read it online for free   the famous American writer deftly painted a picture of a negatively Utopian and morally ambiguous future  where consensual homicide is endorsed by the powers that be and is just an operator assisted phone call away  Reading 2 B R 0 2 B  I was afforded a taste of Vonnegut s immense talent as a satirical  absurdist science fiction writer  a brief yet rewarding glimpse at his aptitude for dark comedy and socio political commentary  which I later rediscovered in its most potent form while reading his most celebrated novel   Slaughterhouse 5   whose main narrative begins thusly  LISTEN BILLY PILGRIM has come unstuck in time Billy has gone to sleep a senile widower and awakened on his wedding day  He has walked through a door in 1955 and come out another one in 1941  He has gone back through that door to find himself in 1963  He has seen his birth and death many times  he says  and pays random visits to all the events in between He says Billy is spastic in time  has not control over where he is going next  and the trips aren t necessarily fun  He is in a constant state of stage fright  he says  because he never knows what part of his life he is going to have to act in next At the center of Slaughterhouse 5 is Billy Pilgrim  easily one of the most unforgettable protagonists in American literature  He was  or claimed that he was  a time traveler  He said he first came  unstuck in time  while serving in an infantry regiment in Europe during the Second World War  As a result  he began living in a nonlinear fashion  he would have erratic flashbacks and flash forwards whereby he  relived  different moments in his life  These moments could be as mundane as having dull conversations with his obese wife during their honeymoon  as poignant as gurgling and cooing while his mother wrapped him  a mere infant  in a towel  as bizarre as making love with a B movie starlet while on display in a zoo in a distant planet called Tralfamadore  home to the fatalistic Tralfamadorians  as crucial as having an assassin s laser gun s crosshairs in the middle of his forehead  and as epoch making as surviving the infamous firestorm of Dresden by taking cover  with other prisoners of war  in the eponymous meat locker It is a high compliment to Mr  Vonnegut that forty years after its publication  I read the novel for the first time  found it stylistically fresh  and surprised myself by finishing it in less than a sidereal day  I knew right then and there that I had just read one of the greatest books of the last century  At the same time  I vowed to name my firstborn after him  Brilliant artists tend to have that effect on me  And in evidence to Mr  Vonnegut s brilliance  I reproduce here my favorite passage from Slaughterhouse 5  a narration of a war movie seen in reverse by Billy Pilgrim American planes  full of holes and wounded men and corpses took off backwards from an airfield in England  Over France  a few German fighter planes flew at them backwards  sucked bullets and shell fragments from some of the planes and crewmen  They did the same for wrecked American bombers on the ground  and those planes flew up backwards to join the formation The formation flew backwards over a German city that was in flames  The bombers opened their bomb bay doors  exerted a miraculous magnetism which shrunk the fires  gathered them into cylindrical steel containers  and lifted the containers into the bellies of the planes  The containers were stored neatly in racks  The Germans below had miraculous devices of their own  which were long steel tubes  They used them to suck more fragments from the crewmen and planes  But there were still a few wounded Americans  though  and some of the bombers were in bad repair  Over France  though  German fighters came up again  made everything and everybody as good as new When the bombers got back to their base  the steel cylinders were taken from the racks and shipped back to the United States of America  where factories were operating night and day  dismantling the cylinders  separating the dangerous contents into minerals  Touchingly  it was mainly women who did this work  The minerals were then shipped to specialists in remote areas  It was their business to put them into the ground  to hide them cleverly  so they would never hurt anybody ever again On that note  as one of Mr  Vonnegut s countless fans I ought to borrow his famous reductive memento mori So it goes   Originally posted here  Wow  You could drive a veritable fleet of side by side trucks through the difference between what I expected from this novel and the utterly satisfying reading experience it provided  I ll admit  years of having dreary WWII era American lit crammed down my throat in K 12 English classes still makes me involuntarily grimace over the idea of picking up yet ANOTHER wartime classic  and it almost made me miss out on both a novel and a writer hugely deserving of their wildly perpetuated acclaim  I was not expecting a time traveling  world jumping  anti war tome that was virtually spilling over with crackling wit and delightfully dry humor  The gratuitous use of understatement    one of my all time favorite literary techniques    only drives the late Vonnegut s point home like a stake through the heart  Using extraterrestrial beings as a method for pointing out the foibles and idiosyncrasies of humanity is just a brilliant move  Looking at something so familiarly intangible  like time or death  as almost physical entities makes the book worth the read for the perspective change alone  Taking it one step further by showing how a man widely considered to be off his nut and making him the lone voice of comforting logic was a pretty fantastic touch  too  This is a quick reading classic that is packed with still relevant musings AND knows how to deliver an all too human message while making sure the reader enjoys every line of the journey  It s been a long time since I wanted to flip immediately back to the first page after finishing a book  and I m really glad that  Slaughterhouse Five  was the book that reminded me of what a great feeling that is  Most of what I ve been enjoying as of late would not be as eagerly received by others  however  this is a book I can t imagine NOT recommending to anyone looking for a book that so perfectly appeals to not only the brain but also the need for a few hearty laughs   And so it goes      Tolkien aside  Vonnegut was my first major literary hero  Cat s Cradle was  by some distance  the best book I was assigned to read in high school  and it isn t even my favorite of his novels  I ve since explored worlds of postmodernism and metafiction as practiced by Vonnegut s comrades in arms  many of whom are a ton less accessible than the ever conversational Kurt  Which is all fine and good  because Pynchon and Barth and Gaddis and Gass are pretty much where I ve been at lately  but I think that  while all these long syntactically complex sentences and huge plots and goofily named characters and massive philosophical implications have their merits  I ve lost touch with the warmth of Vonnegut s voice  I just adore how he uses the postmodern techniques I ve grown to love   the absurd humor  the metafiction  nonlinear narratives  the goofy names  the use of  low  art forms like crude songs and chase scenes   in a way that makes it seem like he s talking right to you  Franzen wants to be your good buddy  but he hasn t a patch on Vonnegut in the intimacy department  He was my default pick for favorite author from 2008 to 2013  when DFW unseated him  and while I don t talk about him as much as I used to  he s still high on my list Slaughterhouse Five is long overdue for a reread  Vonnegut was just as smart as his big book contemporaries  as evidenced by this novel s brilliant use of time  its incisive commentary on war  and the sympathy Vonnegut builds for Billy Pilgrim  who at first just looks ridiculous but reveals himself to be a complex and conflicted and strangely wise character  Don Quixote and Sancho Panza rolled into one  And Vonnegut s prose  Beautiful  elegant  completely underrated   His head was tilted back and his nostrils were flaring  He was like a poet in the Parthenon  is a phrase that has haunted me since I first read this  Pretty much the peak  along with The Sirens of Titan  of high concept sci fi   Ben Roberts gave me this book for my sixteenth birthday  I asked him what it was about and he said it was about World War Two and the bombing of Dresden and an American POW who is abducted by UFO s  But then he added that it was only kind of about those things  about those things but not really  hard to explain  Then he walked off  Anyway  I was definitely interested in WW2 at the time  and sadly  many  many other wars  some even nonfictional  and so that night at 16 when I flipped open the first page of that beat up second hand paper back that I m sure Ben had used to insulate something at one point  I only found a man with a bad attitude rambling about some things and he didn t seem to have a very heroic view of things  I was fanatic about heroics at the time  because I went to private school and didn t understand what that meant  Most of the other kids had no problem with it  because they understood that the first rule of private school  especially a religious one  is to say you believe in things and act as though you believe in things and harshly ridicule those who transgress the things you believe  when in fact you believe in absolutely nothing and take your parents credit card out with you on the weekends  My parents never gave me their credit card and I had a hard time fitting in because I did believe in things  like heroism  and it was years after I graduated before I realized why kids used to stare at me blankly when I talked about heroics and fighting against evil for good  Poor me  I wasn t rich  wasn t good at football  got bored too easily with classes and got kicked out of the drama department for cutting up with the more popular actors than myself  heroics was all I had  So  when I realized that no one was going to get killed  at least not the way I wanted them to  heroically  and that there were no space ships laden with other worldly warriors coming to attack us  I put it down  Probably for Tolkien  Or a Star Wars novel  I sold Ben s second hand copy that he gave me for my birthday years ago  Sorry Ben So  fourteen years and a few days later I opened it back up again  Things had changed  It was a much better book  I was surprised  And very pleased  I know this is one of those books that you re supposed to read in high school  but I didn t because I hated reading because I was afraid I would turn into the kids I went to school with  most of whom would never read a book again after graduating and some who would destroy the parts of their brains that the read was stored in through drug use and some that would die  So it goes  But here today  looking back  I m glad I didn t read it  I m glad I waited till now  But enough about my reading I want to venture to say that this may be one of the tightest books  thematically  elementally  rhetorically  I have ever read  It is poetry in the highest order disguised under Vonnegut s gruff  bar stool vernacular  It s easy enough  if not dangerous  for kids  who can pick up on the book s  and Vonnegut s  bad attitude pretty quickly  But dangerous because the average 17 year old can t possibly understand what this is about  though he could pick up on the basic angst and feel as though he got it  Also  the average high schooler probably wouldn t read this unless he or she was getting class credit  To those who did read this for their own good  I d highly recommend re reading if you haven t already  I think you ll find a lot that you missed the first time around One of the novel s particular strengths is it s voice  It would not be difficult to imagine Vonnegut reciting this story to someone sitting next to him in a bar  the prose is so familiar  so self aware and irreverent  But thematically  it s iconoclasm is another of the novel s strengths  Vonnegut is not vindictive in his assaults on how Americans saw and thought of America and other Americans post war  Like Ben said  it s about those things but not really  It s profound and funny and sad at points  but not really  That s not why you laugh  The novel s broken and a chronological order drive home its elements more fully  and the small details he uses to link everything together add layer upon layer  The greatest strength of the novel  I feel  however  is that Vonnegut doesn t waste a word  Everything is there than needs to be without any excess  and tied together so perfectly  It s breathtaking really  like a matador that so enchants a bull that he can kiss it on the forehead  I cannot praise it enough  lmslkh lkhms ll mryky kwrt fwnyjwt  lrwy  ttnwl qDy  qSf mdyn  drysdn fy  lmny  thn lHrb l lmy  lthny   lty lm tHZ  bshhr  hyrwshym rGm tfwq  dd lDHy fy l wl  w bthy  sbb lqSf mqrn

particular book  I m giving  Slaughterhouse Five  five stars with little elaboration  I ll simply say that this was my first time revisiting the book since first reading it in high school  and part of the reason for my high rating is that it held up incredibly well    something I can say of few books I loved as a teenager Kurt Vonnegut s writing simply touches my reptilian brain stem in a way few authors  books do  I don t know that I love  Slaughterhouse Five  as much as I do  Breakfast of Champions     one s favorite Vonnegut book is often the one he read first  and for me that was  Breakfast     but it s still a great book In  Slaughterhouse Five   Vonnegut makes mention that one of his recurring characters  science fiction author Kilgore Trout  has great ideas but is a terrible writer  Fortunately for his readers  Vonnegut both had great ideas and was a wonderful writer  His exploration of the life of a character who spends his entire existence bouncing among various highlights of his life    becoming  in Vonnegut s parlance  unstuck in time    is consistently creative and insightful  One may be tempted to criticize Vonnegut for making Billy Pilgrim an overly passive character  for never having him take control of his life or fight back  but such passivity makes complete sense for someone who realizes he has no free will    that the story of his life  and death  has already been written and nothing he does will alter it Despite its dark subject matter   Slaughterhouse Five  is occasionally quite funny  and not just sardonically so  Having forgotten the scene from my first reading of  Slaughterhouse Five   I laughed out loud at Kilgore Trout convincing a less than brilliant woman at a party that all of his novels are completely true    that it would be a violation of the law for him to write a story that was untrue It turns out I said more about  Slaughterhouse Five  than I intended to  Be glad  though  that I managed to write this whole review without saying  so it goes   Well  until now  So it goes   Shells were bursting in the treetops with terrific bangs showering down knives and needles and razorblades  Little lumps of lead in copper jackets were crisscrossing the woods under the shellbursts  zipping along much faster than sound  War is a wonderful thing   it presents a man with madness  And madness is even more wonderful thing   it allows a man to travel in time  to go through space to distant planets  to see things others can t see   Why anything  Because this moment simply is  Have you ever seen bugs trapped in amber    Yes    Well  here we are    trapped in the amber of this moment  There is no why   So it goes   I enjoyed reading about Dresden because I went there a few years ago and they were still rebuilding the city  I also have a picture of how the lights glow on the river like Billy Pilgrim spoke of  This was one of my all time favorite places in Germany  A proper review to follow     And because I have the sense of humor of a ten year old  I thought that I would throw this one in for fun    You re welcome     And even if wars didn t keep coming like glaciers  there would still be plain old death  Except no one really dies  because time  as we see  doesn t flow in a linear fashion  Everything which is about to happen has happened already and everything which has happened in the past can happen again if you want it to  All you gotta do is  have the ability to see in four dimensions and consider Time as a platter dish in front of you  Pick whatever makes you happy and forget about the rest  Sounds simple enough eh Billy Pilgrim just about the friendliest name  hated his life  not because of the brutal war that he had to experience or the inequitable hatred that he was subject to  but because he was tired of all the travelling back and forth in time  because he was disinterested in about everything  and above all  because he couldn t attach any meaning to his life or any other s life for that matter  He was like a pale  withered pebble lying by the road because it has nowhere else to be Tragic  yes  Comic  yes  But this story is much much more  It really is inexplicable how Vonnegut has said a million things and not a single thing all at once through this masterpiece  Oh and some extra credit points for this There is one other book  that can teach you everything you need to know about life    it s The Brothers Karamazov by Fyodor Dostoyevsky  but that s not enough anymore If you happen to read this review  stop right here and go pick up this book  You won t regret it     and so it goes   I pretty much thought this book was brilliant  I ve read it twice now and I shall read it again  It is difficult to write about  and read about  a subject of horror  Because  c mon  that s what it is  If the earth in Dresden becomes a veritable tomb for stinking  rotting corpses  and the few survivors have to spray fire into the holes to incinerate the rot because it is physically impossible to smell and touch the rot without hacking all your guts out   well  that s horrific  Yet Vonnegut mangages to write about such experiences with a certain degree of humor  he can look straight at a subject but give the reader enough breathing space and entertainment that he or she does not have to throw the book aside in total disgust  Vonnegut can get you to think  not by standing on a soapbox  but by placing an object before you and saying   Well  here it is   And then  sliding his hands in his pockets   What do you think of it    Somber  filthy  spectacular  Tremendous  hilarious  real  Sharp  frank satire in the face of all that gets our blood boiling  war  Christianity  poverty  you name it  The absurdity of it all  It ll have you rolling on the floor  soiling yourself  laughing silly  I still have belly aches  And the descriptions  Forget lengthy winding paragraphs  How about short lines that zing you in the teeth  And never any pomp  any pretense  just pure story   It is so short and jumbled and jangled  Sam  because there is nothing intelligent to say about a massacre  Everybody is supposed to be dead  to never say anything or want anything ever again  Everything is supposed to be very quiet after a massacre  and it always is  except for the birds  And what do the birds say  All there is to say about a massacre  things like  Poo tee weet   Ha livros que tenho a certeza de que lerei na minha vida  Mesmo nao sabendo quando  ou onde  em que circunstancias  ha livros que tenho a certeza que nao posso deixar de ler  Este e era um deles Billy Pilgrim atravessa as fronteiras do tempo  Billy Pilgrim e optometrista  Billy Pilgrim combate em Dresden na Segunda Guerra Mundial  Billy Pilgrim e raptado por aliens  Billy Pilgrim e das personagens mais tontas que ja pude conhecer Misturando ficcao com alguma autobiografia  pauta se essencialmente pela satira  pelo humor negro  mas ao mesmo tempo  tem ideias que me deixaram fascinada  bem como a propria construcao do enredo  Billy avanca e recua na vida  nao acompanhamos uma linha do tempo linear  antes as linhas se sobrepoem  tanto Billy esta na guerra como esta no consultorio a atender clientes  Um livro anti guerra  que mostra muito bem a loucura e insanidade que a caracterizam mas tambem a inocencia com que a guerra e vivida  E um livro muito inteligente em todos os sentidos  ate na escolha dos titulos o livro e brilhante  e a melhor parte e sem duvida em Dresden  E tenho de dizer que o Billy e uma personagem completamente parva  faz sentido com o contexto  mas se fosse num outro livro levar me ia a exasperacao  na certa Houve partes que tive de ler mais de uma vez  pela mensagem que queriam passar e que achei brilhantes  A ideia de que as pessoas nao morrem  continuam a existir mas num tempo diferente  que ainda perduram algures  E tambem  a dada altura  quando a guerra nos e descrita de tras para a frente  esta foi das minhas partes favoritas  When the bombers got back to their base  the steel cylinders were taken from the racks and shipped back to the United States of America  where factories were operating night and day  dismantling the cylinders  separating the dangerous contents into minerals  Touchingly  it was mainly women who did this work  The minerals were then shipped to specialists in remote areas  It was their business to put them into the ground  to hide them cleverly  so they would never hurt anybody again  Recomendo vivamente    Benvenuto a bordo  signor Pilgrim  disse l altoparlante   Nessuna domanda   Billy si passo la lingua sulle labbra  penso un momento  e infine chiese   Perche io     Questa e proprio una domanda da terrestre  signor Pilgrim  Perche  lei   Perche  noi  allora  Perche  qualsiasi cosa   Perche questo momento semplicemente  e   Non ha mai visto degli insetti nell ambra    Chi e Bill Pilgrim  Vonnegut nel suo libro da diverse risposte  o almeno io ne ho trovate due  La prima  quella letterale  e che Bill Pilgram e un uomo fortunato perche ha scoperto di poter viaggiare nel tempo   view spoiler  Sostiene infatti di essere stato rapito dagli extraterrestri di Trafalmador all eta di 42 anni e  grazie a loro  di aver conosciuto la vera natura del tempo  gli istanti non si succedono uno dietro l altro perdendosi per sempre  ma sono cristallizzati ed eterni  La conseguenza di questa scoperta e la possibilita di viaggiare nel tempo  spostandosi da un istante a un altro  con al consapevoelzza che le cose brutte accadono e sempre accadranno perche non e possibile impedirle  ma lo stesso vale per i momenti belli  Dunque per evitare una situazione sgradevole basta spostarsi nel tempo  Bill e diventato bravissimo  puo sopportare la guerra e la prigionia proprio perche di tanto in tanto si allontana per tornare alla sua infanzia o per rivivere la sua luna di miele oppure torna a Trafalmador dove l attende la bellissima Montana Wildhack  anche lei rapita dai trafalmadoriani e  donata  a Bill per fargli compagnia durante la sua permanenza sul pianeta   ogni tanto Bill passa dalla padella alla brace e si ritrova in momenti poco felici della propria vita  ad esempio la sua morte o quella della moglie o il ricovero in un ospedale per veterani a causa della difficolta di re inseririsi nella societa al suo ritorno dalla guerra  Ma cosi va la vita    hide spoiler  Questa prima risposta pero a me non convince  mi rendo conto che l interpretazione cui sono giunta e strettamente connessa con la mia formazione universitaria e quindi c e anche una certa rigidita nel cercare sistematicamente tutte le conferme alla mia seconda ipotesi  ignorando o scartando quei dati che magari la mettono in crisi    view spoiler  Secondo me i racconti di Bill Pilgrim sono solo delle allucinazioni consolatorie a cui egli ricorre per rendere gestibili situazioni emotivamente stressanti  Questa interpretazione per me e stata chiara sin dall inizio e  considerando i vari racconti come dei deliri  non ho avuto difficolta a seguire Bill nei vari viaggi nel tempo che  guarda caso  si verificano ogni volta Bill si trova in una situazione che mette a serio rischio il suo equilibrio mentale  Bill  del resto  e solo un bambino che si trova in guerra  Cosa fanno i bambini piccoli per appianare le incongruenze e affrontare le difficolta  Spesso aggiustano le situazioni sgradevoli dando loro un senso magico  chiamando in causa esseri fatati che possono dare un senso a cio che sembra non averne  Quando iniziano i deliri di Bill  Secondo me quando viene ricoverato nell ospedale dei veterani per shock postraumatico da stress  riesce a tollerare la prospettiva di vivere con una donna che non ama perche viaggiando nel tempo scopre che non sara poi cosi male e  comunque  puo sempre tornare su Trafalmadore dove l aspetta Montana con il loro bambino  La soluzione di Bill  e il suggerimento di Vonnegut  e di concentrarsi sui momenti belli della vita e di ritornare ad essi con la mente  Anche alcuni elementi del racconto mi fanno propendere per l ipotesi del delirio  ad esempio il dialogo tra Bill e la guardia che lo accoglie al campo di concentramento e uguale a quello tra Bill e i trafalmadoriani che lo rapiscono per portarlo su Trafalmadore    hide spoiler   Sa   disse  noi  qui  la guerra abbiamo dovuto immaginarcela  e io immaginavo che a farla fossero uomini abbastanza anziani come noi  Avevamo dimenticato che a fare le guerre sono i ragazzini  Quando ho visto quelle facce appena rase  e stato uno shock   Dio mio  Dio mio   mi sono detto  questa e la crociata dei bambini    Forse e il caso che metta termine ai miei di deliri  Sicuramente  Mattatoio n  5 non e un romanzo di fantascienza  nel capitolo introduttivo  Vonnegut ce lo dice chiaramente  E  un romanzo sulla guerra  su cosa significa combattere  uccidere e vedere quotidianamente delle atrocita e su quanto sia difficile dimenticare tutto per tornare alla banalita della vita  Vonnegut lo sapeva e ci ha messo piu di vent anni per trovare una forma adeguata per comunicare la sua esperienza di soldato e lo ha fatto proprio durante un altra guerra insensata  la guerra del Vietnam  E  anche un romanzo ottimista  non e possibile impedire all uomo di distruggersi   Cosi va la vita   ma possiamo rendere migliore la nostra vita se riusciamo a valorizzare i momenti belli    Noi sappiamo come finisce l universo     disse la guida  e la Terra non ha nulla a che vedere in questo  salvo che vien spazzata via anche lei    Come    come finisce l universo   disse Billy   Lo facciamo saltar per aria  sperimentando nuovi combustibili per i nostri dischi volanti  Un pilota collaudatore tralfamadoriano preme un bottone d avvio  e l intero universo scompare   Cosi va la vita   Se voi sapete tutto questo   disse Billy  non avete modo di prevenirlo  Non potete impedire al pilota di premere il bottone    Lui l ha  sempre  premuto  e lo premera  sempre   Noi glielo lasciamo  sempre  premere  e glielo lasceremo  sempre   Il momento e  strutturato  in quel modo    Cosi     disse Billy andando a tastoni  immagino che anche l idea di impedire la guerra sulla Terra sia stupida    Naturalmente    Ma voi vivete in pace  su questo pianeta    Oggi si  Altri giorni abbiamo guerre terribili come voi non ne avete mai viste o lette  Non possiamo farci niente  e cosi ci limitiamo a non guardarle  Le ignoriamo  Passiamo l eternita guardando alcuni momenti gradevoli    come oggi allo zoo  Non e un momento piacevole    Si    C e una cosa che i terrestri potrebbero imparare a fare  se si sforzassero davvero  ignorare i periodi brutti  e concentrarsi su quelli belli    Um  disse Billy Pilgrim    Slaughterhouse Five has some really interesting and innovative perspectives on the concept of time  I was really happy to see the mention of aliens in this novel due to its ensuing exploration of ideas from an entirely different point of view  Vonnegut writes in a way that pieces together various storylines and short snippets of fiction to create a comprehensive book    in a way  quite cleverly  that allows its structure to mirror its content  A quick read  a fascinating read  I look forward to reading more of his work  srtsr dstn yh lbkhnd khyly ywsh rwy lbm bwd w b Dy jh qshng adm mykhndwnd byly pyl grym yh tnh lsh h by khyl w by azr bwd khh nmyshd dwstsh ndsht z bkhsh hy jlb khtb bry

survive the the Battle of the Bulge and the fire bombing of Dresden  where he was held as a prisoner of war in a former slaughterhouse   After the war  he spends some time in a mental institution and finds it difficult to live a normal life  but he manages to get married and become an optometrist  and later on in life he is convinced he was abducted by aliens This is a novel about the trauma of war and its effects on the human brain  The war events are gruesome even though the language used to describe them is quite vague  Instead of description in detail  we get metaphors and it is fitting as  for those of us who did not live through war  it is impossible to truly understand its horrors  The author  however  did go through it and his personal experience is the inspiration behind this part of the novel Pilgrim s life after war is shaped by PTSD and this leads to some weird but fun to read events  I will not describe any of these events  but I will mention that the ideas of free will and responsibility come up Long story short  I like the back and forth between the past and the present  this is something that I enjoy quite a lot and I also use in my own writing   the link to some philosophical ideas  such as Hobbes   man is wolf to man  and those who have read The Leviathan know what it means   the story  and the writing  Vonnegut is a great  great  great writer  Just in case I did not make myself clear  he is a great writer  D Ultimamente  quasi per casualita  mi imbatto e leggo opere dedicate alla guerra  La maggior parte di esse la condanna e ne disvela il dolore  la truculenza  la profonda ingiustizia Mattatoio Ndeg 5 parla della follia della guerra  O meglio  e la rappresentazione della follia della guerra  della sua insensatezza  Vonnegut  usando i topoi della science fiction  alieni  viaggi temporali   ci offre uno sguardo distaccato ed al contempo tragico dell insensatezza della guerra e dell esistenza umana  Uno strano ibrido tra le memorie di Primo Levi  Se questo e un uomo La tregua  e il  teatro dell assurdo  di Ionesco e Beckett  E dovrebbe apparire accanto a loro nelle librerie di testo nelle scuole  I enjoy Kurt Vonnegut a lot  Especially with the other three novels I ve read of his  Cat s Cradle  Breakfast of Champions  and Sirens of Titan This one didn t really do it for me as much  And arguably  this is touted as his most important novel  I guess that s so  as the insanity of war is most prevalent here  The story centers around Billy Pilgrim  who has become unstuck in time  thanks to his abduction by aliens  They have taught him the concept of time  which they have special insight into as they are able to see a fourth dimension  This isn t really much of a spoiler  but it was the great part of the book for me  so maybe it s best if you let the story lead you to it  view spoiler  It was this aspect of the novel that really won me over  and something that I will carry forth probably for the rest of my days  To appreciate each moment in the past as if it were right there in the present  just may be the perfect antedote to depression or grief  Assuming you only visit the postitive moments  of course   hide spoiler  Storywise  characterwise  I found the novel not quite so gripping  and worthy of two to three stars  But to take something away from this like I have  deserves 4 to 5  I m making a very strong exception to the rule here and I m totally ignoring any shortfallings  When I finished the novel I was bent on giving this 2 stars  but I think it s amazing for it to affect me regardless  So amazing  5  it is  I picked this up because I was looking at this website that had pictures of literary tattoos and an extraordinary number of people had  Everything was beautiful and nothing hurt  tattoos  I was like   What is so great about this quote that all these people had it permanently inked on their bodies   Turns out  the quote is kind of a non sequitur  I mean  I m sure you can figure out a way in which it s deeply integral to the book s themes or whatever  but in terms of the narrative  it just appears as a thought the main character has and then is never mentioned again  Another popular tattoo from S 5 on that website is  So it goes   which makes a lot more sense to me because Vonnegut writes it every single time he mentions death  Nothing like a nice little momento mori on your forearm  right I gave this book five stars because it is hella deep  The plot jumps around different times like crazy  but everything feels connected  which is quite a feat in terms of writing ability  Some people may think the whole alien abduction thing is sort of stupid  but I d be lying if I said this book didn t really make me think about the nature of time and human suffering   And Lot s wife  of course  was told not to look back where all those people and their homes had been  But she did look back  and I love her for that  because it was so human So she was turned into a pillar of salt  So it goes    Chapter 1  Slaughterhouse Five I meant to write how I love this book more every time I read it  Mary O Hare and Roland Weary and the Children s Crusade  but I went in search of something I read Vonnegut saying once and fell down a rabbit hole of conversations between him and Joseph Heller  and spent just as much time there as I did reading the book itself  Which   just the fact that these two were friends should mean that some days the world manages things OK Their interview with Playboy in 1992 is as good a place as any to start  but where I wound up was at the review mentioned briefly there  Vonnegut s review of Heller s Something Happened  where Vonnegut says this about the molasses like cautiousness of accepting certain books as important ones   To accept a new myth about ourselves is to simplify our memories   and to place our stamp of approval on what might become an epitaph for our era in the shorthand of history  This  in my opinion  is why critics often condemn our most significant books and poems and plays when they first appear  while praising feebler creations  The birth of a new myth fills them with primitive dread  for myths are so effective  And Vonnegut  like Heller  is no feeble creation  They write jokes  yes  and one writes science fiction  but all the best jokes are dangerous  because they re truthful  and all the successful jokes start as a threat to someone or something  And science fiction  well Rosewater was twice as smart as Billy  but he and Billy were dealing with similar crises in similar ways  They had both found life meaningless  partly because of what they had seen in the war  Rosewater  for instance  had shot a fourteen year old fireman  mistaking him for a German soldier  So it goes  And Billy had seen the greatest massacre in European history  which was the firebombing of Dresden  So it goes  So they were trying to re invent themselves and their universe  Science fiction was a big help In the same interview in McSweeney s  sans Heller this time  Vonnegut says he avoids irony  that he doesn t like people saying one thing and meaning the other  and it stopped me right there  I had to think about that  because I would have always pegged books like Catch 22  like Slaughterhouse Five with praise for their irony  But I think there s something to that  What they do works like irony in that it points out the absurdity  but it works so much better because it s not saying one thing and meaning the opposite  it s saying one thing and meaning it for real   it only seems like the opposite when it doesn t sound like what we expect to hear  So you can have epitaphs like Billy Pilgrim s   Everything was beautiful and nothing hurt   and it doesn t cut to your heart because it means the opposite  it cuts because of the sadness that in one real way it s true  And I don t know  I m just thinking out loud here  but that s what I like about Vonnegut  about Heller  their two books like twins in all the ways twins are alike and different  There s no moral written into their stories  It s just the way things were  and you dig around in them  and you unearth from them the things you need to carry with you One of my favorite lines Vonnegut ever wrote is from God Bless You  Mr  Rosewater   in true Vonnegut form  the same Rosewater as above  It goes Hello  babies  Welcome to Earth  It s hot in the summer and cold in the winter  It s round and wet and crowded  At the outside  babies  you ve got about a hundred years here  There s only one rule that I know of  babies     God damn it  you ve got to be kind  And yet  babies  all of this happened  more or less Chapter 1  Slaughterhouse Five  again It is so short and jumbled and jangled  Sam  because there is nothing intelligent to say about a massacre  Everybody is supposed to be dead  to never say anything or want anything ever again  Everything is supposed to be very quiet after a massacre  and it always is  except for the birds And what do the birds say  All there is to say about a massacre  things like  Poo tee weet    In this re read  Slaughter House Five is still the seminal eye opening experience that I thought it was when I first read it in the seventies  While there was certainly comedic qualities  it is actually Vonnegut s most serious work with the possible exception of Mother Night  Vonnegut has taken his own war experiences and examined them with eye of a man who have questioned too long and has never found answers but realizes that the non answers may be the answer  This novel is one of the greatest anti war novels ever  Yet Vonnegut is wise enough to state within the same novel that he may as well written an anti glacier novel  A must read for everyone on the planet  A book all Earthlings should read  A book for people interested in more than just three dimensional reality  Thank you Kurt Vonnegut for re establishing my thoughts on the futility of war and my love of flying saucers  I was not aware of Kurt Vonnegut when he passed away last year  I hadn t read a single book of his  and that situation remained until a few weeks ago when  after watching a documentary on another fallen hero  Hunter S  Thompson  I decided to buy some of the books I had intended to a long time ago and never did  So in went Catch 22  South of No North  The Cheese Monkeys  and Slaughterhouse Five  And out I walked looking like a  cult classic  wannabe late to the party Slaughterhouse Five is the first of the four that I ve read and I find that kind of sad  because now the others have such a high bar to flip towards that surely they ll trip and stumble  But we ll wait and see  In any case I  like just about every other person on the planet that has read Vonnegut it seems  found it wonderful  It s told from the perspective of a man named Billy Pilgrim  who becomes  unstuck in time  following an aeroplane crash in his late life  This leads to a narrative that jumps back and forth throughout a few major settings of his life  his brief experience as a chaplain s aide in World War II  as a prisoner of war in a Dresden slaughterhouse  number five  giving its title to the book  during the famous firebombing  postwar with his fat  millionaire heiress wife  and as an elder man who spreads the word of his fatalist philosophy  developed as a result of his being kidnapped by an alien race As you may have guessed by that last item  there are a couple of science fiction elements in the book  but not enough that it falls into the dreaded void that might have seen a lot of people ignore it out of their pig minded refusal to read genre fiction  The literary mechanism of time travel can t really be called science fiction  as it there is no grand machine  and it is never known if it occurs only in Billy Pilgrim s mind  The alien race that picks up Billy and helps him understand his time shifting is unavoidably going to be thought of as sci fi  but they could just as easily have been a group of monks  So there s really no reason to be a literature snob  there s ideas like this in all genre fiction  A major theme in the book is the concept of time and space as related to death  The aliens  Tralfamadorians  that help Billy  and display him in a zoo with a porno star  incidentally  can see in the fourth dimension  time  and therefore can visit any point of their life at any time  As a result of their unique sight  they believe that the body exists forever  when a body dies  it merely stops existing in that time and place  but continues to exist in other times and places where it was still alive  This fatalist worldview is something that Billy preaches later in life  which ends up amassing him a public profile that leads to his death at the hands of a revenge loving fellow slaughterhouse refugee  The famous quote of  so it goes  is the standard response from the Tralfamadorians  and also the narrator  whenever death occurs Slaughterhouse five has been called an anti war book  in fact  the back cover claims it to be the most famous anti war book every made  which I find hard to believe   but I think it is more of a comment on the human condition  the way that we operate in ways so perpendicular to what we know is what we want as a result of our modern environment  That it is mostly set in a warzone doesn t really mean that it is anti war  I think Vonnegut has used war as an extreme example of the silliness of humankind s value system  Without sounding like a hippy  I d recommend it to anyone who thinks that work is life  or that politics is life  or that religion is life  I found it brilliant as a piece of literature  brilliant as a story  and brilliant as a different view on the problem of modern life  khtb slkh khnh shmrh pnj rw dws dshtm   mn khtb hyy khh rj  bh jng nwshth shdh rw khyly dws drm m yn khtb tfwt hy zydy b khtb hy jngy khh z nwysndh hy dygh khwndh bwdm dsht yn khtb rw wnh gt

modernist book  maddeningly fun to read  and deeply rewarding to all readers  The montage of the story is brilliant and helped the book be a page turner    not because of its cheap thrills but of how exciting the writer s techniques were  and the various timelines  Fighting the urge to flat out cry at some parts was proof to how transformative and powerful Vonnegut s words can be  as seemingly simple and effortless as they might read  I couldn t help but sympathize  and empathize  with our boy Billy Pilgrim  whom by him we recount the events of the Dresden bombing at the Second World War  an event that had double the casualties of Hiroshima yet remained an unknown secret for years  and still is relatively unfamiliar  So it goes  Livro magnifico  Confesso que ao inicio me pareceu deveras estranho  mas conforme fui avancando fui ficando rendida a historia  Atraves de muito humor negro e usando um fundo de ficcao cientifica  com viagens entre passado e futuro e entre dois planetas   Kurt Vonnegut apresenta nos uma historia bem real sobre a inevitabilidade da vida e das suas reviravoltas  E e assim   Po zamyslu eto dna iz luchshikh knig kotorye ia kogda libo chital

eio tak vazhno vam prochest    Slaughterhouse Five is ambitious  It is honest  It is brutal  and it is funny  Vonnegut draws on his personal experience as a POW in World War 2 to write a detailed narrative of what POW life was like leading up to and during the Allied fire bombing of Dresden  But that s only a third of the story  The rest of the story the protagonist jumps around in time to life before and after he joined the army  and ultimately his mental breakdown and delusions of being abducted by aliens  I know this sounds campy  but Vonnegut does it masterfully  I m a stickler about giving out five star ratings  but this story completely deserves all five  Billy Pilgrim is obviously suffering from post traumatic stress  and as such no matter where he is or what he s doing he can never completely escape the horror he experienced in Dresden  This combined with Vonnegut s gallow s humor of describing death with a nonchalant   So it goes   at least once per page  makes the story complex and rich and multilayered  The gorgeous yet haunting descriptions Vonnegut gives of Dresden s moonscape in the morning after the bombs  details like his guards walking around with their mouths open like a barbershop quartet in a silent movie  The ways in which this unexpectedly attacks Pilgrim s psyche at unguarded moments later in life is amazingly well crafted  Also being able to use an  alien  philosophy of presentness and appreciating both the present moment and life as a whole  sets this work apart from the rest  A wonderful story  amazingly told  Everyone should read this at least once  http   joshuarigsby com Kurt Vonnegut recently died  A number of interviews with him are posted as videos on the web  If you ve never heard him speak  check them out Indicative of the kind of person he was is a comment he wrote once that has stuck with me  A Midwesterner  Vonnegut was raised in Indianapolis  a fact of which he was proud  he said  because his town was the first in the country to convict and execute a white for murdering an indian  Of course  Kurt opposed the death penalty  He wasn t very fond of Indianapolis either That kind of humor  humor with a humane core  runs throughout his books  Slaughterhouse Five  a memoir of his time as a prisoner of war in Dresden  fictionalized as that of the Everyman  Billy Pilgrim  is perhaps his best and most extreme  Although it links to some of the perennial characters who appear in many of his novels  the book is a good place to start if you haven t already  Afterwards  you might want to read his other war based novels  Mother Night and Bluebeard Vonnegut was passionately  and actively  opposed to war and the causes of war  I was introduced to Mr  Vonnegut when I first read his terrific short story    2 B R 0 2 B    In no more than 17 virtual pages  I read it online for free   the famous American writer deftly painted a picture of a negatively Utopian and morally ambiguous future  where consensual homicide is endorsed by the powers that be and is just an operator assisted phone call away  Reading 2 B R 0 2 B  I was afforded a taste of Vonnegut s immense talent as a satirical  absurdist science fiction writer  a brief yet rewarding glimpse at his aptitude for dark comedy and socio political commentary  which I later rediscovered in its most potent form while reading his most celebrated novel   Slaughterhouse 5   whose main narrative begins thusly  LISTEN BILLY PILGRIM has come unstuck in time Billy has gone to sleep a senile widower and awakened on his wedding day  He has walked through a door in 1955 and come out another one in 1941  He has gone back through that door to find himself in 1963  He has seen his birth and death many times  he says  and pays random visits to all the events in between He says Billy is spastic in time  has not control over where he is going next  and the trips aren t necessarily fun  He is in a constant state of stage fright  he says  because he never knows what part of his life he is going to have to act in next At the center of Slaughterhouse 5 is Billy Pilgrim  easily one of the most unforgettable protagonists in American literature  He was  or claimed that he was  a time traveler  He said he first came  unstuck in time  while serving in an infantry regiment in Europe during the Second World War  As a result  he began living in a nonlinear fashion  he would have erratic flashbacks and flash forwards whereby he  relived  different moments in his life  These moments could be as mundane as having dull conversations with his obese wife during their honeymoon  as poignant as gurgling and cooing while his mother wrapped him  a mere infant  in a towel  as bizarre as making love with a B movie starlet while on display in a zoo in a distant planet called Tralfamadore  home to the fatalistic Tralfamadorians  as crucial as having an assassin s laser gun s crosshairs in the middle of his forehead  and as epoch making as surviving the infamous firestorm of Dresden by taking cover  with other prisoners of war  in the eponymous meat locker It is a high compliment to Mr  Vonnegut that forty years after its publication  I read the novel for the first time  found it stylistically fresh  and surprised myself by finishing it in less than a sidereal day  I knew right then and there that I had just read one of the greatest books of the last century  At the same time  I vowed to name my firstborn after him  Brilliant artists tend to have that effect on me  And in evidence to Mr  Vonnegut s brilliance  I reproduce here my favorite passage from Slaughterhouse 5  a narration of a war movie seen in reverse by Billy Pilgrim American planes  full of holes and wounded men and corpses took off backwards from an airfield in England  Over France  a few German fighter planes flew at them backwards  sucked bullets and shell fragments from some of the planes and crewmen  They did the same for wrecked American bombers on the ground  and those planes flew up backwards to join the formation The formation flew backwards over a German city that was in flames  The bombers opened their bomb bay doors  exerted a miraculous magnetism which shrunk the fires  gathered them into cylindrical steel containers  and lifted the containers into the bellies of the planes  The containers were stored neatly in racks  The Germans below had miraculous devices of their own  which were long steel tubes  They used them to suck more fragments from the crewmen and planes  But there were still a few wounded Americans  though  and some of the bombers were in bad repair  Over France  though  German fighters came up again  made everything and everybody as good as new When the bombers got back to their base  the steel cylinders were taken from the racks and shipped back to the United States of America  where factories were operating night and day  dismantling the cylinders  separating the dangerous contents into minerals  Touchingly  it was mainly women who did this work  The minerals were then shipped to specialists in remote areas  It was their business to put them into the ground  to hide them cleverly  so they would never hurt anybody ever again On that note  as one of Mr  Vonnegut s countless fans I ought to borrow his famous reductive memento mori So it goes   Originally posted here  Wow  You could drive a veritable fleet of side by side trucks through the difference between what I expected from this novel and the utterly satisfying reading experience it provided  I ll admit  years of having dreary WWII era American lit crammed down my throat in K 12 English classes still makes me involuntarily grimace over the idea of picking up yet ANOTHER wartime classic  and it almost made me miss out on both a novel and a writer hugely deserving of their wildly perpetuated acclaim  I was not expecting a time traveling  world jumping  anti war tome that was virtually spilling over with crackling wit and delightfully dry humor  The gratuitous use of understatement    one of my all time favorite literary techniques    only drives the late Vonnegut s point home like a stake through the heart  Using extraterrestrial beings as a method for pointing out the foibles and idiosyncrasies of humanity is just a brilliant move  Looking at something so familiarly intangible  like time or death  as almost physical entities makes the book worth the read for the perspective change alone  Taking it one step further by showing how a man widely considered to be off his nut and making him the lone voice of comforting logic was a pretty fantastic touch  too  This is a quick reading classic that is packed with still relevant musings AND knows how to deliver an all too human message while making sure the reader enjoys every line of the journey  It s been a long time since I wanted to flip immediately back to the first page after finishing a book  and I m really glad that  Slaughterhouse Five  was the book that reminded me of what a great feeling that is  Most of what I ve been enjoying as of late would not be as eagerly received by others  however  this is a book I can t imagine NOT recommending to anyone looking for a book that so perfectly appeals to not only the brain but also the need for a few hearty laughs   And so it goes      Tolkien aside  Vonnegut was my first major literary hero  Cat s Cradle was  by some distance  the best book I was assigned to read in high school  and it isn t even my favorite of his novels  I ve since explored worlds of postmodernism and metafiction as practiced by Vonnegut s comrades in arms  many of whom are a ton less accessible than the ever conversational Kurt  Which is all fine and good  because Pynchon and Barth and Gaddis and Gass are pretty much where I ve been at lately  but I think that  while all these long syntactically complex sentences and huge plots and goofily named characters and massive philosophical implications have their merits  I ve lost touch with the warmth of Vonnegut s voice  I just adore how he uses the postmodern techniques I ve grown to love   the absurd humor  the metafiction  nonlinear narratives  the goofy names  the use of  low  art forms like crude songs and chase scenes   in a way that makes it seem like he s talking right to you  Franzen wants to be your good buddy  but he hasn t a patch on Vonnegut in the intimacy department  He was my default pick for favorite author from 2008 to 2013  when DFW unseated him  and while I don t talk about him as much as I used to  he s still high on my list Slaughterhouse Five is long overdue for a reread  Vonnegut was just as smart as his big book contemporaries  as evidenced by this novel s brilliant use of time  its incisive commentary on war  and the sympathy Vonnegut builds for Billy Pilgrim  who at first just looks ridiculous but reveals himself to be a complex and conflicted and strangely wise character  Don Quixote and Sancho Panza rolled into one  And Vonnegut s prose  Beautiful  elegant  completely underrated   His head was tilted back and his nostrils were flaring  He was like a poet in the Parthenon  is a phrase that has haunted me since I first read this  Pretty much the peak  along with The Sirens of Titan  of high concept sci fi   Ben Roberts gave me this book for my sixteenth birthday  I asked him what it was about and he said it was about World War Two and the bombing of Dresden and an American POW who is abducted by UFO s  But then he added that it was only kind of about those things  about those things but not really  hard to explain  Then he walked off  Anyway  I was definitely interested in WW2 at the time  and sadly  many  many other wars  some even nonfictional  and so that night at 16 when I flipped open the first page of that beat up second hand paper back that I m sure Ben had used to insulate something at one point  I only found a man with a bad attitude rambling about some things and he didn t seem to have a very heroic view of things  I was fanatic about heroics at the time  because I went to private school and didn t understand what that meant  Most of the other kids had no problem with it  because they understood that the first rule of private school  especially a religious one  is to say you believe in things and act as though you believe in things and harshly ridicule those who transgress the things you believe  when in fact you believe in absolutely nothing and take your parents credit card out with you on the weekends  My parents never gave me their credit card and I had a hard time fitting in because I did believe in things  like heroism  and it was years after I graduated before I realized why kids used to stare at me blankly when I talked about heroics and fighting against evil for good  Poor me  I wasn t rich  wasn t good at football  got bored too easily with classes and got kicked out of the drama department for cutting up with the more popular actors than myself  heroics was all I had  So  when I realized that no one was going to get killed  at least not the way I wanted them to  heroically  and that there were no space ships laden with other worldly warriors coming to attack us  I put it down  Probably for Tolkien  Or a Star Wars novel  I sold Ben s second hand copy that he gave me for my birthday years ago  Sorry Ben So  fourteen years and a few days later I opened it back up again  Things had changed  It was a much better book  I was surprised  And very pleased  I know this is one of those books that you re supposed to read in high school  but I didn t because I hated reading because I was afraid I would turn into the kids I went to school with  most of whom would never read a book again after graduating and some who would destroy the parts of their brains that the read was stored in through drug use and some that would die  So it goes  But here today  looking back  I m glad I didn t read it  I m glad I waited till now  But enough about my reading I want to venture to say that this may be one of the tightest books  thematically  elementally  rhetorically  I have ever read  It is poetry in the highest order disguised under Vonnegut s gruff  bar stool vernacular  It s easy enough  if not dangerous  for kids  who can pick up on the book s  and Vonnegut s  bad attitude pretty quickly  But dangerous because the average 17 year old can t possibly understand what this is about  though he could pick up on the basic angst and feel as though he got it  Also  the average high schooler probably wouldn t read this unless he or she was getting class credit  To those who did read this for their own good  I d highly recommend re reading if you haven t already  I think you ll find a lot that you missed the first time around One of the novel s particular strengths is it s voice  It would not be difficult to imagine Vonnegut reciting this story to someone sitting next to him in a bar  the prose is so familiar  so self aware and irreverent  But thematically  it s iconoclasm is another of the novel s strengths  Vonnegut is not vindictive in his assaults on how Americans saw and thought of America and other Americans post war  Like Ben said  it s about those things but not really  It s profound and funny and sad at points  but not really  That s not why you laugh  The novel s broken and a chronological order drive home its elements more fully  and the small details he uses to link everything together add layer upon layer  The greatest strength of the novel  I feel  however  is that Vonnegut doesn t waste a word  Everything is there than needs to be without any excess  and tied together so perfectly  It s breathtaking really  like a matador that so enchants a bull that he can kiss it on the forehead  I cannot praise it enough  There are two ways I can present this review and one is more succinct than the other  The primary narrative of the book revolves around the role of literature in it s examination of war and violence  Immediately you will conclude that this book is quite serious and grave  but it is actually quite funny and maintains a light heartedness that is difficult to accomplish in a war torn setting  The non linear storyline of the novel is a clear representation of Pilgrim s distorted mind and the irreparable mental damage that the war inflicted on his life  However  although the protagonist does suffer a mental breakdown  at no point does the reader believe him to be crazy  With this in mind  it is apparent that we consider Pilgrim s madness as a justifiable reaction to the atrocities he experienced during the war and how war trauma affects the psyche of an individual  There are many subtle techniques that the English literature student in me truly appreciated in this novel with the most obvious being the placement of Vonnegut himself in the story  as well as the book acknowledging it s own role as a book  This is the author ripping us from the comfortable and false reality of the book and tossing us into the real world  The more subtle technique I found were the evasiveness of some of the language where horrific scenes were almost hidden by tame similes and metaphors It is a difficult novel not to enjoy due to it s desirable length and it s supportable message which surely accounts for some of it s huge popularity  Pilgrim is a peculiar character that in one instance is completely separate to our own traits and existence  yet  one cannot help feeling as though only a thin veneer exists between both Pilgrim s and our worlds  A fantastic anti war novel Alternatively  this book is basically how Catch 22 should have been written  Vonnegut   Heller   Reread in October 2011 for Banned Books Week Love this book  Beautifully written so that when you are done  you are presented with an entire image of both a life  Billy Pilgrim s  and a portrait of WWII from Vonnegut s perspective  Simultaneously heartbreaking and ridiculous  ultimately lovely  There IS just something about this book that sets it apart from everything else he wrote  Feels like the perfect consolidation of his voice   Mother Night cut with Sirens  It s got gravity AND alien abductions  Also  love how characters from Rosewater and  Mother Night and Sirens show up  I ve read this book 3 times now but this is the only time I ever caught that  I m dumb  That first chapter especially  If you never get around to reading Slaughterhouse  at least read that first chapter  It s the best first chapter out there  There are those famous first sentences   it was a dark and stormy night    Gregor Samsa awoke to find     Etc    but they should have famous first chapters  and this should be the iconic example of it everyone points to  It s the whole book in 20 or so perfect pages   A satirical fable about the futility of war which is part autobiographical  and which uses sci fi elements as a metaphor  Best read slowly  it is a beautifully crafted book  poignantly written and structurally brilliant  A masterclass in how to play with narrative structure  it reminded me of Tristram Shandy and The Time Travellers Wife  the latter of course written much later  and yet I have read nothing quite like it The narrative circles around the bombing of Dresden with multiple times  perspectives and narrators Vonnegut is able to produce powerful yet simple images on each page  A sentence that encapsulates the novel  You could make an almost random choice from any page it is so well crafted  Try They got up to discover the door was unlocked  True  and false and simultaneously both  Unpick that  I read this book twice in the past  but too long ago to write a proper review  Time for a re read In the interim  peep this analysis from my main man Sparky  In his words   Why anything  Shit just izz cuzz    https   www youtube com watch v JBY9q   poo tee weet  This is such a poignant  moving and thought provoking book and jolts you awake with chaos and

everyone s heard of  How did I ever give this four stars  I really don t remember enjoying this one all that much  so much so that I would have considered keeping it off the assigned reading list were it not the classic  The novel begs readers to question capital  T  Truths  the stories we tell ourselves and the grander societal narratives  and shows the dire consequences of fatalism  I think it also really centers on what I call the essential Vonnegut question  What is the meaning of life  Sadly  in a novel about the bombing of Dresden that answer is nothing  Finally  this one really hit me emotionally  I think Billy Pilgrim is SUCH a tragic character  How on earth did I not fall in love with him on my first reading many years ago  Now I expect 4 7 pages on one of the following topics 1  Does Vonnegut keep his promise to Mary O Hare  How is war portrayed  What is the message here 2  Provide a character analysis of Billy Pilgrim  What makes him tick  What  if anything  does he suffer from  What  if anything  are the symptoms and causes of that  Is he really  unstuck in time   or is this a metaphor for something else  or is he just insane 3  Analyze the role s  of Sight and or Time in the novel  What are the consequences of accepting the different beliefs regarding each  Reread 3 23 15  It s the book I ve reread the most times  Still funny  maddening  heartbreaking  and awesome  Was struck by how politically and economically relevant the book is still today   America is the wealthiest nation on Earth  but its people are mainly poor  and poor Americans are urged to hate themselves     It is in fact a crime for an American to be poor  even though America is a nation of poor  Every other nation has folk traditions of men who were poor but extremely wise and virtuous  and therefore more estimable than anyone with power and gold  No such tales are told by the American poor  They mock themselves and glorify their betters  The meanest eating or drinking establishment  owned by a man who is himself poor  is very likely to have a sign on its wall asking this cruel question   If you re so smart  why ain t you rich   There will also be an American flag no larger than a child s hand  glued to a lollipop stick and flying from the cash register     Americans  like human beings everywhere  believe many things that are obviously untrue  the monograph went on  Their most destructive untruth is that it is very easy for any American to make money  They will not acknowledge how in fact hard money is to come by  and  therefore  those who have no money blame and blame and blame themselves  This inward blame has been a treasure for the rich and powerful  who have had to do less for their poor  publicly and privately  than any other ruling class since  say  Napoleonic times    There isn t any particular relationship between all the messages  except that the author has chosen them carefully  so that  when seen all at once  they produce an image of life that is beautiful and surprising and deep  There is no beginning  no middle  no end  no suspense  no moral  no causes  no effects  What we love in our books are the depths of many marvelous moments seen all at one time  That passage perfectly sums up what kind of an experience the novel is It really moves you as not only a reader but as a human The quality of writing is really beautiful the time shifts are so seamless  giving you the chance to experience someones extraordinary life in such a unique way I particularly loved the repetition of phrases you read in an early passage that is later repeated in a completely different season of his life You truly feel that the passing of time is a circular occurrence There are so many of these irresistibly precious moments where that singular phrase connects two events on opposites sides of his life s spectrum The event s themselves were just as wonderful as the composition Somehow the book isn t terribly depressing despite the uncanny tragedy behind it all Billy has embraced a calm reasoning in the belief that everything that happens in his life and will happen was always meant to be and even if he s miserable now there is another him in a different time who is happy If makes you feel like everything is beautiful and nothing hurts Even when it isn t  even when it does  Conhecia Vonnegut apenas pelo seu lado de ensaio  tendo sido esta a sua primeira obra de ficcao que li  Se tinha gostado da sua capacidade de analise do processo de storytelling  agora percebo porque e tao apurado  Vonnegut demonstra neste pequeno livro  de uma forma totalmente anti convencoes  um dominio magistral na arte de contar historias  Vonnegut leva nos atraves de multiplos espacos e multiplas linhas temporais  sem se preocupar muito com causalidade  verossimilidade ou sustentabilidade  e por isso impressiona ainda mais que a nossa atencao se mantenha sempre ligada  mesmo quando tudo parece estar a ser feito para que nos desprendamos Poderemos dizer desta obra que Vonnegut e um autentico dissimulador narrativo  Tendo uma historia aterradora e autentica para nos relatar   o facto de o proprio autor ter sobrevivido ao  Bombardeamento de Dresden    tudo faz para menosprezar esse facto  para rebaixar a importancia do mesmo  conseguindo dessa forma produzir um discurso contra tonal ainda mais poderoso  Ou seja  quando ele poderia ter usado o facto para produzir uma historia explosiva e arrebatadora  o facto de lhe retirar toda essa componente  surge como um dos mais autenticos discursos anti guerra do seculo XX que poderemos ler E um livro magistral por tudo aquilo que nao diz mas nos leva a entender  I m sure it has been said many times before  This is a kick ass anti war book On the one hand  the author seems to be pleading with all his might in this book for the end of war  destruction  cruelty  revenge  and the horrendous actions people inflict on each other  On the other hand  he turns his back in apathy and chooses to follow the Tralfamadorian way instead  Billy Pilgrim  the character who served in the Dresden war  has supposedly been kidnapped by a flying saucer from Tralfamadore  and he has been learning a few lessons from the Tralfamadorians  who can see in four dimensions  The most important thing I learned on Tralfamadore was that when a person dies he only appears to die  He is still very much alive in the past  so it is very silly for people to cry at his funeral  All moments  past  present  and future  always have existed  always will exist      It is just an illusion we have here on Earth that one moment follows another one  like beads on a string  and that once a moment is gone it is gone forever  When a Tralfamadore sees a corpse  all he thinks is that the dead person is in bad condition in that particular moment  but that the same person is just fine in plenty of other moments  Now  when I myself hear that somebody is dead  I simply shrug and say what the Tralfamadorians say about dead people  which is  So it goes   The book is filled with a good number of  So it goes  examples  Every time there is a mention of death or a corpse or a massacre  the writer simply says so it goes  and so on  and goes on  There are horrific incidents noted  Slaughterhouse Five itself is a one story cement block cube with sliding doors  that had been built as a shelter for pigs about to be butchered  Now it was going to serve as a home away from home for one hundred American prisoners of war   In a letter  it is noted that  British and US bombers killed 135 000 people in the attack on Dresden   and  on the night of March 9th  1945  an air attack on Tokyo by American heavy bombers  using incendiary and high explosive bombs  caused the death of 83 793 people  The atom bomb dropped on Hiroshima killed 71 379 people   So it goes As noted  there is the mention and description and realization that this is serious stuff going on  those soldiers are babies  and there is a  Children s Crusade  going on  On the other   so it goes   This is the cyclical tone of the book  which is present in the introduction itself when the author expresses his desire to write an anti war book  an act that is considered naive   An anti war book    Why don t you write an anti glacier book instead   What he meant  of course  was that there would always be wars  that they were as easy to stop as glaciers  I believe that  too  And even if wars didn t keep coming like glaciers  there would still be plain old death   As a writer  Vonnegut does not stick to rules  He turns and moves about images and information almost like in a vertigo  Like someone shifting from one moment in time and jumping into another memory  This brings attention to how imagination is shaped from lapses of memory and strong moments in time  Another strong theme is basically the same one noted above  about the strong urge to have to stop war vs  the apathy and lack of free will towards war  And the Tralfamodarians want us to be exactly that  devoid of free will  and doubtful even about the concept of free will  The Tralfamadorian says   I ve visited thirty one inhabited planets in the universe  and I have studied reports on one hundred more  Only on Earth is there any talk of free will  In other words  what Kurt does is that he puts in all of the ingredients for a full blown nightmare of sorts  corpses   a  children s crusade    the slaughterhouse five   injured horses   men dying left and right    And then he notes  so it goes   as if urging us to realize that this cannot possibly be OK  and questioning our ability to sleep at night knowing of such atrocities  as well as questioning our justification of war by choosing to resort to the reasonings of extraterrestrial creatures that make absolutely no sense  rather than deal with reality or believe in the concept of free will   The Population Reference Bureau predicts that the world s population will double to 7 000 000 000 before the year 2000   I suppose they will all want dignity   I said   I suppose   said O Hare  How can each individual possibly expect dignity  This seems to provoke the inherent answer of  well  shouldn t we all want dignity   Billy  who had witnessed the terrible war  instead of talking about his experiences  would rather be on radio or TV to talk about the things Tralfamadrions taught him  Note  From the books by Trout  the sci fi books in this book that the idea of Tralfamadore is inspired from   there are a few references to Christianity which were also interesting to note  in terms of the justification of war and killing  The first example was about a man who built a time machine so he could go back and see Jesus   It worked  and he saw Jesus when Jesus was only twelve years old  Jesus was learning the carpentry trade from his father  Two Roman soldiers came into the shop with a mechanical drawing on papyrus of a device they wanted built by sunrise the next morning  It was a cross to be used in the execution of a rabble rouser  Jesus and his father built it  They were glad to have the work  And the rabble rouser was executed on it  So it goes  The other is about a visitor from outer space   who made a serious study about Christianity  to learn  if he could  why Christians found it so easy to be cruel  He concluded that at least part of the trouble was slipshod storytelling in the New Testament  He supposed that the intent of the Gospels was to teach people  among other things  to be merciful  even to the lowest of the low  But the Gospels actually taught this  Before you kill somebody  make absolutely sure he isn t well connected   So it goes  The flaw in the Christ stories  said the visitor from outer space  was that Christ  who didn t look like much  was actually the Son of the Most Powerful Being in the Universe  Readers understood that  so  when they came to the crucifixion  they naturally thought  and Rosewater read out loud again  Oh  boy they sure picked the wrong guy to lynch that time And that thought had a brother   There are  right people to lynch   Who  People not well connected  So it goes   This was an endlessly gripping  amazingly intelligent and deeply fascinating read that took me only a couple of hours to finish  so engrossed was I with it s absurd humor and poignancy  The book follows Billy Pilgrim s life  in a non linear narrative that jumps to different moments of his life as he jumps onto them himself  for Billy is a time traveler  and this plot device which could have been artificial  ends up being absolutely delightful and in fact comments on the arbitrariness of time  its unrealness  how life can be seen  perhaps  more as a collection of moments that we can revisit  than a journey with an end  Billy s naivete  his listlessness as Vonnegut himself describes many of his  non characters  is shocking in its depiction of how little freewill he seems to have  sometimes justified by the Trafalmadorean  the curious extraterrestrials that abduct Billy at one point  principles of the timeless nature of life  or can also be seen as an acute commentary on the powerlessness of the common soldier during war time I could go on and on about the different aspects that captured my imagination and gave me such an amazing reading experience  but I d rather let it linger wordlessly in my mind until I revisit it again  perhaps during a time traveling experience  or in dreams  or in my memory  So it goes  This is one of those books that you either love or hate  I loved it  I took my time and read it slow and I loved it  Slaughterhouse Five is the author trying to come to terms with his experiences with war  It is vivid and personal  The main plot is about Billy Pilgrim who has become unstuck in time  time traveling between his experiences before war  during the war  and after war  It describes how war affects humans  how difficult and surreal it is trying to fit in back to a normal life after war  how someone can possibly start questioning free will after being structured and trapped into a moment as inevitable as a bombing of an entire city  So it goes  Just wow  Beautiful  On a side note  some of my favorite quotations are below  I found a lot of people have tattooed  So it goes   and  Everything was beautiful  and nothing hurt   I think I m done with tattoos but these lines are probably going into my epitaph   It s so short and jumbled and jangled because there is nothing intelligent to say about a massacre   Well  here we are  Mr  Pilgrim  trapped in the amber of this moment  There is no why   So they were trying to re invent themselves and their universe  Science fiction was a big help   There are almost no characters in this story  and almost no dramatic confrontations  because most of the people in it are so sick and so much the listless playthings of enormous forces  One of the main effects of war  after all  is that people are discouraged from being characters   Everything was beautiful  and nothing hurt   I don t have a lot to say about this book  or maybe I have a whole lot to say  and don t quite know how to say it   but I m going to settle for saying that it s wonderful in a quiet and surprising sort of way  I think it s really set apart by two things  The first is that it has a really deep rooted sense of empathy in it  I think it s easy for stories about war to become nihilistic  ironic  and detached  And honestly  all those words can be used to describe Slaughterhouse Five  but there s also a pervasive sense of compassion underlying everything that keeps its tone from ever feeling snide  I really liked that  The other thing is its use of detail  I m honestly not usually a fan of minimalist writing  I long my sentences long and rambling  thanks   but Vonnegut s style was fantastic for me because he has really illuminating ideas set up with precisely the right details  so that any additional information would feel a bit like overkill or hand holding  And  as this is a book involving time travel  he presents the information in just the right order I d definitely recommend it  It s funny  sad  and thought provoking  and it presents all its ideas in just the right way  I have read this book three times and loved it every time I love it because it is brief  The language and sentences are brief  The stories are summarized  I love that Kurt Vonnegut wrote in this book that it has very few characters and little conflict  but I like that too  I love how the book itself is almost a character  and aside from Billy  not many people in the story are developed I love how the book deals with sad and terrifying things without causing me to get depressed or terrified  I think I have cried over this book every time  but never for long  and never without some feeling of hope I just love this book  I love how the story is so complete  but not linear  Without the whole book  it isn t as good  but somehow  as I am reading  I don t miss the parts I haven t read yet  It is only as they unfold that I understand how important they are to everything that came before them Having read several other books by Kurt Vonnegut  I also like how characters reappear in multiple novels  This book was my first introduction to Kilgore Trout  but the second time I read it I had several more of his stories in my mind  and this time around I was pleasantly surprised to run into Elliot Rosewater again I recommend this book to everyone  It has a bit of adult content  but in my mind I had made it out to be a lot more than it really is  I guess this book isn t for everyone  but if you think you can handle it  it is worth it   It is so short and jumbled and jangled  Sam  because there is nothing intelligent to say about a massacre  Everybody is supposed to be dead  to never say anything or want anything ever again  Everything is supposed to be very quiet after a massacre  and it always is  except for the birds  And what do the birds say  All there is to say about a massacre  things like  Poo tee weet  People keep saying that this is the story of Billy Pilgrim  World War II veteran  optrometrist and time traveller  I wish they wouldn t do that  because that is not true  This book is about TRYING to write about the unspeakable horrors of war  in this case  the Dresden bombing  and discovering that you simply cannot  It is about how when a mind is trying to draw on suppressed terrors  will constantly be diverted to other more manageable things like stupid insignificant moments of life   Slaughterhouse 5  is a story about failing to write about Dresden  Anyone knows that in order to write about something  one must first make sense of it  Yet the problem with wars is that almost all of them are pretty senseless  It is a proven fact that after a certain point  nobody really knows what is going on anymore  Vonnegut underlines this  and points out how this is true of every other bombing in world history including that of Hiroshima   Slaughterhouse 5  is about the madness of war and how those touched by it eventually turn to that madness for comfort  As Vonnegut put it  there are no actual characters in the story  Fine  we have Pilgrim and his comrades Roland Weary  Paul Lazzaro and poor Edgar Derby  a school teacher who was eventually executed for stealing a teapot  We also porn actress Montana Wildhack and the reclusive science fiction writer Kilgore Trout  But it is true  there are no characters  Because the only star of the show should be the EVENT  whose gaping absence  in this case  could also be a presence of such  Because a writer s only chance of getting near such an event is to talk around it  through populating it  Which is why we have characters like Pilgrim  who are not actually meant to be there  but have to be  because  ironically  his presence provides the closest  most comfortable focal point for our eyes to rest on  Any closer  and it might all be a bit too much   Lot s wife  of course  was told not to look back where all those people and their homes had been  But she did look back  and I love her for that  because it was so human  So she was turned into a pillar of salt  So it goes People aren t supposed to look back  I m certainly not going to do it anymore I ve finished my war book now  The next one I write is going to be fun  This one s a failure  and had to be  since it was written by a pillar of salt  Time is a flexible thing in Vonnegut s world  one can be dying one minute and be born the next  only to die again  Vonnegut shows us the big events in life  The ones that jar our conscience and even our sanity  But what about the little bombs that are peppered along the path of life  Every laughable  silly character in this book has a ticking bomb of their own  Some of them are bombs in their own right who trigger other bombs  It is how all these events play out that make  Slaughterhouse 5  such an enjoyable and deeply resonant book  If you re looking for a read that explores BIG themes  like birth  sex  death  war  humanity and the meaning of life then don t bother reading this  You will be disappointed  However  if you are looking for a short  concise novella who right from the start understands the futility of such an undertaking and humbly admits as much  then this is for you  And who knows  I mean  you might actually arrive at a better understanding of those big themes through this scrawny little book  Like I did  And start to pay a little more attention to bird song  Especially ones that go  Poo tee weet  Because when put into perspective  even birdsong makes more sense than the bloodlust of humanity  Or so it goes   Madre mia Por aqui hay resenas muy extremas  la mayoria referentes a un estilo cansino  arrastrado  Y tienen razon  pero parecen no darse cuenta de que es un efecto deliberado en un libro oscuro  untuoso como el tizne del carbon  Todo en este libro es deliberado  el desolador efecto de la ciencia ficcion  una pieza fundamental y en realidad solo una anecdota  la desesperanza y la desgracia  que estan de costado a un humor negrisimo  la perspectiva  la de un protagonista privilegiado que todo lo vive desde fuera y que  pudiendo elegir  gira sin remedio sobre los momentos terribles porque es debil  Y los muertos  tantos muertos que pasan como una palabra mas  con unas muertes que de tanto acumularse son ridiculas  pero tan verosimiles que ninguna pierde significado  Y por lo que he leido  quienes critican el libro  critican justo esto  Pues  con perdon  no han entendido nada  Hay quien dice que es el peor libro de Vonnegut  No saben que alegria me dan y que altisima expectativa me crean   Well  here we are  Mr  Pilgrim  trapped in the amber of this moment  There is no why   Fatalism is commonly referred to as  the doctrine that all events are subject to fate or inevitable predetermination  I have always heard of this book and have avoided it because I thought it would be boring and political  I couldn t have been more wrong  It speaks volumes politically  yes  and is a first hand account of war from an American POW in Germany  the bombing of Dresden in WWII to be exact   However  the mechanism of story telling  via one man s ability to jump through time and visit different parts of his life  war  marriage  death  as well as recounting being abducted by aliens  is ingeniuous  casual  funny  philosphical and tragic all at once  War  Why do we insist on fighting  Will we ever evolve to a point where we can resolve conflicts peacefully  It s a pointless debate claims Mr  Vonnegut  Life happens  people die   we re powerless to change it  and it s silly to fight it  the forces that work against us   and the battles   Life  death  war   they re tragic  and as absurd as being taken by aliens yet  inevitable  I m on the homestretch with this one  Call it a reread if you would like  Originally  I listened to this on audio book a few years back with Ethan Hawk as narrator  and to be brutally honest to poor Ethan  his reading really detracted from the harsh beauty of this novel  I didn t know much about Vonnegut before listening to it and felt that it was a good idea to read it though without the vocal distraction  Boy  am I glad I did  The time traveling Tralfamadorians world view is so distinct and wonderful  and yet at other times completely mind bending  Combining the historic war accounts with that make this very versatile  and I love when Vonnegut frequently breaks the fourth wall down to remind you that  MOST of this is true What could I end this review with that would be more apropos than  so it goes Edit  I m finished now  SH5 ended the way that it always would ve and will always continue to  Po tee weet   Dopo un massacro tutto dovrebbe tacere  e infatti tutto tace  sempre  tranne gli uccelli  Questo non e solo uno dei piu importanti libri contro la guerra  questo e un capolavoro  un cult  un libro che dovrebbe essere inserito fra le letture scolastiche dei ragazzi e non solo per il messaggio che porta con se  ma anche per l originalita della costruzione  stralunato  schizofrenico  irriverente  ironico  fantastico  Billy Pilgrim rapito dagli alieni del pianeta Tralfamadore  scopre che   non c e principio  parte di mezzo o fine  non c e suspance  ne morale  ne cause ed effetti   egli viaggia nel tempo avanti e indietro  svolgendo e riavvolgendo il nastro dei suoi terribili ricordi  sapendo che non c e nessun perche  ogni momento semplicemente e  e che cosi va la vita   http   youtu be ztppE9DKhHE  Oh  Vonnegut  you clever bastard  How did you construct a novel with such a complex plot  such recondite themes and tremendous artistry  using such simple prose  Time collapses and unfolds  the reader gets endings before beginnings  the message is fateful and looming  and the vocabulary level is appropriate for middle schoolers  You got to love a writer who can do that Vonnegut understands the nature of comedy like few others  Comedy is just tragedy from a distance  tragedy from a certain perspective  The novel sparkles with humor  and the reader is left with a pit in his stomach  A gnawing  gaping feeling that clutches your insides  and spreads through your mind like a weed  And here I just wanted a quick laugh  Vonnegut s astounding view of seeing life as a frequent travelling in an endless time continuum  intertwined with apathetic war memoirs bring about a terrible war novel  In stead of being a war novel  it frequently comes back to the themes immorality of life and at the same time meaninglessness of life  Indeed as we look back to the history  we  or being more truthfully  humans  never lived or died or  forever lived or died  And the pattern will repeat itself through time and again  It follows from here that only time lives and all others including we mortals are just the rooks of a chess set  behaving in the pattern which time requires A splendid read  I can t really do this book justice with a review  It s a humorous account of a man unstuck in time  It s also a heavy account of the firebombing of Dresden  The one kept leading back to the other and back again and you feel bad for laughing at the absurdities of war while on the same page a man finds himself in an alien zoo  I think this book is fantastic and I recommend you read if if you haven t already  4 5Kurt Vonnegut was a POW in Dresden during World War II  He only survived the allies  bombing of Dresden because the Germans housed the American prisoners in a meat locker in a building they called Slaughterhouse Five  For years afterward  Vonnegut attempted to write a book about his experiences  and in 1969 he eventually produced Slaughterhouse Five  a fictional biography of one of his fellow soldiers who he calls Billy Pilgrim  In the first chapter of Slaughterhouse Five  Kurt Vonnegut explains that his     Read More  http

The telling of his story is more anti stupidity than anti war  if anything  I do question it s significance as a literary cornerstone but found it very enjoyable nonetheless  I m not sure I can even

mozhe bi nai vazhnite knigi  koito triabva da prochetete predi da umrete Taka e to  E  un romanzo ricco di umanita  di pietas  raccontato in un linguaggio piano e semplice ma la cui linea temporale non procede rettilinea  che affronta il tema della follia dell uomo  declinato in questo caso dall insensatezza della guerra e dalla spirale di violenza senza fine che con essa si mette in moto e che produce azioni sconsiderate per crudelta e violenza  incomprensibili e incredibili come potrebbe essere incredibile venire rapiti dagli alieni e passare del tempo esposti in uno zoo su un altro pianeta  o acquisire la capacita di vedere e vivere tutto il tempo come un unicum eterno  fisso davanti a noi dall inizio alla fine  potendo saltare a piacimento da un momeno all altro della nostra vita  scegliendo magari i momenti migliori  consapevoli anche del momento e della modalita della nostra morte e come essa sia solo un ronzio viola dove non c e niente  neanche noi  ma anch essa  ovviamente  e solo un momento dal quale saltare via verso un altro momento  come in un romanzo di Kilgore Trout  sapere insomma  tristemente  che cosi va la vita e che non si puo cambiare  perche ogni momento e gia stato  e  e sempre cosi sara  all infinito  This won t be for everybody  If you like a straight  linear narrative  then you may not enjoy this book  This book plays with the idea of disjointed time  perhaps echoing the way that a traumatic event rebounds throughout a person s life  constantly dragging them back to the past when they least expect it  At its heart  it s an anti war book  The ludicrous Billy Pilgrim is everyman thrown into the barbarities of war  Life is fragile and ridiculous and untimely deaths stalk the pages  As Vonnegut might say   So it goes  Be prepared to suspend your disbelief and follow Billy through a life lived in disjointed episodes  played out in no particular order  Stick with it  It s a short read and it is a satisfying story because each episode takes us forward I think Vonnegut carries the whole thing off superbly and there are images here that will stay with me for years to come  War is never glamorous or exciting   it s brutal and filthy and mundane  and through it all  ordinary men  women and children plod wearily onward with heavy hearts  empty bellies  and broken shoes  And sometimes  they re burned alive  Billy  Billy  Billy  Were you actually insane  Were you actually in Tralfamadore  Were you actually  unstuck in time  Is Billy an immature man boy too tormented by war to face the reality of death  Is that why he comes up with a fourth dimension where death doesn t actually exist  This childlike man is the perfect narrator for The Children s Crusade   There is nothing intelligent to say about a massacre   As Vonnegut says   There are almost no characters in this story  and almost no dramatic confrontations  because most of the people in it are so sick  and so much the listless playthings of enormous forces  One of the main effects of war  after all  is that people are discouraged from being characters  What can possibly be said of this novel that hasn t been said before  I return to Vonnegut for both his elegant economy of language and his profound humaneness  Here he introduces the reader to Billy Pilgrim  who seemingly has become  unstuck in time  after he is abducted by aliens from the planet Tralfamadore  We follow Pilgrim in a not so linear path through the eras of his life  both real and perhaps imagined  but the novel concentrates on Pilgrim s  and Vonnegut s  terrible experience as a prisoner of war in World War II who witnesses his own country s firebombing of Dresden This is a classic for a reason  It s worth multiple readings  its about  a second world war american soldier survived the war   witnessed the destruction city Dresdan  Germany  most controversial bombing by Allied forces as its not a military based city   he was kidnapped by a alien species  kept in a zoo in their planet he went to past regularly through Time Travel Most of all Kurt Vonnegut s witty style of writing made this book worth reading  I read this book as a teenager and was stunned to find someone writing in my own language  I hadn t known it was possible  Re reading it now  decades later  I still love it  There is so much in here that is interesting  impressive  passionate and meaningful  I read today where a contemporary writer said that originality is overrated  I could not disagree more  This book is exhibit A  Possibly the best anti war novel ever written  So it goes  Sl jns   Everything was beautiful and nothing hurt   How could I review this masterpiece of a book which attempts the impossible  to tell the tale of a horrendous massacre  the bombing of Dresden   Poo tee weet    that is probably all I should be saying Vonnegut tries and tries desperately to make the thought of so many unnecessary deaths bearable  Through Billy Pilgrim he escapes to Trafalmadore  where past present and future all exist at the same time   making all moments permanent and death meaningless  Now  when I myself hear that somebody is dead  I simply shrug and say what the Tralfamadorians say about dead people  which is  so it goes   A beautiful  beautiful satirical novel  absolute must read to everyone  I cannot wait to visit Dresden and Slaughterhouse 5 in a couple weeks  So it goes  I regret giving out 5 stars so often because I d really like this one to stand out  I wish there was a 6 star rating I think I might revise all my previous book ratings and employ a bit harsher criteria Or why bother  This book hit me like a truck  I ll die either way  So it goes  A couple of chance events led me to reread Slaughterhouse Five over the summer  and I m grateful that I did  despite the fact that it served as a fine reminder of how porous my memory is  Yes  the book is effectively about the firebombing of Dresden in World War II  That s generally the ten cent summary  and in fact  that s how the book introduces itself  And that s kind of how I remembered it  although there s the weird science fiction element that lingers in the brain  But the reason why a good book is worth reading is not because you ll get to see how it ends  but you ll get to see how it unfolds  Vonnegut s clear writing and still fresh approach are well worth multiple visits Like the movie  Jaws   a horror movie where you barely ever see the shark  you barely get any actual account of Dresden  And you see little actual warlike activity  In fact  the horror is not really the fire bombing of a beautiful European city  Billy Pilgrim was a broken person well before his wartime experience  He was already emotionally isolated and powerless  And he already found life meaningless  The war simply compounded and hastened those experiences  Clausewitz described war as the continuation of politics by other means  In essence  Vonnegut is describing war here as an exaggerated extension of society    war as the breakdown of society by other means The science fiction element is introduced as a philosophical counterpoint to Billy Pilgrim s grim reality  On Tralfamadore  Billy created a space where he is the center of positive attention  On Earth  the only attention he ever received was negative  On Tralfamadore  Billy was in control  He knew how to handle situations  He was accepted and loved by Montana  His only meaningful relationship was this imaginary one  On earth  he simply re experiences the traumatic events of the war over and over again  being  spastic in time    and he is unable to find or maintain an emotional connection to any living person Ultimately  this book is as much about mental illness as it is about the crippling effects of war  But it also deserves its reputation as an antiwar treatise I ll close by saying that I normally don t revisit books  mainly because life is short and there are far too many good books to read  But clearly it s a good thing to revisit the classics  especially if  as time marches on  you only retain the most basic recollection of its contents  A near perfect example of semi autobiographical  semi apocryphal  semi fantastic historical fiction  set in and around World War II  Slaughterhouse Five veers enjoyably into comedy and science fiction  and is a great example of non linear narrative   I took a bit getting into this but I ended up loving it  I feel rather sad  now that I ve finally finished  For me  the ideas in books do not get much better than this  Deceptively simple is an excellent description for this story and Vonnegut s style  Works on so many levels  inventive science fiction  philosophy  war memoir  social history  and comedy  It inspired me to check out many other Kurt Vonnegut books    Sirens of Titan    Bluebeard  and  Breakfast of Champions  being amongst the best  I ve just reread Kurt Vonnegut s  Slaughterhouse Five   I read it the first time during the  70s as part of a university course on war literature  It s amazing how much better it was this time around  Vonnegut takes the concept of time travel to new levels  na perigrapheis te megalutere phrikaleoteta kai tis sunepeies autes se prosopiko epipedo se tesseris diastaseis  To ergo auto den einai sci fi  einai exophrenika paralogo eno ten idia ora einai apolutos logiko kai sunepes  Etsi paei  A great  rollicking  tragicomic read written by the venerably sardonic Mr Vonnegut  This is a great introduction to his ouevre  and certainly a more welcoming read than the confusing  Cat s Cradle   The book tells the oldest story in the world  man s inhumanity to man and the concrete ridiculousness of war itself  in whimsical postmodern fashion  through a clearly disturbed protagonist called Billy Pilgrim  who seems strange passive and offers no opinions on the carnage around him and perpetrated on him  Instead  his trauma is manifested in schizophrenic hallucinations and memory warps  which take him either to the scene of the carnage itself in flashback mode  or to an imaginary other dimension populated by time travelling  or should we say time  encompassing   aliens known as  Tralfamadorians   All throughout  Vonnegut s smart aleck descriptions of Billy s fellow soldiers  the opposing Germans  Bily Pilgrim s staid postwar life as an optometrist  all the while hiding increasingly unsuccessfully his trauma    these are all delivered straight faced and with rich wit  I was truly entertained particularly by Billy Pilgrim s wartime  friends   Wit aside  this is also a deeply humane book  It functions as a great introduction to Vonnegut s work because I think it marries two of his key concerns as a writer  Firstly  the absurdity of the human predicament  made even more absurd by man s evil to man  Secondly  a sincere belief that nothing is so bad that a funny turn of phrase cannot conquer   Slaughterhouse Five  manages to marry both to a perfect blend  and ends up offering a surprisingly moving treatment of the absurdity of war In my opinion  it s more akin to Salinger s  To Esme  short story than it is to  Catch 22  at least in tone and focus of impact   I very much enjoyed this book  The way in which it is written   without a specific timeline or progression   is like nothing I have ever read before  It is a testament to Vonnegut s strength as an author that the storyline and deeper meaning is still coherent despite the non chronological order of the narrative  The book itself is proof of the author s argument that real meaning comes from the entirety that moments create  rather than the moments themselves  Vonnegut also introduces a technique that was revolutionary at the time  the use of the unreliable narrator  Due to Billy s distance from reality  the author leaves it up to the reader to decide what is true and what is simply happening inside Billy s head  The validity of the Tralfamadorians is never proved  and the question of whether they were simply made up in Billy s head  as a way to cope with what he had experienced in the war is never answered  This is a distinctly postmodern technique  as it leaves it up to the reader to decide whether or not to believe everything that happens in the story  This is a thought provoking  brave decision on the part of the author  Up until this point  what was written was always expected to be accepted by the reader as the truth in the story  By discrediting this assumption  Vonnegut diminishes the importance of  truth  in favor of narrative and the content itself  The biggest question that I am left with is  did Vonnegut truly succeed in creating an  anti war  book as he had promised Mrs  O Hare  Again  I believe the author takes a postmodern view of this predicament  He  along with his characters  realize that there is no possible way the bombing of Dresden can be dealt with on a moral level  Therefore  he simply avoids the question altogether  His goal was to write a scathing expose  chronicling the horrors that occurred in the German city  However  he himself even says   This  book  is a failure  and it had to be  since it was written by a pillar of salt    Page 22  He accepts the fact that he will never be able to truly capture the emotion and terrors of Dresden  so he simply decides to accept what happened   So it goes   There are plenty  but one of my favorite passages   The visitor from outer space made a serious study of Christianity  to learn  if he could  why Christians found it so easy to be cruel  He concluded that at least part of the trouble was slipshod storytelling in the New Testament  He supposed that the intent of the Gospels was to teach people  among other things  to be merciful  even to the lowest of the low But the Gospels actually taught this Before you kill somebody  make absolutely sure he isn t well connected  So it goes The flaw in the Christ stories  said the visitor from outer space  was that Christ  who didn t look like much  was actually the Son of the Most Powerful Being in the Universe  Readers understood that  so  when they came to the crucifixion  they naturally thought  and Rosewater read out loud again Oh  boy they sure picked the wrong guy to lynch that time And that thought had a brother   There are right people to lynch   Who  People not well connected  So it goes  Eventually I have got round to this after leaving it for several years I my tbr pile  I was always confident that I would enjoy it  ap but it exceeded my expectations  The book is about the war of an anti hero  Billy Pilgrim  Although really  as Vonnegut describes in the first chapter  it is about the bombing of Dresden  Incredibly there is humour amongst the pages  comical characters and farcical situations  As the book continues it gets gradually more serious  and we know where it s headed from the author s prologue  The strength of the novel lies in Vonnegut s writing though  It is a classic of course  and needs to be that compulsory reading list   If all this  more or less did happen  Kurt  I cannot conceive of it  I lie down on the floor and breathe  just to make sure the surface under me is real   Slaughterhouse 5 is satirical version of authors experience in World War II  centered primarily on the Dresden firebombing which wiped out the entire city centre  Narrated through the life of a disoriented and ill trained assistant to chaplain named Billy Pilgrim  since his unfortunate incarceration by Germans to the bombing day and its aftermath  author uses nonlinear narration to steer the story forwards  using satire dark humor to explain the devastation and absurdity of war  and uses his early Sci Fi writing skills to explain the fatalistic nature of it  It is something beyond the spell of ordinary writers to see the potency of using two dissimilar categories of writing  to tell a story of war  I might think it s a catalyst for disaster  but in hands of Kurt its creation of history  War is fought by babies  a children s crusade  but Billy who traversed the entire book referred as child ill trained  innocent war not ready or likely  to be kind of guy  who emerges as the enlightened one  who quite early learns the trade of avoiding the frenetic nature of war with his ability to time travel  and sulk in unknown world  there by remaining blind eyed to the surrounding madness  It s a profound way to describe a war  with absence of all the hormones thumping actions and devastation  trying to glorifying the war  the machines and the trigger happy action junkies with uniforms and guns  Just like Billy  author has surrendered to the insanity of war  and he is powerless to do anything about it   God  grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change The courage to change the things I can And the wisdom to know the difference  It s also remarkable where in author  refuses to judge anyone involved in war  no blames are passed  no questions are asked  no one held responsible  Is just how the war is  we will continue to do what we do to each other  There were deaths  there are deaths  there will be deaths and so it will go on I highly recommend this book  irrespective of what genre you like I will also recommend the Israeli animated movie   Waltz with Bashir  which shares a striking similarity to this book  About a soldier in search of his lost memories of his experience in Lebanon war  Often times it s even referred as Israeli Slaughterhouse  Yeah it doesn t have that bling of World War  but hey war is war  there are deaths  desolation and birds which will have its say  Poo tee weet  Brilliant writing  Personally I think it was a great move to weave science fiction elements with his own personal experiences of WWII  The horror and meaningless isn t lost  but I found it really insightful for a war story  There is no sense of the grand drama and the often theatrical tone taken with war  the approach and opinion is novel  It acknowledges how fucked up it is  but admits and accepts that this is who we are  Seems nihilistic  but personally feels closer to zen  This is as life is  Good moments  bad moments  I love the way it deals with time and life  that even though we die in one moment we are alive in all others  Will definitely have to reread  Brilliant writing  This book is of course essential reading  no matter what language you choose to experience it in  One of the best books I have ever set my peepers on  and I ve set my peeper on over like ten books Funny  tragic  biting  thought provoking I thought this book was a wonderful read  Perche non state ancora leggendo Vonnegut  Must read Vonnegut  Re read  For the second year in a row I have re read a personal favourite  Prior to last year  I was always a one and done type  I always wanted to tackle something new and fresh  Books are more of an investment than film  I can re watch a movie in two hours  Re reading a book takes longer Now  Slaughterhouse five could be read in an afternoon but I just dilly dallied my way through it   plus  a new subscription to the New Yorker has diverted my reading attention away from novels recently  It was  however  an illuminating read  I remembered only vague moments from the book    Take a flying fuck at a rolling donut     All of this is true  more or less    Billy Pilgrim became unstuck in time    So it goes  and so on  The depth  playfulness combined with somberness and the absurdity that plays out as perfectly believable are astounding  It s incredibly concise  beautiful  silly and thought provoking  It doesn t glorify war  it ridicules it and human s history of seeming need to engage in bloody conflict  Probably because it was my first Vonnegut  I was pleased to see the references to other works this time around  I was aware Kilgore Trout was a mainstay shortly after I first read it  but to see Eliot Rosewater   God Bless You Mr  Rosewater   and the name Rumfoord   Sirens of Titan   maybe others   was really something  Everyone should read this  Hell  everyone should read this twice   So it goes  Billy Pilgrim is a war veteran  an optometrist  a time traveler  an alien zoo attraction  He was present at the fire bombings of Dresden in 1945 and this is his reflection on his fractured life  centering on this particular moment  Vonnegut himself was a prisoner of war who saw the destruction of Dresden and this story feels almost autobiographical in the sense of how this book looks at the war and the bombings in particular  It is the smartest and wittiest anti war anti bombing piece of literature I am yet to read  At first this book almost doesn t make sense  It takes a second to get accustomed to the time travelling and aliens in among the depictions of the war  Once you let yourself run with it you see that the real point of what Vonnegut is trying to say about the war and about death is revealed most clearly in these parts of the novel  We are simultaneously seeing Billy s experiences in the war and how these would effect him throughout the course of his life  Through the rather outlandish interactions with the Tralfamadorians  the alien race that abducts him  we see an amazing philosophy on life  death and time that forms the most brilliantly simple and poignant motif of the novel   So it goes  following the very mention of death throughout the story  The novel also really centres on the psychological impacts of war as it becomes clearer that the time travelling and the aliens could very possibly be means by which Billy is trying to cope with the horrors that he saw and experienced during his time in the war  As a history student  I actually studied the question of the ethics of the bombing of Dresden and other Allied bombings during the Second World War so in that sense this was especially interesting to me and I thought it genuinely added a lot to the moral and ethical and even philosophical questions about these events  All in all  I thought this book was stunning and it really made me think  I couldn t ask for more from a book   Slakthus 5 ar resultatet av Vonneguts forsok att skriva en bok om andra varldskriget  efter flera decenniers grubblande forsok att skriva nagot som far med alltihop  Slutresultatet ar en bok om Billy Pilgrim som blir krigsfange i Tyskland och sedan overlever bombningen av Dresden  Dessutom sa blir han kidnappad av utomjordingar ett antal ar senare som forklarar for honom att manniskors koncept av tid ar absurd  Allt hander  allt ska handa och allting har alltid hant  Inget hander som inte ska handa   och aven om nagon i dod i ett visst ogonblick sa finns det sa manga andra ogonblick dar han fortfarande lever  Bara for att det ar i vad vi kallar det forflutna sa finns det faktiskt en plats dar de forflutna ar just nu Det ar en lite forvirrande surrealistisk bok dar man inte riktigt vet vad som ar sant eller inte  Vilket ar precis sa det ska vara  Det ar en bok om krig  vald och hur det paverkar manniskor  Det ar utan tvekan en bok om posttraumatisk stress skriven med sa mycket svart humor som mojligt  Ar utomjordingarna som Billy traffar pa verkliga eller ar de bara hans satt att hantera alla de traumatiska upplevelser han gick igenom som ung soldat i ett fruktansvart krig  Det ar suddiga granser och det gar inte att saga vilket som ar den egentliga sanningen i boken  Mojligtvis for att allt ar sanning   i alla fall for Billy Pilgrim Boken ar skrivet pa ett enkelt men berorande satt vilket fungerar bra med tanke pa de amnen som boken tar upp  Jag hade haft en mer tveksam installning om den var skriven som en rysk tegelsten till bok  Som nagon som har upplevt posttraumatisk stress  dock ej pa samma niva eller av liknande orsak  sa kan jag delvis relatera till Billy  Speciellt avsaknaden av synbara kanslor mot sjalva handelsen  Billy ar ratt passiv nar det galler sjalva kriget   han ger ofta uppfattningen att han inte berordes sarskilt mycket av det aven om det ar uppenbart att det ar snarare motsatsen  Det ar utan tvekan en otroligt vacker bok aven om den ar inlindad i humor for att inte gora den for tung   for den tar upp sadana amnen som egentligen ar blytunga  Sattet men ser pa tid och rum pa planeten Tralfamadore var nagot jag defintivt tog at mig snabbt  Det kanns som en filosofi nagon har kommit pa for att forsoka overtala sig sjalv att alla traumatiska upplevelser var tvungna att handa och aven om en kamrat ar dod for stunden sa lever han i manga andra tidsrum  Det var nog den delen som berorde mig mest i boken  for det ar en vacker men sorglig syn pa livet eftersom det snarare ar en inbillning for att kunna fortsatta att leva  Jag forstar verkligen varfor Slakthus 5 anses vara en av de framsta antikrigsbockerna i var historia  Det ar en bok alla borde lasa atminstone en gang i sitt liv  Apesar de ser um livro que tem uma guerra como tema central  e de nao se furtar a mencionar ou descrever alguns dos horrores dessa guerra  o autor nao se prende ao lado serio e politico da questao  e transporta facilmente o leitor  que desde o inicio ja se encontra certamente preso e maravilhado por seu talento  carisma  estilo e humor  atraves dos altos e baixos da envolvente historia de Billy Pilgrim  E a partir do momento em que Kurt prende voce a historia dele  a essa especie de montanha russa particular  ele faz de voce e das suas emocoes o que bem entende  O coracao aperta  voce se preocupa  se entristece  dai voce relaxa  e jogado para frente e para tras no tempo  alternadamente  num recurso que chega a ser genial e provavelmente inedito na literatura  e nao consegue deixar de dar boas risadas com os sonhos lisergicos e com as experiencias extra terrenas ainda mais lisergicas e insuspeitadas vividas por Billy  Uma das primeiras coisas que me encantaram e deliciaram nesse livro foi a descricao do momento em que Billy assiste a um filme de tras para a frente  Que puta ideia incrivel  E como se o filme passasse ao mesmo tempo na frente dos olhos de Billy e dos nossos proprios olhos  Para mim foi impossivel nao visualizar aquilo e falar  que foda isso  Que escritor criativo e sensacional  O autor ainda nos presenteia aqui e ali com poemas e trechos de musicas inspiradores no estilo  Deus do ceu  do relogio a batida  o dia infeliz  o sorte fodida  Juro que vou tomar isso emprestado do autor em momentos bem oportunos  Risos  Por fim eu me pego perguntando a mim mesma  por que foi mesmo que eu nao li Kurt Vonnegut antes  Nada me resta agora a fazer a nao ser me envergonhar de maneira apropriada e corrigir este terrivel lapso  Minha avaliacao  Tem mesmo como nao dar cinco estrelas  Nao  nao tem  Coisas da vida  I find myself belatedly catching up on a lot of  great literature  these days that I had never even heard of until fairly recently  I dipped a toe into Slaughterhouse 5 a year or so ago and withdrew it hastily thinking I could not go there       I probably sampled the book online  Not the best way to encounter Vonnegut      So the other day I was helping my son with a car boot sale  arranging and re arranging his books in unexpected Bank holiday sunshine  And there was Vonnegut  unnoticed  unremarked by the great British public strolling idly past  keen to offer peanuts for his collection of x box games  There was a lull  coffee from the thermos  I picked up Slaughterhouse five     And the rest  as they say is history      Dresden      Dresden   My long dead brother visited Dresden in 1974  when it was difficult enough to get out of the GDR when you were a bonefide visitor and impossible of course if you were German  Indeed you needed all sorts of passes to get in     He had made friends there  corresponding with them while working as a press telegraphist  and he was determined to visit them  He took them banned pop records with classical labels stuck over the original labels  he brought back postcards  Talked about it s beauty  Visited a classical music shop and returned with a suitcase stuffed with Peters editions of piano sonatas  He died when I was 27  I never got around to asking him what he knew of the history of Dresden  So it goes       That s what I knew of Dresden  Shocking isn t it  Perhaps somewhere in the 30 odd years since then the fact lodged in my brain that Dresden had been bombed as a reprisal for Coventry  But no  nothing else  Words fail me to describe the effect this book has had on me  much like they failed Vonnegut for a long time as he felt the simultaneous need to write about being there  and the imposibility of doing so  There s a powerful scene in the book where Vonnegut s alter ego  Billy Pilgrim  first tells someone that he was in Dresden when it was bombed  He is not believed  even by his own daughter    He s simply echoing things we say   said Rumfoord   Oh   said Lily  Billy afterall has developed his own narrative to deal with his hideous experiences  He frequently talks about being abducted by aliens     So why would anyone believe anything else he says     So it goes    Slaughterhouse Five    Read it  Read it if you want to know the truth about war But if you would rather hang onto a romantic fantasy  Walk on by   first of all let me mention that this book is DEFINITELY amongst the top seven books I ve ever read it s about a man named  Billy Pilgrim  and his life which is divided into several different sections by the use of  Time travelling  element The writer have done this change of times with great sophistication in a way which doesn t leave you confused and unclear about which time you re actually in  the common problem with the Time travelling novels  the next tip is I don t even know which genre includes this novel it s definitely non fiction because it reveals the real story of bombing Dresden  a city in Germany  by the British Royal Air Force and the United States Army Air Forces on World War II but on the contrary it s sci fi either  cause one of the several time shiftings in the book happens in a planet named  Tralfmador  which Billy believes aliens kidnapped him and a female actress  Montana Wildhack  and brought them there to use them for entertaining Tralfmador s inhabitants the other thing about this book is the brilliant use of writer from the phrase  so it goes on  It s been used 106 times throughout the book and it really catches you a few times I ve not read the book in English I ve read it in Persian and it was significantly fluently translated and very easy to read huge huge cheers to A A Bahrami for his masterpiece esque translation Persian readers do owe to such translators he translated the phrase this way  yes that s how life goes on   in Persian  blh rsm rwzgr chnyn st And by comparing the Persian translation of the phrase with the Original one I can say the Persian phrase is even more influencing and heart wrenching it makes you feel the utter pain at times in the book There are some points that you laugh intensely there are some points that you may cry in heart  or even shed tears    there are some points that you get angry amazed and shocked I believe that s what a book is all about to be able to teach something to you and change your feelings and moods and make you learn something new even when you re just reading a novel in your spare time it definitely deserves all the 5 stars and it d get 500 stars if I was about to rate it from 1 500  I do know that I d read it in English someday soon and I can t even wait for that time I ll be reading  a man without a country  from Vonnegut a bit later and I hope I convince myself to read it in English  A beautifully constructed anti war novel showing the meaninglessness of massacres  as senseless as a bird s  poo tee weet  Billy Pilgrim  an optometrist  goes on a  pilgrimage   correcting the  vision  of the readers  view of war through an examination of posttraumatic stress caused by the violence of WW2  Pilgrim ultimately create an alternant POW reality with aliens  Tralfamadorians  which parallels his WW2 experiences well  to cope with what he saw  help himself feel more respected  and ultimately to rid himself of free will and thus moral responsibility for the violence of allied bombings   So it goes  is often used in descriptions of horribly morbid and sad realities to stir up the reader to action  one of the many examples of irony in the work The major themes addressed are the violence of war  free will moral responsibility  and true sight Ironically  the work end up being an example of  Tralfamadorian literature  in that it is told from the Tralfamadorian s perspective of time  Sometimes awarding a book five stars doesn t seem enough  Can I colour them golden or encrust them with diamonds  This is the fourth or fifth time I ve read Vonnegut s classic  and I m not generally one for re reading books  but something about this draws me back again and again and I always find something new to it  more to think about and ponder over  It s a difficult book to describe  a man suffering through war  the futility of it and how it affects him as he flits backwards and forwards through time  There are other reviews here that can do this more justice than I could ever hope to  it s one book that I find so hard to review  to put into words what it means to me  in truth I m only here to proclaim my undying love for it Edited to add some wittering   because this re read has sat with me and been giving me a lot of thought  I ve skimmed through some other reviews and it s fascinating to see different takes on this book  Spoilers will obviously follow  To me  the Tralfalmadorians were not real  this was almost a part of Billy s subconscious    their bleak outlook  that everything is preordained and there s nothing you can do to change anything    reflecting the hopelessness that he felt as a cog in the wheel of a terrible war  He ambled through it aimlessly  could have no bearing on it    and this affected his outlook on the rest of his life  I m pretty sure he s undergoing some sort of post trauma or mental illness in the post war sections   All this happened  more or less   slaughterhouse five it s the kind of book that either you love or hate  there s no in between  Some people complain about the lack of plot and they re right  there s none  and that s the beauty of it  Kurt Vonnegut didn t write a novel about war because there s nothing new to say about war  war is horrible  and Kurt Vonnegut knows it  he was there  As he said   There are no characters in this story and almost no dramatic confrontations  because most of people in it are so sick and so much the listless playthings of enormous forces  One of the main effects of war  after all  is that people are discouraged from being characters   I love this book  I really do  so what if this novel is about a man who travels through time and space  what about it  There s nothing wrong with that  god knows we ve read worse  So what if this book doesn t make sense  what about it  Life doesn t make sense that s the whole point You can quote this book  disagree with it  glorify or vilify it  but don t tell me that this book is shallow or dull because it s not true  What we love in our books are the depths of many marvelous moments seen all at one time   That s all I have to say   So it goes     Reading description of this book on Goodreads one would assume this is yet another science fiction book about alien abduction  but it is so much more  The story mostly takes place in Dresden  Germany where prisoners of war were held  In fact  most of the book deals with humanity s obsession with war where sci fi part deals only as a tool  emphasizing harsh realities and triviality of a war in general  Vonnegut s shift from first person to third person narrative is quite impressive and almost unnoticeable  Even though the story jumps back and forth through main protagonist s life in no particular order  it is fairly easy to keep up with it  Simple sentence structure at times keeps story fluid and interesting while long descriptive parts are engaging and vivid  All in all a very interesting and enjoyable book to read This book marked my first audio book experience  I found this awesome version with Ethan Hawke reading and Vonnegut s take on his book in the end as well  As pleasurable as having somebody else reading a book to you might be  I m pretty certain it has a less impact and evaporates from memory more quickly  Reading can t be replaced  at least in my case   Notes to myselfBoinia nomer piat   ili Krestovyi pokhod detei  Imenno  Krestovyi pokhod detei     Da vy zhe byli togda sovsem det mi     skazala ona    Chto     peresprosil ia

Weird  artsy  psychedelic mix of historical fiction  sci fi  and satire  Because I hate war more than almost anything  I always love any good anti war book  but I especially welcome one that uses World War II as its context  Americans have so romanticized World War II until we are not able to admit that war was hell then  too  Likewise  we are hesitant to apply to World War II Herbert Hoover s words that  Older men declare war  But it is the youth that must fight and die   Most of all  Americans just will not admit that the allied forces could have done anything immoral  if  we  did it  it must have been right  Being anti war means being against all wars  including  perhaps especially  popular wars  and it means speaking accurately about atrocities performed by either side  That s my anti war rant  As for the book  a young American man both time travels within his own life  and visits another planet  one that has no war  The seminal events of his own life on Earth happened to him as a young soldier taken as a POW by the German military  climaxing with his witnessing of the fire bombing of Dresden  scorched Earth total war against the entire population of a city  This is exactly what happened to the novelist himself  in fact  Adult reading  with some stuff that is hard to read about  intentionally so   4 5 Stars Billy saw the war movies backwards then forwards and then it was time to go out into his backyard to meet the flying saucer Billy Pilgrim was a POW in the Second World War  he saw the firebombing of Dresden that killed thousands of innocents  Then he went home  got married set up shop and got kidnapped by Aliens  But because Billy comes unstuck in time instead of experiencing these events chronologically  he flits amongst them  One moment he s in a German POW camp  the next in a zoo on Tralfamador  then back to his sleepy hometown of Illium According to the reviews I ve read of this book people generally see in in one of two ways  as an incandescent  undefinable beacon of post modernist war Literature or as outdated  repetitive and gimmicky  I would definitely describ4e myself as leaning towards the former option By creating a disjointed  interrupted narrative Vonnegurt creates a novel that  though a science fiction medium  explores PSTD and the effect of war on the individual  The Tralfamadorian dismissal of human rights and freedoms is eerily similar to the atrocious experiments conducted by the Nazis during WW11  Vonnegurt also builds a strongly satirical atmosphere  with little cutting comments about consumerism  war and the human condition  Like so many Americans  she was trying to construct a life that made sense from things she found in gift shops  There is so much more I could write about Slaughterhouse 5  Like what an incredible title that is for a start  so violent  so suggestive  so metaphoric  In short this novel is very impressive  I usually hate anything remotely sci fi esque  I couldn t even really enjoy Fahrenheit 451  despite how elegantly it spoke about censorship  Yet Vonnegurt has got the balance between fantasy and reality perfect  This book is slightly heart breaking  topical  thoughtprovoking discussion of humanity  and the fascination it has  has had and always will have with war   ngr bh bzy grfth dny r  zmn r  jng r  mrdn admh r    blh rsm rwzgr chnyn st     h mHwr

lucrurile Laitmotivul care te va urmari intreaga carte  Te va urmari pe tot parcursul ei asa cum moartea te urmareste toata viata Romanul lui Kurt Vonnegout nu este deloc o excursie usoara si nici placuta  Abatorul 5 este o camera in care s a adapostit autorul  prizonier de razboi fiind  in timp ce orasul Dresda a fost bombardat la 13 februarie 1945  135 000 de oameni au murit in Dresda  Civili nevinovati ucisi la ordinele Aliatilor  Singura lor vina  traiesc in Dresda  Este adevarat ca acesti civili nu au fost gazati si nu au fost facuti sapun  Au fost ucisi uman  prin aruncarea a tone de bombe in capul lor  Nimeni nu a platit pentru aceasta actiune  Nimeni nu s a sinucis   Asa merg lucrurile Kurt Vonnegut se intoarce in timp intr o camera din Marele Abator Dresda  construit prin amabilitatea Fortelor Aliate la 1945 fev Frumosul oras german a fost redus la o zona selenara in cateva ore  Soldatii trebuiau  initial  sa dezgroape cadavrele si sa le ingroape  Dar s au decis sa le incinereze cu aruncatoarele de flacari  Sau cu grenade  Gigantice scrumiere umplute pana la refuz cu mucuri umane   Asa merg lucrurile Romanul lui Kurt Vonnegut este un roman anti razboi scris cu umorul pe care doar stresul post traumatic al soldatilor intorsi de pe front il poate naste  Capacitatea lui Billy Pilgrim de a calatori in timp este o gaselnita la care Vonnegut apeleaza pentru a sublinia conditia soldatului care nu stie ce l asteapta in secunda urmatoare  Oare suieratul acesta violent imi va curma viata  Oare acel punct care vine inspre mine este grenada care ma va sfarteca  Oare pacanitul acesta amenintator trimite gloante catre craniul meu  Billy Pilgrim este pasiv si inert moral si social  Actiunile sale sunt automate Deciziile sale pot fi inscrise si descrise folosind fara greutate un cod binar  Poate ca trafalmadorienii au dreptate cand spun ca toate momentele sunt cum sunt pentru ca asa sunt structurate  iar structurarea lor este foarte bine definita  totul petrecandu se doar asa cum s a decis  De catre cine  Oare asta inseamna ca toti suntem pasibili de mantuire datorita acestor structuri   Captivi in chihlimbarul clipei  sa insemne  de fapt  ca suntem cu toti mumificati  Biete piese ornamentale pe mobilierul unui copil razgaiat  Organisme vidate pastrate in tabernacolul pazitor de legi creatoare de tari si nascatoare de milenare vendete  Dresda din 13 februarie 1945 este o astfel de clipa care a inchis in chihlimbarul ei 135 000 de oameni pe care i a mumificat si ascuns in Muzeul Osuarului Inchinat Cruzimii Umane la sectiunea Antreuri si Alte Feluri Principale din Meniul Razboaielor  Alte milioane de captivi au reusit sa scape nemumificati  dar captivitatea lor nu s a incheiat niciodata  Ba dimpotriva  Cei mai multi transmit aceasta captivitate mai departe urmasilor lor pentru ca nimeni  niciodata  sa nu mai permita ornarea timpului cu momunemente funerare  maiastre edificii arhitectionice comandate de mustaciosi sau cheliosi Abatorul 5 este o carte care trebuie citita si recitita cu fiecare ocazie  Nu doar datorita umorului fin  inteligent si subtil  cat datorita fortei pe care Vonnegut o are si o exprima cu atata talent in aceasta proza emblematica pentru romanul anilor 60  Dincolo de calatoriile in timp si rapirile extraterestre  acest roman este o declaratie ferma  o reflectie profunda care ataca punctual un secol naucit de razboi si ura Un roman scurt si dens despre conditia umana dupa ce aceasta a facut cunostinta cu animalitatea din ea care nu ezita sa iasa la suprafata cand are ocazia   I had been waiting and wanting to read this book for so long  and finally it was given to me as a gift  It has completely lived up to the hype  and i can t believe I waited so long to read it  It is a gripping  gut wrenching story of war  yet told in a distant  emotionless way  Billy so desperately tried to protect his sanity throughout this book by the way he told his stories  He detached himself from the horrors and wrote about them as if it were a horrible fairy tale  At first  the whole alien aspect really confused me  as I didn t understand where it came into play  I now understand it was his escape from the horrors he had seen  i think it started with his time in the mental hospital  It was also quaint  the way he said  So it goes  after each mention of death or someone dying  It was clearly another way of detaching himself  Normally  when books jump around in time  it can confuse me  but the way Vonnegut wrote it was very well done  and it seems a way to deflect slightly from the horrors of war  It was as if he could only handle writing about it a bit at a time  It s a must read for everyone  SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE  I was moved and delighted and fascinated throughout  I thought the ending would pack more emotional punch  But I so enjoyed the ride  I can t really complain too much I just reread Slaughterhouse Five  When I first read the book as a youth  I remember the humor  But now as a grown man and author  I was deeply moved by the gravitas  absurdity  and surrealism  The writing itself is gorgeous and haunting  The chapters were so compelling  I couldn t stop reading  That rarely happens with me SPOILERS I know Vonnegut drops hints that it s not a regular story with character and plot  I think I was expecting some full blown scene between the man who was killed for stealing at teapot  Edgar Derby  instead of the passing reference  Or a scene between Billy Pilgrim and his wife or son  I suppose the closest type of scene like that was between Billy and Rumfoord  as Billy keeps uttering the fact that he was there  he was a prisoner of war  I was expecting more repercussions when people learn Billy is time travelling  That someone might make the connection that it might be a result of the trauma of war and all the deaths  The book worked for me both ways  as a real time travel story  or as the mental meanderings of a post traumatic stress war veteran  Both scenarios were thrilling and emotionally satisfying Overall I loved the book  It was an unconventional story so it s fitting that it didn t deliver in a conventional way  It surely is a book I will not forget  And it is a book I return to often By the way  I love speculative fiction like this  If you do too  you might check out my novel The Prospect of My Arrival   Soft sci fi so it may not appeal to hard sci fi readers   It s about a human embryo that s allowed to preview the world before deciding whether to be born  The book was a finalist in the Amazon Breakthrough Novel contest  http   amzn to ozbXC4 This is my favorite Vonnegut book and when people ask me what my favorite book of all time is  this is one of three that I tell them ties for first place  To say that it is brilliant and a masterpiece is to fail to do it justice  Many have written on the subject of war  but no one before and none since have ever truly captured the essence of war like Vonnegut has with this work  which is even more amazing considering that the action of the book very rarely gets involved in the war itself  This is the humanist approach to the topic of war and that makes it accessible to anyone who is human  There are very few  classics  that deserve that title  Most are books that people read because it s widely accepted that an educated person should have read them  They don t truly stand the test of time and they don t make any difference in the way you think  You walk away from them the same way you come to them in the first place  Slaughterhouse Five rises above all of that and if you come away with the same perspective you came to it with it s because you have failed the writer  not because he has failed you And EVERY aspiring writer should  at very least  study the way Vonnegut writes  You won t ever need a thesaurus while reading his books  You get the feeling that his publisher charges him a dollar for every adverb he uses and still  with a simplistic approach that is accessible to school aged children and scholars alike  he paints a beautiful  vivid picture that stands the test of time and reads today just as easily as it did when it was first published and as easily as it will be read 20 years from now  You should read this book  It would be a shame if you didn t  This is the kind of book that makes the world a better place for existing  It does so one reader at a time  What are you waiting for  Slaughterhouse Five is a semi autobiographical account of Vonnegut s time in a prisoner of war camp during World War II  But mainly it is the story of Billy Pilgrim  a time traveling man who alternately visits his life as a normal man  an alien captive  and a prisoner of war Vonnegut quite cleverly gives readers an inside look into the world of war without making it a Book About War  He also includes an alien planet preceded by an alien abduction without making it a Book About Aliens  And finally  while Billy slips in and out of different times in his life  this is not a Book About Time Travel  Now if you were to ask me exactly what this book is about if it s not about war  aliens  or time travel  I may not have a perfect  definitive answer For me  the book was primarily about hope  for a better future  a better life  a better moment  Many events and quotes in the book lead me to believe this  but one main theme really struck this chord with me  Billy is trying to teach the world the Tralfamadorian perception of time which is completely non linear  The Tralfamadorians know and can literally see that all moments are occurring at all times  Every person is existing in the now  the then  the everytime  This is why Billy can travel to his past  present  and future  This is why he can see his birth and his death To me  the belief and acceptance of this perception is about hope  If we are existing at all points of our lives  then death has no hold over us  nor do present time pains and difficulties  While Billy is being held captive behind enemy lines  he gets to slip back in time to his wedding night  to his mother washing him when he was a baby  He gets to escape Slaughterhouse Five has more to offer than this  but it was what came to mind while writing  so there you have it  Read the book  You ll like it  Calificacion  4 5 Lulitas Un libro en jirones  Pareciera que la misma Segunda Guerra Mundial  de la que la narracion se ocupa  lo hizo volar en pedazos y que el autor intenta reconstruirlo desesperadamente  a partir de los escombros  Hay viajes en el tiempo  alinigenas y platos voladores  pero eso no le quita inteligibilidad  verosimilitud ni interes a lo esencial del relato  Aunque podria criticarsele la ausencia de peronajes fuertes  la historia esta contada desde la optica de Billy Pilgrim  un optometrista que se desprende de la secuencialidad del tiempo humano y que se desplaza  desordenada e infinitamente  entre diferentes momentos de su vida  Incluida su experiencia militar en Dresde  durante el bombardeo norteamericano de 1945  Las descripciones de la guerra son desgarradoras y oscilan entre la poesia y lo grotesco  Constituyen una excelente critica al absurdo y la crueldad de todo conflicto belico  Muy recomendando para quienes buscan leer algo original  y no enteramente ficticio  porque se basa en experiencias personales del autor  sobre el tema  from The Book Hooligan Spoilers abound The most important thing I learned on Tralfamadore was that when a person dies he only appears to die  He is still very much alive in the past  so it is very silly for people to cry at his funeral  All moments  past  present and future  always have existed  always will exist  The Tralfamadorians can look at all the different moments just that way we can look at a stretch of the Rocky Mountains  for instance  They can see how permanent all the moments are  and they can look at any moment that interests them  It is just an illusion we have here on Earth that one moment follows another one  like beads on a string  and that once a moment is gone it is gone forever  When a Tralfamadorian sees a corpse  all he thinks is that the dead person is in bad condition in the particular moment  but that the same person is just fine in plenty of other moments  Now  when I myself hear that somebody is dead  I simply shrug and say what the Tralfamadorians say about dead people  which is  So it goes     Billy PilgrimI came upon this gem of a book in Cooperstown  New York  We were on a trip to Niagara Falls when my uncle decided to make an unscheduled stop to visit the Baseball Hall of Fame since he is a baseball fan and there lies my problem for I am not a fan of the sport  Instead of going inside the Hall of Fame  I decided to wander the streets of this small town and check out the establishments  The second establishment that I entered was a store that sells baseball memorabilia including books about the players and about the sport itself  However  in one small corner  there are non baseball books that are not for sale and what caught my eye at the moment was the extremely appealing cover of Slaughterhouse Five with its vibrant red background  the bright yellow skull and crossbones on the foreground  and the appealing typography  I picked it up  bought it  went back to the car  and started reading although not exactly in that order Slaughterhouse Five is the story that begins with a autobiographic first chapter that     happened  more or less    pg 1  about the creation of the book  This chapter is more of an introduction or a preface rather than a chapter of the book itself and explains the thought processes of Kurt Vonnegut when he was formulating the book Then it pivots to the main story which was about Billy Pilgrim  a man who becomes  unstuck in time  which means that he no longer has a linear perspective on time  He experiences past and future events in a disorderly fashion and sometimes he experiences such events repetitively  Thus  the story follows a nonlinear narrative as the reader jumps back and forth in the events of Billy Pilgrim s life  We are given a narrative that gives us a glimpse of Billy s childhood  of his time in the army  of his postwar suburban life  of his old age  and of his life with the Tralfamadorians  who are a race of aliens that view time the same way that Billy views it and he learns from these aliens the same way that the aliens learned from him  Through the Tralfamadorians  Billy discovers that free will is a human illusion and that everything happens because they must  As the Tralfamadorian that Billy is talking to said    I ve visited thirty one inhabited planets in the universe Only on Earth is there any talk of free will   It is this fatalistic view of destiny that the book expounds upon  Because Billy s life is already mapped out since he has experienced everything that has happened at that will happen  he leads a dreary existence as he waits for what he will experience next which he already knows  Life is only a happy experience if it is filled with unknowns and since Billy already knows everything that will happen  he then leads his life as just a sequence of nonlinear events and nothing more Billy s death is even made to look as such a minor occurrence because Billy has already seen how he dies and he dismisses it as just an annoyance  He counters that he is not worried about death because  after the event  he will just go back in time to one of his other memories  The book has not made it clear if Billy is indeed a time traveler or if he was just mentally incapacitated by his experience during the war  War being a most ugly thing and which causes severe mental trauma to its participants Vonnegut also expounded on the destructiveness of war in this book but relegates it as a futile endeavor by saying that       writing an anti war book is like writing an anti glacier book   Which means that both attempts are senseless because both war and glaciers are things that cannot be stopped and controlled  It is the seemingly unstoppable nature of war that leads Vonnegut into writing that humans have no free will because  if we do have free will  why do we let destructive and horrible events like war happen  This human irrationality appears in one of the events within the book where a man is executed for stealing while the destruction caused by the firebombing of Dresden is all around them  Amidst all the burning rubble  the mangled bodies  and the bleak landscape  the men in the story found time to execute one man for stealing a teacup The fatalism within the book can indeed make a man think of all the senselessness that pervades in our world  This book is not a warning nor it is a lesson  It is just an account of how war and destruction can affect the most basic of human life and how it can change such a man forever by making him believe that he is a time traveler so that he can escape war s destruction and death  So it goes Rating  5 5  Kurt Vonnegut is one of my favorite authors and this may be his best book  High schools are using it today to lure kids into the thrill of reading and into the enjoyment of discussing something important about what they have read  What a dirty trick to play on these poor kids  If the kids are not careful  they may get hooked on Vonnegut and reading while the video games gather dust  Billy Pilgrim  the novel s protagonist  has come unstuck in time  Billy bounces backwards and forwards from World War II and the horror of the fire bombing of Dresden  Germany   where he was a POW   to the suburban life of the fifties and sixties  to the zoo on the planet Trafalmador  where he and a Playboy Playmate are the zoo s specimens from earth   Sounds silly  You bet  But beneath the silliness beats a forceful anti war story with a thought provoking outlook on life  Billy can t seem to figure out why he no longer has a linear life  why he zips forwards and backwards   old age to childhood in a single night  a single moment  As the Trafalmadorians say   Everything that ever has been  always will be  And everything that ever will be  always has been   Vonnegut is a fatalist  Yet  remarkably  he celebrates humanity  and our striving to better our condition in spite of all the cards stacked against us  This peculiar combination reads as peculiarly uplifting Vonnegut once asked   Does anyone out of high school still read me   The answer is an emphatic  Yes   Because the reasons English teachers use Vonnegut to lure their students into the love of reading are the same reasons those of us who are already there read him  Try him   You ll like him   This is an anti war book and it is a terrifying depiction of the horrors of war through the distorted mind of Billy Pilgrim heavily decorated with brilliant dark humor  Vonnegut writes so well that I could literally play Billy s transition between the past  the present and the future in my head  feel the burning heat of Dresden underneath my feet and there was a counter by my bedside keeping track of  So it goes  This book is about the struggles of war  It is the struggle of being in the war  dealing with life after war  and repeating the mistake of entering another war  It seems like  up till today  that nothing is learned and there is nothing that can change that  It is incomprehensible to me  I am not sure if Vonnegut meant to bring out the anti war sentiments out of his readers but he definitely did out of me  I have no wartime experience and I hope in my lifetime I will never be engaged in war  Billy s not afraid of death and so am I but I hate the idea of dying for a cause that I may not even believe it  I rather die out of a chronic illness or carbon monoxide poisoning  But when the time comes  do I have a choice  The thought of it is depressing  God grant me the serenityto accept the things Icannot change  courageto change the thingsI can  and wisdom always to tell thedifference   I had an epiphany mid read  In the beginning  I didn t like Slaughterhouse Five very much  I read Breakfast of Champions and Galapagos a number of years ago and loved them  I went into this one expecting to bow down to Vonnegut once again  Then I found myself underwhelmed by his familiar absurdist schtick  About halfway through  I decided to do my best to read Slaughterhouse Five as if I hadn t read the other two works first  After all  Breakfast of Champions and Galapagos weren t even gleams in Vonnegut s eye when he published Slaughterhouse Five  This shift in perspective made all the difference in the world Slaughterhouse Five represents a terrific example of 20th century anti war literature  There s a bit of a Catch 22  published eight years earlier  feel to the novel  along with dread inducing moments reminiscent of Remarque s All Quiet on the Western Front  published in 1929   Vonnegut may not have been the first to tread the path of the 20th century anti war novelist  but his unique mix of Tralfamadorian aliens  time travel  war  domestic life  socio economic commentary  and unabashed  often hilarious vulgarity make Slaughterhouse Five an essential read Here s a sample of the horror that weaves throughout Vonnegut s satire  From the prison camp dining hall   Only the candles and the soap were of German origin  They had a ghostly  opalescent similarity  The British had no way of knowing it  but the candles and the soap were made from the fat of rendered Jews and Gypsies and fairies and communists  and other enemies of the State  So it goes   So it goes    the Tralfamadorian statement made in connection with any talk of death   serves as a refrain throughout the work  Vonnegut s repeated use of this simple phrase had an almost contemplative effect on me  Whether the death was tragic or comic  of many thousands of people or of individuals  from fire bombing or from driving a car with a damaged exhaust system  Vonnegut follows the event s telling with  So it goes   Death s inevitability stands in stark contrast to the means of demise   So it goes  becomes an absurd slap in the face when stated in connection with the 130 000 plus people slaughtered in Dresden  more than were killed by either atomic bomb dropped on Japanese civilians  And Vonnegut was a prisoner of war in Dresden at the time of the fire bombing  Is it any wonder that Slaughterhouse Five would take on a cynical  absurdist  anti war tone  In a sense  Dresden served as Vonnegut s blackly humorous muse throughout his career as a writer Readers interested in better understanding Vonnegut s intellectual context as a writer might want to linger on Howard W  Campbell  Jr  s extended monograph analyzing the  disagreeable behavior  and sloppy appearance of American prisoners of war  It can be found just past the book s midpoint  Additionally  interesting philosophical and theological debates run throughout the text  What happens after we die  Is time linear  Are our actions and reactions pre ordained  What role does God play in human affairs  These debates often happen in quick hits  forcing the reader to catch his or her breath for a moment before continuing through the narrative How much of Slaughterhouse Five is autobiographical  Fiction  Is Billy Pilgrim an avatar of Kurt Vonnegut  Did war and other tragedies in life make Vonnegut come unhinged in time  traveling back and forth through his memories and present existence  Can a witness to such devastation at Dresden be expected realistically to put the past behind them and sally forth unscathed  No  In a sense  we re all unhinged in time with our pasts erupting continuously into our presents  May the future be kinder to everyone  Billy Pilgrim  POW  optometrist  time traveller and general outsider has become unstuck in time  As we hurtle backwards and forwards after him to certain key points in his life  sometimes on more than one occasion  Vonnegut treats us to an insightful and inventive commentary on the nature of fate  logic  the concept of free will and even existence itself  So it goes  Along with the extremes of the mundane and completely fantastical that Billy supposedly experiences throughout his life  the pivotal event we return to continually is the bombing of Dresden in the closing months of WWII  a horrific event which Billy  along with a small group of fellow soldiers  miraculously survives  Our narrator  most probably K Vonnegut himself   inspired by his war experience  sets out to write an  anti war  book  with fellow soldier Billy as his unlikely hero  Although war may have a significant role to play within the story  this is ultimately a hugely entertaining  complex satire  approaching a number of sometimes important  sometimes obscure ideas that absolutely astounded me from beginning to end  It is the best book I have read in a very long time  my admiration not having waned even now  a whole month later Slaughterhouse Five presents a tantalising opportunity to reveal some completely original ideas and inventions to those who have yet to pick it up   Huge concepts  almost too huge in places  are presented by a variety of unreal  satirical  often tragic characters  some who have reoccurring roles throughout Vonnegut s other fiction  to create a thoroughly enjoyable book that I feel should be made compulsory for everyone to read at least once in their lifetime The deeply insightful  and really quite comical portrayal of the very worst scenes of war and its protagonists should be argument enough to read this story  the completely unexpected  supernatural and philosophical elements  all superbly executed  help raise the bar to another level and will elevate this book to  Top 100  lists for the rest of time   What a weird yet wonderful place the world could become if everyone could think like Vonnegut     All time is all time  It does not change  It does not lend itself to warnings or explanations  It simply is  Take it moment by moment  and you will find that we are all  as I ve said before  bugs in amber    Poo tee weet  http   relishreads blogspot co uk 201    In one of my high school AP English classes  we had a list of books for outside reading to choose from  and Slaughterhouse Five was on it  I decided not to read it because  as the teacher explained  it was about World War Two and time travel  For one  I was not interested in time travel  I remember imagining Bill and Ted getting in that damn phone booth and shaking my head   and I was afraid I d drown in too many war references  What if I didn t get it  I chose The Crying of Lot 49 instead   Joke was on me  I guess  Fast forward to 2007  and I m doing a casual study of Kurt Vonnegut  Slaughterhouse Five is my second pick  What s the verdict  you wonder  I am delighted to report that I loved this novel  Whereas Cat s Cradle struck me as clever but perhaps forgettable  Slaughterhouse Five was funny  playful  structurally fascinating  and damn moving  I was interested in how  So it goes  repeated throughout the novel  changing with each use  first the casualness jarred me  and then I was surprised to see it  and then I expected to see it  and then I was exhausted by it  and the cycle went round and round again  a little different each time  It emphasized how much freaking death is in this book  A lot  I also found the prose to be quite lovely  Vonnegut loves to end a paragraph on a short  declarative sentence   On the plane to Baltimore last Thursday I finished Slaughterhouse V by Kurt Vonnegut  I think I may even have finished it while we were still on the runway  I don t even remember the takeoff  I was so engrossed  This is really a slim book  not so many pages at all  but it took me a good chunk of time to read it  I kept going back and rereading the striking bits  of which there are many  One of the lines I ve even committed to memory   The skyline was intricate and voluptuous and enchanted and absurd  It looked like a Sunday school picture of Heaven to Billy Pilgrim   The narrator gives this stunning line as a description of what it s like for the protagnoist to look out the window of his train at the pristine city of Dresden  in its last days as a whole city  Knowing this destruction is coming  and knowing who Billy Pilgrim is  this description is both terrible and tender  That collection of disjointed descriptors is somehow arresting and sentimental without being outright so  Moments like this one sneak up on you throughout the novel  There are these sudden flashes that break your heart  or at least they did mine  Like the time Billy  anothere soldier and their captor accidentally open the door to a room where a dozen girls are showering in a communal shower  Vonnegut writes   There those girls were with all their private parts bare  for anybody to see  And there in the doorway were Gluck and Derby and Pilgrim  the childish soldier and the poor old high school teacher and the clown in his toga and silver shoes  staring  The girls screamed  They covered themselves with their hands and turned their backs and so on  and made themselves utterly beautiful   This book manages to be about Dresden  about the horror of World War II and the Holocaust with only fleeting explicitness  Then it s also about time travel and the nature of death  Did I mention it s bizarre  It s bizarre  And wonderful  I imagine I ll be reading it again sometime  This is one of those books that has always fallen through the cracks of my literary life    always on my radar as something I clearly should read  never actually on my bookshelf  When a friend of mine recently included a copy in a pile of books she dropped off for me during my recent extended illness  I figured it must be a sign   The uniqueness of Vonnegut s genius has always astounded me  I daresay being personally close to him must have been an adventure  both good and bad  In any case  his writings never fail to take my breath away with their combination of insight and creativity In the first chapter  Vonnegut openly grapples with how one could possibly write about the horrors of wartime atrocities like the bombing of Dresden  He then proceeds to give the reader just about the weirdest novellic journey imaginable  And at the end  you think to yourself  yes  that was exactly how to do it  indeed  the only way to do it In short  a classic for a reason  In truth  a masterpiece  I really enjoyed reading this novel more then I thought I would  and I really cannot explain why  This is a fun book to discuss in class because there are so many things a person can miss or think is unimportant  Discussing the ideals of the Tralfamadore s on how everything is set in stone  and a person cannot change anything because it has already happened  and when we die we just return to other moments in our life  I always have fun learning about other people s beliefs systems when they are not pushed upon me  and i think the Vonnegut has a beautiful outlook on life even if I do not agree with everything he says  I hope Vonnegut is having fun revisiting the parts of his life  So it goes  So far this is my favorite novel I have read in my American Novel class   What was that  I have just experienced my first Kurt Vonnegut book  I thought it was crazy   crazy in an extraordinary way  The book was this wild and unique mix of sad  witty  brilliant  silly  time traveling  war time  alien abduction  quiet adventure about a guy  Billy  who I think was mentally ill  but I m not sure because there was enough evidence that he wasn t  What  I think what I liked most about the book were all the great lines  There were so times that I stopped at to laugh and or ponder  Here are a couple of my favorites  I know they re probably ones where you had to be in the moment of the book or at least to have read the book  but here goes  The champagne was dead  So it goes   The boots fit perfectly  Billy Pilgrim was Cinderella  and Cinderella was Billy Pilgrim   He supposed for years that he had no secrets from himself  Here was proof that he had a great big secret somewhere inside  and he could not imagine what it was   I love story  I love language  I love fiction  I love reading  And then  occasionally  I am blessed by a book  a special book  and remember the reason I read at all  East of Eden1984A Clockwork OrangePerelandraLife After GodA Wrinkle In TimeI remember books so beautiful  so romantic  so tragic  so human  so honest  that I grieve that I can never read them again for the first time before I even reach the last page  Some   East of Eden  Perelandra   I ve stretched out as long as I possibly may  savouring each page in its beauty  Others   1984  A Wrinkle in Time   I read in in a single setting  the horror of them gripping me as though they were reading me  I read Slaughterhouse Five this afternoon  in its entirety  It reminded me why I read books at all   The flaw in the Christ stories  said the visitor from outer space  was that Christ  who didn t look like much  was actually the Son of the Most Powerful Being in the Universe  Readers understood that  so  when they came to the crucifixion  they naturally thought   Oh  boy   they sure picked the wrong guy to lynch that time  And that thought had a brother  There are right people to lynch  Who  People not well connected  So it goes That kind of irony and humour was one of the things which made me love this book  probably because it dovetails so neatly with my own  but I think even more compelling for me was the fact that Vonnegut seemed to have such empathy for his characters  No matter how ridiculous a character Billy Pilgrim was  or may have become  there was always a fundamental sense of dignity to him  to this ordinary man experiencing the psychedelic  the extraordinary  The author crafted a masterpiece highly witty and funny  The book broke the traditional chronological order of events  Billy shifts in time forwards and backwards without disrupting the smooth flow of the narrative  The author amazingly kept the events coherent and whole regardless of the constant travelling back and forth in time  This technique allowed Billy to predict what will become of him and the other characters  He is totally omniscient  I had some doubts that the Tralfamadorians scenes are a figment of his imagination due to some situations he went through like morphine  fractured skull  mental hospital  and hallucinations  but the author keeps trying to validate the authenticty of the encounter of the aliens who seem to developed a higher culture than the earthlings  Death for them is not death  It is a form of life in the fourth dimension  An excellent read  It deserves my 5 stars  In primul rand  cartea nu e despre ce ma asteptam   Descrierea de pe Goodreads zice ceva de genul    povestea lui Billy Pilgrim  un om care devine capabil sa calatoreasca in timp  dupa ce este

really write a review because i m not sure I understoodeven half of it  But it is pure literature  Parts of it are of the strongest reading moments i had in my whole life  Do think how a docymentary movie about o World War II movie of a bombing would seem like played backwards  Magnificent  The best anti  war book I  ve ever read   To ekho teleiosei edo kai kairo alla den exera ti na grapso  Pos

this was a very interesting book  During the times that it skipped back and forth within the timeline I found it difficult at times to understand what was going on  but after reading farther into the setting I found it easy to comprehend  I recommend this book to anyone looking for something interesting and random to read  Billy Pilgrim  Roland Weary  Poor old Edgar Derby  Kilgore Trout  Some of the most interesting characters I ve ever read about  A quick and meaningful read about the nature of life and war  using the bombing of Dresden as a focal point and time travel as a wonderfully inventive plot device  A magnificent novel One of the most unforgettable passages in the book for me is when Billy Pilgrim  in an almost Benjamin Button esque fit  watched a war movie  backwards   The bombs leaped back into planes  the planes flew backwards to their origins  they were disassembled into bare materials  and Hitler became a baby  Obviously  I m not doing it any justice at all   I just thought that was such a novel and touching perspective  Quite Vonnegutian Po tee weet  And so it goes  One of the great novels of all time  As Vonnegut himself graded it  A   Hilarious and languishingly sad and insightful and smart and wild  Vonnegut was there in Dresden when the allies destroyed that once beautiful city  and he writes this autobiographical novel to reflect on that terrible time  laced with science fiction and acidic humor and a kind of fatalism  or is it mock fatalism    So it goes  Vonnegut famously writes  as if things just happen  He was traumatized by the war  and suicidal at times ever since in spite of his hilarious novels  but like Joseph Heller s Catch 22  it is one of the great anti war novels of all time  And it s black comedy  both of them  One of the very best books ever from one of our greatest writers    Dhe gruas se Lotit iu urdherua te mos shihte pas  aty ku kishin qene gjithe ata njerez dhe shtepite e tyre  Por ajo pa  dhe une e

perante o livro  apesar da obvia falta de pormenores  Ali no hospital  Billy estava a viver uma aventura muito comum entre as pessoas que nao tem poder em tempos de guerra  tentava provar a um inimigo surdo e cego por vontade propria que era interessante ouvir e ver  About 2 weeks ago I was in the Dresden and this become a first book that I have randomly chosen to read after coming back  Universe of structured and predefined moments  I don t think so  but anyway    So it goes    Read in high school  Ninth grade  Living in Florence  Oregon  Sometime near  or during  Christmas break  Living in that house with all the 6 s in the address  Furniture that had a previous life as industrial spools  miles of telephone  or electrical wire  Playing Super Mario Brothers  Selling Chanterelle mushrooms to restaurants for  60 lb  Making  500 or so a month extra for a few months  Riding my bike to the beach after school  the dark clouds overhead  High winds  No shower head   showered  before school by hooking a rubber hose up to the faucet  soaping fast and feeling miserably cold   Brilliant satire on war and humanity  a novel best auto described by quotes below  A must read  There is no beginning  no middle  no end  no suspense  no moral  no causes  no effects  What we love in our books are the depths of many marvelous moments seen all at one time        There are almost no characters in this story  and almost no dramatic confrontations  because most of the people in it are so sick and so much the listless playthings of enormous forces  One of the main effects of war  after all  is that people are discouraged from being characters  Kurt Vonnegut  Slaughterhouse Five I ve put off reading Vonnegut for years  fearing that his work would be too hard to take  This story is tragic at its core  but surprisingly entertaining  There is an authorial presence here that s unusual  Greta Garbo s films have always made me feel that she was not only a great actress  but a magnificent person  similarly  reading  Slaughterhouse Five  makes me think that Kurt Vonnegut was a real mensch  He s not unflinching in the face of evil and disaster  but he makes himself look at it and survive it and report it anyway  What could be more courageous  And he even manages to be funny  I can t believe that I waited this long to read  Slaughterhouse Five   but better late than never  Partly autobiographical  historical  science fiction  ironic  and philosophical in turns  it s a work that s quintessentially Vonnegut  The anti war message is not pounded over one s head  and there are even hints that Vonnegut  or at least Billy Pilgrim  at least understands the arguments of those who defend the fire bombing of Dresden  even as the horror  not just of Dresden but of war in general  in its ground truth rather than in the abstract  is depicted  An unforgettable book  Every time I read this book  I love it more  I want to read more by Vonnegut  and I will  but I am a little afraid that nothing will compare with this book  I love Billy while simultaneously pitting him and being disappointed sometimes in choices he makes  I am impressed at Vonnegut s use of symbolism and motif and I wonder if I will ever fully understand everything the Tralfamadorians mean in this book   which is frustrating and interesting  This book makes me feel conflicted about a lot of things and makes me re examine views   which is what he wants me to do  Brilliant book  I wrote a great review of this  but it got wiped before I could save it due to a network error  Seems kind of apt  Suffice to say it s quite brilliant  an absurdist anti war work on a par with Kubrick s Dr Strangelove  One of my favorite books  So glad I re read this one  Not sure why it took me so long to get around to reading this  I am a casual Sci Fi fan who shares a birthday with Vonnegut  so I ve read some of his other work but somehow this one never made it into the list  I love the descriptions of time and the thought of traveling through it  I love the twisting lens of propriety  I love never knowing whose perspective is the sane one Phenomenal  Gut wrenching  Whimsical  Dark  Imaginative  Brutal  Airy  I rarely reread books  but I m already considering it for this one  The alternate title for the book is A Children s Crusade  A Duty Dance with Death  At The beginning of the book the author claims to be writing a book about the battle of Dresden  a lesser known allied air strike where more people died than at Hiroshima  A wife of one of the author s friends is angry he is writing a war book because war books always glorify war  She says they were just children fighting in the war  He agrees to call it A Children s Crusade  In many ways  modern wars are no different from the children s crusades of the middle ages  In war we send out 18 or 19 year old men  but in many ways they are children  they do not know what they are doing  This sets the tone for the rest of the book which I find to be symbolic of war  even though the actual war is talked about very little Most the book is nonsensical  The story is told in a completely non linear fashion  The first part which talks about the author  but the rest is about an optometrist named Billy Pilgrim  Billy claims to have been abducted by aliens that see in the fourth dimension  They teach him the  true nature  of time  They can all go to any moment at any time  They can look at moments in time like we look at the rocky mountains  This leads to the convoluted story telling  Billy believes this and can somehow jump from moment to moment  He tells about part of his story during the war when he is in Dresden  then he is back in the states before the war  then back in the war  then at another point in the war  then getting married after the war  then when he is old  then when he is in school  and so on  By the end the reader is able to piece together his whole life  but it is like putting a puzzle together This is in many ways like war  It doesn t make sense  After we see destroyed buildings and bits of pieces of information from different survivors and with that a story is pieced together which eventually becomes the narrative thousands of school children will recite on tests  Yet it is not the story of the war  We learn a broad story of events that logically follow one another and culminate in victory for the good guys  The history of America s wars in most history books read more like a Victorian novel or an epic Greek poem  For the actual soldiers  it doesn t make sense  There are bombs  explosions  going here and there and they don t even knowing why  There is a reason tons come back with PTSD and other ailments  they just went through hell  and the worst part about it is that it is senseless hell  This is the reason the bombing of Dresden is not well known  because it does not fit the narrative  The good guys don t just bomb a completely unprotected city for no reason and kill thousands of civilians for no apparent reason  So what do we do  we skip over that  We get Hitler Bad  Hitler attack  Winston Churchill good  Churchill save day  American fighting men save the day  allies win  world saved  Yet this is not the story of war  this is the fantasy of those that don t want to understand In this story Billy talks about visiting space aliens and going through time warps and all this stuff  It is all kind of crazy  but nothing compared to the craziness of sending bombs down on innocent people  but so it goes  The aliens Billy meets are also very deterministic  There is no ability to change the course of events  Each moment happens because that is just how it is constructed  Billy knows when he is going to die  but he does nothing because that is just how it is  Throughout the book whenever someone dies  which is almost every other paragraph  it is followed by the sentence  So it goes  As if that is just how it is  Of course  to the man in the army this is how life feels  this is how war feels  You cannot choose where you go  or when you leave  or even when you go to the bathroom  It is all controlled by some external and seemingly arbitrary force  Life is completely controlled  You are a mere pawn in some scheme that you are completely incapable of fathoming And that is slaughterhouse five  It is not a story about a crazy optometrist who gets abducted by aliens  It is about some children  18 and 19 year old children  sent on a crusade they didn t understand  It is about the crazy stories they have to create to make sense of their lives  Billy Pilgrim is not insane for seeing aliens  the world around him is insane that escape to aliens is a better alternative than reality  This is one of those books that I am really sad I put off reading for so long  I had so many preconceptions about it  I thought it was about war and nothing else  Why would I want to read a book about war      because Kurt Vonnegut wrote it  that s why  This book is beautiful It really is  It s honest and interesting and I found that I read it really quickly  Perhaps too quickly   I should look into rereading it  I love Kurt s dark humour   he s just so bitterly funny  He picks apart the American dream and in so few words  and he does it so well  There is something compassionate about this book  and I think it s his most accessible Once you read this book  even if you don t like it I think you ll be able to understand why so many people have  so it goes  tattooed on various parts of their body  or   everything was beautiful and nothing hurt  But perhaps the most jarring for me is when he referred to himself   That was me  That was the author of this book   Suddenly I remembered this was not just fiction  this was something he experienced   so while not all of it is necessarily true  all of it is valid Vonnegut took a subject like war  a subject  I am frankly  almost completely uninterested in  and he made it human  Not only do I think he s a great American writer  I would wager he s a good human being  The classic novel  Slaughterhouse Five  A Novel by the late literary icon Kurt Vonnegut was not on my reading list  but found its way to the top of it based on recommendations from fans of the novel  While I was aware of it  and Vonnegut s career  I had yet to read any of his works  Seeing how I had also fared well lately in recommendations in what I should read  I thought I should give it a go Writing a review of such an iconic and classic book is daunting  The temptation is to search the Internet for reviews and analysis of the novel and parrot that back in the review  so as to make myself look like a literary intellectual  That would also be more than a bit of a cheat  The beauty of writing  as in many other forms of art  is that it is all interpretive  there are shared experiences  but we all get something unique or different to ourselves through art   how our minds interpret what we read and what we see  so  it s only fair that I relate to Slaughterhouse Five  having been read by me in 2015  as I experienced it The book itself  told in an almost stream of consciousness format  by Billy Pilgrim  focuses  or I should say  is anchored by his remembrances of being a prisoner of war during WWII  and held in the German city of Dresden during its bombing by the Allies on February 13 to 15th in 1945  while history has now determined that the bombings claimed 22 000 to 25 000 lives  for the longest time  and in 1969 when Slaughterhouse Five was originally published  it was believed the death toll was in the 100 000 to 200 000 range Billy  an inept soldier at best  is obviously deeply troubled by the bombing and his survival during it  and in telling what happened  also relates other experiences in his life  doing so by explaining that after he was kidnapped by Outer Space beings known as Tralfamadorians  he was able to time travel back and forth through time  visiting different points of his life   at least when he isn t stuck in a Tralfamoadorian zoo  where he is observed and eventually mated with a  B  movie actress who may have also dabbled in pornography In telling this tale  Vonnegut doesn t structure his novel in a traditional manner  but bounces around in space and time relating Billy s remembrances   an approach that works beautifully  In reading Slaughterhouse Five  it dawned on me that living through a time of war must be a strange and surreal experience  as people act and behave differently   outside the norms of proper  expected society  Billy relating his wartime experiences is almost as farfetched and unbelievable as his time traveling experiences  and time with the Tralfamadorians   both might as well be the same  I was aware that Slaughterhouse Five had been described as an  anti war  novel  and got that  as the behavior of human beings during war  as described by Billy  is as silly and crazy as his remembrances of space creatures  both are out of place and time  Add to this  his mundane life as an optometrist  in a functional  safe marriage  and the absurdity of war is driven even further home I suspect Billy Pilgrim is telling this tale late in his life  and to make sense of what he went through during WWII and the bombing  he is manufacturing events he experienced into a wild and crazy tale  that in many ways  through the philosophy of the Tralfamadorians takes away the concept of free will  and as such absolves him of his participation in something as horrific and terrible as WWII  His way of coming to terms with what he experienced in Europe during that time Published in 1969  Slaughterhouse Five  A Novel  written by Kurt Vonnegut is still a powerful read  a WWII novel unlike any other  that still has something to say  and can still prompt thought  The absurdity of war has not left us  while we no longer fight World Wars  the insanity of conflict  death and destruction still haunt us  and it s in reading something as creative and inspired as Slaughterhouse Five that it causes us to pause for a second and wonder just what the hell we think we re doing  or accomplishing  in our desire as a species to embrace violence Thought provoking and brilliant  Slaughterhouse Five is a classic novel worth reading  Slaughterhouse Five is hands down  a genius combination of truth and fiction  Kurt Vonnegut s famous satirical novel is about violence and war and the idea of free will  It s an autobiographical and fictional mix built into a story about Billy Pilgrim s time travels on Earth and his visit to the distant planet Tralfamadore  It was published in 1969  in the midst of the U S  involvement in the Vietnam War and became a best seller because of its anti war sentiment  It has been banned from some schools and studied in others and is considered Vonnegut s most influential work  I think it is excellent in its message  its symbolism and its construction Vonnegut s main character  Billy Pilgrim  jumps back and forth through time and tries to make sense of a life that has been dramatically transformed by his experience as an American prisoner during World War Two  Billy wasn t meant for war  but there he is  His miraculous survival after the Allied bombing and total destruction of Dresden  Germany is a turning point in his life  a moment he struggles  unconsciously  to understand and beat Billy copes in a way no one around him can understand  by retreating inward and traveling in time  past and future and being kidnapped by aliens from the planet Tralfamadore  Tralfamadorians tell Billy that there is no real end in time   All moments  past  present  and future  always have existed  always will exist   They tell him that moments in time are like  bugs trapped in amber   When Billy notes that life on their planet is peaceful  unlike on Earth  they tell him they  too have experienced violent wars  but they have a way to deal with them   There isn t anything we can do about them  so we simply don t look at them  We ignore them  We spend eternity looking at pleasant moments  I like everything about this book  Many of characters are symbols of certain types of thought and are precisely depicted through their actions and what they say  When Billy s daughter  Barbara treats him like a child  I found myself believing in Tralfamadore  When Billy visits his mother at Pine Knoll nursing home  I felt his mother s tears  as she pulls all her  energy from all over her ruined body  even her toes and fingertips  just to ask Billy   How did I get so old   I hated Roland Weary  I felt sad for Wild Bob and the hobo who says   This ain t bad  This ain t nothing at all   I saw the irony of Edgar Derby s fate  a teacher of  Contemporary Problems in Western Civilization  and the image of Derby s face bursting into tears after Billy feeds him a spoon of syrup This is one of those books that reads quickly and gives the first impression of a story casually told  but it s not  Every word is carefully chosen  every character is deliberately included  and every jump in time is purposefully choreographed  And despite the graphic descriptions and language and the ugliness of war  this book has a beauty about it that s hard to describe While this story is about Billy s personal struggle  its bigger story and strongest message is about war  I think Vonnegut s description of the Allied bombing of Dresden in reverse is very powerful  The formation flew backwards over a German city that was in flames  The bombers opened their bomb bay doors  exerted a miraculous magnetism which shrunk the fires  gathered them into cylindrical steel containers  and lifted the containers into the bellies of the planes  Vonnegut continues this reverse description back to the beginning of man  where eventually   Everybody turned into a baby  and all humanity  without exception  conspired biologically to produce two perfect people named Adam and Eve   All that s complicated and violent  returning to something so simple It took me a long time to get to Slaughterhouse Five  I don t think these ideas will ever leave me  I love this book  It s so utterly bizarre yet at the same time it makes a strange amount of sense  I look forward to reading more Vonnegut and i definitely want to reread this at some point  It seems like one of those books where every time you read it you get something new out of it  For example  this time that i read it i focused mainly on the humour  but it also has some darkness and mystery sort of aspects to it too  It s a great blend of different type of stories that shouldn t work together but do  Brilliantly written  Awesome listen on Audio book  Laugh out loud funny in places and horribly sad in others  Best description of a war in reverse that I ve ever read  and I will never EVER forget the phrase  and so it goes    Favorite Quote  It was a movie about American bombers in World War II and the gallant men who flew them  Seen backwards by Billy  the story went like this  American planes  full of holes and wounded men and corpses took off backwards from an airfield in England  Over France  a few German fighter planes flew at them backwards  sucked bullets and shell fragments from some of the planes and crewmen  They did the same for wrecked American bombers on the ground  and those planes flew up backwards to join the formation The formation flew backwards over a German city that was in flames  The bombers opened their bomb bay doors  exerted a miraculous magnetism which shrunk the fires  gathered them into cylindrical steel containers   and lifted the containers into the bellies of the planes  The containers were stored neatly in racks  The Germans below had miraculous devices of their own  which were long steel tubes  They used them to suck more fragments from the crewmen and planes  But there were still a few wounded Americans though and some of the bombers were in bad repair  Over France though  German fighters came up again  made everything and everybody as good as new When the bombers got back to their base  the steel cylinders were taken from the racks and shipped back to the United States of America  where factories were operating night and day  dismantling the cylinders  separating the dangerous contents into minerals  Touchingly  it was mainly women who did this work  The minerals were then shipped to specialists in remote areas  It was their business to put them into the ground  to hide them cleverly  so they would never hurt anybody ever again  The American fliers turned in their uniforms  became high school kids  And Hitler turned into a baby   So It Goes  A Review of Slaughterhouse Five by Joe KhouryKurt Vonnegut is a brilliant mind  This was apparent to me as soon as I had finished slaughterhouse five  I ve known about the legendary author  humorist  and veteran among other things for years  and I finally decided to assert myself into his renown bed of work via satirical post modernist war classic  Slaughterhouse Five   The book tells the story of Billy Pilgrim  A World War Two soldier that acts as something of a pushover in the heat of battle and abhors war  Pilgrim has become  unstuck in time  meaning he experiences different moments at various points in his life  He experiences his war life  institutionalized life as an optometrist  his POW life in German custody  and his life in the four dimensional universe of the Tralfamadorians all at different points in such a way that almost makes this a psychedelic read   Right off the bat  Vonnegut grips you with his charismatic style and feel  His somewhat friendly yet ambiguous feel really set the tone for the book  I was hooked on this right from the beginning  The books venture s into the realities of war  time travel  extra terrestrial life  dreams  and use of symbolism are truly captivating  The biblical allusions were superb as well  This book may not settle well with those who desire a linear or easy to follow story line  While this tells an interesting story  I d recommend this book to readers who value symbolism and lessons that can be applied to life  I believe the symbolism and lessons taken from this book are phenomenal and enhance the work so much more  The poignant uses of symbolism were extremely well done  Much of the symbolism delves into the senseless atrocity of war  He notes that pre firebombed Dresden was a charming city  devoid of war factories and agony  and filled with life and happiness  The city had no reason to be bombed into dust  Yet it was  Kurt s real life observation of Dresden before and after the firebombing served as an excellent metaphor for war  Senseless massacre  Each time someone or something is destroyed or killed  the same phrase always resurfaces   So It Goes   A detached yet sobering sentiment that can be applied to many happenings that are out of one s control    After a massacre  everybody is supposed to be dead  to never say or want anything ever again  Every thing is supposed to be very quiet after a massacre  and it always is  except for the birds  And what do the birds say  All there is to say about a massacre  things like  poo tee weet    I believe this quote summarizes what this book stands for so well  When all is said in dome in war  there is no way to justify it  When things such as firebombing 135 000 innocents to push a war agenda happen  logic just doesn t apply  This book challenges many notions  Death  War  Love  Hate  Time  Humanity  Slaughterhouse Five is a culmination of these notions  It deals with all these and looks at them from an outside perspective  It tears down the pre conceived walls of sanity and existentialism in such a way that takes time to be fully realized  This is rightfully a classic  an essential read  and a genius work of literature  So It Goes  5 5  Savrsenstvo bez ijedne mane  So it goes    Poo tee weet     Most readers  like myself  would pick up this book expecting a stereotypical story about the horrors of war  Slaughterhouse Five  however  is anything but stereotypical  The protagonist  Billy Pilgrim  is an American POW who survives the carpet bombing of Dresden during WW2  The book is not arranged chronologically from beginning to end  but rather in a seemingly random order  corresponding to Billy traveling through time  Various time periods of his life come and go  and we discover that Billy was not only a soldier  but also was abducted by aliens and spent years living amongst them  These aliens  the Traflamadorians  do not see time as progressing linearly as humans do  but rather as happening all at once  every event has happened  will happen  and is happening simultaneously  Their philosophy on life is that  since the bad parts of life cannot be avoided  one should simply focus on the good  That is the true message of this book  to focus on the good The mantra  So it goes   repeated whenever death occurs  serves to show that death is not such a bad thing  It happens to everyone  While Vonnegut does not condone war he realizes that war  and subsequently death  is inevitable  Why waste your life dwelling on the negative  the past  when you instead could focus on all the good  That s one thing Earthlings might learn to do  if they tried hard enough  ignore the awful times and concentrate on the good ones Slaughterhouse Five is a most unusual book  It s a memoir  with much that is clearly autobiographical  and yet it s a work of fiction   All this happened  more or less   we re assured by Vonnegut   or perhaps I should say by the narrator of the novel  who isn t the protagonist  but may not be entirely Vonnegut either  It s a work of science fiction and fantasy  and yet at its core is gritty  even bitter realism It s a novel full of comedy and laughter  and yet a book with a serious philosophical message The message is in the quotation  We need to concentrate on what is best in our lives  and not focus so hard on what is unpleasant  Now Billy Pilgrim  protagonist of Slaughterhouse Five  has a great advantage over most of us  he s come  unstuck in time  and can travel backwards and forwards through his life  this means he can live as much as he likes in the good moments  and just has to learn to spend less living through the worst The worst happened at the end of World War 2  Taken prisoner by the Germans during the Ardennes offensive that ended in the Battle of the Bulge  he s shipped from the front to a prisoner of war camp in Germany  The trip  in rail cattle trucks  plenty of opportunity for often black humour  as for the the prisoner of war camp  the Americans are greeted by Brits performing Gilbert and Sullivan to welcome them to their new home  But it isn t their home  Soon they move on to be put to work  in the capital of the eastern province of Saxony  Dresden  So Pilgrim  like Vonnegut and his narrator  is there on 13 February 1945  when British and American planes destroyed the city with high explosive and incendiary bombs  The bombs themselves and the subsequent firestorm killed  we now know  up to 25 000 people though Vonnegut  like many at the time the book was published  believed it was 135 000  That s the number quoted in the book  but even the real number is horrific enough  and reducing the estimate doesn t take anything from the point made by Pilgrim And what is that point  It s more subtle than one might imagine  There s no attempt to suggest that it means the Western Allies were somehow more reprehensible than the Nazis  or even that there was some equivalence between them  Faced with the accusation that the Germans had engaged in mass murder and bore the principal responsibility for the war  he doesn t deny it  He simply refuses to accept that what he witnessed was anything but vile  The bombing of Dresden merely reveals how utterly appalling war is in itself  however good or bad the motives of the sides involved So it becomes an event which the time traveller Pilgrim as one to avoid  though   fortunately for us  since we can read about the experience   he regularly travels back to the time  But he lives in many other times  and tells us about them  he marries a woman with little to attract him  but a wealthy father in the optometry business  which he joins  He has a daughter who turns into a copy of her mother and who  at the end of his life  tries to bully and cajole him into accepting her care and conforming to the bourgeois lifestyle she feels is appropriate for him  He has a son who turns into a troubled and deeply troubling teenager  before flipping and joining the  Famous Green Berets  and winning the plaudits of his superiors in Vietnam   finding a career for himself in the very activity his father finds most toxic  It isn t his home life that provides the antidote to Dresden  What does is his abduction by the inhabitants of the distant planet Tralfamadore  It is they who teach him that all moments co exist   There is no beginning  no middle  no end  no suspense  no moral  no causes  no effects  What we love in our books are the depths of many marvellous moments seen all at one time   Everything happens at the same time  we have always lived  we always will live  because we have lived  and death is just a moment when we re less well than at others  Why should we focus on it When they bring an attractive young cinema star to join him  they provide him with the moments on which he ought to focus  An invaluable lesson from the Tralfamadoreans  They also teach Pilgrim to say  so it goes  each time he thinks of death   and the words become the recurring refrain of Slaughterhouse Five  They neatly sum up this fine short novel  as it races along  giving us joy and laughter and shock and horror and insight and entertainment  So it goes  Rather splendidly  It s very hard to review this book  when so much has already been said about it  It is a bit of paradox  On one level it is about absurdity  Billy Pilgrims beliefs are absurd  yet  to him at least  meaningful and hopeful  Everyone thinks he s mad  The bombing of Dresden was tragic  horrific  pointless  and absurd  But it happened  Yet this book never falls into solipsism   the sense of outrage is as strong now as when it was written  Outstanding in every way   I love that Vonnegut intertwines fiction with non fiction seamlessly  The narrative of this book is incredible because it incorporates Vonnegut s personal experience in WWII  particularly  Dresden in a way that can only be described as heartbreaking  The raw and heavy prose is very dark  yet Vonnegut lightens the mood at the same time thanks to the protagonist s time travel and experience on Tralfamadore  also thanks to Vonnegut s not so subtle commentary on society  in this book  American  German and British society   This quirky and reoccurring sci fi planet  Tralfamadore makes Vonnegut s darkness digestible and makes getting through evil character descriptions and the harshness of war a little easier  I can t help but think that he does this as a gift to the reader who otherwise might be left feeling JUST hopeless and sad  Rather  after finishing this book  you are left feeling a bit sad  yet with a smile and a deeper connection with humanity   Powerful book with lots of hard truths reflected on humanity by the mirror of irrevent fatalistic narrative  I read this in a single sitting  equally gripped and repulsed by the stories related in the fantastic non linear timeline  This for me  like Camus  The Plague  The Stranger and Phillip K  Dick s A Scanner Darkly is more than fiction  all these books are mirrors made from truths and eased into our brains by the trickery of fiction  Amazing work  A book  about flying saucers  the negligibility of death  and the true nature of time   Billy Pilgrim has done a lot of thinking about these things  unstuck in time as he has been since WWII This was a great read  and I am glad to have finally taken the plunge into Vonnegut s world  We have a shelf full of his books  and I look forward to reading more of his work  I quite enjoyed his commentary on religion  war   We had forgotten that wars were fought by babies     marriage  and aging   I knew it was going to be bad getting old  I didn t know it was going to be this bad   I ve seen comments from other readers stating that this is a science fiction story because of the time travel element  I think this is a wonderful example of how a book can be a different thing to different people  For myself  I see it as an illustration of PTSD resulting from surviving the horrors of war  Just look at the scene involving the barbershop quartet on the airplane  Classic PTSD reaction to an event So it goes  It used to be shell shock and battle fatigue  Now we know it as post traumatic stress syndrome  It has always been with us  especially in the young men  and women  we send to war  completely unprepared for the experience  We force them to see and hear things they shouldn t  And we expect them to return home unaffected  The real cost of war is the minds and souls of these young people  and the trauma they can t escape SLAUGHTERHOUSE 5 was written during the Viet Nam conflict   young men were dying and surviving and returning home altered forever Billy Pilgrim never actually sees combat  but he sees war  He sees the beautiful  non strategic city of Dresden reduced to rubble   to a moonscape  He sees death and horror and cruelty  And his gentle mind chooses to protect him however it can BIlly gets unstuck in time and place  He revisits episodes in his life  and he is abducted by aliens  forced to live in their version of a zoo  They teach him to accept his life  his losses  his future   All moments  past  present and future  always have existed  always will exist   All of US exist even after we die  They give him advice to survive   That s one thing Earthlings might learn to do  if they tried hard enough  Ignore the awful times and concentrate on the good ones   Billy tries  No one understands him  He doesn t understand himself  But he accepts his time travel and his alien existence   he accepts and survives  This may not have been the life he hoped for  but it is a life  And so it goes   Death is to be faced  accepted  but maybe if the Tralfamadores are right  death is not forever  I hope Billy finds peace In the words of my pendant from Another Mother For Peace   War is not healthy for children and other living things   Which brings me to The Children s Crusade  Old men send young children off to war and seem heedless of the cost  Vonnegut knows what that cost is  Billy does After a few days  seeing that this book still haunts me  I ve been thinking  Vonnegut seems so gentle  so loving  so careful  with Billy  His prose is gentle  It doesn t show off with wild figures of speech and metaphors  It IS  Billy IS  What may feel detached is actually  in my mind now  that unconditional love for Billy and everyone around him  Respect  Even though others may think him a clown or buffoon  Vonnegut knows the struggle  and he knows the most humane thing we can do for Billy is to accept him and love him  A word about James Franco s narration   WOW  Just wow  I found this book challenging  but in the best of ways  It was a bit of a confusing book to jump into cold  but once accustomed to Vonnegut s bizarre anti hero and his adventures time travelling the book started to pick up  Kurt Vonnegut has a very distinct style of writing that feels informal to the point of familiarity which I found refreshing and humorous  Thoroughly enjoyed this book  and would recommend reading a few times for clarity  Brilliant  This book is basically a comment on the insanity of war  And it communicates this through the insanity of the story  which jumps from time period to time period  and the character has either been abducted by aliens or more likely has gone insane  There is a forward by Vonnegut and an interview at the end of the audiobook version I listened too  which really helped to understand his mindset when he wrote the book   wow    What a beautiful  sad  strange book  The fact that it s regarded as a modern classic strikes me as something of a minor miracle  considering all its talk of aliens and time travel and Kilgore Trout  If you  like me  read this in high school  I d certainly recommend reading it again as an adult  it was much less funny to me this time around  although it s still very funny  and much more hard hitting and compassionate  This is absolutely a mind opener  The perfect war story It changed the way I look at the dimension of time It s deep  philosophical  inventive  and smart The bible of Pacifism  Too subtle to be true I connected to the characters  the plot was revealed from the beginning of the book  but I was hooked throughout the whole thing Absolutely a favorite It s a book you should read before you die   This is by far the most interesting book I ve ever read  I have never seen anybody write in the style that Vonnegut does  None of the events are laid out chronologically  and the setting changes from a very realistic setting to an Alien planet  Nothing about this book is orthodox  It s one of the only books I ve had to reread to understand it  However  that being said  I feel that Vonnegut s odd style really sets this book apart from others in a good way  and provokes some deep thinking from the reader  especially questions about free will  Having Billy Pilgrim being  unstuck in time  really makes the book interesting  This book also exposes the ridiculousness of life  One character survives a fire bombing only to be executed for taking a lamp  It shows the horrible nature of war  with the bombing of Dresden  Although chronologically  the Dresden bombing should be towards the front of the novel  it ends up being the very end because Billy is unstuck in time  It also tackles some very philosophical points with the Tramalfadorians  who can see into the fourth dimension of time  Vonnegut brings up the inevitability of death with Billy knowing how he will die  and the Tramalfadorians seeing into the future and already seeing the end of the universe  Yet  as they argue  things will happen  and have happened  and there s nothing people can do about that  A Tramalfadorian will blow up the world  and it has always blown up the world  Vonnegut challenges the concept of free will  something that I have not seen many other authors do  Overall  I really enjoy the fact that Vonnegut prompts the reader to think about the world in a way they may not have thought have  I enjoy his writing style because it is very different from other authors   I d say that this is about PTSD  but it s about trauma while it s happening  and not just after the fact  I m not going to attempt an in depth review of a book millions have had to read and write about for school  While Vonnegut s curt  pun intended  writing style can be irritating  I liked that the story wasn t 100  for or against war  He never says that the bombing of Dresden was necessary or unnecessary  it s not really about the war at all  as I read it  Instead  it s about the effect that living through a war can have on a person  The one character  Billy  who lived through it is traumatized it  but the military leadership  in the form of the main character s last hospital mate  is clueless of what war is actually like  It was interesting how Vonnegut illustrated the trauma created a numbness and emotionless state in Billy  he hardly notices his family  seems to feel nothing  years after the war  as people die around him Looking through a handful of other reviews  a few people seem caught up in the whole story line involving the aliens  It seemed to me that this was clearly Billy expropriating bad plots from sci fi novels in some convoluted attempt to make sense of the horrors he witnessed during the war  Anyways  I liked the book much more than I thought I would  Full stars  I m rating this five stars because it sold an original philosophy of life  effectively  I had resisted reading it for years because  to generalize  I found that the people who enjoyed Vonnegut enthusiastically were less willing to engage emotionally with art  or other people  Not saying it s true  just saying that was my impression  The book isn t emotional  But it is very good  My taste seeks deeper treatments  but I can t fault the book at all  I read it fast  it kept me interested  I liked the aliens  approach to time quite a bit  There is a sadness throughout it that is never confronted by the author  but that s not a flaw  The protagonist doesn t confront much  So no drawbacks  but I m personally drawn to meatier material  The book did remind me how much I enjoy war novels though  And maybe that s a worthwhile point  After war  an artist must be entitled to expressing things in a more detached or skeptical way   I m so ashamed to say that I haven t read anything by Kurt Vonnegut yet  So here it goes  finally   I definitely have a new favorite author  Time to buy all the books Or borrow some from the library    Hey guess what  I m a 17 year old suburban hipster boy now  because I just read Vonnegut for the first time and I really liked it  And guess what else  I didn t actually read it  I listened to it in the car on the way to and from North Carolina  And here s the thing  Ethan Hawke was the narrator  If I were the 17 year old girl I was half my life ago  I would date the boy me   The Main character of this book is a guy named Billy Pilgrim  Billy Pilgrim is  unstuck  in time  This means that he jumps uncontrollably through random parts of his life  His life first starts off with Billy entering WWII and then getting captured but right before he gets captured he shifts through time and sees all of his life  After the camp gets blown up in Dresden and the war ends Billy becomes an optometrist  The night before his daughters wedding he is captured by aliens and they explain their concept of time as well as find a mate for him  When he gets back he gets into a plane crash and feels its right to tell the world of his experiences in his book  He does this by writing letters and recording things on a tape recorder  All of these events happen do not happen chronologically in the book and will pop up at random times due to Billy s time problem  A big theme of this book is that free will doesn t actually exist  The aliens that abduct him tell him this  only on earth is there any talk of free will   Vonnegut 180   Also it is shown throughout the book by the fact that all his life events are predetermined and he can t control any of them  War being terrible is also a big theme  which is shown by all of the destruction talked about that was caused by the war   The author s style is very interesting in this book  First the fact that most of the war parts in this book are true just from a different perspective   All of this happened  more or less  The war parts  anyway are pretty much true   Vonnegut 1   The author also adds to this by having himself be in the book during the war parts  This creates a more interesting story knowing that some parts of this are in fact true and it gives a historical retelling feel to it at certain parts  Also  making it not chronological was also an interesting choice  This forces you to piece it together yourself and it reinforces the fact that he s jumping through time  This also puts you in the character s shoes more because you experience a lot of his life the way he had to experience it again  Another style choice I noticed was the lack of a climax  The story never really built up to anything  you just figured out more things about Billy s life  There are slight climaxes but they are blurred because the book isn t chronological  This makes the book interesting because it s unusual and different from most books  I really enjoyed this book  I like the originality and style of the author that makes the book different  I m also a big fan of WWII stuff and since most of the war parts are true that just makes it even better  Also the interesting aspect of random time travel also adds to the book s experience by making it more exciting  I would definitely recommend this book to someone  especially someone who likes Science Fiction and WWII books and doesn t mind the fact that it s not chronological  This book isn t too difficult of a read  This book also has some nice themes to it that appeal to many readers that are interesting and different  True literature  No pretension or fluffy MFA turns of phrase  Honest and good   i stopped reading for quite a while  been using audio books more than actual books so going back to reading felt really goodi really liked this book not because it was a classic  and still is  but because it has many life lessons hidden behind the weak and frail main character named billy pilgrima person can find quotes almost on every page of this book and i found that they spoke to me on a very personal levelsome of these wonderful quotes   And I asked myself about the present  how wide it was  how deep it was  how much was mine to keep    or There is no beginning  no middle  no end  no suspense  no moral  no causes  no effects  What we love in our books are the depths of many marvelous moments seen all at one time    or   God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change  courage to change the things I can  and wisdom always to tell the difference   i laughed a lot at this war story  don t blame me  read it and you will laugh too death had little meaning in this story was in this book  every death followed by  so it goes i am really glad that i read this book after a long break  cause now i feel motivated to read more books  wnh gwt z m dwd nwysndh hy

and forth in his own life  and to the planet Tralfamadore  Here he meets another time traveller from Earth  the porn star Montana Wildhack and they fall in love and have a childIt s an anti war novel focusing on the fire bombing of Dresden  a civilian city with no war industries in the vicinity  by the RAF  Billy is a prisoner there during the bombing  living in the disused slaughterhouse of the title In all his work  Vonnegut asks naive  apparently artless yet somehow supremely art full questions to expose the sham ethics of modern life  For me  the memorable example in Slaughter House 5 is when Billy   unstuck   watches a propaganda film and sees it backwards so it appears the planes are sucking the bombs back up  and are then shipped backwards across the Atlantic where the bombs are dismantled and their mineral components carefully put back in the earth A must read  it ll only take a day  And if that s too long  George Roy Hill s 1972 movie is excellent too  Slaughterhouse Five is one of my favorite books so far  it s kind of hard to wrap your head around  Billy Pilgrim is telling us how he becomes unstuck in time and goes back and forth throughout his entire life thus far and his experience in Tralfamadore  In reality he s experiencing post traumatic stress disorder  Billy Pilgrim was a prisoner of war in world war two  he was the sole survivor of a plane crash  and his friend Derby is executed in front of him by firing squad  He makes up the Tralfamadore abduction to help cope with his PTSD  Slaughterhouse Five is about many things such as war  love  hate  post traumatic stress  sanity insanity  aliens the ones from space   it s about life  and it s about death  So it goes  Sometimes in life our perception of reality is not the same as others  Billy Pilgrim struggles with this when he tries to tell his daughter about the Tralfamadorians  She doesn t believe him  which makes the PTSD worse  I had much different expectations about this book  I wasn t quite expecting it to be about aliens and becoming unstuck from time itself  With that being said  I still really enjoyed the book  and everyone who is 16 years and older would be able to comprehend and understand the book  while still enjoying it  If you have a lower reading level I wouldn t recommend it  there are some parts where you should have a higher reading level  So it goes  Billy Pilgrim s story was very eye opening for me and I highly recommend it   Listen Billy Pilgrim has come unstuck in time  This book pushes the reader to question the parameters of insanity  to travel to new places  and to doubt the fabrics of space and time as we know them in the third dimension From the get go it is captivating  intriguing  and laugh out loud funny more often than one would think upon going into the novel  It subtly brings up points and talks about the negativity of war without ever be outright  and Vonnegut handles the controversial opinion with great tact and delicacy Not only does Slaughter House Five make strong points and provoke complex thoughts  but it also shows how literature can truly been an art form  It is wild  funny  and overwhelmingly beautiful in places  A true masterpiece That being said    Poo tee weet    Sad  witty and heart felt Kurt Vonnegut s book  Slaughterhouse Five  took me into a very ugly historical period  the bombing of Dresden during World War II  with a character so unassuming and unheroic I felt for him immensely  The character I m talking about is Billy Pilgrim  Optometrist in Ilium  New York  soldier  alien captive and Post traumatic stress disorder sufferer  From the moment Vonnegut introduced him I was surprised at how young he was when he went to war and started a family because of all he experienced and struggled to overcome   Periodically  despite feeling lost when the story veered into science fiction and gallows humor  I became fascinated by how creatively Pilgrim attempted to survive  His full commitment to his fantasy life as an abductee by the Trlfamadorians to Tralfamadore was as admirable as his time as a clueless POW  Known as an  anti war novel   Slaughterhouse Five  lives up to its reputation and definitely opened my eyes about the true reality of war  Holy mother of god  this book was good  I mean  I expected it to be  because  well  Vonnegut  but DUDE  Would it be overly dramatic to call it life changing  Raise your hand if you want to say  so it goes  all the time after reading this book  READ THIS BOOK  A commentary on war told through the eyes of Billy Pilgrim  a prisoner in WW2 Germany who was abducted by aliens from Tralfamador and who endlessly skips from one event in his life to another  Superbly written  Great characters  Layers of meaning  Slaughterhouse Five by Kurt Vonnegut was a very great book  Reading the unique story of Billy Pilgrim was very enjoyable I liked it because the story was very true  Not in the fact about what occurs in the story but the message it brings to the reader  The theme of the book can relate to everyone in society  and Kurt Vonnegut displayed that theme in a brilliant way  The author displayed satire throughout the book  For example  Billy Pilgrim s friend was executed for stealing a teapot out of the rubble of Dresden  The teapot being a such invaluable item is what gets him killed after surviving the bombing of Dresden  This ironic black humor is stating the injustice war brings  Throughout the book  Billy encounters many deaths  When someone dies his saying that he acquired from the Tralfamadorians was  So it goes   This occurred quite a lot during the book  This is a metaphor displaying that too many people die in war  I would recommend this book to anyone who finds interest in WWII and fans of Speaker For The Dead  I feel like I should start off by saying that I am entirely aware that a review for Slaughterhouse Five is completely unnecessary  I also know that I should have read this book at some point in my life far before now  since I subscribe to the Earthling concept of linear time That being said  here s my review I ve actually never read any Vonnegut  I m not sure why  I m pretty sure as a writer myself that is a pretty unforgivable oversight  I m fixing that though  starting now Slaughterhouse Five is the story of Billy Pilgrim  one of those souls that goes to war and never really sees it  A series of events lead to him never seeing actual combat  but witnessing one of the biggest atrocities of the wars in Europe  This is all mixed in with time theory  making the best of what life gives you  the price and devastation of the human spirit when confronted with war  with a generous dash of comedy to make it an easier pill to swallow Shortly put  it s an American classic for a reason and if  like me  you for some reason haven t gotten around to reading it  you should probably fix that sooner rather than later   This might be the first book I ve ever re read  but inspired by the Kurt Vonnegut club in  the universe vs alex woods   I decided to listen to it out loud  I m glad I did  This is one of my favorite books Repetition doesn t irk me as much as the brutalities displayed in this novel  but others may disagree with the intent  though I think it s clear  So it goes  Great and brutal  Now to the next Vonnegut  This is an easy to read  hilarious and cleverly narrated novel which I would recommend to anyone even if they hate reading  Like really  This tells a story about a WW2 veteran who wrote a novel about WW2 veteran and ended with a sound of bird s tweet  It doesn t even make sense to me at first  I know  The protagonist  Billy Pilgrim were described as a wimpy college student enlisted as a soldier  and turned into an optometrist after the war ended  At some point in his life he got abducted by some extraterrestrial beings known as Trafamaldorians  whose form resembled toilet plungers with little arms that grew along its shafts with eyes in each of its palms  In Trafalmadore  Billy was taught many things about perception of time  life and death  also from their fateful encounter he learned about the alien s famous phrase used as a response to unfortunate  inevitable death   So it goes   Like I said before  this book is really crazy and hilarious  the author was a genius  I liked the alien s way of life in that they only look at the good things in life  The illustrations in the middle of the story was also adorable  Really love it  When you ve seen too much the imagination is a safe place to be  At least your mind is safe in the world you make up  I have to read this book again  I loved it so much  every sentence is special  I loved this book which  believe it or not  comes as a bit of a surprise to me since it includes alien abduction and a war that isn t fictional  World War II    things that would usually put me off a book pretty quickly  But they didn t  In fact  I loved the aliens  I loved every telepathically transmitted word they said as much as I loved the war scenes  Why  God knows  I ve been trying to figure that out ever since I put the book down  The prose was simple enough  Actually  it was simple to the point of being misleading  at first it gave me the impression that I d picked up something painfully unsubstantial  If I hadn t been so desperate to read ANYTHING  I might have committed the terrible mistake of setting it aside after the first few pages  Having said that  I am desperately glad I didn t because it didn t take long for the book to dish out some heavy handed surprises   like the unbelievably refreshing plot  for example  In it  Billy Pilgrim  the main character  in case you were wondering  is thrown through different times of his life completely against his will and not in a boring time traveler s wife way  either  His constant whizzing around is accompanied by a series of very interesting remarks on the nature of time  curtesy of the aliens   war  human relations  bible references and almost everything else you can think of  I will say  however  that the main focus of the novel is time  Duh  Hence the time traveling  right  WRONG  since the best remarks  in my most humble opinion  just happen to be about this subject  Now  if you were still wondering about the plot  whether you would like it or not  what effect the constant time travel had on the story  then I recommend you read the following quote  Each clump of symbols is a brief  urgent message describing a situation  a scene  We Tralfamadorians read them all at once  not one after the other  There isn t any particular relationship between all the messages  except that the author has chosen them carefully  so that  when seen all at once  they produce an image of life that is beautiful and surprising and deep  There is no beginning  no middle  no end  no suspense  no moral  no causes  no effects  What we love in our books are the depths of many marvelous moments seen all at one time  It s from the book itself and I think it describes Slaughterhouse Five to a tee  If you read that quote and don t like the sound of a Tralfamadorian book  then  my dear  SH5 is not for you  Because that s it  It s the story of a man who lives his life in an order that isn t chronological  It s a compilation of scenes connected by the fact that he lives them  It s brilliant  It s human in the most honest way  It s something  god damn it  It s really something but it may be that kind of something that s not for you quite yet   and if that s the case  I recommend you keep the title saved somewhere and check it out in a few years since it s certainly worth reading at some point in your life  The most curious and bizarre part of reading this book  for me  was reading of the last few pages  I finished the book  reading about Billy s experience in the last few days of the war  as my music player shuffled to  Imagine  by John Lenon  I guess all I can say is  so it goes   The children s crusade  is an accurate title for a book about wars  We know wars are fought by  as the book puts it  babies  We know these babies are fighting wars that are not their own  and that to glorify wars is just another big fat lie we tell ourselves  Yet there are wars    Maybe this is why Trafalmadorians were amazed by the fact that Earthlings believe in free will This book  like  All quite on the western front   does a through job of showing the reality of wars and the experiences of a soldier  So many bitter smiles     Ended up liking this one a lot more than I thought I would  once I figured out Vonnegut s tone  I can definitely see myself rereading this in the future Reread in September 2013 I don t think I ve ever read anything quite like this  and I appreciate it for trying so many should be contradictory things to its ultimate strength  It s probably the most  holistic  book I ve ever read  not only because of the sci fi  post traumatic stress disorder  or is it   yes it is   time travel conceit of the storyline itself  The same devices and little bits of language are used in vastly different contexts  so flexibly that even after reading it I don t know how Vonnegut planned going in to pull all of this off  And so it goes   for example  has a very specific meaning within the book that I can t really explain without spoiling the entire plot  but it s used to connote a sort of sad fatalism  as whimsy  as commentary on war  as a deconstruction of human perspectives on death  and to unfold the trauma and coping mechanisms of the story s protagonist  while somehow also being used in a tongue in cheek way as some of the cleverest  funniest moments I think I ve seen in a novel on such a dour topic as the massacres of war  Throughout the book  and in countless instances  Vonnegut occupies a particular way of framing and interpreting reality so fully that even brief narrative utterances within the story end up having such a specific and relevant meaning that it s really delightful to catch all of those little contextualizations  And beyond that you have a layer of autobiography  with Vonnegut himself adding a layer of perception and commentary which I expect he included to drive his perspective and aims for the book home a little more And to avoid the risk of going on too long as I usually do and picking apart a few things of interest to me at the expense of the book itself as I usually do  I ll end by saying that it s that humanist undercurrent to Slaughterhouse Five that I most appreciated  Truffaut said that it s impossible to truly make an anti war film  since  and I lazily paraphrase  the action will always end up being exciting and jingoistic and glamorize war itself  but if it s possible to create an anti war book this is it  Here s a novel which does nothing but make war look petty and wasteful and thoughtless and destructive  and those who participate in it weak and wasteful  There s no glamour or appeal to war here  while at the same time the commentary is deliberately a little muted and often very subtextual  Still  Slaughterhouse Five is  within a postmodern sort of construct which doesn t come to any pessimistic or optimistic conclusions  a very human book  one which achieves some things that another book would have to be as funny and poignant and surreal and disjointed and empathetic in order to even aim for  See these tears so blueAn ageless heartthat can never mendThese tears can never dryA judgement madecan never bendYou wouldn t believe what I ve been thru I won t pretend anything I write here could possibly bring anything new to the table  So I ll just say my long overdue introduction to Vonnegut did not disappoint   This is the audio CD version  ready by Ethan Hawke I thought this was an outstanding novel  The writing is superb  The literary   poetic devices used by KV  eg   So it goes   are fascinating I especially liked his depiction of the main character  Billy Pilgrim  watching a WWII movie backwards  This  opposite  of a war film is wonderfully and tenderly handled by KV  even including a note that it is women who do the work of dismantling the bombs  Of course on reading this  one immediately realizes  then  it is women who are building the bombs which are dropped on Europe  killing in turn women and children in Germany So I rate this a 5  as an outstanding example of literature in its genre  with superb prose  and unique  if not likable  characters Regarding the audio  Ethan Hawke only enhanced the experience by tenderly relating the character of Billy Pilgrim and his getting unstuck in time   The crowning glory of Kurt Vonnegut s early years  After this  the reaction was   Oh  yeah  Vonnegut   Before then  it was always   what now  What next  WTF  I had caught up with Vonnegut by the time Schlachthof Funf came out while I was a high school senior  I d read everything I could get my hands on between the time I was 16 and 18  thanks to Joani Walker  who introduced me to Vonnegut  Hesse  and Judy Collins Kurt Vonnegut is one of the most imaginative of American writers  and everyone owes themselves the pleasure of digging into Vonnegut s multiverse  And I am going to close with a comparison between Vonnegut and Twain being twins born of different centuries  I loved this book  Having downed my first two Kurt Vonnegut books this year  I can say I am a fan  I bought a third earlier in the week Two questions I had while reading Slaughterhouse Five  why was this not required reading in high school and why did I not read it as a teenager  I enjoyed everything about this book  the way Vonnegut so effortlessly commands the English language  without pomposity  The time travel  the commentary on the nature of war  life  existence  The humor and the darkness inherent in life so beautifully captured in a novel  That last sentence is super corny but that s how I feel  Vonnegut is a genius  this book is brilliant  and I wish I had read him it sooner  The only reason I didn t devour this book in like 3 days is because I am in a new relationship and texting too much during my reading time Also  just skimming the other reviews  I really liked that this was a war novel without being a war novel  And I like that Vonnegut s prose is so poetic  I read this book back in high school  and I obviously forgot everything about it except the parts that took place in Dresden  I love Vonnegut in general  and this book is no exception  My favorite is still  Mother Night James Franco s narration was pretty good  Some reviewers have complained about his monotone delivery  but I felt it was in keeping with the tone of the novel  Billy Pilgrim is so disconnected from his life that it makes sense for the story to be performed in a detached manner  I m looking forward to discussing this with my book club in a few weeks  Eto ochen  krutaia kniga  Voobshche  Vonnegurt krut  no eta kniga ego masterpis  Mne ne khochetsia ee opisyvat   Mne khochetsia prochitat  ee zanovo  Ia vse skazala  Son muchos elementos los que se pueden desstacar de esta  una de las obras cumbres de la Literatura del siglo XX  En primer lugar  habria que destacar la finalidad  Nada que ver con Literatura por Literatura  Hay una afan claro  Kurt Vonnegut pretendia seguir los pasos de Norman Mailer  que es nombrado en la obra  y de otros combatientes durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial  evitar que una guerra pudiese repetirse  Si bien  Mailer opta por la via realista  por hacer hincapie en toda la crueldad y la atrocidad  e incluso en los valores positivos de los que fue testigo  Vonnegut en cambio hilvana una historia de ciencia ficcion  pero al fin y al cabo el objetivo es el mismo despertar el aborrecimiento de la humanidad contra los conflictos belicos Vonnegut utiliza un hecho historico y ademas de harta controveria  como es el bombardeo y destruccion de Dresde cuando la guerra parecia encaminarse a su fin  Lo de Dresde  como lo de Hiroshima o Nagasaki no fue mas que un intento por anticipar el fin de la guerra  por evitar que el conflicto siguiera sesgando la vida de los soldados aliados  pero quiza como sucedio con las ciudades niponas el precio a pagar fue demasiado alto El otro lado que merece la pena destacar la estructuracion espacio temporal de Matadero 5  Tal vez influido por la teoria de cuerdas el tiempo no es lineal  Pero no es un mero corta y pega  Los cambios son fluidos y lo que es mejor argumentados  No seguiremos profundizando  Dejemos esa labor al lector  This doesn t just break your heart  it rips it off and steps on it until it s dust  And it somehow even makes you laugh a bit in the process  The book  Slaughterhouse Five  by Kurt Vonnegut is a novel about a man named Billy Pilgrim  Billy is a war veteran and this novel shows his post war visions and his confusion of what s real and what s his imagination  There are three different time periods that this book jumps through  current time  back in the war  and sometime after the war when billy was abducted by aliens  or Tralfamadorians  The writing of this novel is pretty easy  but most of the things Kurt says actually has a much deeper meaning if you think about itThe main focus of this book is Billy experiencing the firebombing of Dresden as a prisoner of war  However  the more important part of this book is the slow degrading of Billy s mind  He starts losing his mind after he is abducted by aliens from the planet called Tralfamadorians I enjoyed this book  despite all of the confusing time changes  I always felt like I was standing right next to Billy  Kurt did a fantastic job of using powerful imagery and describing every environment in great detail  I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who hasn t read it already  Slaughterhouse Five is one of my favorite books of all time  and deservedly so  It is a wonderful comedic romp  and a wonderful piece of fiction in general  The tone of the book is a bit cynical  but its a soft cynicism  a calm acceptance of humanity s nature rather than a grim denial of hope  Vonnegut gets the reader hooked from the get go  weaving the making of the book into its narrative in a strange yet interesting way  Despite the humor  this book nearly brought a tear to my eye more than a few times  I would give this book a 5 5 stars  II have little to complain about it  although some of the raunchiness was a bit weird    But she did look back  and I love her for that  because it was so human  So she was turned to a pillar of salt   I re read this after more than twenty five years  and I now remember why I love Vonnegut  Time to re read more of his  One of my favorites  I have read it many times  and find myself confused and transported each time  So it goes    My first Vonnegut and a real revelation   clever  funny  heartfelt  direct and yet quite elliptical    eight   She made him feel embarrassed and ungrateful and weak because she had gone to so much trouble to give him life  and to keep that life going  and Billy didn t really like life at all  I bought a copy of this book when I was in middle school  but I never read it  I tossed it into my tote bag earlier this week to read on the train  but when I went to open the book  it crumbled to pieces  The slightest touch  turning the page  not to even mention dog earing  would leave little flakes all over the brown NJ Transit seats  I left pages of Slaughterhouse Five every where I went  It s almost painfully meta   I ended up taking the book out at the library   Listen This really IS the best book in the Universe  Everybody should read this book  If you have not read this book then YOU should read this book  You should read this book NOW  EVERYBODY should read this book now  There should be teams of people whose sole purpose in life is to deliver this book to other people so they can read it  These teams should work day and night  twenty four seven  and only be comprised of people who have already read this book  Publishing houses should print hundreds of billions of copies of this book  There should be so many copies of this book that it is everywhere  all the time  You should not be able to go about your everyday routine without having to take this book off of stuff  All of your stuff should be under this book  If you have children that can t read they should each carry a copy of this book so they may be of use to people who CAN read this book  Copies of this book should be FREE  they should be given away with fast food and movies tickets  You should have to throw this book away before you can eat your french fries and popcorn  Rubbish bins should be so full of this book that you can t throw this book away  You should go to sleep at night on a bed made from this book  Your dog should bring you this book when you wake up in the morning  Everything you see  smell  taste  hear and touch should be this book  This book should never be out of your thoughts until the day you die  Your corpse should rest under copies of this book so that you have no chance to distract other people from Slaughterhouse Five  So it goes  Skylar BouchardMrs  Nagel8th period10 20 14 Book review of Kurt Vonnegut s Slaughterhouse Five Slaughterhouse Five by Kurt Vonnegut follows the life of Billy Pilgrim who has become unstuck in time  He can go back and forth between different points of his life  In that the reader is put into different scenes of his life  His life story goes a little like this Billy Pilgrim was in World War Two and held prisoner in a slaughterhouse in Dresden and then survived the bombing of Dresden  Then he was too ken to a mental asylum for PTSD  He later becomes a optometrist and marries a rich girl who was also very ugly  had kids  was taken captured by an alien race called the tralfamadorians who saw time as one big stretch of land that they can visit  sees his wife die and dies himself  The concept of time already being predetermined and the idea of there being no such thing as free will as well as the effects that war has on a person that has survived it is explored in this novel  The book paints a realistic picture of war by making it more humiliating than tragic or heroic  I feel like a lot of anti war novels exploit the tragedy and make it seem surreal and unbelievable where as even though this novel is ment to be a little surreal in itself it makes the tragedy of the war part of the novel seem more believe able  Kurt Vonnegut uses humor to make the reader more aware of what is happening in the novel and catch the reader off guard  It is interesting how the entire novel as well as the main character has a tone and feeling of detachment especially as a way of dealing with grief  For instance the novel doesn t engross you and the character of Billy Pilgrim believes he does not have free will and is merely a observer of his own life  Although the main character is an interesting and engaging character he is the only one that does feel real the rest are very underdeveloped in a sense and I wish he could ve made the minor characters a little more fleshed out   I gave this novel a five out of five  It achieved what it wanted to and seemed to encapsulate how war effects people in a realistic manor  I recommend this to the existential   One of my all time favorites  The book shows that there isn t a reason for everything   Re reading this years later and it s still great  Thanks  Kurt   Normally books I have to read for school i find rather unbearable and boring  However this book is something else  Each word on the pages play with a different emotion  the book has parts that make you want to laugh  and other parts that make you sad  but not the type of sad where you cry  It s more of a disappointment in the actions of others  What I really enjoyed about this book was the use of  time travel  to tell the story  It s a different way to look at things  each event sparking a travel back to a future or past occurrence  Also the little innuendos that you would occur bringing you back to something that was said or brought up earlier in the book  I also really enjoyed that Vonnegut made his way into Billy Pilgrims journey throughout the novel  It s one mans journey into an alternate reality to cope with what he has seen before  showing you his experiences as he goes along   Normally  I don t enjoy surrealist writing  Unfortunately  I think I can actually be a bit close minded against that genre  and would probably call them trash instead of great literature  But Slaughterhouse Five is an exception  There is no consistent timeline  no interpersonal conflict  no established setting  or anything that should go into the making of a good story  But it is genius  Honestly I thought this book was incredible  a complex ideological theme converted into a relatively easy read by masterful authorship  It combines humor with disgust and despair as it explores the tragedies of WWII  growing older  sanity  and the concepts of death and identity in general  It s dark and sad but beautiful at the same time  and it has become an instant favorite for me  illogicism and all   Brilliant Comedic  tragic and poetic  The repetition of the line  so it goes  has a definite purpose which I found extremely affective  It transports the reader out of a morbid mindset after reading an account of the horrors of war  into thinking with the  alien  philosophy posed in the book  Yes  terrible things occur  but those moments do not define a life  all moments are as real as any other  Great writers who have experienced war and write about it  tend to have an objective view  which serves us better than merely trying to shock readers with graphic descriptions that highlight the ugliest side of human nature  Instead Vonnegut allows readers to experience these things as an outsider of our world would  What you get is a reading experience unlike any other   Slaughterhouse five was an inspiration for a lot of media today that I frankly had never realized  I really enjoyed how Billy s life was described as a series of time hops and revelations  I think it is almost a more realistic way of how people think about trauma  and how sometimes traumatic events can permeate our memories before them  just as easily as they can effect our experiences after them  Vonnegut also explores the concept of free will and inevitability or war while still trying to remain anti war  The biggest theme seems to be that traumatic events affect people  and that merely by experiencing trauma  the world has been affected  He s doesn t ask you if bombing Dresden was right or wrong  he merely wants you to understand that people were changed by it  Overall I loved this book and thought that the way it was delivered was done masterfully   Full review on my podcast  Check SFBRP  110  I read this book in  almost  one sitting  It was dark  beautiful  and its pace  spellbinding  This is my first Kurt Vonnegut novel  I thought his voice was sincere and close  reading this book felt like sitting down with the man  in a moving train cart  while he recollected his experience  and those of others both real and imaginary  in fragments  Little snippets and seemingly ordinary details of the desolation of war are both beautiful and terrifying  I loved every page of it  and will definitely be re reading it   Something tells me that this book is going to linger in my subconscious for a long time  I feel a bit hollowed out after having read this story  I feel like Vonnegut achieved his goal to capture the blatant fruitlessness of war  the unreasonable justification of what we do under the premise of something  being necessary   It smacks of the ridiculous  but in the most painful way  Like capturing the feeling of helplessness that turns a tragedy into an almost absurd moment and you laugh even while tears blur your vision  Yes  this book is going to stay with me   So it goes   Brilliant   I m on a long term quest to read all the books of Vonnegut  and subsequently post reviews here   While on a nearly six hour flight  I cracked open this novel  and zapped through the life of Billy Pilgrim  I didn t necessarily become unstuck in time  but I did seem to escape the concerns of spending a quarter of a day trapped in an aluminum tube zooming across the sky at 30 000 with limited legroom If one were to cull the top three from the Vonnegut canon  this book would have to be among them  That and Cat s Cradle and perhaps Breakfast of Champions  It s quirky  It s pithy  It s thought provoking  I want to say the book is all forward motion  but it s really not  What I mean is that the book doesn t drag  I think about a year that I  naively  decided to assign Player Piano to a sophomore class after reading 1984  I thought it would be a wonderful clash of dystopian books to compare and discuss  It wasn t that great a time  and I haven t returned to Player Piano since  because while it is a decent book it has moments that drag  The experience of reading the book is forward motion  but the timeline is nonlinear  A somewhat unreliable narrator to the side  who is and maybe isn t Vonnegut himself  tells the story of Billy Pilgrim  an optometrist and former prisoner of war and alien abductee  Flashing through time  readers go on a journey through the horrific bombing of Dresden  into a philosophical quagmire of predestination  an alien zoo  a plane crash  and the appearance of Vonnegut s oft used character Kilgore Trout  It s a blend of fiction and nonfiction  Vonnegut was a WWII POW and did live through the bombing of Dresden   It s a reflection on life and inevitability of death  with the refrain  So it goes   It s everything that you want a Vonnegut novel to be  well worth reading again  Fresh eyes are certain to see new things a second pass through  Who should read this book  Vonnegut fans  those who want nonlinear stories  WWII fans  those who find alien abductions of interest  philosophers  I was almost one hundred percent certain that Kurt Vonnegut would be one of my favorite writers prior to actually reading any complete work by him  I had only read the following letter  which was enough to make me fall for him  and scattered quotes here and there Despite containing flying saucers and aliens from planet Tralfamadore  I think it would be very silly to count this novel as science fiction  I think it s anything but  A friend of mine was once talking to me about Fyodor Dostoyevsky and he said something along the lines of feeling that Dostoyevsky wrote as though no one would ever read his work  consequently being liberated from the confines and crippling pressure to deliver  I think Kurt Vonnegut did the same  Speaking of Dostoyevsky   Rosewater said an interesting thing one time about a book that wasn t science fiction  He said that everything there was to know about life was in The Brothers Karamazov  by Fyodor Dostoyevsky  But that it isn t enough anymore   said Rosewater  Another time Billy heard Rosewater say to a psychiatrist   I think you guys are going to have to come up with a lot of wonderful new lies  or people just aren t going to want to go on living Kurt Vonnegut s writing is incredibly easy  beautifully absurd  and darkly comical  At times it felt like I was reading the echoes of my own inner voice   infinitely more eloquent  though   Am I ready to obsess over him and wade through everything he s ever written  Why  yes  yes I am So it goes  Kurt   Whatever happens  happens I ve come to believe that living is temporary  That life is a passing moment in time  That  I  am only here for a little while  That thought is both comforting and frightening  We live  And then we die That s it Is there meaning in this  I don t know Billy Pilgrim tries to find meaning  Through his adventures through time  the fire bombing in Dresden  the Tralfamadorians  Billy searches for a conclusion  The Tralfamadorians teach him that all that happens must happen  that it always has happened  and that it always will happen  There is no why  It just is  Everything is inevitable  There is solace in that  Life  but a movie with a never ending film reel playing the same stories  these stories only differentiated by their characters  over and over again without end  Life remains the same  Life will continue  Life has continued  and it will always do so  With or without us  I am a fleeting character  An evanescent settler  I won t be here for long  What happens in my life  has already happened  and it will always happen the same way  That s what the Tralfamadorians believe at least  That s what Billy Pilgrim believes at least I don t know what to believe    SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE addresses the triviality of life  It questions the perceived importance of events  Time passes  It will continue to pass  It has always passed  One day I will be completely forgotten  Every moment I lived  every heartbreak  every joyful tear I ve shed  every bad day  every good day  every thought I ve dwelled on  everything that I ve ever produced  will seize to exist  Nothing about me  from who I was to what I did  will be important  I will be wiped from history  And so will many others  But life will go on  It always has  and it always will  That is a truth hard to make sense of  Perhaps it isn t so hard to understand  Maybe it just is the way it is  Maybe I just am  Maybe that s just it To the Tralfamadorians  who see time all at once  I have already lived  I have already died  I am already gone  And there is no void left behind  The wheels keeps spinning  And that s it  Maybe that s all there is  all there ever was I understand this  In some ways  I can see it  In some ways  I can feel it     In the fire bombing of Dresden  people died  A lot of people died  Thousands died  And that s it People will always die  People have always died  People will continue to die IT is bigger than me There is comfort in that  There is comfort in knowing that  in a way  in the end  no one is important  That no one ends their journey differently  That we all die  That we all wither away into dust  dirt  and nothingness In 1000 years  when people will continue to die  I will be a forgotten memory  just like everyone else around me  So it goes    This novel is a masterpiece  I can do it no justice  It has touched me deeply  I am grateful for this moment  for having read it  for what it makes me feel  It inspires me to accept life for what it is  I feel comfort in acknowledging my inevitable fate  I will die  And that s it  I m not sure what that means  or what anything means  really  I don t know  But  I do know that I will die  That I will always die  That I have always died  I m okay with that  I think    NOTE TO SELF  I read the ending  last 70 pages   and wrote this review  whilst listening to   Spiegel Im Spiegel by Arvo Part    Despite the constant change of scenery and the unique organization of the plot  Kurt Vonnegut s  Slaughterhouse Five  flows very smoothly allowing the reader to keep turning pages  or pressing the page button  for those that read it on a kindle like myself   This book covers so much so beautifully if it is alright to describe a book like this as beautiful  It gives a history of the devastating bombing of Dresden while revealing the life of a veteran living with PTSD  Even though the idea of a time traveling  alien abductee might seem off putting to some  it just works  I want to share a part that really impressed me  Human beings in there were excreting into steel helmets which were passed to the people at the ventilators  who dumped them    When food came in  the human beings were quiet and trusting and beautiful  This might seem odd  but to me it taught that sometimes for human beings to really be a good human being they have to be brought to their lowest  I highly recommend this wonderful book  Nota alla recensione  Questa non e una vera e propria recensione  piuttosto e un insieme di riflessioni scatenate dalle parole in questo libro Cosi vanno i libriLi prendi  comprandoli in libreria oppure in prestito dalla biblioteca  e li inizi a leggere  Poi ci sono momenti in cui ti deluderanno oppure confermeranno quello che ti aspettavi da quel libro o ancora diversamente ti sorprenderanno  E alla fine  quando avrai letto l ultima pagina  ti avranno detto quasi tutto quello che hanno da dirti  Perche a volte  rileggendo un libro  riscopri qualcosa che la prima volta ti era sfuggita Nella vita ci sono piu cose di quelle che si leggono nei libriNei libri ci sono piu cose di quelle che si vivono nella vita Ditemi in quale vita si e mai visto un mago lanciare un incantesimo  viaggi nello spazio usando un motore ad improbabilita infinita e tante altre cose che ancora non ho letto  Certo  qualcuno direbbe che questo non e vero  non e reale  e una finzione  ma queste pensino di leggere un libro come il diario di Anne Frank  non e come se hai vissuto anche la sua di vita  ampliando la tua oltre quello che e fisicamente possibile A volte non c e nulla di intelligente da dire al riguardo di certe cose  E la guerra  le tragedie come quella di Dresda o anche quelle di Hiroshima  sono alcuni di questi argomenti  Cosa si puo dire al riguardo di persone che uccidono piu di 100 000 persone  principalmente civili  Sara sicuramente una cosa banale come  I bombardamenti a tappeto non hanno senso  oppure  Era necessario  Billy Pilgrim dice di sapere qual e il significato profondo del tempo  e anche se non lo enuncia mai chiaramente in tutto il libro  e semplice immaginare qual e  ogni momento e strutturato in un determinato modo  quindi  quello che accade deve accadere e la nostra sensazione di scegliere cosa fare e solo un illusione Finisco questa recensione che non e una vera recensione esprimendo il mio disprezzo per chi considera necessarie le guerre e tutti i congegni in grado di provocare massacri  I have no idea how it is I d never read this book before  It s a perfect little origami box of a book  full of layers of wonder  horror  humor  bemusement  joy  sorrow  and shame  The time travel conceit relieves Vonnegut of the need to build to a traditional climax while allowing him masterfully to thread themes  phrases  and images throughout the folds of the narrative  It s part history  part memoir  part sci fi  and part psychedelic trip  Justifiably a classic and an instant favorite of mine  So I like how this book begins and ends with the author writing in the first person  kinda setting you up and then tiring it all together by not tying it all together  I guess  I like how he tells the story of billy pilgrim in bits and there isn t like a traditional sequence to the evens  both kinda set you off balance a little chaotic  I didn t realize so many people died in Dresden  more than Hiroshima  Vonnegut doesn t like dress up war  I mean he s just real about it  War is going to happen  It s going to be horrible  So it goes  Vonnegut isn t trying to look back on the many courageous stories of WW2  like Job  he s looking back at the destruction of war  The tralmafadorians wanted Billy to look back on the  pretty things  from his life  which is really the opposite of what Vonnegut  Bioly did  I m still reading and thinking about what Vonnegut is trying to say about free will in this book  which is cool too  Like reading a book where you want to reread parts over and really contemplate what the author is trying to get across and what are my feelings towards those sentiments  Describing war in reverse really got me  I read that part  and I was like damn  That s so sad  You know it sucks      the ones who hated the wars the most  were the ones who d really fought   13    there is nothing intelligent to say about a massacre   24 Everything was beautiful  and nothing hurt   156   Billy didn t get to see Dresden do one of the most cheerful things a city is capable of doing when the sun goes down  which is to wink its lights on one by one   201This book makes me want to read more books by Vonnegut  from his  style   This is only my second review  so I ll preface by saying that I ll keep these short  unless I HATE a book  Also  some books have had so many things written about them  and I m just some rando internet guy I can t decide if Vonnegut is one of the  greatest writers of all time   as so many people hype him up  admittedly  I ve only read this book   but I love this novel  His style is simplistic  in a good way  that is  it s simplistic but intelligent   and his perspective is unique and funny  Honestly  I ve actually read this book twice in as many years which I ve never done  It struck a personal nerve  and I can t put my finger on why it resonated with me so much  Maybe it s that I think he has wonderful insight into tragedy    behind some of his cynicism about the human race as a whole is an empathetic view of other individuals that s both heartbreaking and warm   So it goes   might seem a little cold but I think the resignation makes sense if you ve witnessed death  Sometimes a life can t be saved   so it goes   I think the coldness of the phrase is balanced by the idea that a person is only dead at that moment   their life still matters because somewhere in time  they re still alive  That time still echoes after its own moment has passed  in the thoughts of the people that life affected  whether that person s impact was for better or worse doesn t matter  because all life has meaning   Maybe I m projecting some of my own views there  but I think I loved  Slaughterhouse Five  for that  Okay  the self aware humor also got to me  Kilgore Trout  underappreciated sci fi writer  Sometimes I wonder  if I was asked  what would I say was my favorite Kurt Vonnegut book  Re reading  Slaughterhouse Five  for the first time since 40  years ago  I m tempted to say this is it  But I know I ll think the same thing after  Mother Night  and so many others This may be the best example of why Vonnegut was the way he was  the way most love his writing  but some hate it  If you re not familiar with the fire bombing of Dresden  Germany by the Allies in World War II  do just a few minutes research  Find that it had no military target value  find that the number of casualties was way beyond that of our atomic actions in Japan  etc  Then realize that Vonnegut actually was  as an imprisoned soldier  in Dresden to survive the bombings  When I put myself in his shoes  I realize I d probably be pretty goofy  too  PTSD has been around for centuries  Slaughterhouse Five  is a quick read that gives some insight  a peek inside the head of the great American novelist  Warmongers might want to skip it  though  So it goes  I tried picking this book up for the first time when I was 14 and didn t end up finishing it  I wanted to be a Vonnegut fan  I wanted to enjoy the book and find an intense illumination within it like so many others seemingly did  Said expectation and desires took the wind out of my sails though and I think I m very glad that they did  If they hadn t I don t think I would have been able to appreciate it in the way I do now  upon finishing it a few minutes ago  For instance  I recently read The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath  Another book I wasn t at a place to finish as a teen because it flung open views within myself that I wasn t at a place to have or examine  As a very good lit teacher I was lucky enough to have once said   the best stories are the ones that come into your story at just the right time   I put both The Bell Jar and Slaughterhouse Five on the same level when it comes to a genuinely wrought plunge into depression  PTSD  and the fallible human  The main complaints I ve seen about Slaughterhouse Five seem to concern the ultimate style of the book which is often said to be less influential and impressive these days than it was when the book was published and the over usage of  so it goes   I m not a Vonnegut expert and will not pretend to comment on the whole of his work  But I will say that I took the style of this book as more a glimpse into the emotional and neurological effects of PTSD rather than a stylistic enterprise  It is certainly chaotic but  viewing it this way  I did feel it added an essential element to the book  As for the repetition  I believe it was also essential    at least from the context of Vonnegut s personal expressions  For example  I found myself remembering  time jumping to   various experiences I ve had with grief loss death as well as trauma  And  on the outside of those experiences  I don t think anything felt more poignant than these three words  I m hoping I can explain the above adequately    from my experiences  I don t believe grief is a vacuum that can be bottled up into a specific amount of time  I believe both it and PTSD span further than that in a lifetime  That you might grieve the loss of someone because of a random memory or because you re at a different level of maturity in your life and did not previously possess the same depths as you do in this moment  I think there isn t really a better example of this than that of children that lose a parent at a young age or soldiers that lose their friends in the middle of a war  There isn t a well for grief to draw from in the moment so you can easily see how it takes shape in different avenues of their lives  Such as a kid acting out  dealing with intense depression through a relatively happy event in their later lives  etc  This long standing relationship with grief  loss  ptsd  etc  also shapes the person s attitudes towards more personal loss or  at least  loss in an intellectual context  Hence   so it goes   Because for those that have crossed that line in life  that really is the way it goes  To some it may signify an ambivalence but  from my perspective across the line  I believe it is simply an accurate acknowledgement of reality and personal context  So I actually felt as if each individual repetition packed quite a wallop within itself   Kurt Vonnegut was  just before his death  referred to as the greatest living American author  I haven t read nearly enough books to make that claim  but I can see why it exists  Vonnegut s writing is supersaturated with heavy ideas  brought to life behind dark and unforgiving imagery  It is intense  Maybe SH5 it is so famous because there are so many ways to interpret its themes  meaning  and even what is reality in the book  Vonnegut s characters are not like able  because they are not supposed to be  Still  you begin to understand them  whether or not they leave you annoyed  Finally  and this is the reason I marked this review as having spoilers  I do not think this book is about war so much as it is about death  and life lived with naturalization or a fatalist view of death  War is the largest mechanism that Vonnegut uses to express his themes  but it is a result of these themes that the book critiques war  not the other way around  An anti war book would say that war was bad  but it was all fine with Billy Pilgrim  Maybe people think SH5 is an  anti war  novel because  at some level  they understand that the book is about death  and lives are the currency of war  One would be hard pressed to find a  pro war  book  especially when the option of being a hero is seemingly revoked  Read this book  You likely will not agree with everything Vonnegut offers between the lines of his curt and dark writing  but after reading  I consider it gold because of its capacity to raise questions about our purposes  goals and fears   This is my third Kurt Vonnegut novel and each time I am even more amazed by how extraordinary he is  Nobody in the world writes or creates stories like Kurt Vonnegut  he is honestly one of the greatest American writers ever to live  I m not sure I ll ever understand how he can write so timelessly  or how he can write satirically about tragedies without sounding despicable  I think he is a very human writer  and unlike a lot of male writers of the 20th Century  Vonnegut never feels like he s trying to create a masterpiece  even though he says he wanted to   he is just writing what he wants because he wants to   there is no pretentiousness to him  But in saying that  this book is a masterpiece in my opinion and I love that he was so against war  and like he wrote in his introduction  he didn t glamourise it  I definitely recommend this book if you would like to read Kurt Vonnegut book but never have before I can t wait to read more about Kilgore Trout in Breakfast of Champions  So it goes  This is a great book  It took me some time to get to Vonnegut s work  and Slaughterhouse Five is the first his book that I read  I am glad I waited this long  for this book had come to me at the right time  I don t think that I would I appreciated as much have I read it earlier I ve read somewhere that Vonnegut had never got to describe the bombing of Dresden which he says the book is about  But I think it wrong  All the book is about that bombing  about destruction   destruction of the beautiful defenseless city  of people living in it  taking refuge in it  of lives  of humanness  of being The book shows the mindlessness  meaninglessness and senselessness of the war  Wars are great forces  and though started by people  they grind people caught in them  mostly the young men  who were just schoolboys a couple of days ago  These kids aren t capable of comprehending the immensity and inevitability of the events  they get swept by the current and are engulfed by the forces  It must be hard for any human being to process all the killing  fighting and blood  all cruel and harsh reality of the war  I think that s why veterans don t talk much about what they ve been through The main character of the story  Billy Pilgrim  has been to war and witnessed the results of the Dresden bombing  just like Kurt Vonnegut himself did  He survived  he is no hero  Just a young boy caught in the war  He was just lucky  He doesn t understand the whys of the war  he accept the reality as it is  without even trying to change it  without trying to save himself  The will of individual  free will does not exist  he is passively takes whatever happens to him  He is broken by the war  And at the same time Vonnegut likens him to Jesus in a way that he accepts all the suffering without complaining and in a way that he  will die for a little while  and then live again  Vonnegut gives all kinds of explanations for the war   religious  political  economic  only to show that they have no meaning  all of them do not justify the massacre  the slaughter  the war I am sure that I will return to this book again and again  It is a sad and tragic book  very thought provoking  Even though  writing anti war book is like writing anti glacier book   I believe that the more people read books like this one  the better it will be for our world  I have avoided reading Slaughterhouse 5 because I couldn t understand how anyone could write a novel about the fire burning of Dresden  In the early chapters  it became clear that Vonnegut  a third generation German American who was on the ground when the air attack occurred  struggled with the same issue  It took him 20 years and 5 000 pages of discarded drafts to find a way  He even apologized for the book  saying there was really nothing intelligent to say about a massacre His approach is brilliant  We see the story through the eyes of a young  naive Billy Pilgrim who continually shifts his thinking back and forth to different events in his life  which gives him needed distance from the huge emotional and psychological scars that resulted from witnessing this horror  The perspective of Billy Pilgrim is child like and matter of fact  which allows us to process this event without his judgment intruding  An amazing  powerful  anti war story  one of the best ever told  and sadly fatalistic    There are almost no characters in this story  and almost no dramatic confrontations  because most of the people in it are so sick and so much the listless playthings of enormous forces  One of the main effects of war  after all  is that people are discouraged from being characters    Slaughterhouse FiveI had tried to read this book a few times  put off by the dry listless opening and apparent lack of direction  It didn t particularly help things that reading ebooks on a tiny screen is sort of terrible  But one day I had decided to trudge on past the 4  mark and finally make a dent in this story  It wasen t long before I was hooked  I can see why Kurt Vonnegut is such a big name The tone doesn t change and the direction doesn t sort  And it s wonderful  Where the narrative leads and the character it follows shortly after out introduction to the narrator fit with it so well that anything else wouldn t seem the least bit right  It s something particularly hard to explain but easy to understand if experienced  The philosophy presented in this book has got to be my favorite part about it all even more than our sweet little punching bag of a protagonist  though every character seems to be a punching bag of life s whim honestly   I really can t recommend this enough  Un libro interesante  bastante corto  definitivamente no es  lectura ligera  y definitivamente tendria que leerlo varias veces antes de entenderlo algo mejor  mezcla rara de aliens  el bombardeo sobre Dresde en la WWII  viajes en el tiempo y sanidad mental  la linea narrativa no es lineal y a veces resulta un poco chocante  un estilo expresivo casi paradojicamente simple para una historia tan compleja  la proyeccion de imagenes es bastante rica y fuerte  sospecho que en el fondo y a lo largo de toda la historia hay una critica al fascismo pero eso podria perfectamente ser invencion mia  Como dato extra  es uno de los libros mas censurados  por los consejos escolares  de la historia reciente en colegios de USA  I just finished all of the first six Vonnegut novels  except for the early Player Piano   It has been quite an experience over three weeks  In God Bless You  Mr  Rosewater  Vonnegut clearly and relentlessly makes his case for Humanism  As a cry for all of us to love one another without reservations  and without expectation of material rewards for such love  the book is effective  However  as a work of engaging literature it falls short  I tired of the many pages of the Rosewater family history  Also uninteresting was the bland midwestern town of Rosewater  of course that s how Vonnegut deliberately portrayed it  but I felt queasy after reading a few chapters of the dead end lives there  So  after reading the six early Vonnegut novels  Slaughterhouse Five and Cat s Cradle are the standouts   entirely original and deeply moving  Mother Night  which is a separate tightly focused tragedy  distinct from his other early novels  and Sirens of Titan are also classics in their own right  I thought Breakfast of Champions very funny but ultimately too over the top crazy even for me Summary Sirens of Titan  1959   5 starsMother Night  1961   4 starsCat s Cradle  1963   5 starsGod Bless You  Mr  Rosewater  1965   3 starsSlaughterhouse Five  1969   5 starsBreakfast of Champions  1973   3 starsHail to Kurt Vonnegut  Your spirit is out there traveling in a chrono synclastic infundibulum to Tralfamadore and the universe beyond  Kurt Vonnegut  1922 2007  I grew up during the worst of the Viet Nam War era  As a kid I never knew why we were fighting  Communism isn t a concept that a child can embrace as an enemy worthy of the most powerful nation on earth  That s what we were taught in school  that America was the most powerful nation on earth and undefeated in war  Yet here we were  in a stalemate against this little country  a country smaller than the state in which I lived  I could never understand that as a kid  I couldn t understand why we weren t winning or why we were fighting in the first place  I wonder what little kids think today about our current belligerency  We had high tailed it out of Viet Nam long before I ever read anything by Kurt Vonnegut  I didn t think much either way about Viet Nam  I didn t really have to  I wasn t going to get drafted to fight over there  the war was over  Most young kids today don t have to think much about the war in Iraq  it doesn t really have much to do with them  If kids do express an interest in the war it is most likely an opposing view  just ask military recruiters I was 17 when I happened upon my first novel of his  Breakfast of Champions  I found it funny and entertaining enough that I sought out more books by the same author  I think Slaughterhouse Five was next  but there could have been another one of his novels in between  Slaughterhouse Five was the first time that I ever stopped to consider the point of view of the vanquished  a literary device rarely used since The Persians by Aeschylus  a work I read later at university  A skeptic was born  at least a skeptical way of looking at what is often presented as reality was somehow facilitated by reading everything Vonnegut had written during my high school senior year Slaughterhouse Five had grave questions about WWII  a conflict most people view as the ultimate justification for war  Since then  the wars we have chosen to fight have had very questionable justification and even less purpose  Our present quagmire seems not only to have been instigated without justification  but our initial support  for those who did support it  was based on lies  Tens of thousands o people have died for a lie   So it goes   Vonnegut would say  Over four years since the initial invasion and we are up to our eyeballs in a conflict that just about everyone but our president knows we cannot possibly win  at least not without perpetrating genocide upon what s left of the Iraqi population  How delusional would you have to be in order to think that democracy will somehow take root beneath so much bloodshed  American kids keep dying at a steady rate in Iraq for a war that most of them are way too young to understand  and certainly too young to be fighting  Although the war was dreamed up by geezers like Dick Cheney and Paul Wolfowitz  it is being fought by 18 and 19 year olds  As a character in Slaughterhouse Five remarks   It s a children s crusade   Wars have always been fought by children  WWII was no exception but the nation s leaders were forced to send their children to fight  In the Iraq War it s only the other people s kids who are sent off to battle  There is no draft in this day and age of the  All Volunteer  military  instead we use a kind of economic conscription to fill the ranks of the military which defers most young men and women with any other choices in life  We send kids over to fight  bring them back  and then send them over again  sometimes three and four times  The military takes soldiers from retirement and sends them to Iraq  Military tours have recently been extended from one year to 15 months  This is yet a further outrage to be heaped upon the injustice of the current make up of the military stacked upon the untruthfulness of why we are in Iraq in the first place My skepticism led me to oppose this war  and the Gulf War  from the beginning  I didn t believe the reasons we were given to invade Iraq  I didn t believe the insanely optimistic predictions for a quick and inexpensive war  and I have absolutely no faith that we can in any way succeed in Iraq  You can partially blame Vonnegut for my skepticism  but my opinions are based upon what I know about the Arab and Muslim world  which I ironically learned while serving in the military  My predictions of what would unfold after we invaded turned out to be a lot more accurate than those of Wolfowitz and Cheney  We seem to have lost any sense of a collective memory in this country so no one seems to care what anyone said four years ago  After the invasion the Bush administration seemed to make a game out of coming up with new reason for why we had gone into Iraq as the reason they gave us initially proved to be false  In their way of thinking to bring up their mistakes was only being pessimistic In the battle of politics  those who oppose war generally lose out to those who believe in it  Our war in Viet Nam didn t come to an end because of the protests against it  we just seemed to lose all sight of why we were there in the first place  The war in Iraq will come to a similarly ignominious end  but not until Bush leaves office and can blame the inevitable result on someone else  Bush had four years to prosecute the war the way he saw fit and the result has been a disaster  Now he just needs the rest of his term to transfer the mess to the next unfortunate president The Bush administration has taken our national security to an absurd level  It is as if America s only raison d etre is to protect ourselves from any outside harm  and any and every moral compromise is justified to this end  torture  illegal search and seizures  wiretapping of U S  citizens  not to mention a war on false pretexts I always thought that instead of invading Iraq we should have bombarded the world with good will after 9 11  We should have made a quixotic effort to end hunger in Africa  or teach the entire world how to read  or cure malaria  or just done something truly heroic to show to the world that the United States of America stands for decency  If anyone was hell bent on our destruction after that they d be some lonely terrorists  even among their own kind  Of course  this kind of plan never wins out over war  I m just dreaming and the war people are realists   and look where their shitty plan has got us  I would have to go along with what Vonnegut has to say about mankind  and our nation    There s only one rule that I know of  babies   God damn it  you ve got to be kind   There are some classic novels that I love  but understand why other people can feel ambivalent about  The Lord of the Rings is my baby  but it s also thousands of pages of dense worldbuilding and now common tropes  Les Miserables is one of the most lyrical  well crafted  moving novels I have ever read  but it also contains about twenty pages on sewers and twice as many on the Battle of Waterloo  I love these books  but I can see why not everyone does Not so with Slaughterhouse Five  Oddly  I wouldn t rank it above those other books on my list of personal favourites  but if someone told me point blank that they hated Slaughterhouse Five  I think my brain would shut down for a few seconds and I would be forced to end the conversation by baking away slowly  repeatedly mouthing the word  false  I don t know what it is about this book that fills me with zeal  All I know is that I finished it in about 24 hours and Billy Pilgrim  Dresden  and the phrase  So it goes   have stayed with me ever since  It is funny  It is tragic  It is emotionally detached  and many of the characters are one dimensional  thinly veiled allegories  And it hits home with every single sentence Vonnegut s brand of satire was refreshing and effective  It definitely got me thinking  which was clearly his intention  I have to give this book 5 stars  because I think it succeeded in everything it tried to do   Si este libro es tan corto  confuso y discutible  es porque no hay nada inteligente que decir sobre una matanza  Despues de una carniceria solo queda gente muerta que nada dice ni nada desea  todo queda silencioso para siempre  Solamente los pajaros cantan      So it goesCon este prefacio Vonnegut nos trae la historia de Billy Pilgrim  quien cree haber estado en un zoologico de otro planeta y experimentar viajes en el tiempo La novela esta planteada en un orden no lineal y los acontecimientos se aclaran a traves de varios  flashbacks   o viajes en el tiempo en este caso  del narrador poco fiable  que describe  junto a diversas metaforas  rasgos surrealistas y situaciones absurdas el estado mental del personaje central  Vonnegut busca plasmar en Matadero Cinco que nuestro modo de enfocar la existencia es equivocado  el tiempo no pasa sino que simplemente es  que todo transcurre de forma simultanea  y que todo lo que nos acontecio  nos acontece y nos acontecera esta ya escrito  pues sucede que ser  vivir  crecer  morir  y volver a formar parte del origen  ocurre al mismo tiempo  pero se desmenuza lentamente a lo largo de la escala del espacio tiempo  En otras palabras  el Doctor Emmett Brown estaria un poco decepcionado Es asi de simple  y en consecuencia  todo nuestro arbitrario disco duro de creencias religion  libre albedrio  inmortalidad  etc   edificado en torno a nuestra incapacidad de asumir o entender esta verdad  es en si una pura ficcion   Farsa cosmica  mejor dejar cantar al pajarillo  Poo tee weet There are many intelligent aspects to the novel  but there is one that stands out for me  Vonnegut s most powerful aspect of the novel the   what appears to be   a very ironic and detached tone to the events throughout the novel  Billy Pilgrim nonchalantly remarks every story of a death  including his own  with the phrase  so it goes   The impossibly sane reply to the insanity of war  but isn t that ultimately insane in itself  Or perhaps it is something that can be stared into  The firebombing may be like a sun which you can t look into  but what part of Dresden the reader is left with is described as the surface of the moon  which in real life is something humans have proven to do anything to see  Like with the surface of the moon  we are obsessed in chronicling the wars of humanity  It is with this vague and ambiguous language that Vonnegut pulls the reader into action  Despite not appearing to have much to say  the reader ends up thinking for themselves and realising their own views of the themes of the novel  Vonnegut has written the closest representation of Tralfamadorian literature we may get    There is no beginning  no middle  no end  no suspense  no moral  no causes  no effects  What we love in our books are the depths of many marvelous moments seen all at one time   It is then that Vonnegut s mastery is realised   a jumbled structure that makes the reader think about the marvels  good and bad  of war all at once  I first read  Slaughterhouse Five  in 2007  That s seven years ago  In those seven years I seem to have forgotten how deeply it affected me  I re read it a week ago  Then read it again straight afterwards for a third time I hate war  I absolutely hate it  I m against armies and violence full stop  and believe that actions of war can never be justified  Never  As such  I avoid everything related to the topic  This book  however    Vonnegut doesn t glorify war in any way  His pacifist message is loud and clear  War ruins and kills  land  people  everything   So it goes   Our excuses are insufficient and are only created to prevent bleeding hearts when we realise the simple truth  that there are no excuses or acceptable reasons to hurt others  regardless of if the government military backs you up on it or not  This book is full of symbolism  repetitions and metaphors waiting to be stripped and analysed  Vonnegut s own voice occurs every now and then  slowly  ever so lightly  tying Billy s story to his own  I wish I could hug them both I still somehow find myself slightly stuck in time  just like Billy Pilgrim  I feel misplaced in a world that glorifies war  As there is nothing intelligent to say about a massacre  there is nothing to say about my coming stuck in time  I can hear the birds so clearly Poo tee weet  At only 177 pages  Slaughterhouse 5 is a semi autobiographical account of World War II with focus on the Dresden bombings  I have never read many war novels so this was a new topic for me and I found the way this book is written to be very easy to get into and surprisingly humourous One part that really struck me was about a third of the way through when narrator Billy Pilgrim describes a film he s seen about the war backwards  with the bombs being extracted by the planes from the burning cities to the bombs eventually being turned into minerals and buried so no one can use them  This was an interesting way of getting the anti war message across and it struck me as a poignant motif in the novel The time travel aspect of this novel was seamless and beautifully executed with Billy traveling from one time to another within paragraphs  It never felt jarring or unnecessary and I think that this is one of the main things that kept me reading through the book The quirkiness of this book was unexpected  I had heard little about it before reading  The themes discussed were vast yet remained entertaining throughout and I think that my reading of it would definitely benefit from a reread  Overall I absolutely loved this and I pretty much read it in one sitting  It is definitely one of my favourite modern classics  On the morning of March 22nd  2014  I decided I would sit down and enjoy a cup of coffee and browse through my Goodreads and pick titles to review  Nothing in particular stood out to me  as a lot of the titles  the jury is still out  on  I m looking at you   read again  rate again  shelf The sun hadn t appeared from behind the clouds and I wasn t quite ready to go outside yet  I had heard the door close  My family must ve just left for IKEA  My father says  No  we don t need to remove the seats from the back of the van  dang it   So it goes I decided in this instance that prior to going out to lunch  I would write a review of Vonnegut s  Slaughterhouse Five   It would be weird  not really specific towards the book but rather the style of Vonnegut s writing  and I would begin the review  I will read this another 4 000 times  I will read this another 4 000 times  Upon my first reading of Slaughterhouse Five  I hadn t had a chance to read it yet which is apparently curious  as many people I know had read it during high school   I picked up on one specific element of the novel that I found fascinating  how it functioned as metafiction   I m concerned that maybe I m grasping onto this aspect of it too much  as I just recently have dove into the world of postmodern lit and metafiction  but it still really was something I loved about the book  The way that the first chapter  essentially a prelude to the novel  ends and the novel begins was a moment where I got chills  Maybe it isn t supposed to be all that significant or fascinating  but it just was to me  Obviously throughout the duration of the novel   so it goes  and  and so on  appear multiple times  It was so interesting to me to hold the  novel   Chapters 2 end  up to the first chapter  talking about writing the book   I intend on writing a piece more at length about this  but it was just really cool to me  It keeps you aware that you re reading a book about a book being written and while the reader is supposed to really immersed in Billy s story  you can t help but feel like you re in the head of Vonnegut as he writes the book and it s curious plot  The plot in itself is fascinating  but I really loved how the novel functioned in this other way  I should just boost the book up to a five star rating Anyway  I also want to read the book again and really focus on the story of Billy and figure out why he decides the novel needs to function as  sci fi   One of my favorite things a professor I had during my freshman semester of university has ever told me is that the function of science fiction    speculative fiction  is to mirror our own reality in some way  Maybe the absurd nature of what s going on  Billy s story  being frozen  the aliens  lasers  etc   is supposed to be a way of showing the absurdity of war  Maybe it s supposed to function on another level  Maybe it s supposed to distract the reader from understanding the severity of what s going on  Again  I ll be giving this another read in the near future  Probably this summer  it s spring now  or something like that  As of now  it s a 4 5 in my book  It ll go up to a 5 at some point  but I m just not quite there  Brilliant novel by a brilliant man  Edit  screw it  giving it a 5  I haven t read this in ages but it s one of those books that sticks in the mind  You probably know that Kurt wrote this book based on his experience in Dresden during WW2 when the Allies turned it into some kind of living hell  At the time Kurt or his alter ego Billy Pilgrim was a POW there and witnessed the carnage first hand  This is an anti war book like no other  The funny thing about this book is that on the one hand it s a straightforward anti war gesture but then it s also quite a hilarious satire  The hero is abductees by aliens from and forced to mate with a starlet with the improbable name of Montana Wildhack  A name that reminds me of those parlour games where you make up your own pornstar name  Kurt was well ahead of his time here  I used to be a starlet once upon a time  Or so my agent told me  But I was never kidnapped by aliens  At least I don t recall it  Unless I m mistaken and this has all been a lurid dream  The point is that all starlets eventually lose their looks and no doubt Montana will as well  Those kind of things are finite  It s what you do with it while you ve got it that counts  So Kurt wrote this absolute spellbinding classic  It s unique and utterly brilliant  He also wrote Cats Cradle and Player Piano and several other crazy but perceptive novels  He must be one of the most original writers that ever existed  And one of the funniest  To read it is to step inside the mind of genius  How often are we afforded that glimpse of genuine greatness  Now will somebody tell me which swine has nicked my copy   One of those stories that demands research afterwards  I expected to be blown away  given the reputation  but when I finished it  I was a bit disappointed  The writing was splendid  I especially admired how Mr  Vonnegut could bounce around so much in a person s life but somehow keep it together so that as a reader I was never lost  The book was a quick  easy read but after finishing and mulling it over  then putting sense to the story of Billy Pilgrim  I realized that the reason I was unimpressed was due to my laziness in not seeing beyond the words  In my opinion  what I had read dealt with someone going through the hell that is PTSD but presented as science fiction  Having put that together  I feel that there is even more hidden within the words and while it brings awareness to the fact that the bombing of Hiroshima was but one of several massacres done via bombing  it also gives a nod to the soldiers on the ground and the hell that they dealt with  I hope to write like this one day and I am very glad to have read Slaughterhouse Five   Now here s the story  It is so short and jumbled and jangled because there s nothing intelligent to say about a massacre  Slaughterhouse Five is indeed short and jumbled and jangled  Billy Pilgrim leaps through time back and forth while dealing with PTSD brought about by his participation of World War II  In so many levels  war is ugly and doesn t make sense  and this book will probably not make sense on many levels This is how Slaughterhouse 5 makes sense to me  Billy Pilgrim was a baby who fought a war with other babies  In this war  the kind hearted babies like Billy Pilgrim experience how war breaks and makes depravities out of people  Billy  in his desperate bid to make sense of reality   has become unstuck in time   He discovers time travel  but unlike other time travel stories  Billy Pilgrim succumbs to fatalism  Billy accepts that what will happen tomorrow has always happened  and as the Tralfamadorian philosophy goes  tragedy and happiness cannot be avoided or made  Billy thinks all he can do is focus on the happier times  Vonnegut opines that humans tend to romanticize life experiences  and we do  according to science  because humans need to make sense out of the nonsense  Billy Pilgrim s leaping back and forth through time means he has a hard time remaking his memories  Forgetting or remaking memories could have allowed Billy Pilgrim to be more empowered  a little bit happier  more in touch with reality  It could also have made Billy Pilgrim romanticize and forget that massacres never made any sense  Billy Pilgrim should have had a happier life If the difference between fiction and reality is that the former should make sense  then a round of applause to Vonnegut for making fiction as close to as reality as possible  After a massacre   everybody is supposed to be dead  to never say anything or want anything ever again   but Vonnegut also writes that you can hear birds singing  Humans may have killed each other because they become resigned that conflicts and massacres cannot be avoided  but life may go on  I truly hope that he s right   Somewhere along the way  Kurt Vonnegut was asked what instrument he played   For a writer   he said   The instrument you play is your mind   To compose Slaughterhouse Five  he played what he called  the Dresden part  of his memory  This was my third read of S 5  I read it with my own  Dresden part  in mind  Funny how during my second read  Kurt s introduction to his 23 year effort of getting this story  out  slipped me by   I think of how useless the Dresden part of my memory has been   he writes     and YES  I m saying  YES  THAT S IT We all have a Dresden Part within us  It s where we ve lived through something that otherwise could have killed us or ruptured our sanity    torn away our hold on life  Some people  like Kurt  write books about their own Dresdens Kurt was there  in Dresden  when the city was annihilated  He survived in a meat locker  as did his alter ego  Billy Pilgrim  Billy time traveled  A lot  So did Kurt  I suppose  Time travel is one of the ways we survive a Dresden and its aftermath  Some might see time travel  in this sense  as dissociation  Whatever it is  it s a saviour to sanity  It s imagination  doing its part to keep us alive  It s the beautiful human brain at DEFCON 5  It s the experience of being bombed  one way or another   To the victor go the spoils  of war  and the spoils so often end up being something like  a beetfield on the Elbe  that s crammed with people reduced nearly to rubble  The lunacy of war  an American soldier who s the last to die at German hands  a lad in Dresden  after the bombing  He s stolen a teapot from some ruin  He s caught  tried  found guilty  and shot in the back by a firing squad    Kurt  in the 1950s  writing a letter to someone at the Air Force to request official information about the Dresden bombing  A PR man writes back to say there s no info  it s still top secret  Kurt reads the letter to his wife  then says   Secret  My God    from  whom   Who actually does the filthy work of crazing and killing other human beings      Foolish virgins     right at the end of childhood     The wife of one of Kurt s veteran friends calls the men fools to imagine they re  men instead of babies     you ll be played in the movies by Frank Sinatra and John Wayne  or some of those other glamorous  war loving  dirty old men  And war will look just wonderful  so we ll have a lot more of them  And they ll be fought by babies like the babies upstairs     referring to her own children  Of Slaughterhouse Five itself  Kurt tells a friend that it s  so short and jumbled and jangled  Sam  because there is nothing intelligent to say about a massacre   Kurt s done it  He s also  perhaps unwittingly  written a profound testimony to what happens in the brain  body  and being of a person who s survived devastation     They had been     living like woods creatures  living from moment to moment in useful terror  thinking brainlessly with their spinal cords     He  nails  the experience of having been traumatized  There are glimpses of gorgeous humanity and humour throughout     like this moment when Billy Pilgrim and a few of his fellow soldiers come upon a group of girls showering in a huge  communal space       The girls screamed  They covered themselves with their hands and turned their backs and so on  and made themselves utterly beautiful      Kurt of himself  during his introduction to the story   I have this disease late at night sometimes  involving alcohol and the telephone  I get drunk  and I drive my wife away with a breath like mustard gas and roses  And then  speaking gravely and elegantly into the telephone  I ask the telephone operators to connect me with this friend or that one  from whom I have not heard in years   I had that disease myself for a while  when I was nineteen or so  Drunk dialling  we called it  Glad I got over it young    D     There are glimpses of mercy  and bliss  When Billy and his POW buddies discover a way to eat  on the sly  a liquid vitamin formula that they re producing for young women in the Nazi  Lebensborn  program  they make lollipops of the stuff  and share them         The spoon was a tablespoon  Billy thrust it into the vat  turned it around and around  making a gooey lollipop  He thrust it into his mouth    A moment went by  and then every cell in Billy s body shook him with ravenous gratitude and applause      Billy made a lollipop for  Derby   He opened the window  He stuck the lollipop into poor old Derby s gaping mouth  A moment passed  then Derby burst into tears  Kurt always said   Goddammit  babies  you ve got to be kind    And he was     oh  how he was     In honor of Banned Books week  I read Slaughterhouse Five for the third time  I was in high school the first time I read it  and I really didn t care for it  I found it confusing and much of the anti war message was lost on me I read it a second time about 6 years ago  and while I did enjoy it more then  it s clear after my third reading that I enjoy it more and more every time  I ve read probably around a dozen of Vonnegut s books by now and there is just something so unique about his writing  I don t know how to describe it  but I do know that if I picked up one of his books and started reading it  I would immediately know it was his  His voice is just that dynamic You all know that I adore Philip Roth and that I do believe him to be the best living American author  However  one complaint I ve always had is that he doesn t do soundbites well  Meaning  there aren t sentences he s written that can be taken out of the context in which they re written and still be impactful  On the other hand  Vonnegut has a way of writing completely gut punch sentences that just make you nod your head and wish you could drink some whiskey with the guy    I have this disease late at night sometimes  involving alcohol and the telephone    In summation  I love this book and look forward to taking even more from it the next time I read it  This was a remarkable book  and not at all what I was expecting  I knew it had anti war themes but I did not expect time travel or abduction by aliens  I was impressed how Vonnegut was able to convey the shell shocked horror of the war  The tone reminded me of Cormac McCarthy s  The Road     its understatedness serving to enhance the bleakness of the situation  as if when antipathy becomes overwhelming it gives way to apathy I liked the book s self awareness    the fact that it referred to itself  its opening and closing phrases  and that the author also placed himself in the book but not in the main narrative  A pretty early example of postmodern literature  Seems like it to me   Once I realized  partway in  that the main character s  time travel  and  alien abduction  were merely his deluded coping strategy for dealing with the aftermath of the trauma of war  and of a plane crash   and of making peace with his fatalistic outlook on life  the book made much more sense  but also became much sadder Phew  Quite a book  I may well need to read it again   Slaughterhouse Five by Kurt Vonnegut is about a man named Billy Pilgrim who has come  unstuck  in time  This means that he can jump back and forth through different periods of time in his life  In the story he may walk through a door in one period of his life and exit in another  This jumbled up sequence of events takes the readers through Billy Pilgrims experience in World War II and his life afterward as well as his abduction by aliens from the planet Tralfamadore  The book does not follow any particular string of time and often cuts out of one period and jumps to another part of Billy s life right in the middle of the action  Slaughterhouse Five doesn t really have a beginning  middle or end and there is no climax  conflict or resolution as is the case in a typical novel  I really enjoyed this book  This is the second time I have read Slaughterhouse Five but this was the first time I looked at the text from an academic point of view  I was exploring whether Kurt Vonnegut was actually referencing a subconscious or dream state  A lot of the text and events in the book could easily be referencing dreams or imagination  Vonnegut even talks about his main character Billy Pilgrim falling asleep in one period of his life and waking up in another  This could be Kurt Vonnegut making a point about how in our dreams time is not a factor  You can relive something that happened thirty years ago  He also makes a point about death and that in a dream a person can be alive who has been dead for years so time is only a part of our conscious state  While I don t believe that Vonnegut actually meant that everything that Billy Pilgrim is going through is actually a dream he does use it as a tool throughout the book to make his point about the way humans perceive time   The book Slaughterhouse Five is written by the famous author  Kurt Vonnegut  Kurt Vonnegut wrote many books a few of them are Cat s Cradle  Breakfast of Champions  Bluebeard  The Sirens of Titan and many more  Slaughterhouse five is one of the few novels I had a hard time putting down  It is about a man who goes by the name Billy Pilgrim and his time traveling  experiences in the war after and before  A man tells Billy Pilgrim story from childhood to his death along with all the friends he gains and loses   In the novel Billy Pilgrim kept traveling through time  from his war days to his elder days to his childhood and even from planet to planet which keeps the story fun and interesting  Kurt Vonnegut added jokes at the perfect time and he made Billy Pilgrim feel like the reader knew him for a long time  Also whenever he introduced a character he would say how they met and how they died  but continued talking about them through out the book  which made the novel unique  One weakness in the book would be the first chapter  It was very confusing and didn t at all relate to the book  The reader couldn t tell who was talking  In my opinion the first chapter wasn t necessary at all and could have been taken out to cause less confusion   Slaughterhouse five definitely has its strengths with one small weakness making it almost a perfect novel  It is the kind of book someone could read over and over and each time discovers something they hadn t noticed the previous time through  Anybody who likes a war story  a funny book  a book with some meaning or a book that will stay in their mind for a long time should consider Slaughterhouse five   Slaughter House Five is written by Kurt Vonnegut  Kurt Vonnegut was born November 11  1922 in Indianapolis  Indiana  He died April 11  2007 in New York  He has written numerous novels  such as the Player Piano  The Sirens of Titan  Cat s Cradle  Slaughterhouse Five  and Breakfast of Champions  The book Slaughter House Five is about a man named Billy Pilgrim  who is trying to write a book about his war experience in Dresden  Throughout the story Billy travels through time to the war  his adult hood  his death  and to his zoo enclosure on another planet  I found it interesting how he could time travel with no consequences  By this I mean  I find it interesting how he doesn t even try to change his fate  He knows how he will die  so why doesn t he try to stop it  I also find it interesting how he goes to an alien planet that thinks of him as a perfect beautiful human being  This is interesting because it makes u think that if an alien life form exists  we might be to them as animals are to us  In this novel I found no weaknesses  The whole story was perfect  The beginning was a little slow  but it had to be in order for the reader to get the proper background information that they needed  There is nothing that the author could have changed to make this novel more interesting  This whole novel is just enjoyable  and a great read  The whole story keeps you interested and wanting to read more  to find out what happens to poor Billy Pilgrim  This book should be recommended for people who like action  science fiction  and have a great imagination  Just reread Slaughterhouse Five  and I wanted to mention a narrative technique that is demonstrated perfectly in its pages  Vonnegut  who in the introduction to the novel admits the years of difficulty he had trying to write a novel about Dresden  found that the only way he could tackle the subject was to write about Billy Pilgrim and his time hopping  The weirder  science fictional elements of the novel allow Vonnegut the distance and perspective needed to write a novel that takes a stance without being preachy  that is entertaining even as it condemns the firebombing and the horrors of war  It allowed him to remove himself  if not completely  then mostly from the novel s pages  which is what gave the book its universal resonance  If this book had been closer to memoir  I imagine that after a brief initial impact it would have faded away  The book s endless reprinting is a testament to the power of the unreal in fiction  and as a narrative device it should be explored by any writer wishing to deal with themes too weighty for even the most solid prose  By lightening the weight  the prose can move more freely  can craft a story that the reader will enjoy  This book  one of the first that I can think of that follows the bizarre and ever evolving literary technique that is magical realist based partially on very lightly veiled facts from the author s life is one of my favorite and most eye opening books that I have ever read  I remember having read it at least four or five times in high school  reminiscing on the punctual nature of the youth of Vonegut s main character as he waded through his marriage  bodies  aliens  and other elements from his life  trying to make sense of it all in a world that makes no sense most of the time  It is a gorgeous book  Short  sweet  simple and important  it helps to navigate many of the struggles associated with modern  first world manhood  while retaining the magic and mysticism of Vonnegut s writing  Reading it as an adult  I can see so much more than the adolescent version of me has  It is uncanny how a book  on subsequent readings as one gets older  experiences more  and can have more to contribute to the book as a reader  can change over time  The format and the style of this text almost begs for the reader to supply their own experiences and lay over the glossy film of their own lives onto the page and onto the characters in Slaughterhouse Five  That we all have struggles  guilt  pain  and experiences as men  and as our struggles continue  so do the struggles of Billy Pilgrim continue  over and over again  as heartless readers project their own meager and boring existences onto this character as he recounts his own life over and over again  We do not give him a rest  just as we do not allow ourselves a rest  and we constantly live in the repetitive  a centipede of flesh over time over the generations This book is amazing  and should be required reading where it is not  It is a shame that I was never assigned this book and that I had to ultimately approach it on my own  but  I think that it part of the magic of the text  as its ability to metamorphose over the years to become such a stable and standard chevron of manhood  an overarching symbol that everything in the world is brutal  everything is not meant to make sense  and everything will ultimately be okay  Review originally posted on my blog  http   utahmomslife blogspot com 2011   For years my only association with Kurt Vonnegut was from the Rodney Dangerfield movie Back to School  In case your husband hasn t forced you to watch it numerous times  help me    I ll give you a quick synopsis  Dangerfield plays the part of a successful and rich business owner who goes back to college to help support his wimpy and struggling son  Only  Dangerfield discovers that he prefers college style partying to studying so he pays Vonnegut  playing himself in the movie  to come and write a paper about himself for his English course  He fails the assignment because as the professor  and love interest  claims  obviously Dangerfield didn t write the paper himself and whoever did write the paper didn t understand the first thing about Vonnegut My long distance book club that I maintain with former college roommates added Vonnegut s Slaughterhouse Five to our reading list last summer  but we fizzled out and didn t get to it  So we decided to try it again this year  I didn t know what to expect  Honestly  because of the title  I have confused it with Sinclair s The Jungle for years  Surely it has something to do with our meat industry  Right It s not like that  At all Vonnegut s Slaughterhouse Five is funny and irreverent and shocking and hysterical and moving and poignant and seriously disturbing  I enjoyed every minute And just so you know  Vonnegut is a creative genius nutcase  Oh and he swears  A lot  I read this once before and remember feeling a bit disappointed  thinking that I loved Vonnegut so much but felt this was supposed to be his best work     it was a little while ago  so I thought it would be such a quick read to go through it again and give it another shot  now that I ve got a good 11 or 12 Vons under my belt  Vonnegut really is such an amusing writer to be read  so full of satire  dark humor  and irony mixed with incredible insight  philosophy  cynicism  and told with style and form as unique as his name  I definitely enjoyed this a lot more this time through  and I feel that I didn t really give it a fair shot before  I don t know if it was just that I was a bit unfamiliar with his style before or if I was expecting it to be one of the top 100 books on Time s list  which it was is  but it still gives you an unfair prejudice  and was expecting something else  I actually remember my dad saying that he read this a number of years ago and took exception to the fact that the novel simply stated   Billy Pilgrim had come unstuck in time   and never explained why  how  so on and so forth  I remember thinking that the first time through and felt that I took exception as well  but this time    and again  maybe it s because I ve read more of his stuff and have seen the way he treats  time     I felt like all the UFO stuff and  unstuck in time  stuff was simply a metaphor for a soldier with a fractured mentality  experiencing flashbacks  remembering horrible realities  indescribable terrors  and imagining peculiar unrealities  Is this a sci fi version of Post Traumatic Stress  It sure works with his style of short  1 2 page sections that switch back and forth from the exposition to the resolution and back and forth and back and forth    I added an extra star this time through for the brilliant emphasis on  death  and  time   both of which I think were a bit lost to me before as I was simply trying to get through the story rather than appreciate all the subtle nuances  jokes  and moments of heartbreak  Such is life  So it goes   When Kurt Vonnegut died in 2007 I vowed to reread  Bluebeard   my favorite Vonnegut  It is somewhat autobiographical  painting a picture of a man who is uncomfortable with his talent and unsure of what his soul has to say  It was when I was rereading  Bluebeard  that I remembered reading  for the first time  another book by Kurt Vonnegut  A book that changed my soul and the way I looked at the novel In the same way  Ulysses  transformed the literary world by using stream of consciousness   Slaughterhouse Five  transformed fiction by melding fact with fantasy  As a bookstore owner  where would you place  Slaughterhouse Five   In the fiction section  In the fantasy section  Non Fiction section  It does not really matter except that it deserves a placed next to the most important books ever written  The melding between fantasy and nonfiction opened my eyes to the world around me  I remember reading  Slaughterhouse Five  for the first time and I could not believe that it did not follow a time line  Like his main character  Billy Pilgrim  who was abducted by aliens who experience time non linearly  Vonnegut creates a novel whose time line can not be mapped  I loved this  I realized that I did not even know I was placing limits on what a novel could be  As the moments of Billy Pilgrim s life are being pieced back together  a terrible yet beautiful picture of our world emerges  Underscoring everything is what happened to him during World War II  Each death is met with the same sentiment   so it goes   Vonnegut does not judge  he only shows It was not important that Billy Pilgrim really did become unstuck in time  What is important is that what was happening around him was a senseless as if he had become unstuck in time  The bombing of Dresden wiped out a beautiful city and killed 130 000 people  Is that fiction  Shouldn t it be fiction  Vonnegut s blurred lines between fact  fiction  and fantasy bring his anti war message home with the clarity of a true artist  an artist who  with the brush of his pen  opened his soul for all to see  Billy Pilgrim  fatalistic ex soldier injured in a plane accident  psychologically scarred in the Dresden bombing  gets  unstuck in time  and flickers back and forth through all points of his own past  present and future   which include a stay on the planet Tralfamadore  Or  he may be a nut  he lived through the firebombing of Dresden  and it scarred him Based loosely on Vonnegut s own experiences  this is a remarkable book  both for its detached wisdom in discussing the Dresden massacre  and for its fantastic  careening imagination  Though I wonder how useful Vonnegut s meta  textual self commentary is   a typical moment is when he stops his narrative to explain the epigraph of his book   Vonnegut is clearly a philosopher and a great writer with an eye for catchy phrases and scenes   fizzing with rabies    among the things he could not change were the past  the present and the future    so it goes    A wonderful testament to the absurdity of human existence  So it goes  Read twice  12 2 01  9 25 06    I tedeschi e il cane erano impegnati in un operazione militare che aveva un nome spassosamente esplicativo  un attivita umana che di rado viene descritta nei particolari e il cui solo nome  riportato nei giornali e o nei libri di storia  da a molti entusiasti della guerra una sorta di appagamento post coitale  E  nell immaginazione degli appassionati della guerra  quello svagato gioco amoroso che segue all orgasmo della vittoria  Si chiama  rastrellamento    Morti  guerra  guerre  mattatoi per umani  mattatoi per animali che salvano esseri umani che vi si rifugiano durante il bombardamento di Dresda  morte e morti senza senso   Cosi va la vita  uomini che assistono all assurdita indicibile  insensata e incomprensibile che e la guerra  Vonnegut sopravvissuto al bombardamento su Dresda ci mette 23 anni a scrivere della sua esperienza e lo fa nel solo modo possibile  in maniera insensatamente folle  all apparenza   La guerre  le guerre sono una follia  assurda  insensata  datosi che queste follie esistono a questo punto tutto puo esistere anche il sig  Pilgrim e la sua singolare vita  che  come Vonnegut  da prigioniero di guerra americano dei tedeschi e sopravvissuto al bombardamento di Dresda per un puro e folle caso  viene rapito dai tralfamadoriani  i quali avevano bisogno di un esemplare umano da esporre nel loro zoo  Pilgrim dopo questa esperienza su Tralfamadore  puo viaggiare nel tempo della sua vita facendo andate e ritorni nel suo passato e nel suo futuro  Sa anche esattamente il giorno della sua morte e come morira  E perche no  a questo punto tutto e possibile anche che i tralfamadoriani non siano tanto diversi dagli umani  Billy Pilgrim dalla sua gabbia nello zoo e tenuto anche a rispondere alle domande degli abitanti del pianeta  uno di essi gli chiede quale sia la cosa piu importante che ha imparato su Tralfamadore fino a quel momento  Ho imparato come gli abitanti di un intero pianeta possano vivere in pace Come sapete  io vengo da un pianeta che da tempo immemorabile non fa che compiere massacri insensati       I terrestri devono essere il terrore dell universo  Se per ora altri pianeti non sono stati minacciati dalla Terra presto lo saranno  Ditemi dunque il segreto  cosi lo portero sulla Terra e saremo tutti salvi  come puo un pianeta vivere in pace  Billy credeva di avere fatto un discorso molto nobile  E rimase sconcertato quando vide che i trafalmadoriani si chiudevano le manine sugli occhi  Sapeva per esperienza che cosa significava  aveva detto una stupidaggine   Le    le spiacerebbe dirmi     disse alla guida  molto sgonfiato   cosa c era di tanto stupido in quello che ho detto   Noi sappiamo come finisce l universo     disse la guida   e la Terra non c entra niente  salvo che sara spazzata via anche lei   Come    come finisce l universo   disse Billy   Lo facciamo saltare in aria noi  sperimentando nuovi combustibili per i nostri dischi volanti  Un pilota collaudatore tralfamadoriano preme uno starter  l intero universo sparisce   Cosi e la vita   Se sapete tutto questo   disse Billy   non c e qualche sistema per prevenirlo  Non potete impedire al pilota di premere il bottone   L ha sempre premuto e lo premera sempre  Noi lo lasciamo e lo lasceremo sempre fare  Il momento e strutturato cosi   Allora     disse Billy andando a tastoni   immagino che sia stupida anche l idea di impedire le guerre sulla Terra   Naturalmente   Ma oggi voi vivete in pace  su questo pianeta    Oggi si  In altri momenti abbiamo guerre terribili  le piu terribili che abbiate mai visto  Non possiamo farci niente  percio ci limitiamo a non guardarle  Le ignoriamo  Passiamo l eternita contemplando i momenti piacevoli    come oggi allo zoo  Non e bello questo momento   Si   C e una cosa che i terrestri potrebbero imparare a fare  se davvero si sforzassero  ignorare i brutti momenti e concentrarsi su quelli buoni  E gia  Bisognerebbe proprio che ci sforzassimo di ignorare i brutti momenti della vita Concentriamoci su quelli buoni  E via  Cosi va la vita Vonnegut ovunque tu sia magari anche su Tralfamadore sappi che ho apprezzato molto il tuo libro  e stato bello leggerlo  grazie per averlo scritto Succede raramente che un libro mi faccia pensare a questo  Ancora meno che lo scriva  I finished The Book Thief on vacation and immediately went to the local indie bookstore because the back blurb had a comparison to Slaughterhouse Five  My first two Vonnegut novels were more obscure  but I loved them  It was time Random thoughts   Kurt Vonnegut is brilliant  You already know that  as did I  But it s good to remind oneself occasionally   I love the description of  novels  on Tralfamadore  They are full of symbols messages and are absorbed at one time  not sequentially  There isn t any particular relationship between the messages  except that the author has chosen them carefully  so that when seen all at once  they produce an image of life that is beautiful and surprising and deep  There is no beginning  no middle  no end  no suspense  no moral  no causes  no effects  What we love in our books are the depths of many marvelous moments seen all at one time   I would love to know if anyone else finds a similarity between Billy Pilgrim and Pi  from Life of Pi   I certainly do  Final thought  War is hell  So it goes  z shhkhrhy by nZyr dbyt Hwdthy khh bry byly

is    well  it s hard to figure out the plot  to be honest  The characters are often unlikable  The concept is absurd  The genre is impossible to pin down  is it science fiction  philosophy  comedy  drama  something completely new    And the storytelling is all over the place  But the interesting thing is that the mess that is Slaughterhouse Five is also profound  thought provoking  sometimes humorous  sometimes dramatic  and always absolutely riveting  It is one of the most fascinating books I ve read in a long time and grabbed my attention from the very beginning Describing the book is next to impossible  Suffice it to say that it is about a man named Billy Pilgrim who is  unstuck in time   This means that he lives his life out of order  sometimes in one time and sometimes in another  At some point along the way  he serves in WWII  is captured by Germans and survives the bombing of Dresden  which is  I had to look this up  considered one of the most pointless bombings ever conducted in wartime because Dresden held no strategic advantage  Also  along the way of living his jumbled life  Billy Pilgrim is kidnapped by aliens who put him in a zoo and have him mate with a kidnapped movie star named Montana Wildhack See what I mean  It sounds ludicrous at best  But that is something of the point with this book  The insanity is there to both obscure and highlight the book s message  The author calls the book an  anti war  book  and I think he is right  But it isn t like other anti war stuff  It takes a very different view  It looks at war as pointless  not because of all the life lost  but because it doesn t make any difference if you kill anyone or not  They still live in time That was the concept that drew me in most  the idea of living in time  According to the book  every moment is already structured  We live now and forever because we live in the moment  The best we can do is to make sure that we live most in the good moments  War makes no sense because you can t kill people  not really  They live in the past and will always live in the past  As the author says  again and again and again    so it goes  I don t buy into all of the author s philosophy  It is too fatalistic for me  insisting that we can t change anything  not even the end of the universe  even if we know what will cause that end  I believe more in free will  Maybe that is naive  but so it goes The thing is that I don t have to believe in the author s philosophy  I enjoyed the mental exercises this book put me through  I enjoyed reading another viewpoint and exploring the possibilities  I enjoyed the quirky prose and well written sequences  And I enjoyed just thinking about new ideas and concepts  For me  all of that made this book one of the best and most interesting books I have read in the last few years I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in a good book that will make them think  And through it all  maybe  just maybe  the book will help them appreciate the good moments in life a bit more before we all go when the Tralfamadorian pilot presses a button on the new kind of time warp engine that wipes out the universe So it goes  After re reading this for a third time I picked up on so many new elements that I had somehow overlooked the first two times  I know the character  Kilgore Trout  shows up in most Vonnegut novels but I had totally missed the fact that Howard J  Campbell  the American Nazi war criminal from  Mother Night   makes a few brief appearances in here and so does Eliot Rosewater  I feel like an idiot for missing key pieces like that  I m getting rusty Anyways  this is probably one of the best instances of Kurt Vonnegut s literary genius  It s a staple in every collection and is one of the best  anti war  books there is  Vonnegut is a master at conveying the absurdity of war and does a brilliant job of getting his point across by introducing the unforgettable Billy Pilgrim  Billy has come unstuck in time and  Slaughterhouse Five  or the Children s Crusade  is Billy s journey back and forth through different parts of his life  Billy surviving the fire bombing in Dresden during World War II  Billy marrying his wife  Billy being abducted by aliens  and Billy practicing optometry  The prose and the back and forth of all these moments is brilliant and some of Vonnegut s most memorable quotes are found in these pages If you haven t read this already  what are you waiting for  I didn t read this book in high school  I didn t like to read what was assigned in high school because I thought that if it was assigned it probably sucked  I took an easy english class my senior year instead of doing AP english  and now I have a degree in literature  Also  now I feel like my appreciation of this book is in earnest  and not in response to being told to like it  Like the Stranger  I read this again to talk it over with a friend who was also reading it  I must have forgotten how humanistic it is because there were parts of me which were aching when reading it this second time  and that is a beautiful feeling  Everyone knows that this is a great book  so I doubt this review will do much to convince anyone of much of anything  but it is always nice to be reminded of something great  which is exactly what Vonnegut just did for me  Moments before I found out he died I was talking with a roommate about how much stupider this country would be without him bringing up the average  which was exactly the case since upon hearing that he had died we drank whiskey and walked around bumming cigarettes from people  But it is these stupid things that we do that Vonnegut is so forgiving and enamoured with  I don t think stodgy intellectualism is of much interest to him so hopefully he would appreciate a couple of dumb kids getting drunk to his memory   If I should ever die  God forbid  I hope you will say  Kurt is up in heaven now   That s my favorite joke     Slaughterhouse 5  came to my attention a while ago after reading an article about a Missouri school board that banned the book for his profanity  apparently  it would make a sailor blush    and for practically everything else  Coming from a family where the notion of banning books is as foreign as the currency and political history of tralfamadorians  except from my grandma  but that s another story entirely   the rash accusations made against this story awoke my interest in it  Would it be more demeaning towards humanity as a whole than Jersey Shore  Be more violent than a Tarantino movie  Would I find in its pages a recipe for homemade bombs  or  don t raise your eyebrows  that was actually the underlying message of a popular TV show I know  would it teach girls that the easiest way to escape poverty is to get a boob job and become mistress to the local drug lord Of course not Instead  I found  Slaughterhouse 5  to be a brilliant and moving account of how war messes you up  sprinkled with dark humor and aliens  It was also a condemnation of the decisions that lead to massacres like the Dresden bombing  but also a justification of war on the basis that  sometimes  it is necessary to prevent a bigger evil  Here s the plot  Through disorganized vignettes we come to meet Bill Pilgrim  World War II veteran  who believes he s unstuck in time and is forced to go back and forth through it reliving the most important moments of his life  In case you re wondering  one of those moments deals with the complete obliteration of Dresden at the hands of allied forces  and another describes his kidnapping by a tralfamadorian spaceship  which then made him live in a zoo with a young movie star  Unlike the Missouri School Board  I happen to think that  Slaughterhouse 5  has some valuable lessons in it that made it worthy of a place in a library shelf  For starters  it reminds the reader of how there are no winners in war  You re either in the losing side  watching everything you know and love disappear from the face of the earth because a man you ve never seen decided that bombing your city and killing you would be the perfect move to force an enemy to surrender  or you can be on the side that wins  condemned to spend the rest of your life reliving a tragedy and questioning the point of your own existence  Either way you re fucked  and if you don t believe me ask some of the thousands of war veterans all over the world that have suffered from Post traumatic stress disorder as a direct consequence of their involvement in a conflict  The reader might also remember that there s hope in any situation  if you re brave or crazy enough to look for it  Bill Pilgrim finds comfort in the idea that time is not linear  and that gives his life a purpose it lacked before  As someone who is still battling with the desperation that inevitably comes with the certainty that there is nothing out there  and no real reason to go on  I could sympathize with Pilgrim  although the origin of out despair is completely different  and in that sense  I was touched by the message of hope that in my view is the ultimate message of  Slaughterhouse 5   If we want to keep our sanity in this day and age we better remember the good times and live for them  or risk losing our sanity  And now I have something new to talk to my therapist about   Memorable Quotes  there s several  It is so short and jumbled and jangled  Sam  because there is nothing intelligent to say about a massacre  Everybody is supposed to be dead  to never say anything or want anything ever again  Everything is supposed to be very quiet after a massacre  and it always is  except for the birds  And what do the birds say  All there is to say about a massacre  things like  Poo tee weet    There are no characters in this story and almost no dramatic confrontations  because most of the people in it are so sick and so much the listless playthings of enormous forces  One of the main effects of war  after all  is that people are discouraged from being characters  But old Derby was a character now   He is in a constant state of stage fright  he says  because he never knows what part of his life he is going to have to act in next   We went to the New York World s Fair  saw what the past had been like  according to the Ford Motor Car Company and Walt Disney  saw what the future would be like  according to General Motors  And I asked myself about the present  how wide it was  how deep it was  how much was mine to keep   Like so many Americans  she was trying to construct a life that made sense from things she found in gift shops   And Lot s wife  of course  was told not to look back where all those people and their homes had been  But she did look back  and I love her for that  because it was so human So she was turned into a pillar of salt  So it goes     He was a funny looking child who became a funny looking youth   tall and weak and shaped like a bottle of Coca Cola    The most important thing I learned on Tralfamadore was that when a person dies he only appears to die  He is still very much alive in the past  so it is very silly for people to cry at his funeral  All moments  past  present and future  always have existed  always will exist  The Tralfamadorians can look at all the different moments just that way we can look at a stretch of the Rocky Mountains  for instance  They can see how permanent all the moments are  and they can look at any moment that interests them  It is just an illusion we have here on Earth that one moment follows another one  like beads on a string  and that once a moment is gone it is gone forever     He ate a pear  It was a hard one  It fought back against his grinding teeth  It snapped in juicy protest    If what Billy Pilgrim learned from the Tralfamadorians is true  that we will all live forever  no matter how dead we may sometimes seem to be  I am not overjoyed  Still  if I am going to spend eternity visiting this moment and that  I m grateful that so many of those moments are nice   I met Kurt Vonnegut at a small discussion group held at Reed College in 1966 67  The discussion was in the living room of my turn of the century  19th to 20th  dorm  kind of shabby and dark  He talked almost exclusively about his struggle to write about his experiences as a prisoner of war during the bombing of Dresden  It was my first real taste of the complexities of WWII  Though my father was a veteran my understanding of was barely more than the comic book version of Nazi vs  Good Guys  Kurt Vonnegut talked to this group of mostly 18   19 year olds as if we were adults  He was not sure he could ever write a book about this event that had affected his life so much  I picked up Slaughterhouse Five after it came out because it was by Kurt Vonnegut  I did not know it was the book he d been trying to write for 20 years  Throughout the book I could hear his voice from that hour I spent with him and a dozen or so undergraduates  I was amazed at the way he was able to weave this horrible experience with a really entertaining sci fi ish type of story  If I had read this in high school as a requirement  I don t remember  But then  I don t remember anything I read back then for some reason  Possibly it s too far back there  or I blocked it out  In any case  I m glad that I m reading Vonnegut now  starting with SH 5  I loved it  The subject matter  WWII  Dresden fire bombing  POWs was horrific to read about but Vonnegut s satirical writing style made it a bit easier First  I listened to this in audiobook format  narrated by Ethan Hawke  He did a wonderful job and has such a soft spoken voice that with earbuds in place  it was like the book was being whispered to me  I imagined Billy Pilgrim s voice sounding just like that  An added feature was an interview with Vonnegut near the end of the audio  And then  I believe Vonnegut himself  narrated a portion but I had to stop because of the loud background music that drowned out his voice   very irritating  I read the kindle ebook version next so I could take notes and fully digest this book  But I have a feeling that many readings will turn up things I hadn t seen or thought of before in previous readings  I love that about excellent books Vonnegut starts SH 5 saying that everything in the book happened  more or less  That the war parts are pretty much true  but changed the names  He set out to write his Dresden book and tells of his struggle over the years to  remember stuff   as he puts it  and the process he used as a  trafficker in climaxes and thrills and characterization and wonderful dialogue and suspense and confrontations   When he visited with a friend who was there at Dresden  the friend s wife was so mad at Vonnegut for writing a war book that will portray the soldiers as men instead of babies  meaning barely men  18 19 yrs  old   glamorizing war  making it look wonderful and encouraging more babies to fight more wars  Vonnegut told her  Mary  that he didn t think that he d ever finish the book but if he does  he ll call it  The Children s Crusade   That explains part of the title and the dedication of this book  I think that he succeeded in not glamorizing war so in that way  I would consider it an anti war book  sort of  Except that in an earlier excerpt  anti war books are compared to anti glacier books  It just can t be done Vonnegut even states that this book   is a failure  and had to be  since it was written by a pillar of salt    just before the story begins  Prior to that statement  he writes of looking through the Gideon Bible in his motel room for tales of great destruction  He lands on the story about Lot s wife and how she was told not to look back where all those people and their homes had been    But she did look back  and I love her for that  because it was so human  So she turned to a pillar of salt  So it goes    People aren t supposed to look back  I m certainly not going to do it anymore  The story is told through Billy Pilgrims s POV  He becomes a time traveler and is taken by the aliens Tralfamadorians  love that name  to live quite comfortably in their zoo  where he is provided everything he needs which includes a lovely mate  We follow Billy through his spastic time jumps which is a marvelous vehicle to include his horrid but also at times oddly funny and ironic WWII experiences  Through these brief sporadic time jumps  we learn Billy s life story  pretty much from beginning to end  all out of order and sometimes simultaneously  According to Tralfamadorians  people don t die  They only appear to die  That they are very much alive in the past  All moments  past  present  and future  always have existed  always will exist  Billy learns to say the Tralfamadorian expression upon hearing of a person s death   So it goes   And we hear that expression a lot throughout this book   there s that many deaths  Which I believe Vonnegut was making a point  We re left wondering if Billy is in fact insane  or if he s suffering from prolonged Post Traumatic Stress Disorder  or brain damage suffered in a plane crash or the results from shock treatment in a mental institution or a combination of all or none  It s up to us to decide and that s the other thing I love about this book Some of my favorite Vonnegutisms  Like so many Americans  she was trying to construct a life that made sense from things she found in gift shops   How did I get so old   Well  here we are  Mr  Pilgrim  trapped in the amber of this moment   I think you guys are going to have to come up with a lot of wonderful new lies  or people just aren t going to want to go on living   The water was dead  So it goes  Air was trying to get out of that dead water  Bubbles were clinging to the walls of the glass  too weak to climb out   How nice   to feel nothing  and still get full credit for being alive  About writing his novels  Trout said   I ve been opening the window and making love to the world  Now that I know some of these characters are seen in other Vonnegut books  I look forward to seeing them again  Billy Pilgram becomes a time traveler after he s abducted by aliens and taken to the planet Tralfamadore  There  Billy is placed in what would be akin to a zoo in America  where the Tralfamadadorians are privy to watch his every move  But Billy doesn t always stay there  He finds himself going back and forward in time  returning to his childhood  jumping forward to when he was a prisoner of war during WWII and kept in a slaughterhouse  Slaughterhouse Five  in Dresden until its destruction by bombs  and even as far into the future as his own death  then back to Tralfamadore where he is mated with a porn star from America  And all over again This classic is part fact and part fiction  the factual portion taken from Vonnegut s own experiences as a prisoner of war in Dresden before and after its firebombing  And in its telling  one wonders if this is the only way Vonnegut could relay his experiences as a soldier and subsequent prisoner of war by implanting small bits and pieces among the other experiences of Billy Pilgram  After all  Vonnegut states at the beginning that he had been planning on writing about the war but could never actually get it finished  This book really managed to come full circle  It started with Billy talking about his book on Dresden  and even though he didn t write it  by the end of the novel he had accomplished so much  One question I had for the majority of the book was what is the significance of the title  I think I have an idea  While he sees his whole life not as a linear progression  but rather as one thing  like a picture  the thing that defined him the most as a person is his time in Slaughterhouse Five and Dresden  That seems to be the one aspect of his life that he always comes back to during his time travels  When he is in the hospital in Vermont  when he is on Tralfamadore  when he is in Indiana  and when he is just about everywhere else  Billy always finds himself talking about Dresden  The significance of his time in Dresden comes down to one thing  it s the place where he formed his belief of  so it goes   Billy s time in Dresden taught him that some terrible things just happen  Since his life is not linear  this is a lesson he carries during his entire life Overall  this book was a great read  I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates a good book  The legacy of Slaughterhouse FiveWhat made this novel so popular This groundbreaking novel was published in 1969  although Kurt Vonnegut had been working on it for over 20 years  My take on this novel is that  much like his main character  Billy Pilgrim  Vonnegut himself was stuck in time for those 23 years and suddenly became  unstuck  and outlined this novel within a linear structure  allowing his stream of consciousness regarding the science fiction portions of the novel to take over Many things can  and have been written regarding this novel  and I will not repeat or review them here or even attempt to reveal the many devices used to structure this book  other than what I have already stated  Read the book and watch the movie by the same title  which are excellent studies in both literature and film  a cinematic excursion into the making of a great classic  The essence of this story is a study in the absurdities of war  And how better to discuss the ironies and absurdities than to juxtapose the tragic alongside the comic  This is what Vonnegut has succeeded so brilliantly in doing  He pulls no punches and makes no excuses  as he presents this semi autobiographical work depicting his experience as a POW and the bombing of Dresden  Germany during WWII  systematically cutting into this senseless act with the comedic meanderings of Billy Pilgrim   his desire and search for another life   a perfect life  one with an exotic centerfold starlette  Isn t this the dream of most men  after all  With the bit of information that I ve just revealed about this story  it s easy to see why it was revolutionary in its time  yet just as relevant today  Vonnegut deals with two fundamental truths in life  death and irony  and everyone can relate to that   Life s a bitch and then you die   This universal message  plus many other factors  many details that permeate this story  expose it to debate  controversy  and more questions than answers  especially the story s ending  which has been copied by many  film makers  ever since  I won t give it away  of course  in case you haven t read the book or seen the movie   two things which I highly recommend This book and the movie were ahead of their time  in that the content was considered risque at the time of publication and its film debut in 1972  but also ahead of its time in the sense that science fiction merged with reality in such a forceful and meaningful way  as if Vonnegut had invented an entirely new genre  which I believe he did to an extent  In my view  we should give Vonnegut credit as one of the most influential novelists of our time for several reasons as opposed to seeing him and his work as some sort of second rate  fringe element hack job The fact remains  Vonnegut became much more than a sci fi writer because of Slaughterhouse Five  The musings in this story  its statement in opposition to war is profound and heartfelt  despite its fictive elements  which either way serve to enhance  or play up both the tragedies of war and life s tragedies and ironies for the sake of humanity itself This is certainly an unusual novel  and unless you have already read it as a school assignment  you don t want to miss it  The film stays very true to the novel  although  there are details in the novel that you won t see in the movie  That s always to be expected since most movies run for about two hours or less in most cases  which translates into 120  pages  or minutes and they can only use the best parts of the novel in the movie  This novel comes in short at only 190 pages  but still too long to include all of it in a feature film  however  the film makers did an excellent job at getting the novel s feel and its powerful message across in grand style  Enjoy it  I started to read this book in high school  not knowing who Kurt Vonnegut was or how he wrote  I understood it to be a science fiction novel about a guy time travelling with aliens  I didn t make it through the book  I don t remember how much I read  But it didn t precisely fit my expectations  so I gave it up quick  I think it was the non linear story telling that was way ahead of his time when this was written and way over my head when I first attempted to read it I continued life ignorant to what this book contained  Vonnegut has an incredible gift for restating a plain as day fact in such a way that fully reveals its absurdity  He speaks of a bottle of soda on a night stand and says   its label boasted that it contained no nutrition   Things of this nature characterize KV s entire style This book is also about how periods in your life come and go as if they had nothing to do with each other  Billy Pilgrim s newlywed wife asks him to tell her about the war and he declines saying that it is like trying to tell someone about a dream  and nobody s dreams are very interesting to other people  That is a pretty precise summation Billy s ennui with the American Dream is relatable  To his family  there is no reason he should be unhappy  but his suburban life in middle age was slowly driving him crazy  This was enhanced by his experience in the war and also having traveled through time and space to an alien planet to live in a zoo and procreate with a porn star But see  Even in writing this review  I lose the message of the book by describing the mechanics  The book is about all of these things  yes  These are events that happen in the book  but the book is about the entire picture  how all these things relate to one another and how it affects Billy s consensus reality with those around him  He is alone in the universe in a way  We all are   There are no almost characters in this story and almost no dramatic confrontations  because most of the people in it are so sick and so much the listless playthings of enormous forces  One of the main effects of war  after all  is that people are discouraged from being characters  I did not get this book when I read it was a teenager  During all these years  whenever I heard praises for the book  I remember thinking that it wasn t that big of a deal Now that I read it again  I am fascinated by it  I GET it now  I also get that the book isn t really made for teenagers  Even at 29  I think I might enjoy this book even more a decade more  and a decade after that  The book  while about war  and time travel and aliens   is more about age  It s about time  not as a concept  but as a personal experience  the act of passing through it  of growing up  of being on a journey that can t be stopped  and sometimes  having the feeling that we are on a train  unable to control the journey  and only being an audience to our lives Whenever I read books nowadays  I highlight the passages I like  With  Slaughterhouse Five   I almost wanted to highlight everything  The book is funny  but a sadness to it  full of lines that have a weariness to it  but at the same time  the acceptance of this weariness  The book has a line that is repeated throughout the book  which is  So it goes  that comes after any passages related to death  And it s the book s most ingenious three words   So it goes  is the book s philosophy and this would be a phrase on my tombstone  if there ever was  which most likely wouldn t be So it goes  Among the things Billy Pilgrim could not change were the past  the present  and the future   All time is all time  It does not change  It does not lend itself to warnings or explanations  It simply is  Take it moment by moment  and you will find that we are all  as I ve said before  bugs in amber   Another time Billy heard Rosewater say to a psychiatrist   I think you guys are going to have to come up with lot of wonderful new lies  or people just aren t going to want to go on living   She upset Billy simply by being his mother  She made him feel embarrassed and ungrateful and weak because she had gone through so much trouble to give him life  and to keep that life going  and Billy didn t really like life at all   Billy didn t want to marry ugly Valencia  She was one of the symptoms of his disease He knew he was going crazy  when he heard himself proposing marriage to her   when he begged her to take the diamond ring and be his companion for life   He had already seen a lot of their marriage  thanks to time travel  knew that it was going to be at least bearable all the way   I have told my sons that they are not under any circumstances to take part in massacres  and that the news of massacres of enemies is not to fill them with satisfaction or glee  It was The Gospel From Outer Space  by Kilgore Trout  It was about a visitor from outer space     who  made a serious study of Christianity  to learn  if he could  why Christians found it so easy to be cruel  He concluded that at least part of the trouble was slipshod storytelling in the New Testament  He supposed that the intent of the Gospels was to teach people  among other things  to be merciful  even to the lowest of the low But the Gospels actually taught this Before you kill somebody  make absolutely sure he isn t well connected  So it goes The flaw in the Christ stories  said the visitor from outer space  was that Christ  who didn t look like much  was actually the Son of the Most Powerful Being in the Universe  Readers understood that  so  when they came to the crucifixion  they naturally thought    Oh  boy    they sure picked the wrong guy to lynch that time And that thought had a brother   There are right people to lynch   Who  People not well connected  So it goes The visitor from outer space made a gift to Earth of a new Gospel  In it  Jesus really was a nobody  and a pain in the neck to a lot of people with better connections than he had  He still got to say all the lovely and puzzling things he said in the other Gospels So the people amused themselves one day by nailing him to a cross and planting the cross in the ground  There couldn t possibly be any repercussions  the lynchers thought  The reader would have to think that too  since the Gospel hammered home again and again what a nobody Jesus was And then  just before the nobody died  the heavens opened up  and there was thunder and lightning  The voice of God came crashing down  He told the people that he was adopting the bum as his son  giving him the full powers and privileges of the Son of the Creator of the Universe throughout all eternity  God said this From this moment on  He will punish anybody who torments a bum who has no connections    Quick and dirty reading notes and  i relevant thoughts  There are BOOKS written about this novel and I won t attempt to duplicate them  These are just my thoughts  half a day after finishing it   I don t think I read anything quite like Slaughterhouse Five  You are really going to love it or simply stop reading it  There is such a strong anti war aura about it  yet with the exception of one paragraph at the end  it is never explicitly said  war is bad   Instead Mr  Vonnegut proceeds systematically at demythicizing the war  There is nothing glorious about it  The soldiers are no heroes  just too young boys  or too old men or  most frequently  untrained buffoons  and not only Billy Pilgrim  although in his case  Mr  Vonnegut takes facts to extreme   And when we are dealing with true soldiers  the British officers  the pride and joy of the their army  they are referred by sobriquets as the Blue Fairy Godmother  Everything that happens to Billy during the war is ridiculous  he carries no weapon  and when in the end he gets one  it is only to protect himself from wild dogs and rats   he doesn t take part in a single battle  he survives the butchering of Dresden by sheer luck  Being a soldier is just menial work or half acknowledged traveling  But what I think it s spectacular about this novel is the fact that although it addresses such a heavy topic  it never feels heartbreaking or distressing  Mr  Vonnegut accomplishes that in three ways     1  the gore and horrors of the war are hidden under layers upon layers of good natured humor or ridicule depending on the story     2  every time when something distressing is going to happen  Billy  travels  through time to a happier moment  and the reader never witnesses the slaughterous details     3  from the very beginning  in the not titled Preface  we are given a summary of the novel  There are simply no surprises going on that might detract the reader from the embedded message  And because this is Kurt Vonnegut  in the end he has to explain the message he wanted to pass   There are almost no characters in this story  and almost no dramatic confrontations  because most of the people in it are so sick and so much the listless playthings of enormous forces  One of the main effects of war  after all  is that people are discouraged from being characters   Final  i relevant thought  one of the reasons I liked so much Slaughterhouse Five was because of its concept of time  which is so close to what I consider my personal views on this topic  time doesn t flow  all the events  future  and  past  already exist and we simply navigate through them  Yet  the Tralfamadorians deny the existence of the free will  which I actually consider incorrect  But that s a discussion for another time  tsu If someone asks me what my favorite book is  and I can only pick one  I always say Slaughterhouse Five  There was just something about it that captured me  It s a book you must stay on top of to keep up  I like how the storyline switches and you don t even know if the character is in the past  present or future  There was something horrifying about Dresden and something intriguing about Tralfamadore  So many great quotes  that as a book nerd  I have written down and since I just grabbed that notebook  I will share them  And I asked myself about the present  how wide it was  how deep it was  how much was mine to keep  I been hungrier than this  the hobo told Billy  I been in worse places than this  This ain t so bad   How nice  to feel nothing  and still get full credit for being alive    about the morphine and my two favorites that I have memorized  Well  here we are  Mr  Pilgrim  trapped in the amber of this moment  There is no why   so it goes this book rocks  As a junior in high school  I don t have a lot of time to read  Last year  with a FANTASTIC teacher  I was required to read fairly often  This year  not so much  All our teacher has us do is study stuff that will never help me in my future  She doesn t have us practice writing  she doesn t have us expand our vocabulary  and she doesn t try to expand our horizons in the reading department  So  I ve had to depend upon myself to get my reading done this year  As I stated earlier  I don t have much time  But  I was repeatedly hearing positive things about this book so I decided to give it a try  I DO NOT REGRET DOING SO I can t exactly put a finger on it  and I can t quite describe why I feel so strongly about this book  But  it had me hooked from the beginning  and I could not put it down  This was my first time reading anything written by Vonnegut  His sense of humour is absurd  and I love it  If you know anything about me  you re aware that I m an absurd person  and when I can relate to the author  it makes me love the reading that much more  There was rarely a laugh that I didn t feel somewhat ashamed about because I laughed  But  I loved it anyway  His account of Dresden was devastatingly  heartbreaking to me  and I read it over and over again  The style is completely engaging  and made this a decently quick read for me  despite the subject matter  I think that everyone should at least give this beautiful book a try  even if the general idea of it doesn t appeal to you  I am in absolute love with this book questioning war  yet it doesn t try to give you some bullshit  excuse my language  answer to all our problems  It questions why humans feel it is necessary to always be blowing shit up and destroying everything they see  yet it does not give an answer to this question  It questions what it would be like to live a completely different life than the one you are currently living  yet it gives no answer to this question  In truth  this book doesn t try to give you answers to anything  And for some reason  this makes me love the story  One more thing that makes me oh so passionate about this is that it is based upon actual experiences Vonnegut suffered during his lifetime  And when the author is directly connected to his her writing  it makes it seem so much more real So  why I feel the way I do  I m not quite sure how to explain it  But  I know how I feel  and I am passionate about this story  This is a must read for everybody  and I don t give a poopy if you like it or not  I m just here to share my opinion  Nothing in the world can diminish my love for Kurt Vonnegut s Slaughterhouse 5 because it is wonderfulness  I ve picked it up and read it many times  like this week  and everytime just seems to bring out more flavor and color For those of you unaware  the book begins like this Listen  Billy Pilgrim became unstuck in time and ends with Poo tweet tweet  It is Vonnegut s warbook on the devastating air bombing of the German city of Dresden by Allied forces  At the time  Vonnegut himself was a POW in the city and so had a fabulous front row seat of the massacre  However  his book is the culmination of what is perhaps the best way to write about mass killings   through a nonsensical glass with aliens  British POWs in Cinderella costumes  bad science fiction writers and time traveling  It is the only way to make sense of the nonsensical reality Vonnegut found himself in at the time But the book is about Billy Pilgrim  his life  death  times  family  serivce  etc   and it is very  very funny in a not funny funny way There are so many parts that deserve note such as at the beginning when Vonnegut tells the reader that he has expressly forbade his sons from taking part in massacres during their lives  I think this is excellent advice every parent should mete out along with  wash your hands  and  don t drink and drive   Could you imagine if in wars today  soldiers apologized to their commanding officers with a  Sorry  but my parents always told me      as the reason why they couldn t take part in a military action  It would be brilliant I can t nudge this book onto other peoples shelves enough as it s beautiful in all its topsy turvy looniness and above all  directness about what is and isn t and was and how it all goes Buy it  Read it  Ingest it  MOVE   Everything is supposed to be very quiet after a massacre  and it always is except for the birds  And what do the birds say  All there is to say about a massacre  things like  Poo tee weet   This book left me with a lot of questions  but I love it for that reason  Vonnegut s examinations of people as both individuals and as a whole are incredibly realistic and true  The mirror he holds to the human race in this book is so elegantly and creatively constructed  and yet so believable  It made me feel almost uncomfortable in certain places  When I came across this paragraph  I cringed at the trueness of it   Trout  incidentally  had written a book about a money tree  It had twenty dollar bills for leaves  Its flowers were government bonds  Its fruit was diamonds  It attracted human beings who killed each other around the roots and made very good fertilizer  So it goes  It is obvious that the author has deep  emotional anguish regarding the war he took place in  This emotional commitment was linear and constant  even though the story s setting was not  This unique way of combining feelings with plot made it a very rewarding read The writing is top notch  His creativity can be seen on every page  and it is not forced  His style in this book  although scattered  seemed very natural and instinctive  Because of this  it felt completely honest  Slaughterhouse Five is Vonnegut s best known novel  but it is hard for me to see why  While his themes do come through  they are subtly presented and require the active participation of the reader to escape from the page  It is a mix of autobiography  science fiction  and historical fiction  Vonnegut also appears in the work  adding a metafictional component  Perhaps it is the complexity of the book that makes it most appealing to those academic and critical circles that thrive on writing about form and content  and there is much to write upon in the case of S 5  in the most sterile way possible  avoiding any personal connection with the text  This is quite a shame  because S 5 is in many ways the most intimate of Vonnegut s novels  Vonnegut was present at the bombing of Dresden  At any rate  this book is certainly one of Vonnegut s best  but has not dethroned Cat s Cradle as his masterpiece Vonnegut employs his characteristic style in S 5  never straying from concision  It is also full of aphorisms and occasionally some beautiful passages  again  no surprise   The book is anachronic  which one could hastily dismiss as an eccentric narrative choice  This would be hasty indeed  however  as Vonnegut organizes his book in the same way the alien Tralfamadorians  who see through time as we see through space  organize their own books the author has chosen them carefully  so that  when seen all at once  they produce an image of life that is beautiful and surprising and deep  There is no beginning  no middle  no end  no suspense  no moral  no causes  no effects  What we love in our books are the depths of many marvelous moments seen all at one time This describes S 5 perfectly    we are presented with a tableau of moments from Billy Pilgrim s life in anachronic order  There is therefore little beginning or end  and these are deconstructed even more by the inclusion of the first chapter  which is presented by a narrator   Vonnegut  kind of  and includes an outline of the story of Billy Pilgrim  including the beginning and the end Peppered throughout the novel is the clause  So it goes   which is bothersome and repetitive to many readers  Vonnegut uses it whenever a character dies  in Tralfamadorian custom  Some of the deaths are meaningful  most are meaningless  This  most  is operative  a key element of S 5 is the senselessness of slaughter  of  massacre   which the narrator acknowledges in the first chapter of the book  It is easy to read S 5 as a nihilistic tract  as mere acquiescence to the chaos and human disregard for humans  The Tralfamadorians provide a counterpoint  however  embodying this callous and fatalistic viewpoint in the extreme  After all  they know that the world is going to end when one of their test pilots pushes a start button and ends the universe  Vonnegut  as a humanist  wants us to reject this outlook  Death is inevitable  but that does not mean that we can abnegate our responsibility to others  It is precisely against the Tralfamadorian psyche  and by extension the human psyche that led to the Dresden bombing  that we must struggle most vehemently  How can this be   you may ask   given that the first chapter includes the following exchange  What he meant  of course  was that there would always be wars  that they were as easy to stop as glaciers  I believe that  too  And even if wars didn t keep coming like glaciers  there would still be plain old death Vonnegut has promised us a book without a moral but with depth  This is one such instance  While war may be inevitable  that does not mean that it should be accepted passively  While it may be tempting to state that the book espouses fatalism and passive acceptance  I would suggest that it instead should galvanize us to reject such notions and to advance along our own self determined but humanistic routes  Is it impossible to guarantee perennial peace  Perhaps  but passive acceptance is far worse  as Vonnegut s content demonstrates  The narrator mentions that the climax of the novel is the execution of Edgar Derby for stealing a teapot in the ruins of Dresden  perhaps because of its absurd juxtaposition with the destruction and death in the bombing  Vonnegut is not merely lamenting inhumanity  he is calling for its manifestation Given this  however  the absence of romance and genuine love in S 5 is surprising  although Vonnegut tends to avoid those topics anyway  Billy remains married to his wife  but does not seem to have any genuine affection for her  Her love for him  view spoiler  eventually kills her  so she is hardly an example of the reinforcing power of love  hide spoiler    Several of the other characters tangentially mention wives  or porno   and naked girls feature hilariously in one scene  but there is a lack of deep romantic love  Given the timeless duality of love and war  this is a somewhat surprising stylistic choice  but idiosyncratic of Vonnegut  While the two are clearly not mutually exclusive  after all  Nazi officers had families too   at the broadest level  empathy and love are proven to help resolve conflict Another question unanswered by the narrative is the accuracy of Billy Pilgrim s experiences  They are called into question by the characters in the novel  especially his daughter  After all  it was only after a severe head injury that he began relating his Tralfamadorian and time traveling stories  An additional consideration is the close similarity and germane transitions between his  present  life  i e  the WW2 life  and the other moments in his life  There are verbal echoes   Why you  Why anyone    all over  and his flashbacks often connect in subject or theme to the WW2 developments  Vonnegut obviously never answers the question  and I do not think that the answer matters much anyway  The existential and philosophical questions are raised regardless  All that matters is that Billy Pilgrim believes that he has become unstuck in time  Vonnegut makes us assess credibility just as we would have to in real life  Even if Billy is crazy  does that make the Tralfamadorian outlook any less important to accept or reject  Thus there is a strong metaphysical quandary in the book as well Plenty of other themes creep up in S 5 on an episodic basis  Howard W  Campbell  Jr  appears to reinforce the value of free society through Derby s rejection of his spiel  the role of fiction is explored through Kilgore Trout  whose books provide brief parables themselves   etc  But overshadowing all of these is a oppressive depression fueled by crimes against humanity  S 5 shows us the dangers of such crimes and the fatalistic mindset that produces them  There are clear emotional undertones that are incomprehensible to me  a child of an era of peace and distant war  I can only imagine Vonnegut s reaction to Dresden  but I cannot imagine that it led to mere fatalism  especially given Vonnegut s humanism S 5 is worth reading  It has literary value in its anachronic structure  embedded narratives  choice of subject matter  and metafictionality  It has cultural value as a wartime novel  It has historical value as a treatment of a dangerously underexposed subject  It has intellectual value as a provocative work  As I said at the beginning of this review  it is not Vonnegut s best  but it is his most weighty book by far  This book is about so many things  yet it appears as a silly little book about a schizophrenic optometrist war veteran who is unstuck in time  A lot of laughs  people die  and so it goes This book is worth a second read to understand the author s themes that are woven throughout the book  Amazingly  the second chapter reveals everything that happens in the book  But do you understand it  No  They reveal Billy Pilgrim s life in a chronological outline and give you something to refer back to  if the reader in fact knows that it is all available in chapter 2  The book has no beginning  middle  and end like so many works of literature  The transitions are good  taking you from one part of his life to another part in time  Forward  backward  round and round  The story is revealed in this manner  Revealed is the correct word  even though you read it all in chapter 2  The reader explores the themes of Predestination   What ever will be will be  There is no such thing as free will  we have no real control of our destiny  When people die  Vonnegut uses the phrase   and so it goes   A punctuation to a life that is lost out of our control  Some readers found this phrase annoying  yet it s use is very deliberate as a part of this so called anti war novel The bombing of Dresdon   The author notes how this horrific event was done only to get the Germans to surrender  but there was no military advantage to destroy the city  The city  according to Vonnegut  did no war time manufacturing and housed no troops  yet it was obliterated  Ironically  the protagonist of the book survived because he was hiding out in a slaughterhouse  If the book had a beginning  middle  and end  this would have been the climax of the book  It still may be  but the author tried to change all that in this experimental novel What is real and what is an illusion  This is my struggle with the book  I was frustrated with the story line of the Tralfamadorians because it was so unreal  Typical Vonnegut from what I remember having read years ago  But this one is different  Billy Pilgrim is unstuck in time and has an experience on the planet of Tralfamadore  He learns valuable information there  valuable to the development of this novel  Earthlings are very concerned with free will  but there is no such thing  Billy learns about how time is not linear  it can be visited again and again  Billy visits his birth  his death  his daughter s marriage  the war  everything  People die  but they aren t gone because time is not linear  Philosophical  yes  Silly  yes  but essential to the message of this book  What puzzles me is this   Late in the book  Billy goes to the bookstore and purchases a book by Kilgore Trout  Trout s book has stories in it that are from Billy s own life experiences  Now the question is  did Billy only imagine himself in these Tralfamadorian stories from the Kilgore Trout stories  during a bout with schizophrenia   or did Trout write about Billy s experience  Which came first  This could mean that none of the Tralfamadore story line happened at all  I am rereading the book to understand this and all other questions  I may decide that it doesn t matter if Billy is suffering from brain damage and his daughter is correct in thinking him schizophrenic  It doesn t matter because the theme of predestination does not change  It may just have been  food for thought  that the author threw in to make you wonder   was it real  or was it not real   This book seems like a very easy read on the surface  After a few chapters you ll be cruising along and then realize there are some fairly complicated things being said if you read between the lines  The book explores free will and the irrational nature of humanity without coming off like a philosophy text  I found myself going back several times to try to get a better sense of what Vonnegut was getting at  The main character Billy Pilgrim spends the novel experiencing his entire life in no particular order  He knows what the future holds so to him all events exist at all times  He knows that terrible things are about to happen but resigns himself to the way of things  Even death and war are just part of how things go  The phrase  So it goes  is seen every time death is mentioned  But the Tralfamadorians that abduct Billy  yeah  aliens abduct him  seem to inadvertently make the point that war shouldn t be inevitable  So do we do what we do because we must  or is it dangerous to just accept that war happens It s an anti war book that gets its point across with subtlety  Vonnegut never has his characters jump up and traipse around with anti war sandwich boards  It s all in the subtext  It s refreshing    a great story with a great point   LA TRAGEDIA HECHA COMEDIA Creo que ustedes  muchachos  van a tener que inventarse un buen monton de mentiras bien dichas  o la gente no querra seguir viviendo  Kurt Vonnegut  Matadero cinco Llevaba anos oyendo que  Matadero cinco  del norteamericano Kurt Vonnegut es una de las obras maestras de la literatura del siglo XX  sin embargo  por una u otra razon no me habia dado la oportunidad de leerlo  Al fin compre el libro y me sente para no poderme levantar del sillon hasta dar vuelta a la ultima pagina  Antes de ir mas adelante  dejenme decirles que es una lectura indispensable y que la experiencia de leer este libro es unica  ningun otro libro que haya leido me ha dejado una sensacion como la de Matadero cinco gracias a la habilidad de Vonnegut de combinar el humor y la tragedia sin trivializar esta ultima y haciendola digerible  Sin duda es un libro que debe leerse Y es que Vonnegut es un verdadero maestro del sarcasmo  es mordaz  irreverente y crudo  y a la vez muy divertido  Matadero cinco no es una novela de ciencia ficcion  tampoco es una novela comica  es una cruda narracion de hechos acompanada de una acida critica social que se apoya en los dos generos anteriores para hacer de un hecho terrible  algo legible y aparentemente ligero  Subrayo lo de aparentemente porque  a pesar de que esta obra puede ser leida rapido y entre risas  ningun lector queda sin ser tocado por ella  De esta manera  Vonnegut nos trae entre risas y llanto durante las casi 200 paginas de la obra La novela esta basada en hechos reales vividos por el propio Vonnegut cuando  como soldado de E U A   sirvio durante la segunda guerra mundial  En Europa fue capturado por los alemanes y vivio  de primera mano  como prisionero de guerra  el bombardeo aliado que dejo a la ciudad de Dresde como un  arido paisaje lunar   El autor tuvo que ayudar  primero a enterrar a los muertos y luego a incinerarlos  Sobrevivio gracias a que el y otros americanos se escondieron en un rastro que llevaba el nombre  ni mas ni menos  que de Matadero cinco En la novela  Billy Pilgrim  el protagonista  es un hombre que continuamente salta en el tiempo de forma involuntaria  Basado en esos saltos  Vonnegut va construyendo una historia  bastante congruente  y he ahi parte de su gran genio  ya que logra hacer una narracion muy clara a pesar de tantos brincos   En la historia  Billy salta entre ser un joven estudiante de oftalmologia  un recluta del ejercito norteamericano en la 2a guerra mundial que ha sido atrapado por los alemanes  un loco internado voluntariamente en un manicomio  el marido de una mujer tremendamente gorda que es hija de un rico oftalmologo  un rico oculista y hombre de negocios  el padre loco de una hija que lo trata como si fuera un imbecil  y un sujeto de estudio secuestrado por unos alienigenas que lo llevan a su planeta para ser exhibido en un zoologico  Como el tiempo no existe para estos seres  Billy es regresado a la tierra en lo que parece ser un abrir y cerrar de ojos pero que para el hombre  es un largo periodo Asi  Pilgrim  feo y flacucho  consigue ser visto desde multiples puntos de vista  los soldados lo ven como un payaso enclenque  los alienigenas como un interesantisimo sujeto de estudio  su suegro como una extraordinaria salida para su hija  su esposa lo ama profundamente y su hija lo trata como a un tonto Con su cinico sentido del humor y su enorme imaginacion  Vonnegut logra limpiar un poco la crudeza de las atrocidades de la guerra y la convierte en algo digerible y hasta placentero de leer  al mismo tiempo que hace una feroz critica a la sociedad norteamericana  al valor que dan al dinero  a la forma en la que denigran a los que no logran ser ricos  a la destruccion del medio ambiente y a la deshumanizacion que acompana a la guerra  Adicionalmente hace un interesante planteamiento sobre la inexistencia del tiempo y  por ende  la inutilidad de tratar de cambiar nuestro futuro ya que  al igual que nuestro pasado  es algo que ya esta definido A pesar de ser desesperanzador  este es un libro muy disfrutable  muy interesante  de esos que aparentemente son ligeros y divertidos pero que se te quedan bajo la piel durante anos  Una obra maestra que da mucho de que hablar CONTACTOTwitter   moysheine mail  casiopea22 prodigy net mx What convinced me of this book s greatness was not the innovative language Mr  Vonnegut so cleverly and pleasantly  agreeably if you wish  uses  neither was it the currently rather well known taglines that kept repeating themselves through the book making the text sound even more convincingly clever and current  at the moment  there  Actually I m not completely sure what it was  I m guessing  anyway  that the touchingly optimistic  exuberant  approbative underlying mood towards life  death and time had something to do with it  as probably does the whole setting  that being simultaneously the world of war and its horrors that weren t undergone straightaway and the following peace stirred up with some funniness in the head maybe  maybe not  maybe the world in outer space and another life in a zoo      when a person dies he only appears to die  He is still very much alive in the past  present  and future  always have existed  always will exist  What is likely to strike the reader as most  different  aspect in the book is the fact that Billy Pilgrim was abducted by aliens   so to say  the point that causes this work to be called science fiction   even though there wasn t actually anything too alien going on  just curious lifeforms willing to learn more  people mating and eating and sleeping  passing time while bystanders react as they re used to    An aspect that wouldn t be weird at all  just a bit crossing perhaps  was the setting more worldly  So it goes  I m sure there s a lot more to this book  a lot I ve missed or just passed as less important material  I m definitely looking forward to reading this one again   What happens when you re read a book about the fourth dimension 15 years later  Well  mostly  you realize your memory is not so great  so  I suppose you realize how unlike a Trafalmadorian you are   You might also realize that it is possible to read a book as a teenager and not really understand it I first read Slaughterhouse Five when I was 14  at the age when some people think you are maybe a little bright because you are reading important novels on your own time  but really you have just discovered  that despite being called  literature   there can still be abundant curse words and sarcastic humour  not to mention an account of angst and social alienation that is very appealing to teenagers   I knew at the time it was an  anti war  novel    my father and the cover of my edition both said so  but I assumed this to be mostly embodied by unhappiness of the soldiers  war is not glamorous  it is cold  full of indignities  and uncomfortable   I also took  anti war  to include a demonstration that Dresden was a massacre  which meant the Allies    the  good  guys    did bad things too  Basically   anti war  meant conveying that the reality of war was awful and actually much worse than you thought  And Slaughterhouse Five conveys those things  but now  at age thirty one  I am surprised by how I failed to see all of the other things it expresses  Not only does Slaughterhouse Five point out that war is awful    we know war is awful    but it also points out that despite this knowledge we keep doing it  and I missed its quiet pleading of human beings    probably because it runs mostly in the book s undercurrents of irony    to please  please  just stop  i ve been meaning to read some vonnegut for years and years  i finally picked this up  and two days later he died  hearing about the strangeness of time and how people never really die from a man who had just died made this book all the more powerful for me  like all my favorite books  there are random tangents and commentary on all sorts of things  one of my favorite parts of the book is one character s critique of the bible   the gospels actually taught this  before you kill somebody  make absolutely sure he isn t well connected     oh boy  they sure picked the wrong guy to lynch that time  and that thought had a brother   there are right people to lynch  who  people not well connected  so it goes   the visitor from outer space made a gift to earth of a new gospel  in it  jesus really was a nobody    god said this   from this moment on  i will punish horribly anybody who torments a bum who has no connections   that s only a couple of pages  but sticks with me  there s also an interesting tangent to a time traveler witnessing jesus as a young boy learning the carpentry trade from his father by building a cross for a crucifixion  another tangent critiques america  every other nation has folk tales traditions of men who were poor but extremely wise and virtuous  and therefore more estimable than anyone with power and gold  no such tales are told by the american poor  they mock themselves and glorify their betters   the amount of thinking this book makes you do is amazing for being what seems like such a light read  it makes me always think of the phrase  so it goes  at the appropriate times  which actually does make me feel better   Vonnegut writes so damn well  The only problem with this is the way he sucks me into his super smart but cynical and fatalistic worldview  squeezing any residual hopefulness and optimism I have  whatever survived  Cat s Cradle   that is  out of me until I practically squeal  Uncle  Here s what I learned from this book  War is worse than terrible  War is utter nonsense  People are really stupid  There s probably not much hope for the human race  The best we can do is to try to enjoy the good moments when they come  which might not be very often Uncle But then there are these hilarious one liners and just transcendent moments  For example  a documentary about bombers  seen backwards through the eyes of Billy Pilgrim  who is  unstuck in time   Without quoting the whole section  but see it in my favorite quotes  below   let s just say this passage left me gasping for air I still feel like total crap  mind you  But you have to admit  Vonnegut writes so damn well  I went in honestly having no idea what this was about  only that it s one of those  must read classics  kind of thing and that quite a few people loved it  It seems a fairly appropriate time to read something like this  with all that s going on in current events The way the story jerked back and forth between events threw me a bit off at first  but I found as I read I actually really liked the way it jumped around  Normally I get a bit frustrated with books that don t have a normal chain of events  one that happens after another with an occasional flashback  but for this it just fit the story so well The imagery Vonnegut uses is quite powerful at times  especially the scene where Billy Pilgrim is seeing war happening in reverse  the bombs returning to the belly of the planes that dropped them  all the way to them going back overseas and women dismantling them and burying them  I really loved that part in the book  and could imagine just how nice it would be I also liked how the reader is never really given any indication whether the alien abduction happened to Billy Pilgrim  It was one of those surreal bits to the story that  really  didn t matter in the scope of the story  whether he was abducted or not didn t really matter  but the aliens he either imagined or met were an interesting bunch Overall  I really enjoyed this and am looking forward to reading more of Vonnegut s work  I should first state that I m a huge Kurt Vonnegut fan  Back when I was in high school  I took a short summer writers workshop where K  Vonnegut taught me how to write  how to hold onto my own style of voice  and how to be sarcastic and not give a damn what people think  I like to think that he shaped me into the man I hope to one day be  Simply put  this is the story about a young man named Billy Pilgrim and how he becomes unstuck in time  moving though random moments of his life  back and forth  Simply put  but worth so much more  What stuns me most about the history of this book  is how it was and still is banned in many schools  Are soldiers swearing that far from the truth  Is the horrific bombing in Dresden something we should block from our minds  Perhaps the controversy is a compliment  one that all writers strive to achieve  The ability to make people stand up and take note of words on paper  and good or bad  try to do something about them This is a science fiction book read throughout American high schools as a modern  classic   As if genre fiction can never be literature  He has shown the world  along with Orwell  Huxley  Poe and many others that it can  and I greatly respect him for that  When inevitably we all die  I hope that when I pass  people will talk about my death with the famous line from this book   so it goes    Kurt Vonnegut is that rare author who can be hysterically funny  as serious as a heart attack and as insightful as a prophet all within the space of a few lines  He also seems to constantly express ideas which you already had  but never quite properly articulated  All of these gifts are on display here as Vonnegut takes us through the nightmare of one of America s worst war time atrocities  the unbelievable and unnecessary fire bombing of Dresden which gruesomely killed more German civilians in a single night than the atomic bombs at Hiroshima or Nagasaki  That this is excellent fodder for an anti war polemic is easy to understand  That this could also be the backdrop for an examination of the nature of time  the self loathing of the American working class and the under appreciated beauty of life is less obvious  but Vonnegut nevertheless pulls it off with the help of aliens  optometrists and barbershop quartets Uniquely American  absolutely excellent and highly recommended  This book gave me a lot to think about  including the Dresden fire bombing  something I knew nothing about  It made me think about why I didn t know about something in history that was so horrible and caused so many deaths  It made me think about the notions of freewill and fate  and about death and war and violence  I thought it was funny that while living with the Trafalmadorians the only book from Earth that Billy got to read was Vally of the Dolls  The Trafalmadorians are interesting  how they viewed time as not a line but something they moved back and forth in  revisiting things that had already happen or that will happen  and having no worries about it because it was all meant to be like that  The book made me ask questions  made me wonder about things I hadn t thought of before  and I had no idea how I was going to review this beyond the five star rating I gave it  I like that the book is different  thinks outside the box of standard novels  and made me wonder about things  Reading this book was like biting into a warm dinner roll smeared with butter  it just melts in your mouth and runs down your throat  drips off your chin  and you don t care how messy you are because it is so  damn  good  Funny  witty  sad  crazy    And to think that I walk the streets and attended school where Mr Vonnegut began work on this book  It is truly humbling  You can read this book at face value  or you can dig deeper and analyze it  either way  you are in for a treat  This is one of my favorite books     More often than not  a picture of Kurt Vonnegut is often followed by the simple sentence  So it goes   This is the birthplace of that phrase Vonnegut takes you on a trek through his mind and memory of what he calls the  Children s Crusade   the bombing of Dresden during WWII  If follows classic Vonnegut style in dealing with time no longer being a linear though so much as a web  As he describes it in this book  becoming  unstuck  in time This concept made me a bit wary to begin with  Many novels that venture to  swing  back and forth between time periods become confusing and muddled  Somehow  Vonnegut uses this method to help us become closer to to the characters  By the end of it  you understand why everything is the way it is    because that s the way it has to be  So it goes    I have to admit  its not my favorite Vonnegut novel  that blessing is bestowed upon my first    you never forget your first  but it has been one of the best ones I have read   The greatest thing about this book is the nonchalance with which a strange world and experience is created  Billy Pilgrim is a fascinating character who is at the same time fantastical and completely believable  Unlike many novels which try to imitate this acceptance of the unusual and fail to make it seem natural  Vonnegut makes a world of kidnapping aliens and spontaneous time travel completely normal  The comedy is subtle but constant  and makes for a delightful read  This was the first Vonnegut book that I read and I remember my teacher warning me that I may not understand it very much the first time through  Although that may have been true  it didn t stop me from falling in love with Kurt Vonnegut  I love how weird this novel is  and all of his novels  really   I love how this novel revolves around war  but since the main character  Billy  has become  unstuck in time  it takes place during many different times  and on different planets  I love how Vonnegut approaches war and meshes it with meeting aliens on another planet    because  in a sense  it s how we think about war  Fighting with people that we don t understand  on soil that is different from our own  Whether or not that was Vonnegut s intention  I am unsure  but that is a way that you could read Slaughterhouse Five  I ve read a lot of his other books since Slaughterhouse Five  and they are all equally entertaining  weird  and thought provoking   I am really glad that I read this  I checked it out from the library in December but returned it before I could even read it  I started the audio version yesterday and listened as I cleaned  Such a weird but interesting story  I don t even know how to describe it  but I wish I could have a long discussion about it with someone else who has recently read it  I have already recommended it to a friend  I think I ll also buy it for my husband   Slaughterhouse V laat zien hoe akelige gebeurtenissen de werking van geheugen en ieder besef van tijd en chronologie overhoop kunnen halen  Hoe fictie een noodzakelijke uitweg wordt om te overleven wanneer de werkelijkheid te nachtmerrieachtig wordt  De sci fi stukjes zijn noodzakelijk  niet alleen voor Billy om te overleven maar ook voor de lezer om het boek door te komen  Want bij iedere herinnering van Billy aan de oorlog voel je je eigen hippocampus geblesseerd raken door de wreedheid van ons eigen verleden  Op die momenten bieden de stukjes sci fi een ludieke adempauze  die daarnaast de absurditeit van ons aardse handelen versterken  want door de blik van de buitenaardse wezens wordt de mensheid als een destructief en nietig wezen in een zoo ergens ver weg in het universum geetaleerd  Het geheel draagt zo bij tot een besef van de onzinnigheid van oorlog  als iets wat werkelijkheid en mensheid vernietigt  Essential reading for anyone ever A melancholic and openly funny short novel about a man trying to cope with bearing witness to the bombing of Dresden  not as a citizen but as a soldier on the side responsible  Pilgrim s stoic and spiritual  and so it goes  swings from being beautifully timed to utterly inappropriate  from hearing about the comical deaths of acquaintances to the tragic deaths of millions   I loved this book  We follow Billy Pilgrim through his travels in time as he experiences life as a prisoner of war in Dresden  his marriage  as a zoo exhibition on the planet Tralfamadoria and as he steps closer to death  Of course the Tralfamadorians believe that time continues existing and replaying again and again  we never lose those moments we love and those moments we hate but in life we should concentrate on the positives and ignore the bad as we cannot stop it occurring  Do we have free will or is the fate of the universe fixed in time  Is he actually abducted to Tralfamadoria or is it a response to his harsh experiences  Framed in the backdrop of war  it leaves you amused because of Vonnegut s awesome style and undeniable wit as he takes the role of a narrator on the sidelines and we question fatalism as we consider whether war is always going to happen or what we can or should do to change this  Reading Vonnegut is like visiting that old school friend who always cracks you up with her silly jokes   no matter if you guys are meeting after 5 days  5 months or 5 years  You can pick up effortlessly from where you left of  without the slightest tinge of awkwardness between the two of you  Every time I go back to Vonnegut I am reminded how much I love his funny  irreverent way of looking at things which may never be  well  funny  Billy Pilgrim s character is bleak and tragic and tolerant and glowing and human and broken and tired and alive and resonant  He is solitary in his universe and incapable of hostility  He understands that there is no use in challenging the structure of existence  as this is how it has always been and how it will always be  He  sometimes regretfully  subsists  an outcast on the borderlines of society and time  traveling to and fro erratically within his own life  always with an awareness of the space beyond himself Eloquently  Vonnegut depicts a humanity that is trivial  callous and both beautiful and pitiful in its blind determination  Violence and mortality are ever present concepts   obscure  senseless and incessant as static noise  I wake to sleep  and take my waking slow I feel my fate in what I cannot fear I learn by going where I have to go  And so it goes  Right now I am thinking this book is a masterpiece  and as such  has so much involved in it that it will take more than one reading to understand the impact of the novel  Since this is my first time through  my impressions will likely be expanded a lot when I get around to reading it again  My limited impression of Kurt Vonnegut is that he was eccentric  a deep thinker  and a brilliant writer  I think every word of this novel has a reason for existing  There is a lot to digest  much of it being significant lessons for our world today  If a novel could stop the fighting of wars  this one would have gone a long way toward doing just that  But as he quotes a film maker friend of his   writing a book against war would prevent war as effectively as writing a book against glaciers would prevent their motion   I rarely reread fiction  but I think this is one book I must read again  This is such a strange novel  It s also a very simple one  but it is that what makes it effective and inside that simplicity lies a very complex view analysis of the world and in particular war The book is depressing without actually being so  it s cavalier when talking about death and violence without actually being so  It s an anti war book that takes the inescapable reality of human on human violence that goes in cycles in the history of humanity It is a very out there story which mixes sci fi elements that seem almost nonsensical against such a real and raw backdrop  but that s what makes it such a powerful war tale  because at the end of the day  no matter the reasons  no matter the context  war always ends up being nonsensical A very compelling  fun yet terrible book about the horrible things we do to each other and our ability or inability to keep going  Slaughterhouse Five has been on my TBR shelf so long  it was starting to collect dust so I finally decided it was time to give it a go  Now  having read it for the first time  I m wondering why it s not the second or third or thirty third time   it s that good Vonnegut uses sly black humour to get his point across about the horrors of war and our often fractured view of reality  Sometimes  this book is laugh out loud funny and sometimes it is heart rending  and sometimes it is both at the same time but it is never not important As I just reread my review  I realized how many times I used the word  time   I was about to change that but  after giving it a little more thought  I realized the overuse of the word was actually appropriate for a book in which time has no boundaries  So I stand by my  time  use  As our hero  Billy Pilgrim would say  So it goes    Fatal  historical  satirical  and well written  Favorite quotes  And Lot s wife  of course  was told not to look back where all those people and their homes had been  But she did look back  and I love her for that  because it was so human  So she was turned into a pillar of salt  So it goes    Like so many Americans  she was trying to construct a life that made sense from things she found in gift shops    There is no beginning  no middle  no end  no suspense  no moral  no causes  no effects  What we love in our books are the depths of many marvelous moments seen all at one time    Well  here we are  Mr  Pilgrim  trapped in the amber of this moment  There is no why   How nice    to feel nothing  and still get full credit for being alive    One of the main effects of war  after all  is that people are discouraged from being characters    This was great and my reason for reading it was a sad one  This was the first book of a Banned Book Club started in my local area of the world  This book was banned from our local school system  It does have an age factor involved but if a 17 18 year old  which is the age frame  can t handle this then there are bigger problems  They can t read this but they can sure enlist in the military  This is a great book not many fictional style novels were done relating to the Dresden Fire bombing  Being Vonnegut was actually there it really pertains and you can see how this book might have been a way of coping in some spots  Granted it just falls into the sci fi genre don t be fooled that it s hard core it s not  If I was there I might try and be in a different place to by the trigger of blinking as well  If you like classic literature you might check this out   The boyfriend and I have been watching a lot of Crash Course lately  and this was one of the few books treated in the literature course I hadn t read yet  It s a surprisingly quick read for a lit clasdic about such a dark topic  and very effective in its sparseness  Horrifying without ever being preachy or overly didactic   and surprisingly  grimly funny in moments  Every bit as good as people say it is  Maybe even better  I think a lot of the humor would appeal to the modern day guy who s like 35 years old  lives in his mom s basement  plays a lot of video games and watches a lot of Internets pr0n   my generation  This despite the fact that it was written like 50 years ago  It s truly timeless in nature  It has this tossed off  nullus   High Times magazine investigation of JFK assassination vibe to it  like he s just making this shit up  and maybe he s not right in the head  but it gets more and more intricate  and clearly deliberate  as it goes along  to the point where  by the time you re done reading it  it s like  holy shit  What did I just read  You want to read it through again  maybe even a few times  the way crazy people read Catcher in the Rye  but there s so much other shit to read these days     Billy Pilgrim has become unstuck in timeI have absolutely no clue how to write a review for this book    I am surprised  honestly  This book was amazing    But I don t know if amazing is the right word  honestly  Slaughterhouse Five had almost no plot  almost no characters  and almost nothing but words  How could a book that had almost nothing get five stars Well  that s the question  It was intriguing because connections could be made throughout the book  but you never really know what the connections meant  Slaughterhouse Five is the story of the Dresden bombing in World War Two  and so much more  This book was funny  but you couldn t laugh  it was sad  but tears didn t apply There s no way this review makes sense  sort of like the book  But it was amazing anyway   This review is dead So it goes  This is one of my favorite books  I m always surprised when I hear someone say they don t like Vonnegut  I like all his books Kurt Vonnegut was a soldier in WWII  He was captured and he was a prisoner of war in Dresden when it was bombed  If you don t know the story of the Dresden bombing  read up  There s something utterly authentic and personal in this story  I just stated the reason why  I do not believe that this novel will appeal to everyone  especially those that are looking for the easily digested fun fictional novels  However  I love it for its disjointed comedic presentation of horrible events  There s a science fiction bend to this novel as well  as the main character  Billy Pilgrim  travels through time and is abducted by aliens and taken to their planet  Tralfamador  Everyone dies   So it goes   Absurd  dark  and somehow humorous  Billy Pilgrim s disjointed timeline contrasts huge tragedies  minor tragedies  and life s mundane moments  An anti war book written by an author who seems resigned to the fact that wars  atrocities  and sheer bad luck  are as inevitable as they are pointless  Or at least  that s what I took from this on my first read  I feel like I should read it again  Slaughterhouse Five is a unique book  Part science fiction and part war story  I read this looking for a Science Fiction book  The book itself is science fiction because Billy Pilgrim travels through time throughout his own life  He pops in and out of his own life time in no particular order  He visits himself as a child  as a young man during World War II  after the war as an optometrist  and as a captive in a zoo on another planet  The book is a great read as it is complex with so much going on at one time  On Tralfamadore  Billy learns that one is always alive at some point in time  Billy experiences being a Prisoner of War for the Germans and experiences the bombing at Dresden  You also get a glimpse into the life of a war veteran and the importance of family  This is definitely a must read for any avid reader    Listen  Billy Pilgrim has come unstuck in time  It ends like this  Poo tee weet  In the words of the author  Slaughter House 5  is so short and jumbled and jangled   because there is nothing intelligent to say about a massacre  Slaughter House 5 is utter and complete nonsense  irrelevant material merged with hard real facts of war  it s absolutely brilliant  There is no structure  it leaps through time  creates absurd scenarios without demanding that you believe anything as long as you question nothing  The inherent problem with time travel  being altering time is swept under the carpet as being impossible  everything is alright  and everybody has to do exactly what he does  in other words time cannot be altered and everything will happen as it should   Everything was beautiful and nothing hurt   I don t know how I got to this stage in my life without having read this book      when a person dies he only appears to die  He is still very much alive in the past  present  and future  always have existed  always will exist      Kurt Vonnegut  Slaughterhouse FiveI also need to mention the narration by Ethan Hawke for the audiobook is superb  Early in this book  Vonnegut relates a conversation between the author narrator and a movie producer  The movie producer asks if he is writing an anti war book  and when the response is yes  he asks   Why don t you write an anti glacier book instead   Vonnegut clarifies   What he meant  of course  was that there would always be wars  that they are as easy to stop as glaciers  I believe that  too   Published in 1969  the time of Woodstock and anti war rallies at colleges across the country  this is Vonnegut s anti war message  He introduces Billy Pilgrim  a former WWII POW  becomes unstuck in time and touches on the various stages of the war  including the bombing of Dresden  which Vonnegut himself experienced in real life  It is classic Vonnegut  and I would recommend it to everyone   I swear to God  Kurt Vonnegut may be my favorite author in the entire world I read it at like 1 in the morning so my opinions on him are rather base  but in my opinion as entertainment it excels and from brief  half assed analysis he s great on the literary front as well XPHonestly  I got so engrossed in this book I didn t even realize I was 75  through until my phone rang and I had to resurface  which is  completely  different from my experience reading Jane Eyre and my pitiful cracks at Anna Karenina   I mean  they re great books and all but their style isn t my style  you know  Love it  swear by it  will probably be buried in my grave with it       unless I read another book of his I like more  D  will add link to review on blog unless i don t lawl  I liked the book  It s clear why so many people read this book  When I was trying to buy a copy of the book  I wanted one that was used  I couldn t find it in any used book store and the clerk of the last store I tried told me   We don t have any used copies of Slaughterhouse Five and almost never do  People buy the book new and don t let it go   A poignant look at war and its absurdities and the very real way it comes to change the history of mankind  Also  Tralfamadore  time travel  and Billy Pilgrim  mostly  Some may recognize the allusions within Slaughterhouse Five both to God Bless You  Mr  Rosewater  in talk of Eliot Rosewater  specifically  and to Mother Night  in talking of Howard Campbell Jr   as well as to The Sirens of Titan  in talking about the Rumfords    I loved the spacey nature of this book  Is that weird  I mean the sci fi war psychological aspect of the whole thing is quite incredible  The aliens remind me of the Venar  they are these ugly alien creatures in a video game called The Longest Journey  Basically they are the same  they live in present past and future all at the same time  They see everything  thus are accepting up everything My only complaint is that I listened to this on the Audio CD  which was done by Ethan Hawke  and he didn t do a very good job in reading it  I especially cringed when the main character is caught as a prisoner of war  and Ethan Hawke attempted to the lousiest German accent I ve heard in my life  He couldn t even do the British accent properly  which I would think wouldn t be that hard to do  I fell in love with this book almost instantly  Vonnegut s mastery of the language is absolute  his metaphors and similes are both unexpected and deeply brilliant  The book is a darkly humorous  intense and deep portrayal of both war and human nature in its most absurd essence  That is what makes it disturbingly real  Reverberates with the universal themes that Vonnegut most often pursued understanding of  death  free will  war  and life itself  Here s a true classic  within the ranks of The Great Gatsby and Shakespeare s best   a novel everyone should read  In the faraway future  when books die  so it goes   I believe this book will live on   The pinnacle of Vonnegut s cynicism is perhaps articulated when he wrote at 82 that  life is no way to treat an animal   And here in Slaughterhouse Five  we see the making of that true cynic  In my view  war perpetually astonishes Vonnegut and there is no way he can reconcile it with humanistic reason  In all anti war literature  I would tend to put Yossarin  Catch 22  and Billy Pilgrim on two extremes of the spectrum  where the former characterizes the animal instinct to evade death while not falling to the so called rationalistic motive of war  the latter finds the human belligerence utterly incomprehensible  In fact  so incomprehensible that one truly seeking virtue must refuse to inhabit the same war seeking space  That  as I mentioned  is dark cynicism at its best   This book was my introduction to postmodern and experimental writing  Later I would find other books that I would emulate more than this  but  Slaughterhouse five  was my gateway drug  if you will  The best part was the way I ended up reading it  I wanted to read something  weird   as I remember thinking  and so out of nowhere I recalled seeing part of the film version when I was in junior high on late night television  I was visiting my dad soon after my parents  divorce   For whatever reason  I mentioned this book to someone and that person said   Hey  I think that s a book   So I went to the Kent State Univ  library and got the book and read it in the loft of Harbourt Hall where I lived and  as cheesy as this sounds  it completely changed how I approached books    10 10  Maybe my favourite book of all time  this is Vonnegut at his finest  downplaying neither the horror or the absurd humour that defines human life and history  At multiple times I felt like I wanted to cry  but I wasn t sure if it was out of happiness or sadness  At the end of the day Vonnegut leaves you to decide whether the science fictional elements are real or grieving hallucinations  whether the novel is a tragedy or a comedy  or whether we should take any of his approach to life seriously at all  These are also decisions we have to make in life itself    whether to take a pessimistic  savage view of things or a gleefully absurd perspective  Vonnegut just maybe shows us the way to blend them  creating a humour that isn t oblivious to horror and vice versa  Can t believe it took me so long to read it  but I was immediately hooked  I even put a copy on my phone and would sneak away at parties just to take a moment to read another few pages  as often as I could All the great things you ve heard about this classic  are true  Vonnegut was a lucky survivor of the American fire bombing of Dresden  Germany during the second world war  His survival   he was a prisoner of war of the Germans   came about because his captors squirreled him and other POWs into a fortified underground slaughterhouse  schlachthof funf   Billy Pilgrim  the protagonist of S 5  is an obvious alter ego to Kurt Vonnegut  Pilgrim  however  is a time traveler   which adds a fascinating dimension to Vonnegut s classic memoir on acid story  This book should be an essential freshman English read  The prose is spare and plain   the story is a masterpiece  This is a very quick read   I read it in two short sittings last time I read it  But the story is timeless  it stays with you long after the book is back on the shelf  This book is wonderfully ridiculous  Why ridiculous  Because there is nothing intelligent that can be said about something as unintelligent as war  Only the birds say anything  and it s usually something like  Poo tee weet  The main character of this book  Billy Pilgrim  isn t what you would call a hero  He s more like the polar opposite of a hero  During World War II  he is the most awkward  gangly soldier there is  After the war  he is called crazy because he believes that he has been kidnapped by aliens called Tralfamadorians There isn t much to say about this book and yet there are millions of things to be said  The only thing to do is read it yourself  and then you ll understand why  It s a wonderfully ridiculous book about hideously terrible things  The book was great  the plot was great  and the characters were great  Overall  Slaughterhouse five was one of Vonnegut s best novels in my opinion  This book is unique from other books thanks to its time travel mechanic  10 10  and I would read this book again  I have major respect for the way that Vonnegut structured this novel  Flashes and images incorporated between scenarios  I can understand the criticism that some may had towards the confusion that the novel brings  but I argue that that is what makes this novel exciting  Vonnegut reminds us to live our lives by the moment and that life doesn t end but lives through the moments that we have created   Book  6 was Slaughterhouse Five by Kurt Vonnegut  This is a stark and at times comedic commentary on War  There s time travel  aliens  and porn stars  Billy Pilgrim becomes  unstuck in time  as a result of trauma from WWII  which brings the narrative back and forth through time  It may seem as though the plot is evolving arbitrarily  but I believe that it enhances the overall message behind the story  This isn t a novel about WWII  it s about the effects of war  War inflicts suffering on innocents by cruel and capricious men in power and leads to senseless deaths  So it goes  Vonnegut makes you laugh to cope with the uncomfortable subject matter  but also forces you out of passivity  It s a fantastic read that I believe EVERYONE should experience   This one really surprised me It s a satirical novel by Kurt Vonnegut about World War II and war overall   war isn t glorified in this one  there are no heroes in war  It s also about truth and personal beliefs  there are no right things and wrong things in this world  there is only a choice to choose your own standards      or well there actually isn t if you choose to listen to the aliens who say that time is just another dimension which just is  you can look at the beginning and the end  but you can t CHOOSE what happens in the future  time just is  Humans are only ones who speak of free will It s definitely now one of my favorite novels of all time  It is though a quite difficult read  definitely not for immature people  This book was so awesome  Kurt Vonnegut is definitely one of my favorite authors after this book  He connected everything so perfectly  the beginning  middle and end  Everything was in itself  and I admire his whole  no one ever really dies because we live forever in a series of moments  deal  Everything about this book was great  the way he set it up made the book almost haunting   68  The fact that this book was written in third person omniscient made the story even stronger as a whole  I love that the man telling the story was also involved in the war and was in Dresden in the time of the bombings  He connected little details of the story to himself  Overall  loved this book  I ll probably read it again in the future   I have been working my way through a popular  top 100 must read  list  This has been by far one of my favorite books  Vonnegut was a master of the English language  It is one of the few books I look forward to reading again  I found myself going over single sentences  dissecting them  and enjoying every  In SH5 Vonnegut shows how s to make simple words elegant and meaningful language  This may be my new favorite book  Vonnegut writes with such humor and poignancy about the absurdity of war  and also about human life in general  This book seems especially important now  in relation to the bizarre and meaningless events going on now in Iraq  I found some odd comfort in the book s idea that all moments in time are accessible forever    the past isn t really gone  just in another dimension  How nice to know that the sweetest moments life live on forever  waiting to be lived again whenever we wish  I loved Vonnegut s clear  simple style  His sentences are so direct and unadorned  but this allows the full power and complexity of his themes to come out  I look forward to reading more from him   This re read  narrated by James Franco  came at the perfect time in my life to slow down and let the pace  the style  the moods carry me along a current of meaning and meaninglessness  James Franco s narration is criticized by some as being flat and monotonous  but I think he provides the perfect voice for a guy with PTSD who is passive and detached    an ordinary guy who is  alright  with the extraordinary things that happen to him  a guy who is  unstuck in time  and  therefore  sees all things as on par with all other things  with no highs or lows  no milestones or exceptions Commit to giving James Franco a chance  and  the more absorbed you are in the story  the more you might love the voice   I feel like I only give five 5 stars but that s probably because if I m not loving a book to death I just won t finish it  This one surprised me  because I remember trying it years ago  No idea what my hang up was then  Anti war books are sadly never irrelevant  I just now read this classic  I know  I know  I m behind  Slaughterhouse Five is one of those books that has been on my  to read  list for years  but for one reason or another  I never got around to reading it  I now understand why this novel is considered a classic  It s one of those books written in a quirky style that I connected with early on in the prose  and even more so as the story grew  for reasons I can t quite put my finger on  The sattire  The calm  almost comedic delivery of chilling war stories  Vonnegut pulled me in and never let go  I found myself slowing down and lingering on the words longer as I noticed I was nearing the end  I simply didn t want it to be over  So it goes  I loved this book  It made me laugh out loud multiple times  It made me think  It made me question my world  And the added bonus for me was the way Vonnegut teaches about time through the marvelous Billy Pilgrim  So it goes  Ever read a book where at the end of a section  you have to sit for a minute and contemplate what the hell you just read  Slaughterhouse five is one of those books  full of parallels and complex concepts to be uncovered  I plan to read this book again on my free time at a slower pace  to get the most I can out of it  So to everyone thinking of reading this book  it would be a good to write an OR log on  but consider it for a time where you can read it at a pace that allows you to get everything you can out of it  PS if you liked Catch 22 definitely read this    Kurt Vonnegut brought to writing an offbeat sense of humor that is conveyed through his writing  I loved Slaughterhouse Five  The self mockery of man that is all to often an underlying theme in his stories make them worth reading even today   This was the first Vonnegut that I read  I had seen him interviewed on Bill Maher s HBO program  and I knew that many people considered this a classic  so I asked for it for Christmas several years ago  Last summer I packed it on a whim and took it with me on a vacation  I read it in the bathroom  on the beach  in the car  and several other places where I should have been having fun and socializing instead of being a bookworm Regardless  this started me in on my KV fascination  Although I ve only read a handful of his books  I recommend this as a solid starting place for KV s material  I can t imagine many other works knocking this off as one of my favorite reads  A great read  An anti war book  really  Part reality  part vision  part retrospective  Confusing  Enlightening  Frightening  Thought provoking  What more can you want  This one goes straight into the  favourite books I ve ever read  pile  surely to be re read a lot I loved  loved  loved this book and was transfixed from beginning to end  all the while battling the urge  mostly in vain  to read entire passages aloud to whoever was in my vicinity Bizarre  funny  and touching  it s easy to see why this is considered one of the great anti war books I won t bother to try and summarise the plot  and instead will give in to my read aloud urges once more  It is so short and jumbled and jangled  Sam  because there is nothing intelligent to say about a massacre  28 05 09Re read 06 07 10   Yup  still awesome  Can I give this book 4 5 stars  I don t feel it can really touch Catch 22  but then it is really a very different kettle of space aliens  I love how Vonnegut spins us out to Tralfamadore to emphasise how little we can really understand war  not having been there  and how wild and ridiculous it is to try to describe it and have us get our heads round it  And although the repetition of a certain phrase did grate and remind one of Billy Joel  it effectively highlighted how easily we become desensitised to death and horror  and yet served to make us notice how we ve ceased to notice  Funny  rude  pathetic  deadpan  berserk   no  it isn t Catch 22  but it is damn fine  I m rereading becuase I knew I loved the book  but couldn t remember anything about it  Slaughterhouse Five is dark  but funny  It has a heavy dose of surreal or sci fi parts  but is mainly the author s attempt to write about events that defy words  i e  his experiences in World War II and in particular the bombing of Dresden His style reminds me of the Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy except it has a more philosophical satirical twist  It s one of my favorite books of all time  although I have a love hate thing with Vonnegut s books  Loved this one hated Breakfast of Champions  Liked Cat s Cradle  hated Galapagos  Loved Hocus Pocus    Cok enteresan ve bir o kadarda sahane bir kitapti  Cok bir sey demek istemiyorum  Savasin gereksizligi  insanlar uzerindeki etkileri hiciv sanatiyla anlatilmis  Falan filan  I enjoyed  Slaughterhouse Five  a lot more than I thought I would  I avoided reading it for ages because I thought I was not intelligent enough to understand it  well I did understand it and it spoke to me in many ways Wars are raged and it s children that are fighting it  young men who become soldiers not knowing what they are facing Billy Pilgrimm the protantist of the piece shares his story of the destruction of Dresden and his time on the planet Tran  where the inhabitants believe that no one dies  they are in different realities This was my first step into the works of Kurt Vonnegut  I look forward to reading more of his books   This book made me think a lot  I loved the way it was set out  and i connected with a lot of the characters  I simply loved this book  I was really sad when Edgar Derby died    Vonnegut did not disappoint  Interesting narrative style that goes along with what I interpreted to be the thematic purpose of the novel   that as much as we try to make life like a story  with a linear progression and a beginning  middle and end   life doesn t actually work like that  It kind of moves up and down and around and then ends  often abruptly and without significant meaning  Well  also the anti war stuff  but I went into it knowing it had those undertones  Discovering this other thematic thread was much more gratifying  A great book to mull over in between all the academic books I ve been reading recently  I love Vonnegut s sense of humor  It is beautifully represented in this anti war classic  While reading it I imagined myself as the main character  watching the people around me and their dramatic gestures  The world is definitely a stage   This was my first Vonnegut experience and I was completely blown away  I usually could read a book this size in a few hours  but I found myself consuming this at a snails pace  It took me over a week and I could have stretched it out more Very rarely do I find something that makes you think about what it is saying  makes you examine how you fit into the story  I don t pretend to know much about writing styles and prose and metaphor  but this book spoke to me so eloquently I have been slowly reading the rest of Vonneguts work and although I have enjoyed most of them greatly none of them compare  So it goes  Incredible metaphors  and writing to die for  The kind that slaps you round the face with its photographic imagery  This is another one of those books where I can only wonder why I waited so long to read it  I loved it  It s brilliant  honest  funny and sad  Sometimes when I finish a good book  I have the impulse to read it again immediately  With this one  I actually did  I have an unfortunate affliction  that when I hate something I can write a review a thousand words long  but give me something I love  and I m too dumbfounded to say anything worthwhile  My apologies  This one knocked my socks off         Kindle Lending Library   February  14  Still working on filling in some of my gaps in the Classics   We are stuck in the amber of this moment   said the Tralfamodrian  And isn t that what our lives are made of  a series of moments that we recall in the museums of our mind  Billy Pilgrim is  unstuck in time   travelling back and forth across memory and space  At first I thought that this book about a soldier suffering from PTSD  but as I read I realised it is unfair to simplify Vonnegut s work like this For a novel about fatalism  I think it does have a positive note about no one having to die because they live in the memories of the people who knew them  And therefore they are immortal  So it goes  Taking another nerdy pass through the somewhat silly 1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die list this week  Now with Goodreads friendly spreadsheet I have a hard time rating books I read long ago  so I really haven t added many  That s mainly why I love saving comments on what I read now  so I can remember years later I don t think I ve read this in full since high school  which is terrible  because I don t remember it nearly as well as I want  I shall write a more thorough and articulate review here  with a tentative completion deadline of June 18  2013  The reader has probably already deduced  from the accompanying rating  that I enjoyed this book  I did not merely enjoy it  I was unexpectedly stunned by it  I will start writing around June 16  when school lets out N B  I also have several other books with incomplete reviews or placeholder stubs  As I have resolved to devote part of my college break this summer to resurrecting my neglected habit of using Goodreads  I resolve to finish my reviews of these other books by July 1st   Vonnegut s life and imagination are perhaps no better displayed than in Slaughterhouse Five  His experiences in Germany as a soldier and then a POW in WWII serve as the backdrop for this engrossing work  but it is far from a war novel  Billy Pilgrim  his hapless hero  is a wonderful character who experiences the worst that humanity has to offer while a POW in Germany but then gets to immerse himself in the time tripping immortality of Trafalmadore  A masterpiece  Great ideas in this book and so on  Having read and not read it  I d recommend it  do recommend it  Enjoy  Read this one as a kid I ll never forget the brutality    It gets under your skin and stays with you for years to come 6 star masterpiece  As perhaps my third time through this text and my second time teaching it and exploring it with my students  I m putting together more things about this text   All this happened  more or less   and  So it goes  are essentially it  keys to how we deal with our life histories and the trauma within them  Keys to how we remember and reflect  And as Billy Pilgrim and Vonnegut both use these to reflect on their horrible experiences in war  a powerful anti war statement comes through  I hate war  But at times it has been the only thing possible to stop horrible atrocities   Kurt Vonnegut s Billy Pigrim is by all western standards mentally insane  It s just everybody else around him who are fucking crazy  And that is the magic of S 5  The  sane  people shoot each other  blow each other up to kingdom come with fire bombs and talk about war like it s a honorific way for a man to become a hero In the middle Billy  whose consciousness keeps moving to past and present events of happier more easily understandable moments  and in the more understandable there s a alien abduction And that is the point  an alien abduction makes more sense than war  So it goes  An amazing work that everyone should read   Es una novela belica   memoria personal   metafisica   ciencia ficcion  segun se tome  Yo me la tome mal  como metafisica  y me hizo sentir claustrofobico  con mi propio destino fuera de todo control  como si se me escapara la vida con cada aliento Pasado el tiempo  reconozco que me fue de mucha ayuda  Ahora cuando estoy pasando un mal rato  tengo una experiencia extracorporea  me voy a mi sitio feliz  tralala  no te oigo  tralala y a esperar a que pase la tormenta Como decia Kubrick   Como deje de preocuparme y aprendi a aceptar mi destino   Honestly  Vonnegut is probably my favorite writer  So this review is probably pretty biased  This was the third Vonnegut book I read  I started with  God Bless You  Mr  Rosewater  and  Breakfast of Champions   and I ve reread it multiple times since  I love Vonnegut s writing style  it s as if he s just telling you the story matter of factly  no frills  no bullshit  and this story is creative and is endlessly quotable  I could go on and on but I ll keep this short  this book is a short read  but it s one that will stay with you for years to come   I could easily write a 3 000 word essay about Vonnegut s genius on paper that is Slaughterhouse Five  but I won t  Because A  I write these mini reviews on my phone and B  It would be more of an examination and less of a review  However  I will say that using time as a flexible dimension to explore the impact of the inhumanity of war on the human psyche is a smart experiment  It pays off in unexpected ways and leads first time Vonnegut readers to reconsider preconceived notions they may have held going into a book with so much acclaim  a classic american must read  wow  it s short too   A mind blowing journey  filled with plenty of thought provoking moments  black humor scattered here and there  acting like speed breakers  Slaughterhouse Five is a story of war  which should turn the reader into an anti war advocate by the end of the read  If it doesn t  then consider re reading  Not many books on war stir the soul like this one  The psychological effects of prolonged battlefield encounters are told with some good humor and yet  painful brutality  It should be read slowly  word by word in order savor its absolute brilliance  I can t believe I d never read this before   Deserving of its reputation  One of the greatest American novels ever written  Based on fact  Vonnegut s personal life experience during WWII as a POW and the absurd bombing of Dresden  and mixed with pure fantasy of Billy Pilgrim s abduction to a distant planet called Tralfamador  where he becomes unstuck in time and randomly bounces from one instance of his life to another As fun as is the structure of this novel  it is a very serious novel  The subject matter and opinions evoke serious thought A must read and re read  Has anyone else unintentionally held this book with their left hand and looked at the cover to discover the new title  Laughterhouse Five  If you have  you have experienced what this book is all about  Here Vonnegut juxtaposes laughter and slaughter in a stoic way  but he does so without a trace of snottiness that is so common in nearly all cynicism   Did you hear it there a bit  The page or so where he sees the war movie in reverse was sheer genius and an absolute treat to read  I wanted to applaud  but I was holding a book  Classic Vonnegut  You really can t have a bad Vonnegut book in your hands ever  He has to be the only author you could possibly never stop reading  so magical  It was morbid and black  and Vonnegut s sense of humor and bits of beautifully done sci fi just makes everything so perfect  You can t get through a Vonnegut book without a Nazi or war reference and in this one he really got in depth with it was refreshing and helps as a lead in for every book he did  READ EVERY VONNEGUT BOOK YOU CAN GET YOUR HANDS ON RIGHT NOW       This is a great book  If you re new to Kurt Vonnegut   Slaughterhouse Five  is generally regarded as his most exemplary and definitive work  so it s a good starting point  It s a quirky and very clever novel that succeeds in painting the concept of war as trivial  truly absurd  and wholly unnecessary  Billy Pilgrim may be the most pathetically endearing character ever written  Like all Vonnegut works  you can easily finish it in a day  so you should read it  and if you like it  you ll be thankful for it  and if you don t     Well  so it goes  KV s best in my opinion  Beautiful and poetic Billy Pilgrim has come unstuck in time  So begins one of the most brilliant  hilarious  heartbreaking  and compelling novels I ve ever read  Kurt Vonnegut has very rarely failed to absolutely satisfy me  and this book is probably his masterpiece  All his works reflect his rather wry and sarcastic view of life  but this one  drawn directly from his experience watching the firebombing of Dresden  is one of the most harrowing  yet beautiful works of fiction I ve ever experienced  Highly recommended for everyone  Slaughterhouse Five got better the further into it I read  I m usually a fan of WWII themed literature in general  but Vonnegut s sad and beautiful narrative goes beyond the average retelling of the war and bombing of Dresden  He presents a disordered world that s very much ordered  an insane man who s very much sane  and a shocking series of events that are very much the way of the world  Pay attention to the details  and you ll see how everything comes together  all the inseparable little pieces of life  war  and peace  A comfort re read  How better than to write book about war than with an insane protagonist  Tragic  sad and beautiful  Great book   A very interesting story  Quite meta throughout  It manages to be different in a way that I don t find irritating  not  say  like Ulysses   So it goes  Agapesa to Bonegkat ligo anapoda  prota latrepsa ton

suggest visitors read this novel before coming for a visit  This city has many scars to show from the bombings and subsequent fires  but for getting to the heart of what happened here  the true scope   terror of it  I feel nothing compares to Slaughterhouse Five As if that isn t enough  Vonnegut intersperses fact with fiction  history with humor  aliens with humans  and the results are sublime  If you re not a fan going in  I bet you will be coming out   I love Vonnegut   this was my second time reading this story and I now have a clearer vision of the protagonist s defense mechanisms in response to what he witnessed in the war  Somehow  Vonnegut makes it comical rather than appalling  a decision that separates his work from other run of the mill efforts to encapsulate the insanity of war on paper Read this as part of my daughter Kacie s high school reading curriculum and really quite pleased to be able to talk with her about the novel once we finished  It is an adult read  most definitely  There is some explicit sexual language  violence  and offensive language  It is not a book that I would want my sons to read alone    at all  That said  reading it aloud together was a very useful experience  It is a war book  And it is not about glory  or heroism  or patriatism  and does not fill war with any romantic notions  War is disgusting  brutal  harsh  false  and crazy  And that is what this book shows Kurt Vonnegut is such an extraordinary writer  He writes in the first person about writing this book  meeting his war buddy and discussing it  the wife gets angry  the plot is laid out  and at some point the book begins and we are listening to the story of Billy Pilgrim    drawn right in  And as the book is coming to a conclusion he eases us back out of the story  by interrupting a scene with the statement   That was me  It was I who stood there and saw that  Billy is unstuck in time  so the story is told entirely out of sequence  We travel not only through Billy s war years  but his life before and afterward and how it is all interrelated  He shows us how one thing has led to another through all of Billy s life  by telling it to us completely out of order  And Billy is abducted by aliens    from Tralfamadore who help him to understand his problems with time better since they live in 4 dimensions  Isaac  15 insists that Billy really does come unstuck in time and really was abducted by Tralfamadorians and it has nothing to do with the fact that Billy was reading really bad science fiction and trying to process his war experience  But he is thinking about it  Judah  13 is not entering the conversation  The idea that a story is not exactly as it is being told is a new one to both boys  And it is sort of fun to see Isaac mulling it   could it be that what we are reading is Billy s perception but not the reality  Are there clues in the story of what the reality is And nobody likes Billy s daughter All in all  this was a great experience reading aloud  There were some paragraphs that I was glad to be the one reading  and was selective in how I read  I mainly take my cue from the boys on this  I have usually read bad language aloud when it has come up in a story  but Isaac and Judah don t  They substitute words or say bleep  This book had more than we have run across in others  and they didn t like it when I read it aloud  so I made sure we all three had copies of the book and were following along  but I imitated the boys and left out the offensive language  The language was appropriate to the story    and they saw it  But it is not appropriate for the life we are living in our home  so we didn t say it  This is always a hard call for me  but I think my sons are steering me right  I mean  it s vonnegut  of COURSE I m going to love it  Slaughterhouse Five is a revelation  The book is so unbelievably good  it leaves one quite gob smacked  It destroys the idea of a linear storyline  beginning in medias res and jumping forward  backwards and sideways in a narrative equivalent of playing dice  and yet comes together in the end seamlessly  the various threads in the tapestry of the story settling together beautifully  It deconstructs the entire idea of a narrative and leaves one to play with the frames  The prose is simple yet strangely melodic  phrases are repeated in a frenetic build up towards a climax that leaves one deeply disturbed  yet the proposed climax is not a climax at all  simply another side note  It is a stroke of genius on part of a master storyteller imbued with a deep sense of irony  And indeed  the humour of Slaughterhouse Five  as many of Vonnegut s books  is a gentle yet incisive presence that in no way lessens the sense of pathos and tragedy in the novel Is it a novel about heroes  or a bunch of pathetic pawns used up and thrown away  Who knows The book is very  meta   self consciously self aware  There are repeated reminders that it is a constructed story apparently based on real events  yet  the author inserts himself into the action  physically as a couple of throwaway remarks  emotionally and authorially as a constant presence It is  perhaps  the most poignant 20th century cry against war  The protagonist s mental state  I took to be one of severe shell shock  although this is only one of several interpretations possible  One of my friends was intrigued by the interpolation of the alien storyline and commented on how this gives a sense of objective distance  a clinical studying of the human condition  The book also explores other themes in astute layers  like any good book should  yes  it is a book about war  but it is also one about sex and life and death and politics and power  in shirt  it is a book that bleeds into the human condition  So it goes    Slaughterhouse  Five  is a novel that at its core is about the very meaning of human existence  Are we merely going through the motions of life  or do we control our destinies  What are our obligations to our fellow humans  Is there any great design to the universe and our lives  There is nothing new in those questions  but the way that Mr  Vonnegut examines these questions is still unique and relevant  decades after this novel s first publication The novel s protagonist is Billy Pilgrim  whose metaphorical name gives insight into his journey  Billy Pilgrim goes through life  he does not participate in it  Billy believes that all action is preordained  and thus he lets life happen to him  Yet despite this pathetic choice  Billy is an everyman worth rooting for  He is content with his lot  even if we the readers are not content with his passivity Like the best novels  S5 lets the reader choose what the right thing is  and allows more than one side to every issue  Vonnegut has managed to write a book about war  human nature  natural selection  religious belief  death  history  and the value of choice in one s life  He tackles these plethora of themes in a novel that encapsulates time travel  aliens  WW II  and the humdrum of middle class life  Now that is a feat And the greatest thing about this novel is that every read yields new insights and lessons  Its themes are vast  and its pleasures continue to grow  I have read it over six times  and I learn something new each time  It is simplistically written and executed  but it is a work that is very deep and wide Read and think and you will not be disappointed  Kurt Vonnegut successfully wrote Slaughter House Five as an antiwar book that proves to the reader that war is a tragic endeavor fought by a nations children  and it also results in nothing but destruction  He does this by using rhetorical devices such as worried diction and repetition  First off this can be seen when the narrator states  We had forgotten that wars were fought by babies  When I saw those freshly shaved faces  it was a shock   My God  My God   I said to myself    It s the Children s Crusade   106   The way Vonnegut phrases this sentence represents in a similar way how a person would react as if they had stumbled upon something horrific such as a murder  which is fitting because he had discovered that the two sides are having their children basically murder each other  Throughout the whole story Vonnegut uses repetition to help show the total destruction caused by military actions  One piece of evidence is the way  so it goes  is repeated whenever something to do with death happens or when it seems the narrator does not want go into depth with an item  Vonnegut uses this quote from items ranging from champagne being flat to the death of a character named Roland Weary who fought in World War Two with Billy  Another use of repetition is when a bird sings  Poo tee weet  on page 19 and on 215 the last word of the story about Billy Pilgrams mentally unstable trips through time  Vonnegut uses this at the end after the bombing of Dresden which is a German city that was also a prisoner of war camp that the allied forces bombed and killed up to 25 000 civilians and soldiers  This simplistic is the only quote in the entire last chapter because as Vonnegut said early in the story while he was trying to pitch the story to Seymour Lawrence a publisher  when he states    there is nothing intelligent to say about a massacre  Everybody is suppose to be dead  never say anything or want anything ever again  Everything is supposed to be very quit after a massacre  and it always is  except for the birds  And what do birds say  All there is to say about a massacre  things like Poo tee weet    Overall this provides accurate insight for why Vonnegut chose that particular phrase  The novel  Slaughterhouse Five   by Kurt Vonnegut  tells the story of World War Two veteran Billy Pilgrim  Vonnegut mixes science fiction and historical fiction  Throughout the book the main character Billy  time travels   as he calls it  to different parts of his life  This ranges from his World War Two days  to his wedding  and to other various events in his life  One of the significant places that he travels to is the alien inhabited planet called   Tralfamadore   where he experiences events that he deems real  but the reader may deem insane  The entire story the focus sets in on the question of sanity  Is Billy crazy  Did the war make him so  There are many things that point to the fact that he is  or not  The book keeps the reader questioning everything over the course of the entire book  One of the many things that stood out to me as a reader was the repetition of the phrase   so it goes   After the many deaths or tragedies in this novel  each segment is ended with the phrase  so it goes   Slowly but surely it becomes a huge symbol for the book itself  and a pattern as well  This book is very well written  but the reader must also take it to account the constant alternating time periods of Billy Pilgrim s life  This can easily get confusing if not enough attention is paid while reading  Using the reputation and alternation of plot lines  Kurt Vonnegut does a great job of representing Billy and his crazy  mystical life  The entire novel is a symbol for anti war  and it becomes clear by the end  While reading though  the reader might think differently  Over all I think this book is a masterpiece  and can easily be one of the best books that I have ever read  Not only because of the wonderful rhetoric used  but the theme  symbols as well as the crazy story line   THis book had great continuity  Now you re thinking  maybe  what  how can this have great continuity  This book jumps back and forwards into time  that is not continuous  maybe you said that  maybe not  Well the thing is  as a Tralfamadorean would say  time is always flowing there is no end  what ever happened in the past is still happeneing I mean it happened but in that moment its still there you may be in the forward  that doesnt mean the past ended  The book was future past present mix mix mix but it foreshadowed everything from the beginning to the end  Everything you can trace back to the horrible experience of the war  The bad choices he made with his marriage  the lack of love he feels towards his family  his apathy towards his surroundings  Although this book was about alien abduction and a seemingly kooky man who knows his future  it makes sense  I read this novel the same time as A TALE FOR THE TIME BEING which was time travel related and it enhanced my experience  THey both discarded the notion of linear time and made everything seem interconnected and fluid and it was intersting  The book left me feeling melancholy and numb and sad for the man  Great read     thanks for the book Kurt Vonnegut s Slaughterhouse Five is the story of Billy Pilgrim  It chronicles Billy s life through World War II and beyond  A major event that happens in the book is the firebombing of Dresden  Germany during the war  Billy was a prisoner of war in Dresden at the time of the bombing  so we get a firsthand account of what it was like when it happened  and after  Billy Pilgrim s experience in the war was based on the authors experiences  Kurt Vonnegut was a prisoner of war in Dresden when it was bombed as well  so we get a very accurate idea of what this horrible event was like  The thing I took away most from the novel was that the horrible things that the people who went to war experienced must haunt them forever  Billy is plagued throughout the book with the belief that he has been  and continues to be  abducted by aliens  and that he is unstuck in time  I interpret this as Billy s PTSD  Billy experienced atrocious acts of violence  saw more death than most people should  and is left with a crippling psychosis  That is why I think that the book s main theme is that war is horrible  and no one should have to experience it  I really enjoyed Slaugterhouse Five  The thing I liked most of it was its unconventional writing style  It is written in a way that really shows how chaotic Billy s life is  Events in the book do not happen in any chronological order  reflecting the fact that Billy believes to be unstuck in time  This is a very interesting thing in the book  and I enjoyed it greatly  Overall I give the book five stars  My grandfather  a WWII veteran  passed away in early October of this year  I immediately gravitated toward reading Kurt Vonnegut Jr   an author I d always associated with dealing with the tougher issues in life  ever since finding and reading  Welcome to the Monkey House  in a collection of science fiction short stories in the back room of a used bookstore  So it goes  Slaughterhouse Five is one of the most incredible books I have ever read  I have always been grateful for selfish reasons  aka I would quite possibly not exist  that my grandfather was dismissed from being a radioman on bombers due to problems with his sinuses at such high altitudes  I never really considered what a horrific experience knowing you participated in dropping bombs would ve been This is an anti war book  It s so much more that that  It s science fictiin  it s literature  it s a study on the absurdity of war for the men  and now women  who fight it  and the psychological wounds they re left with if they survive  This should be required reading for everyone on the planet  Maybe we wouldn t be so quick to rush into war if it were  But  as the terrible events of yesterday show  that is most likely a pie in the sky dream  Or maybe those moments really are set in time and unchangeable like Billy believed  I feel that slaughterhouse five was a very entertaining book with its dark humor  but still taught me a few things about life  It could be offensive to some people for certain parts in the book  but those parts are needed to teach the readers what Kurt Vonnegut s views are Kurt mentions God in his story  He says that humans have no free will and pretty much says God is fake  This could anger a lot of Christians and I can understand them being offended  He wanted to make a point of his beliefs and his understandings of what he thought The biggest offensive thing that he touches on is how he trivializes life  Every time somebody dies he just says  so it goes   The massive amount of death in this book is not mourned as much as you think it should be  He even starts to trivialize his own life and the main character starts realizing how unimportant he is in the grand scheme of things Even though many people find this offensive  this can be eye opening and deep for others  I think that it really showed me how war is inevitable and death is everywhere  Someone dying  even many dying don t change much in the grand scheme of the universe The ideal age for this book is probably high school students  You have to be old to fully understand a lot of the deeper meanings he touches on in the book  Anyone who either has a dark sense of humor or doesn t get offended easily will appreciate the values in this book and it s entertainment   All the moments  past  present  and future  always have existed  always will exist  When I first picked up Slaughterhouse Five  I thought that this would just be another book talking about trauma of war  because it is labeled an anti war book  After reading several chapters  I came to realize that it is not solely about war  it is also about the influence of life  death  and all the events in between  on shaping someone s habits and identity  All the moments in Slaughterhouse Five by Kurt Vonnegut have always existed  The protagonist  Billy Pilgrim  jumps back and forth between different time periods of his life  unbounded by the concept of time  Therefore  Billy Pilgrim does not look back at things like everyone else does  instead he re lives them  The book initially sounded like a crazy fantasy to me  and it was hard to follow along  but later  I realized that there is no need to try to line up all the events in the normal chronological order  That was exactly the message Vonnegut was trying to convey  Everything is always happening and exists at the same time  whether one is aware or vividly experiencing it or not  Billy Pilgrim learned this from the Tralfamadorians that captured him  This is the perspective these aliens view their life  They are not emotional about deaths  because they think that everything that has happened is still happening and that person is always alive at some point in time  This drastically different viewpoint was extremely intriguing  and this is why I was hooked ever since reading about this in the second chapter As I progressed  I could clearly see why this book was challenged  First of all  it frequently uses dirty and offensive languages and has sexual content  Second of all  because of its truthful description of the sheer absurdity and horror of war  Vonnegut used vivid imagery to present the cruelness of the war  for example  while describing a soldier s blood in this quote   Now they were dying in the snow  feeling nothing  turning the snow to the color of raspberry sherbet   54   By putting the symbol of violence and death with an enjoyable dessert  Vonnegut demonstrates the indifference towards human lives that most people would develop during a war  However  most of the challenging content of this book serves a purpose being there  They make the book more realistic and prevent the reality of wars from getting sugar coated  Only could this sense of reality establish the link with how Billy Pilgrim rebuilt himself after the war  This is what makes the book more worth reading than it already is  Even though the book is written from a third person perspective  one should treat it like first person and read it as if he or she was living through Billy s life  This is why I would recommend this book to everyone who is able to discard all their personal ideals and put themselves into the author or the narrator s skin while they read  This is the only way one can truly understand this masterpiece by Kurt Vonnegut  When I first sat down to read this book I had weird expectations about it  I had heard from some that aspects of the book were sci fi related  which originally drew my attention to the book  and I heard from others that the book was focused more on the bombing of Dresden  Both of these expectations were correct to some extent  but the truth is  I should have gone into the book with no expectations whatsoever  I read through the book wondering a lot  The book is extremely though provoking  seeming to ask the reader to focus more on how it is talking about Billy s  the main character s  story  than about the actual story  I truly enjoyed this book because it used its science fiction aspects to leave me with questions about how I chose to see things in life  questions that really don t have a correct answer This book is truly one that can t be compared to any other I ve read before  The use of random time jumps within the narrative is confusing and brilliant at the same time  Yet it s difficult to start reading this book with no expectations when it has such a reputation as it does Vonnegut s Slaughterhouse Five has been contested by many and has had many attempts made at it to be banned  It s not hard to see why some might try to do this  The book contains use of some  questionably  inappropriate language  descriptions of sex  discussion of death  and some paragraphs contradictory to aspects of the Christian faith  Yet none of this seems to amount to an argument worth having the book banned over Now this book probably isn t for serious Christians  or for people who are uncomfortable with reading about sex  but this isn t what really could make the book questionable  The main reason why an argument over this book s content could begin is because of the phrase it repeats most often  So it goes Yet whether the phrase is actually worthy of objection is all a matter of perspective  Some could try to say that this quote is a form of nihilism  The quote is repeated after any time something can be described as dead  Whether it is a bug dying  or the entire city of Dresden  Billy repeats   So it goes   People who have an issue with this might try to say that repeating   so it goes  after someone dies might appear to devalue the significance of a person s life  They might also try to say that this kind of view on human life is also supported by how Vonnegut questions the existence of free will  But actually   so it goes  means the opposite and helps make the point in the story The whole point of Slaughterhouse Five is to illustrate how pointless it is to look backwards in time  Vonnegut says it best in the first chapter where he says exactly that and also says  there is nothing intelligent to say about a massacre   The massacre happened  and massacres are bad  What else can be said or done about something that already happened  The story is a satire  which is why he makes a point about not looking back by ironically telling a story about the past  The Tralfamadorians  a species of aliens in the story  also help illustrate this because they never look back in time  They experience all time simultaneously  They were also the ones who introduced Billy to the phrase  so it goes   They don t use it as a way of devaluing the loss of a life  rather they recognize the significance by realizing that death is just something that happens  When a Tralfamadorian sees a corpse  all he thinks is that the dead person is in bad condition at a particular moment  but that the same person is just fine in plenty of other moments   So it goes  essentially means that bad things happen but so do good things  and that whatever happens  happens  When free will is brought into question  it just means that whatever happens can t be changed  and that whatever is going to happen is going to happen  Vonnegut doesn t mean to be nihilistic  he just tries to say that no matter what happens  time goes on Nevertheless  whether someone views  so it goes  as what it was intended to mean  or as a phrase promoting a nihilistic view on life  they should still read the book  Mostly  this book should be read by anyone interested in discussions on philosophies because that s what this book promotes  In the story  Vonnegut never tries to convince anyone that the Tralfamadorian way of thinking is the right way to think  He presents this idea to the reader in the book and allows the reader to form his or her own opinions about it  Anybody who reads this book will most likely have a stronger opinion on how they view the world by the time they finish the book  Listen Slaughterhouse Five by Kurt Vonnegut is the most unique book you will ever read  yes  you WILL read it  and I do recommend it   Although many may object to this book s vulgar content  which mostly consists of sexual innuendo  explicit language  and sometimes  disturbing war imagery   the sensitive content is necessary to tell the story  Without these things  the book wouldn t be realistic   More on this later  This book follows the story  but not chronologically  of Billy Pilgrim  a war veteran that survived the Dresden bombing  Although the plot is sort of hard to follow  I don t think that the point of this book is to read a story  I know it sounds unorthodox  but this whole book is pretty unorthodox   I think the point of this book is to look at the relationship between Billy s real life and his experiences when he is with the Tralfamadorians  an alien race that kidnaps Billy and takes him to their home planet  Tralfamadore   The sub plot of the story  him and a girl being taken to this species  seems to be closely related to one of the books of Pilgrim s favorite author  Kilgore Trout Once the relationship between these two are examined  one may notice that the stories told are weirdly similar  Billy uses the Tralfamadorians as his own way of escaping  When we humans are in a bad uncomfortable place  we allow our minds to take us somewhere better  As for our main character  Billy slips into a reverie that takes him to Tralfamadore  Perhaps it is PTSD  or maybe it s just human nature Some say that this is NOT an anti war book  War seems to be all about eradicating sensitivity  There isn t anything sensitive about 100 000s of men women all dressed the same way  There isn t anything sensitive about a rifle  War is about pulling yourself together even when your best friend gets shot next to you  at least  that s what the media makes it seem like   It is these reasons that make me believe that this is an anti war book  Once again  I know it sounds weird  but bear with me  With every death  Vonnegut says   So it goes   This is the mentality that he has developed as a solider  For him  death happens  and the world keeps turning  The sun will rise the next day  It s desensitizing  In fact  even with all the deaths in this book  Vonnegut notes that   When Billy saw the condition of his means of transportation  he burst into tears  He hadn t cried about anything else in the war    So it goes  is repeated so many times that it almost sounds like Vonnegut is making fun of it  I mean he uses it in REALLY weird ways sometimes  For example   It didn t make a pop  The champagne was dead  So it goes   Vonnegut writes this book about these insensitive things  war  bombings  etc    and he makes them    vulnerable  Some readers complain that the plot of the book makes no sense  and the author just inserted random stories wherever he felt like it  The  seemingly  random pattern that the stories are arranged in  the constant uncertainty  I mean the opening line is   All this happened  more or less  The war parts  anyway  are pretty much true     and everything in between  It s all so    human  At the beginning of this book  Vonnegut vulnerably proclaims   I thought it would be easy for me to write about the destruction of Dresden    But not many words about Dresden came from my mind then     Sometimes when you feel so much  you don t have anything to say  I ve learned that it s possible to be so overcome with emotion that you feel  think  and say nothing at all  This lack of words that he has regarding the war is human also  Although this book is fiction  a war book has never captured so much truth and raw emotion as this one has  That s why the explicit content is necessary for this book  There isn t anything censored about the human mind  It s all a big jumbled train wreck  but it s beautiful  just like this book To further expand on this thought  there is one scene that tells a bit more about how Vonnegut wrote this book  While Billy is reading a Tralfamadorian book  a Tralfamadorian says to him      each clump of symbols is a brief  urgent message describing a situation  a scene  We Tralfamadorians read them all at once  not one after the other  There isn t any particular relationship between all the messages  except that the author has chosen them carefully  so that  when seen all at once  they produce an image of life that is beautiful and surprising and deep   That s what this book is  All the little clips of Billy s life we see may not be related to one another  although I do believe that the Tralfamadorian scenes are related to Billy s life   but when they re read all at once  they make something beautiful  So maybe this book isn t so human  as I ve been saying  Maybe it s more Tralfamadorian My experience reading this book was a very positive one  The many twists and turns made the story interesting to read  and the constant change of direction makes the reader question why Vonnegut would put the events in the order that he did  Not only was it fun to read  but the quality of the story only shone brighter once you began to think about discuss the book  This story would be better to read with a group of people to discuss the connections between events  Overall  I recommend this book to anyone looking for a raw  vulnerable  and real look not just inside of war  but inside the human mind  Slaughter House Five Slaughter House Five is undoubtably a book full of controversial topics such as profanity  sexual content  and references to drugs  yet is also considered an American classic  It is no mystery to anyone who reads this book why it was banned  because of the excessive use of the things mentioned above  which should be made known to anyone planning to read this book   In some part of the book  the profanity can actually add emphasis to the story  and show how serious or not the main character Billy is at any point in time  Those parts however can be few and far between  The rest is superfluous to say the least  such as when the book talks about how Billy  Had had a wet dream of Montana Wildhack   which added nothing to the story  Even with all of the controversial topics the book is filled with  it is still a great book that deserves to be read  not be avoided  despite of these things  This profanity is in no way the point of the book  and not why it should be read  The point of the book is it s intriguing moral  to look at time as a line with every event happening at the same time  indefinitely  and not trying to avoid or wait for the inevitable  The book is also is in part about a topic  the bombing of Dresden  that is little known in today s times  I say in part because the book covers so many topics  and tells so many stories  exactly why it should be read  I think it is given too much credit for being  a book about the bombing of Dresden    This book is definitely made for older audiences  and I think should not be read by kids younger than in the ninth grade  The book most certainly caters to people that are not so politically correct  because it lends itself to being offensive to people without a thick skin and a good sense of humor  The book should definitely be read with an open mind  because if someone is worried about the profanity  or focused on trying to organize the out of order events  they will miss the whole reason why they should read it  This reason  is the intriguing and important moral of the story  Overall this was a great book that I could not put down mostly because of the interesting way it was written  At first the book s out of order events do take a while to understand and piece together  but they also make you want to keep reading because you get little tastes of events and want to continue reading to find out what happens with each one of them  The book really made me and many other readers  I m sure  ponder how time works as well as the very concept of time itself  a good thing I think to do every once in a while  Other reviews of the book  many of which are from parents  really focus on two parts of the book  One  the profanity and sexual references  understandably enough is a main focus for many of these reviewers  which of course was the main reason the book was banned in the first place  These people  I say  however are missing the forest for the trees  as explained above  The second criticism people have with the book is that they can not understand it because it is too hard to follow  These people are overlooking the whole point the book is trying to teach  Instead of trying to always understand why  and more importantly in the book when things are happening  we should just accept them for what they are    Slaughterhouse Five follows Billy Pilgrim throughout his not so normal and literally twisted life  Imagine fighting in the battle of the bulge  about to be taken prisoner when you literally see your life beginning to end   And so it goes   This book not only introduces the reader to a time bending life of billy  but also includes aliens  Yes that s rights aliens  These aren t your normal shoot em up aliens but instead are there to tell billy about their perception of time and how they look at life s better moments  Billy returns to earth but mentions nothing about aliens  Who would if all you got called was crazy   I personally liked this book  but not from the very beginning  This book really started to interest me when Billy begins to experience abnormal things  With this being said  if you re a person who doesn t like books that start slow or are at times a little confusing then I recommend you stay away from it  On the other hand if you re a person who can follow a book from start to finish  or are interested in World War Two history  the topic of  time traveling  then this book is for you  Whilst on the topic of whom would and wouldn t like it I ll mention to all the parents out there  depending on who you are  that this books is not MEANT for anyone under the age of 15 I advise this because  while the book doesn t have a ton of cursing or a ton of things about sex or drugs  their is an average amount of all of those things within the whole book   Slaughterhouse Five  the title made me to imagine terrible stories and feel foreboding  It s true in a manner  But  on the other hand this book include the amusing stories too  The background of this book starts at the Second World War  The author wrote with his real experience  The reason of how that could be able  he fought an war as an American  then he became an American prisoner of war in the Germany  So he was taken to the POW camp which is located in the Dresden  Germany  Its name is the Slaughterhouse Five  It has the origin that there was the time when it was being slaughterhouse  He spend the hard time and eventually saw the death of 130 thousand people with the bombing of Dresden  The author described vividly how it was terrible  When the story of the slaughterhouse end  the story that about the time travel of Bill Pilgrim starts  It was very amused to read  I really liked  so it goes  during reading a book and after reading I think it is the author s own method to convey the impression to the readers  and I really love it now too  Overall  this book was the attractive book  In fact  I don t know much about the eruption of Dresden  and how it was terrible  But I can get the knowledge of this book including the eruption of Dresden  It was great time to read this book    Listless playthings of enormous forces I enjoyed listening to the book so much I started it right over again once I finished  Ethan Hawke s whisper perfectly suits Billy Pilgrim s numbness throughout the book  and the resigned but compassionate tone of the book as a whole I was especially interested in the little ideas and symbols that are repeated in different contexts throughout the novel  almost like memes  The phrase  So it goes  is the most recognizable example  At least twice  bottles described as being carried like dinner bells  Frequently a dog barks in the distance  and occasionally the sound resembles that of a brass gong  Details of Billy s Tralfamadorian captivity turn up in Kilgore Trout novels  or vice versa But the Three Musketeers seems like the richest meme of the bunch  Their first appearance is in the form of a candy bar eaten by a jaded Chicago newswire editor  This apparently real life detail from Vonnegut s past is later echoed by the fictional Valencia Merble eating the same type of candy bar while visiting Billy in the veteran s hospital near Lake Placid  Chronologically  the first appearance of The Three Musketeers is in Roland Weary s escape fantasy  where he pictures himself and the two Army scouts as analogs of the swashbuckling French heroes An interesting factoid  3 Musketeers candy bars debuted in 1932 as separate chocolate  strawberry and vanilla bars  all in one package  Wartime sugar rationing led Mars to scale back their product to just the chocolate bar  which was the most popular anyway  Could this be called a parallel to the way the two scouts are picked off while Weary  at least temporarily  survives When Billy first arrives in Dresden  wearing silver Cinderlla boots and an azure curtain  one of the residents takes him for a clown and seems  to be demanding satisfaction  from him  This may or may not be a parallel to d Artagnan challenging Comte de Rochefort and  later  the eponymous three musketeers to duels By the time The Three Musketeers show up in the mouths of the jaded Chicago newswire editor and Billy s fiancee  the source material has been thoroughly corrupted  At one point the narrator describes humans as  listless playthings of enormous forces   That also goes for bits of information  they are the playthings of the enormous forces of cultural transmutation  I saw the film version of Slaughterhouse Five before reading the book  which led me to believe that the experience of reading the book would be  in a sense  anticlimactic  I was wrong  The movie is great  but the book is more powerful and more true to the Tralfamadorian adage  All time is all time  It does not change   It simply is   Once Billy Pilgrim becomes unstuck in time  he experiences this first hand  And once he gets over the shock of living his life in a random order  of visiting and revisiting particular moments haphazardly  he attains a sort of serenity and calm acceptance of the inevitability of events that are inevitable because they have already happened and always will happen  The pivotal moment in Billy s life is the firebombing of Dresden by the Allied forces  He is present at this holocaust as an American POW housed in one of the city s slaughterhouses  as was Vonnegut himself  After that horrifying and surreal experience  even being abducted by aliens is not terribly shocking or distressing This is not just an anti war novel  it s an anti human novel  While Vonnegut may find certain individuals sympathetic and worthy of respect  this does not change the fact that he sees the race as a whole as dangerous and loathsome  And ridiculous  Slaughterhouse Five is a book filled with vitriol and love and tedium and horror and wonder and moments of earth shattering clarity  all rendered with Vonnegut s signature black humor and understatement  This book is his masterpiece  I hereby promote him to my pantheon of favorite writers  Non solo hard sci fi  non solo pedante e didascalica fantascienza sociologica  non solo esercizi ucronici dal sapore accademico  quanto non penosamente nostalgico   la fantascienza puo essere anche poesia  e Mattatoio n 5 ne e la prova  Poesia tragica  amara  ironica  tutto in un solo libro che  una volta letto  si potra amare o odiare  ma mai dimenticare Qui l elemento fantastico recita un ruolo tutto sommato marginale  Il romanzo ritrae la vita del protagonista  Billy Pilgrim  un personaggio semiserio  simbolo dell  americano medio   la cui vita e segnata dalla Seconda Guerra Mondiale e in particolare dal bombardamento di Dresda di cui e testimone come prigioniero di guerra tedesco  Billy non segue un ritmo di vita normale  la sua coscienza viaggia casualmente da un punto all altro della sua esistenza  allo stesso modo e strutturato il romanzo  composto da episodi diversi disposti secondo una sequenza senza  almeno apparentemente  un filo logico  II romanzo  che romanzo non e  e privo di qualsiasi pathos narrativo  come di una trama degna di tale nome  alla larga quindi cultori di intrecci muscolosi  personaggi stereotipati e quant altro  I dialoghi sono caratterizzati da un umorismo  a volte anche macabro  e da un sarcasmo di fondo dovuto alla rassegnazione  allo sconforto di fronte alla natura umana  Come ho gia detto  poesia  When I first read the blurb  I expected some fantasy story where a man time travels and has all sorts of mixed adventures  chiefly surrounding the war  Instead  I found it to be a powerful novel on the effects of PTSD  where Billy Pilgrim s  time travelling  seems to be  at times  both a method of escapism  from the travesty of war  and also a device of torment   plunging him back into Dresden and its destruction The book delves into the fact that so many of the soldiers were barely escaping the clutches of childhood when they were packed up  shipped off  and forced to kill or be killed  or  in some cases  taken as prisoners   The war is referred to as The Children s Crusades  The lasting effect that war has on people s lives was quite thought provoking   for many  there is no escape from the grotesque and brutal thing known as war  They can clamber to another point in time  sure  but their salvation will only be temporary Vonnegut s prose is simple yet a joy to read  He doesn t pollute his pages with overly detailed descriptions  instead  he paints the rough picture and lets our imagination take over  which I found to be wonderfully effective Slaughterhouse Five is a pretty short book and a beautifully swift read  I highly recommend it  It s an odd combination of realism and science fiction   a tale of aliens and the Second World War   and  somehow  it works perfectly  I found the novel original  sharply satirical and easy to read  I love how Vonnegut briefly inserts himself within the narrative  I love how  insistent that war should not be portrayed as glamorous  Vonnegut ensures that all soldiers within the story are deeply flawed individuals I found Billy s lessons from the Tralfamadorians   that we are timeless beings  that all moments of time occur and reoccur ceaselessly and instantaneously  that free will is an illusion of those who view time as a linear progression   very interesting I was left wondering about the reliability of Billy s story  Is Tralfamadore simply a product of Billy s mind  a coping mechanism to rationalise the tragic inevitability of death in wartime and the result of a post war aeroplane accident he experienced  Or is it a real place in Vonnegut s fictional world  I thought at first that Billy was simply hallucinating when he travelled through different points in his life  but  SPOILER  he does correctly predict his own demise towards the novel s end  I can t believe it took me so long to read Vonnegut  I remember I re read this book aloud with a boyfriend within a year of first reading it  It wasn t my first Vonnegut book  and it s not my favorite  but it is nonetheless seared into me  I believe I read it while traveling around Turkey  though I could be mistaken  That was a rough time for me  I remember going into a book store the sold English language books  and I believe I purchased three things  This  Fierce Invalids Home From Hot Climates  Robbins   and Labyrinths  Borges  Having read Palaniuk before I read Vonnegut  I hadn t realized how much of his style P just lifted right from V  He took Vonnegut s style and gave it a DeLillo spin  But that s a polemic for a different review  I suppose  Anyway  this book made me realize the similarities to Palaniuk more than the previous Vonnegut book I read  Cat s Cradle  did  Everything was beautiful  and nothing hurt So it goes Now there are some damn hooks you can hang your hat on  All this happened  more or less   pretty much sums up Vonnegut for me  He tells a truth more true than fact   All moments  past  present and future  always have existed  always will exist   On a related note  I ve read quite interesting discussions about veterans who say that this book is one of the most accurate accounts of what it s actually like to have PTSD that they have come across  and that strikes a cord with me I will now quote  at length  one of the passages of the book I come back to over and over again   It was a movie about American bombers in World War II and the gallant men who flew them  Seen backwards by Billy  the story went like this  American planes  full of holes and wounded men and corpses took off backwards from an airfield in England  Over France  a few German fighter planes flew at them backwards  sucked bullets and shell fragments from some of the planes and crewmen  They did the same for wrecked American bombers on the ground  and those planes flew up backwards to join the formation The formation flew backwards over a German city that was in flames  The bombers opened their bomb bay doors  exerted a miraculous magnetism which shrunk the fires  gathered them into cylindrical steel containers   and lifted the containers into the bellies of the planes  The containers were stored neatly in racks  The Germans below had miraculous devices of their own  which were long steel tubes  They used them to suck more fragments from the crewmen and planes  But there were still a few wounded Americans though and some of the bombers were in bad repair  Over France though  German fighters came up again  made everything and everybody as good as new When the bombers got back to their base  the steel cylinders were taken from the racks and shipped back to the United States of America  where factories were operating night and day  dismantling the cylinders  separating the dangerous contents into minerals  Touchingly  it was mainly women who did this work  The minerals were then shipped to specialists in remote areas  It was their business to put them into the ground  to hide them cleverly  so they would never hurt anybody ever again  The American fliers turned in their uniforms  became high school kids  And Hitler turned into a baby    Slaughterhouse Five is a classic novel by Kurt Vonnegut designed to entertain and inspire thought  Vonnegut s wild concepts of being unstuck in time and the Tralfamadorian thought process make the reader stop and wonder exactly what time is  Truthfully  Vonnegut creates existential crises  The reader questions whether the Tralfamadorians are right  whether humanity should think of time as simultaneously constant and fluid  Slaughterhouse Five is surprising in that it laid out the events  yet few readers could have guessed how the story would fully unravel  Vonnegut tells his audience early on about pivotal moments such as Billy s plane crash  but when the time finally arrives  he adds enough details that the reader is enticed  Billy narrates the book in a dull tone because he knows that he can do nothing to change it  despite thrilling events all around The theme  from within the tangled web of a non linear plot  is that time is not a thing that can be changed  No human can see it or process it  At the same time  all risks and actions have been accounted for  The Tralfamadorians  for example  know how the world will end  One of them makes a simple decision  That Tralfamadorian will know  but he always will  always has  and always is making that same choice that ends existence  This alien species can see time  but they also process it in a way that allows them to make sense of it  They understand that the future has not happened yet  and they also know that it is in the same state as the past  it will happen  it has always happened  and there is nothing anyone can do but live in it  The Tralfamadorians learned from all this to simply enjoy what is in the present and everything else will be enjoyed or has been enjoyed Vonnegut s style in Slaughterhouse Five is mostly Billy s voice  Billy  the narrator  is drab  boring  and dull  the world around him is vivid and exciting  Billy goes about life the Tralfamadorian way  Live in the present because everything already exists elsewhere in time  One would have to read another of Vonnegut s works to get at his true style  but here he is dynamic with contrast between emotion and reality  between war and Tralfamadore  between three dimensional sight and four dimensional sight  It s truly the type of art one would expect to see painted on canvas  Based on the pictures drawn by Vonnegut in the book  however  writing was by far the greater medium for his talents I loved this book and would very much like to read it again and see if I missed any details  Slaughterhouse Five is a must read  I chose to read this because I had already read many of Vonnegut s short stories that were in Welcome to the Monkey House  I had chosen to read short stories because sadly I haven t had much time to read full books lately   I loved the dry  ironic humor in all of the stories that balances the serious and very thought provoking themes that he deals with  so I decided that I would probably enjoy a novel by him  Slaughterhouse Five  being the one that is most famous and acclaimed  was the one that I chose  Plus  I like to read  classic  books like this anyway for two reasons  first  so I can pick up on references to them  and second  because I know that they must have become a classic for a reason I am finding it impossible to find thing that I like the best  The story is extremely masterful in itself  much better than most  but I feel that I should comment more on the most unique part of the book  which is the way in which the story is actually told  The story is not exactly linear  but rather is told in small sections of different times in his life  Each section has a sort of  punch line  in itself but also has an important role in the overall context of the novel  From the reviews I gathered that for several people  this is a reason that they do not like the book  saying like the user Jak that  it causes the narrative to be almost infinitesimally fractured  and an annoyance to read  It definitely sounds confusing  but in fact I found it was very easy to place the events and keep track of what is going on  and the different events that occur simultaneously in the reader s experience are chosen in a way that they complement and play off of each other  It is strange at first but if you just relax and disregard the desire to have a story to be told  in order   it probably will not bother you because like I said the small bouts of text are placed purposefully and not randomly  The manipulation of time in that way  and particularly the parallel placement of events that  in the chronological viewing of Billy s life  actually occurred twenty or more years apart  was definitely the most unique thing about the book and is as integral to it as the characters and their experiences themselves I obviously loved this book so any criticism is very small  If I have to say what I liked least about this book  I guess it would be the unresolved questions of the narrator s identity and role  The first chapter and the first few pages of the last chapter are told in first person by the narrator  who was a prisoner of war with Billy  and at a handful of points he would abruptly place himself in the story  But for the rest it was told in the third person omniscient about events all across Billy s lifespan that the narrator would not really know about  I m sure that Vonnegut had a reason for his narration  perhaps the narrator is meant to be Vonnegut himself  but it just bothered me a tiny bit because I kept expecting the narrator to come into play in the story or at least explain himself and that never happened  But again  it was not really a problem at all and plus the fact that he was in it so little made it so that you hardly ever questioned it I would definitely recommend this book to almost anyone  I would specifically recommend it to people who like satire because that is what this book is  As a book  it is more abstract and thought provoking  so if you prefer more action packed books  you may not like it as much as someone like me who loves satire and books that make you think about things in different ways  But that is not to say that this book is slow paced and boring and philosophical  it is not that at all  and that s why I think that everyone would like it  But those who like reading satire would enjoy it even more  Slaughterhouse FIve  also called The Children s Crusade  you ll know why once you read the book  is for anyone who s into midcentury literature  time traveling and dark comedy I find myself randomly picking up this book and flipping to various pages in it  Even though I read it way back in high school  I still find myself picking up where I left off  I guess I ve got a lot more in common with a book that s full of time traveling than I thought  Perhaps I m just a dork  but whenever I find myself reading this novel again  I always end up laughing out loud to some clever little line Vonnegut wrote This anti war novel follows Billy Pilgrim  a mediocre but lovable guy  through his life  It takes us from his experience as a soldier in World War II to being an Earthling zoo specimen for some very odd but extremely intelligent extraterrestrials called Tralfamadorians The book is full of Vonnegut s tongue in cheek wisdom and much of it comes in the form of the Tralfamadorians  They are wise and strange little creatures that teach Billy important lessons about humanity as he compares planet Earth s inhabitants to Tralfamadore s I won t spoil the plot  but trust me when I say that this novel doesn t disappoint  With Vonnegut s little sprinklings of humor and timeline quirks  you ll find your interest piqued often enough to prevent you from putting this book down  It s an easy one to read cover to cover and an even better one to pick up when you just want to read something   Am I the only one that has random literary cravings  Well  anyways  the next time you feel like a loser  be glad you re not stark naked in a Tralfamadorian zoo  and give this book a read when you ve lost faith in humanity  Check out my full review here I AM NOT WORTHY Needless to say  I loved it  I won t lie  I didn t understand it at first  especially with its quirky beginning and alien abduction scenes  But   spoiler alert   once I found out that the main character was suffering from post traumatic stress disorder following the second world war  something clicked  and I understood the piece for what it was    and I wholeheartedly enjoyed it  And on top of that  it was hilarious A lot of criticism for this novel comes from Vonnegut s disjointed and confusing storytelling  and for the first hundred pages  I would agree with the critics  I was confused as all hell for the first third of the book  and I found myself thinking that I had picked up another 300 pages of overrated crud  but once I understood why this was happening  it became easier to read somehow  and I thoroughly enjoyed it To be honest  I m not sure why the question of whether or not this is an anti war novel is being asked  The answer is clear  of course it s an anti war novel  Yes  the main character takes a rather neutral stance in regards to his time in world war two  replacing deep sentiments with the phrase  so it goes   but that in itself is anti war  This man is irreversibly damaged  numbing himself to great pain and living in delusions in order to escape his horrific past  Sure  nothing Vonnegut writes says  WAR SUCKS  in bold red letters  but he doesn t need to  The fact that this man is so broken speaks for itself All in all  this was a great introduction to Vonnegut s work  and I am excited to read more  He might even make it up there with some of my favorite greats  Aldous Huxley  George Orwell  Margaret Atwood  Sometimes life provides little coincidences that you are inclined to take advantage of  Like you were thinking about how much you wanted a piece of carrot cake and sure enough the little cafe you went to had a fresh carrot cake slice and it was even discounted  You take advantage  of course  it s carrot cake  discounted at that  Other times life seems to have a set plan  very much like a bug caught in amber  At the time of this review and my reading Slaughterhouse 5  I m studying and living in Dresden for a short while  I went to the Militarhistoriches Museum on the 9th of February  2015  Saw this book  On February 13th  2015  four days from that day  the 70th anniversary of the firebombing of Dresden will take place  I bought it  of course  It was on sale I had the interesting pleasure of only knowing vaguely what Slaughterhouse 5 was about  I understood it was about a  very bad thing  that took place in Dresden during WWII  I understood it was written by Kurt Vonnegut  I also understood it was supposed to be very good  What I didn t understand was how good it was and in what way it was good  Mr  Pilgrim invites on an adventure of time travel and exploration  Skimming the surface of relationships and tragedy  but at the same time exploring death and time in a strikingly unique way  Frequently stepping aboard a UFO   which may have well been named the Santa Maria for this Pilgrim   we are introduced to the Tralfamadorians and their enthralling view of time  They see time not as linear but as simultaneous  They jump and skip through time  focusing on one bit and then leaping to another  Perhaps they go back to the previous bit for a stroll  Their view of death is just another point  Sure you ve ceased to exist at that moment in time  but there are tens of thousands  if you re lucky a billion or two  of moments in which you were alive  You live on in eternity  along with your happiest moments which the Tralfamadorians encourage you to focus on With every moment existing in perpetuity  the most tragic ones do as well  If Vonnegut had any message  I believe it would be this one  The atrocities of WWII and  in this particular case  the firebombing of Dresden will exist for eternity  It has happened  it will happen  and it is happening  We should not forget what has happened so that it  unlike the Tralfamadorians  won t skip ahead to visit us again in another time  Mr  Vonnegut has written a masterpiece that tells his story with a clear voice and concisely  It wanders but is not lost  And we get to discover things in tragedy  that may help us in life if we choose  Or not  So it goes   Compared to Slaughterhouse Five  many another book is going to seem a weak  thin  thing  pallid as the kind of underfed and introverted teen boys from the midwest which we see in Billy Pilgrim  Sophie s World  which was a delightful metafiction at the time  now seems paradoxically lacking in humor and too much full of piffly silliness  And I can t resist an unfair dig at The Dream Weaver  One Boy s Journey through the Landscape of Reality  because it has some of the same specifically philosophical aims as Slaughterhouse  but proves an all too shabby bedsheet when set beside the grand  voluptuous drapery of Billy s quest for re balance within reality  And The Goldfinch was 700 pages long  but littleSlaughterhouse Five is the bigger book  It s a bold experiment in language that remains clear enough for a high school student to read  It s a deconstruction of basic narrative structure that still makes perfect sense as a story  It s a deeply personal tale that resounds with cosmic dimensions  with questions about truth and time and good and evil  It takes a hard look at the depths of human depravity and finds humor and grace and beauty anyway  It s coarse in its elegance  crafted in its vulgarities  I can only try to spin witty generalities at this point in an effort to get something down because the book has hit me like a subtle ton of bricks  and I will need to process it and re read it  Also I m already well underway in reading Cat s Cradle which is a different animal but similar enough to be clouding my brain at this point  The audiobook on Audible com is read by Ethan Hawk  to great effect even though he doesn t attempt to imitate voices as thoroughly as David Pittu does in The Goldfinch  Clearly  audiobook recording is an art all its own  perhaps quite analagous to acting  with multiple styles and schools   I have been putting off writing this review for a few days now  simply because I just don t think there is any words I could use to describe just how amazing this book truly is  As cliche as it may sound  sometimes the right book comes into your life at just the right time  and this book was that for me  When describing this book  of course one would point out the obvious elements of war  science fiction  and mental illness  but to me this book is about so much more then those things alone  Upon finishing the book I looked through some of the reviews here on Goodreads and although most are positive  more than I would have expected criticized Vonnegut s style and prose  Although I am well aware that everyone has different preferences and inclinations towards certain styles of writing  it almost suprised me that more people weren t as enamored by Vonnegut s writing as I was  A few complained of his short sentences and simple prose  but that was one of many things I loved about Slaughterhouse Five  So many thought provoking ideas were presented in the story that Vonnegut didn t need to fill pages with unnecessary and pretentious  literary filler  as I call it  The story is compelling enough that no fluff is needed to get the reader through  To me Billy Pilgrim s story was nothing less then fascinating from beginning to end  and it took me through all the emotions from happy to sad and everywhere in between which for me is what I expect a book to do  This was the first of Vonnegut s works that I have read  and most definitely will not be the last    I really enjoyed this book  I loved everything about it including the main character  I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who is interested in war but not an extremely sad version of it  Vonnegut does a great job of including humor into this rather sad story  It was very interesting learning about how the war changed his life  I very much enjoyed the constant change of setting because it constantly kept the story interesting  The inclusion of the Tralfamadore made this book fiction but that wasn t a bad thing  I very much related and agreed with the philosophies of these strange creatures and thought it was a good addition to the book  I understand why so many people don t think this book is good but I very much enjoyed reading it  This is one of those books that I was upset when it was over  Being a couple days after completion  I miss Billy and the adventures of his life  I think the main reason why I have such an attachment to Billy is because there are no other real characters  Vonnegut concentrates so much on Billy that there is no other character development at all  I think this is due to the constant change in places Billy visits due to his ability to time travel   I actually read this book about 2 years ago  But from what I can remember  this is probably one of my favorites from Vonnegut  I don t usually do book reviews for EVERY SINGLE book that I read but this is one of my favorites so I couldn t resist  I m not entirely sure about the historical accuracy since I wasn t a history major  It was especially interesting  and abominable  how he brought up the idea of holocaust victims  body fat being used to make candles   So it goes   So yeah it was a mixture of grim and satirical  One part that particularly amused me was when he took a gander around the dirty book store and caused eyes to bulge and jaws to drop when he picked out a science fiction novel by Kilgore Trout  Talk about being a nerd  As for the whole anti war theme  I m not saying I m a pacifist but I can see where he s coming from  Overall  phenomenal piece of work  There were some parts that were extremely surprising such as the relationship portrayed between Germans and British POWs  If I had one thing to criticize  it would be his use of time travel  I m a sci fi nerd so yes  I m an advocate for the whole time traveling concept  Back to the Future my life  And of course we can t forget Mr  H G  Wells   I just wish there was a bit more organization  There were some sections where he was kind of jumping all over the place  But other than that  Vonnegut did an amazing job as usual  I wonder if those tralfamadorians enjoyed his satirical humor  His satirical remarks are literally out of this world XD  I bought this book as an impulse buy for myself just before Christmas  I am so glad I bought it  So it goes  The only complaint I have about this book is that it s much too short  Though  as Vonnegut makes clear  it s hard to talk intelligently and at length about a massacre The book itself is an indictment of WWII  and war in general  However  it is more than that  The book explores notions of free will and determinism  the nature of history and inevitability of death and destruction  So why is it so good  Well  because it s so brilliant  The book explores the nature of time and history  and does so by presenting the narrative in a broken and non linear fashion  The narrator is unreliable and interjects himself alongside the protagonist  Billy Pilgrim  The book is funny  terrifying and always good for thought  Of course  another reading of the book is that I was meant to love and read it  I d always loved and read it  and I always will  My moments are so structured  Read this book  it s terribly short  and is very easy to read  It s also worth reading for those who believe that the worst aerial atrocities of the war were Hiroshima and Nagasaki  Learn about fire bombing  the inevitability of Vietnam after WWII  and for an interesting take on war from an author who was actually there   Puu tii uiit   C e davvero qualcosa che posso aggiungere ad un libro dolceamaro come questo  L uomo comune ed un po ingenuo  Billy Pilgrim  ma anche Kurt Vonnegut  ma anche i miei nonni  viene sbattuto nel tritacarne della seconda guerra mondiale in cui pazzi di tutto il mondo  gerarchi nazisti in primis  hanno giocato a chi ce l aveva piu lungo uccidendo milioni di persone  MILIONI  E poi c e Dresda  il bombardamento della citta di Dresda  Che nessuno lo dice ma Dresda era ABITATA  138 000 persone morte sotto le macerie  Nessuno ne parla mai  Nei libri di storia alla distruzione di Dresda vengono dedicate due righe  una in meno della battaglia di Stalingrado  Complimenti  Si parla anche di Tralfamadore  viaggi nello spazio e nel tempo  in stile Doctor Who   fantomatici scrittori di fantascienza e siparietti comici  Cosi va la vita  Si la recensione e confusionaria  ma non e che il libro sia esattamente lineare     People assume that time is a strict progression of cause to effect but  actually  from a non linear  non subjective viewpoint  it s more like a big ball of wibbly wobbly  timey wimey stuff     I really enjoyed reading this book  I already want to read it again because there is so much going on with the time traveling  At first I was sort of blind sighted by the transitions between time periods as I wasn t paying too much attention to the book  It started off with the author of a book having dinner talking about writing a book and a character in it  Billy  But then it transitions to talking from Billy s point of view    If I read this right   I started off using the audio book while driving a long distance  The audio book I had kept loosing the place I was at in the book so I transitioned to a Kindle edition  Because I didn t continuously read the book night by night I still feel like I m missing things and I can t form a complete picture  which makes me want to reread it  The content and story of the book was timeless  The author takes you on his journey throughout his life and instead of being a historical account of his life  he engages the reader though the science fiction aspect of it  The author uses the Tralfamadorians as pausing points to reengage the audience in the bigger picture    That life is simultaneously happening at all times  So while we are reading this in the current day and age  we ourselves time travel to the bombing of Dresden  and experience other time periods in Billy s life  We ourselves are like Tralfamadorians at the end of the book  everything that happened in the book was always meant to happen  While Billy is experiencing flash backs and forwards we experience them along with him  If you are interested in a historical flash back time travel with a great story  you should definitely read this classic  The full title of this book is  Slaughterhouse Five  or The Children s Crusade  A Duty Dance with Death   The book introduces the title and what it means to Kurt Vonnegut  This book  like every one of his I have read  deals with an attempt to find meaning in a world seemingly filled with chaos  The meaning sought after in this book is how one show view death  More specifically  how a person comes by their death  Very philosophical and uses great imagery to display what he means  Even if wars didn t keep coming like glaciers  there would still be plain old death   From Slaughterhouse FiveThis quote is from the introduction by Kurt Vonnegut  It is a semi spoiler  but displays the entire concept of the book in three sentences  I think the climax of the book will be the execution of poor old Edgar Derby   I said   The irony is so great  A whole city gets burned down  and thousands of people are killed  And then this one American foot soldier is arrested in the ruins for making a teapot  And he s given a regular trial  and then he s shot by a firing squad   From Slaughterhouse Five Kurt Vonnegut is an amazing fiction writer  who wrote many short stories and novels including Slaughterhouse Five  Slaughterhouse Five is set around a main character named Billy Pilgrim  who is delusional and thinks he can time travel  Billy is a very confined  withdrawn  and timid man throughout the novel  He is proclaimed to be scrawny  despite his extremely tall stature  which causes him grief throughout WWII  Billy wanders throughout the book aimlessly  yet ironically he is the best off in many situations   view spoiler   As Billy is in Germany with a small group  a large man bedded in clothing and fancy attire is bullying Billy when some German soldiers find them fighting  The larger man  Roland  is stopped moments before beating Billy to death  which leads to Roland  trading  his clothing with the small band of poorly equipped soldiers  As if Fate decided to gift Billy  Roland lost his warm boots  while gaining wooden clods in the middle of winter  which leads to his demise due to gangrene that had started in his feet  Billy is described by many to be crazy because of his ability to time travel  which lead to many poor decisions  Also  the repetition of the line  So it goes  appears throughout the book  commonly after something ironic or tragic  Billy eventually makes a series of decisions in delirium that lead to his murder by a fellow veteran    hide spoiler   Billy is eventually held captive in Dresden during the infamous fire bombings which destroyed the city  but he and a group of captives were lucky enough to survive underground in a meat freezer  While luck had everything to do with Billy s survival  it also caused his death  Billy Pilgrim is the main character of Slaughterhouse Five  He is described as peculiar  scrawny  awkward  and crazy  Worst of all  he thinks that he can time travel  Billy s main goal in his life was to enjoy it  yet run away from anything dangerous  Billy believes that whatever happens to him is not affected by what he does  so he acts extremely passive and lethargic  Billy tends to stay away from trouble  and luckily it saves his life repeatedly  Readers probably will not empathize Billy s actions because he is careless in the face of danger  Although Billy seems to be a mistake  the reader is forced to see his mental problems could be viewed  and how anyone can relate to him As a whole  Kurt Vonnegut is a creative writer  In my opinion  his novel was a strangle pleasure to read because it was written from multiple points of view  The novel was a challenge to read because of Billy s ability to time travel  so the story was not completely in order  Despite the challenge  I would recommend Slaughterhouse Five because it captured my attention  challenged the way I thought  and because it reveals that everyone can relate to someone crazy  Kurt Vonnegut s ability to write about WWII in such a creative way captured global attention of problems caused by post war trauma and about the Dresden firebombings  This is just brilliant  Slaughterhouse Five read so easily I finished it in a day  Not to sound elitist  but this book is a book for readers  The prose is quirky and holds up over the decades  as most of the best books do  The book is concise yet poignant in an utter tongue in cheek manner that really makes you pause and think often about the author s quick observations and keen insight into the absurdity of war and the aftershock  Also the currentshock       and preshock       and all back around again for infinity  I should have read this years ago  I suspect it was  knowing  that it was about the firebombing of Dresden that gave me pause  I think I expected another Catch 22  another dissection of the insanity of war  but much darker  And in some ways that s what I got  This is a book about insanity but there s not a lot of war  It lays its cards on the table early on  This is going to be the great novel about the fire bombing of Dresden  the allied war crime sine qua non  even putting Hiroshima and Nagasaki into the shade But when you get to the event itself it comes and goes  There s only so much you can say about it One of my teachers  indeed the teacher I always credit with teaching me pretty much everything I needed to know about writing  fought in the second world war  He was in North Africa and then Italy  He said he mainly remembered the funny bits  the joking around  War is often described as 99  boredom and 1  insanity  Well that s pretty much it  Except Slaughterhouse 5 is 99  insanity and 1  incomprehension But what really signals that you re in the presence of a master storyteller is Vonnegut s effortless style  Of course that sort of effortlessness takes vast effort  a lifetime s accumulated effort  But you are drawn in and simply sit as his feet as his rambles and dodges this way and that and lays it out for you and you hear his voice  though his voice never dominates or distracts  as he just tells  But how he tells  For all that rambling and all the apparent tangents and deviations into detail there isn t a thing in this book that should be removed or put elsewhere  He layers the story perfectly  guides you through it to the great anticlimax  the blinking emergence into the unreal moonscape that remains after the promised event because to have witnessed it would have meant to have been consumed by it  So Vonnegut didn t witness the forebombing of Dresden  only its aftermath  and he made of it what any 23 year old would have made   that it was insane and incomprehensible and he took another 22 or 23 years to make enough sense of it and to perfect his craft sufficiently that he could tell it  And he captures perfectly how war can break people in body and mind  So is this THE great anti war book  I doubt there is one that can do the job alone because we keep fighting stupid wars  Even a library of great anti war books wouldn t stop war probably because people stupid enough to start wars only read books that somehow conspire to glorify the damn thing  But Slaughterhouse 5 IS a great book and Vonnegut is a great writer and if you haven t read this you really should  When reviewing books  I m usually careful not to reveal too much of the plot   after all  while I might want to encourage people to read a book  I don t want to spoil it for them For those who like to avoid spoilers  feel free to stop reading after this paragraph  I ll simply say that this is one of those  must read  books  I enjoyed it from beginning to end  though it wasn t anything like I expected in any way  I was certainly more than a little sorry that this is a book discovered later in life  as I expect to return to it more than once It s said that we judge a book by its cover  but I ve always felt that was wrong  Perhaps we might buy a book based on its cover  but judging any book on such scant information   a title and picture   is seldom right  Never more so than with Slaughterhouse Five  which for years I d suspected is set in the future  it isn t  and centres around a place of grim violence  it doesn t   Why it s called Slaughterhouse Five is something I ll hold back as a joy for you to discover  should you deem to read it Slaughterhouse Five is the story of Billy Pilgrim s life  framed around his time in the Second World War   more specifically  the terrible bombing of Dresden  of which he is  was and will be a survivor  I say is  was and will be partly because the book is written in snatches   small chunks of Billy s life from seemingly random points  I also say this partly because that s how Billy experiences time   for him  it s not linear  It s a story not told by Billy  but by someone who knows him  The author has promised himself   and many others   that he will write something about the bombing of Dresden  something that brings a kind of meaning to the events there  But he can t  He struggles to recall it and friends he was with do the same  or are reluctant to speak of it  It almost falls into being a story about Billy  while at the same time becomes a story about Dresden  It also is  perhaps more than anything else  a story about death  Death pervades almost every part of this book  sewn into its every paragraph like stitches that hold the piece together  And yet it s not the death that we might expect  It s not a brooding or violent death  more an essay in how to put death into the story of life  It talks about death as not something to mourn or fear  but more an inevitable part of a greater whole   life and existence   that is to be celebrated  So it goes   I won t spoil what that little phrase means  either  The writing style is welcoming   open  honest and conversational snippets that convey far more than posturing prose ever could  It s an easy read  As Billy travels through life   and time   his story unfolds  Yet much of the writing is achingly beautiful  despite the apparent simplicity of the prose  It s both philosophical and poetic  it s never condescending or pretentious  And it s also not a book about time travel  this is not The Time Traveller s Wife  Time travel is not a plot device  it s a means of unfolding the story  and a way in which both life and death can be put into context This is also part of Billy s journey   how he must convey to others what he knows is the truth of life  time and death  It s a mission he undertakes late in life   and involves him revealing to others something about himself  with disarming honesty  that can  for many  only serve to fundamentally undermine the integrity of his viewpoint  I won t spoil this for you either  but this key point is written so deftly that you re never sure if it s a delusion or fact  Not that this matters  Billy can t convey his philosophy without revealing how it came about   and why he knows his philosophy to be fact  It s part of a whole   and the whole has to be accepted for any part of it to make sense  In many ways  it s a highly unusual novel  As the book itself says of war  and perhaps of itself    There are almost no characters in this story  and almost no dramatic confrontations  because most of the people in it are so sick or so much the listless playthings of enormous forces   Slaughterhouse Five is both casual and epic  It s an easy tale with a deep  deep message  wrapped into a tale of life  woven into a story of war And war is enormous   yet we sometimes lose perspective  We think of the bombing of Hiroshima as one of the Second World War s biggest events  where 71 379 people died  Yet on a single night  5 March 1945  Americans dropped high explosives and incendiary bombs on Tokyo   killing 83 793 people  And Dresden  Around 130 000 people were killed in one night  So it goes Billy survived Dresden by ironic chance of the place in which he was held prisoner   and went on to explain to others that it was neither something that had to be done nor could have been avoided  it  just was   If you have war  you have death  If you have life  you have death I doubt that any book could make sense of  let alone give meaning to  something as awful as the bombing of Dresden  or part of any war   or indeed war itself  But death is part of war as death is part of life and Slaughterhouse Five gets as close to raising our awareness of where death fits into life as any book I ve read  A truly excellent book and one that is easily worthy of its reputation of being a modern masterpiece  My brain wants to give this five stars  My heart wants to give it less  but my brain s going to win this one  That s because this book manages to walk an impossible line  it jumps around in time yet somehow keeps a driving  disjointed narrative  it is harsh as war yet gentle as an epitath  and so it goes   it is an absurd circus to the tune of a classical dirge  Every word is true  but I don t believe the sum of the words  and I believe I m right to do so  Still  no one writes of devastation better than Vonnegut  This voice needs to be heard and this book needs to be read  In the audiobook I listened to  Ethan Hawke gave a masterful  hushed reading  so I recommend listening to that even if you ve already read it But what about my heart  Well  near the end of listening to this I started reading In Sunlight and In Shadow by Mark Helprin  which describes a WWII veteran upon his return  much like Billy Pilgrim  But the voice is a bit different  Light years  in fact  It was like reading through 3 D glasses  Vonnegut was the blue lens and Helprin the red  the color of roses  iron  and blood   I want to set Helprin s words next to Vonnegut s   He straightened in his seat  lifting himself until he seemed taller  unconsciously positioning his upper body as if for a fight    not with Catherine  but with an idea  His eyes narrowed a bit as they seemed to flood with energy        People like that always want to show you that they re wise and worldly  having been disillusioned  and they mock things that humanity has come to love  things that people like me    who have spent years watching soldiers blown apart and incinerated  cities razed  and women and children wailing    have learned to love like nothing else  tenderness  ceremony  courtesy  sacrifice  love  form  regard     The deeper I fell  the more I suffered  and the more I saw     the more I knew that women are the embodiment of love and the hope of all time      Love of God  love of a woman  love of a child    what else is there      those are the things that lacerate and wound  and make you suffer incomparably  because in the end  you lose them    Helprin and Vonnegut are not diametrically opposed  Vonnegut s words can be tender  he has his ceremony  and so it goes   he is courteous to his characters  at least to Billy  But love is as hard to find in this novel as free will    it is nowhere  It is not in Billy s marriage  or in his friends  or his children  I don t think this is just because Vonnegut was in Dresden when Helprin was a child  It s because of a choice each of them made and one everyone has to make  That choice has rarely been put so clearly as in these two books side by side  That s why you should read Vonnegut  Just make sure you read something like Helprin too  This was a very interesting novel filled with many witty quips about human behavior  Thoroughly entertaining and thought provoking  it had me page turning for more  The ending left me hanging a bit which is the reason for the four stars but very glad to have read this novel  Mr  Vonnegut is truly a great author  A thoughtful description of war in how indescribable it really is to experience  It claims there is war and always will be war  You d have better luck at stopping a glacier  Also that hell is better than war  Since at least there would be no innocents suffering  Deals with things in a matter of fact tone  Anytime someone dies he will say   so it goes   He gets lost in his own timeline and wanders  Aliens take pity on him and show him that time is something that humans can t grasp  Everything that happens always will happen  always has happened and cannot be changed  A downer  Oh and  war is fought by babies   It s thoroughly glamorized in movies and fiction  The reality is usually a bunch of teens straight out of high school fighting those battles  It took me a little while to get into this book  I was initially put off by how spare Vonnegut s prose was  I generally don t care for writing this stripped down  and since the book structurally mirrors the fragmented mind of its protagonist Billy Pilgrim it took me some time to get into the rhythm of the story  Once I acclimated to this book stylistically though I found it to be really  really great  This book manages to say so much within its short page span  The droll  detached  fatalistic  plain spoken way Vonnegut communicates is devastating at times  There is this fantastic line in the book about how war had made everyone too listless and sick to be characters that conveys more tragedy in one sentence than I have seen other books convey in 500 pages of text  Vonnegut refuses to provide the easy satisfaction of heroes and villains  and he continually emphasizes the lack of individual control any person has over the course of their life  Despite the simplicity of the prose this is a philosophically rich and complex book which will both stir your emotions and stimulate your mind  Highly recommended  Kurt Vonnegut certainly has a very wild imagination  Imagine how he connected the concept of time traveling  war and the lives of different people  Slaughterhouse Five was so funny  poignant and straightforward  Yeah  So it goes  are the three words that the author often used to indicate death  I m certainly happy how he depicted the fractured lives of many people  Billy Pilgrim  throughout the novel  believed in the values of fictitious Trafamaldorians  I can t help but feel an unbearable pity to his sufferings that distort his own thinking The only thing that I can t possibly accept was how the author depicted the character of Christ  I really don t get the meaning of some of the passages that contain the name of Jesus  But is it normal to tell people that the Son of God didn t really come alive because a specific author inside the book used a character that traveled through time and space and used stethoscope just to see if the Son of God was dead  I think it s a little bit disrespecting  Well  the author truly has a very wild imagination and we must respect that I recommend this book to all people who want to catch a glimpse of the sufferings of the veterans of wars  And for those people who want to laugh cautiously and cry without tears  V nachale romana opisyvaetsia zamysel knigi o bombardirovke Drezdena  Avtor zhaluetsia  chto nikak ne mozhet pridumat  nuzhnye

nedostoinoe povedenie amerikanskikh riadovykh v nemetskikh tiur makh stanovitsia vpolne poniatnym  i liked this book a lot  the book talks about death a lot  which made me anxious at first  then calm  then eventually neutral  viewing death as a  peculiarity   vonnegut only writes  so it goes  after death is referenced somehow  i thought it was funny when he said  so it goes  after mentioning that the champagne was dead  i cried during the part where i read in italics truman s justification of the bombing of hiroshima and nagasaki  i also really liked the part where the hobo keeps insisting that things weren t very bad until he died kurt vonnegut seems silly and  witty  and extremely compassionate and also as if he is writing from a perspective that is impossible to write from for people who haven t lived through WWII i liked how the book didn t  tell me how to feel  about the events it depicted  this made me comfortable feeling any emotional reaction to any scene  i never felt alienated or as if i was reacting  inappropriately   except maybe in the very beginning a little i don t think i like the philosophy of the tralfamadorians  I think that a philosophy like that can make people feel kind of distant and dejected  as billy often seemed to be  i felt like i never really got to know billy even though the whole book is about him  i felt like i knew more about the author narrator  even though he only has very few scenes  i am going to go read a bunch of reviews of this book to see what other people thought about the  billy  character  because i don t feel like i can or have the experience to articulate my feelings about him properly i thought a lot during the latter part of the book about an epigraph that i recently read in the beginning of haruki murakami s  after the quake   which  while i don t remember it word for word  impressed upon me the idea that  saying  number  people died doesn t mean anything  it fails to even begin to capture the reality of the event   which also seemed to be a recurring theme in this novel i had read it already when i was 14 or 15 but dont remember much about it  except the general outline of the plot  i feel like i got a lot more out of it this time  Published in 1969  it could be argued that  Slaughterhouse 5  is a child of its time  Only two years before   Flower Power  had bloomed on the streets of San Francisco and the groovy mantra of  Make Love  Not War  had spread throughout the known Universe  including Tralfamadore   Fuelled by copious amounts of mind altering substances  and I m not talking  Buckfast  here  your archetypal hippy imagined an alternative reality where people could  actually  be nice to one another  man  As if This altruistic adventure   or  should I say trip  was to involve something more than just a visit to your local comestible emporium  although it has to be said  the word  countercultrue  had indeed  a part to play in this comedy of errors  So it goes  Slaughterhouse 5  is  without doubt  a  trip   It s a funny  horrific  psychotic  seditious  irreverent trip  A trip that takes you on a mind blowing adventure where you will eventually find yourself in the seductive arms of Montana Wildhack while being ogled by the extraterrestrial worthies of Tralfamadore  In terms of a life aspiration  you can t say fairer than that  So throw caution to the wind and enter the crazed world of Mr Vonnegut Jnr  It may not be filled with flowers but its certainly powerful And very  very funny  If you have not read one of Kurt Vonnegut s masterpieces  then you are missing out on a view altering experience that will leave you with satirical questions and a different outlook on life  This satirical fictional memoir is an outlandish and strange book that really makes you think  With a science fiction twist and an excellent plot  this novel is a must readBilly Pilgrim  the main protagonist  is  unstuck in time  and travels randomly to events in his life  From war stories to extraterrestrial adventures  you get an anti war theme and a satirical message that speaks volumes  And with the repeated saying of  So it goes  after every death  the author gives not a sarcastic view  but an enlightening tone on even the darkest subjects  Though the story is told through the rather unreliable narrator  every message comes together smoothly and you are left with the simple veteran story of Vonnegut This is one book that you just cannot skip  It will change you for the better in just 224 pages  And once you start reading his novels  you will not be able to stop  In  Slaughterhouse Whale  by Kurt Vonnegut you get to see through the eyes of a war veteran named Billy Pilgrim  Billy has an interesting life  while being in a war  The book jumps around to tell about Billy s experiences in the war  his time on the planet Tralfamadore  and other important events in his life  While in the war  the narrator is Billy  He talks about how he gets captured by the enemies and this leads on to a huge bombing which Billy survives  and the rest of the book  This is a great novel that I recommend for anyone who can read something that is somewhat challenging  The anti war novel jumps around to many different periods in Billy s life  For example  Billy will be telling about how he is on the planet Tralfamadore with Montana Wildhack one second  and then it will change to Billy being outside of the prison in the war  Overall  this is a great novel for anyone in their higher teens or older to read  It uses some bad language and talks about sexual activity at times  which may not be the greatest thing for younger people to read    While Slaughterhouse V is either critically acclaimed or rejected in disgust  the novel is truly a work of literary genius  Kurt Vonnegut utilizes his dark humor  satirical expertise  and his vivid imagination to illustrate the obscure world of this excellence of science fiction  With a majority of books following a clear and connected plot  this novel completely distorts that idea and allows the reader to piece together the story themselves  The plot features Billy Pilgrim  an average optometrist of a tall lanky abnormal build  In the estranged story of the book  Billy is tossed between sequences in his life as he begins to view time from the perspective of the Tralfamadorians  Early in the book  the abduction of Billy by the Tralfamadorians is explained and time is explained as such  all time is permanent and an individual perceives all time at once  but can focus on particular scenes  While aware of this new concept of time  Billy continuously becomes unstuck in time and recounts his life out of  order   With a different and engaging plot  Slaughterhouse V is easily a novel I would recommend to everyone  The creative use of time travel and dark humor provides the story to be ever so intriguing  Whether one is a fan of science fiction or not  Slaughterhouse V is a definite read  This novel will give one a deeper perspective on both death and war    I really liked Slaughterhouse Five  The book is written in a very unique way  Because Billy jumps to different points in his life  similar to time travel   you never get bored reading  He is constantly jumping from World War II  to a plane crash  to being in a zoo on a distant planet  The book talks about different points of Billy s life all at once  I really liked how Billy as calm about everything  He almost didn t care about himself  Even on his wedding day when his obese wife told him she would lose weight for him he told her no because he has seen the future and knows it won t be that bad  The entire time he was a prisoner of war he was calm  Even while he was in Slaughterhouse Five when Dresden was being bombed he was calm  One of my favorite things about the book was how Lazzaro told Billy that he would kill him sometime after the war  I thought this part was comical because Lazzaro kept his promise and killed Billy in 1976  I thought it was weird how Billy knew when he was going to be killed and he even predicted his death to a crowd of people but he didn t prevent it  He just stood there in front of the crowd of people he was speaking to  waiting to die  The author defiantly kept this book interesting   I also really liked how Billy was put in a zoo on a planet billions of miles away from Earth  This insane event added humor to the book because the aliens would gather around to see him do things that all creatures do  He was naked in the zoo as well so it was weird to imagine  The aliens eventually put another human in there with him  Her reaction to the situation was humorous  The only thing I didn t like about the book was that it didn t have much for a storyline  The book only talked about Billy s life  It talked about the events that took place in a different order than they happened because Billy jumps around in time but there was nothing else to the book  The book tells you exactly what will happen in the beginning and then how it happens later  The book could have ended at almost any point in it   I liked how Billy made life for his daughter hard  After Billy was in the hospital from his plane crash and his wife died of carbon monoxide while driving there  Billy s children looked out for him more  Billy tried to tell people how even after they die they will live in their moments so his daughter Barbara had to pick him up from work several times after his patients complained that their optometrist was crazy  This made me laugh every time   I don t like to read that much but this was a very good book  It was always entertaining and made me want to read more  I would highly recommend reading this book   I enjoyed this book from the first sentence   All this happened  more or less   Actually  before that  when the author s presented  The introduction in chapter one  and then Billy Pilgrim s non linear story  and the mini stories of all the other people who appear  they are superb  I loved the totally different concept of time  The book is about war and  in the end  about how shit just happens I m terribly bad at writing reviews  but believe me  Vollegut was terribly good at writing this novel   In my opinion Kurt Vonnegut s Slaughterhouse Five astounded me with excitement and tragedy  In my opinion this book clearly demonstrates the Destructiveness of War  and The Illusion of Free Will One of the themes of this book is The Destructiveness of War  One of the main things in this book is the main character Billy remembering the tragedy and horrific experience of the catastrophic firebombing of the German town of Dresden during World War II  War does not only kill the enemy it destroys the himes and lives of your people The authors style is one that interests and intrigues to draws the reader in to keep reading  He makes you wonder what each character will do next  In doing this he creates a unique style of writing  One of the unique parts of the book is that the author put himself into the book as a character  The Main Character in this book is Billy Pilgrim  A World War II veteran  POW survivor of the firebombing of Dresden  prospering optometrist  husband  and father  Billy Pilgrim is the protagonist of the novel who believes he has  come unstuck in time   Kurt Vonnegut   The novel s author and a minor character  Vonnegut himself was a prisoner of war during the firebombing of Dresden  and he periodically inserts himself in the narrative  as when he becomes the incontinent soldier in the latrine in the German prison camp The Setting of this book is an intreating in the way that he expresses the war environment  The main character Billy moves through a lot of environments throughout the book In the plot of the book Billy Pilgrim  the novel s protagonist  has become  unstuck in time   He travels between periods of his life  unable to control which period he lands in  As a result  the narrative is not chronological or linear  Instead  it jumps back and forth in time and place  The novel is structured in small sections  each several paragraphs long  that describe various moments of his life Some connections that can be made about this book would be to Tim O Brian s   The Things they Carried   in the way that the author speaks to the reader  And how the book is separated into small sections In the end this book is a great read and i would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a great read   The book Slaughterhouse  Five by Kurt Vonnegut was a amazing read with twists and turns around every corner  Slaughterhouse  Five is a realistic fiction and a strong science fiction theme  going into the war you will need to know some knowledge about world war two but not very much just the basics  The book tries to give you everything you need but you will get a deep understand and better experience with background knowledge  The book is a about a optometrist  doctor who works with eyes and proscribing glasses  who travels through times in his life  So basically the timeline of the book jumps around from different years of his life  mostly him in the war or to even him getting abducted by aliens  that s right little green men from the planet Tramailofia  HIs life after the war he goes a little crazy then finally tells the world what happen to him people think he s crazy but eventually enough loonytoon people with probably low IQ s believe him and he gains a big following  The book itself can not really be explained only by reading some of it can you see how nonnormal it is compared to every other book you read  Its interesting because it is from the viewpoint of a very mentally challenged man  Its a perspective not usually used by many other and it s actually entertaining  This book will definitely stand out in my mind out of all the many books I have read  It makes me actually wonder if the author may actually might believe what he has written  I personally disagree with the book because my opinion is that time is the one object when can try and catch but will never get to  Man should never be in control of time  The idea of maybe reliving your past when you die is not a bad belief its something I hope the afterlife is close too  Another thing I could swing both ways on is the we have a set path or destiny that we cant control  I hope this isn t true but I could see it being possible  Alien life is definitely possible we now know there is other life not on earth and there is still a lot to discover The book is definitely weird but worth it  It is a book like no other  Please give it a chance I m glad I did  Kurt Vonnegut s Slaughterhouse five or The Children s Crusade is more like a volcanic eruption than a leisurely swim in a beautiful and tranquil lagoon  His story goes both everywhere and nowhere  It is an attempt to explain the horrors of war and its devastating effects The whole book is easily explained with this quote from the title page   A fourth generation German American now living in easy circumstances on Cape Cod  and smoking too much  who  as an American infantry scout Hors De Combat  witnessed the fire bombing of Dresden  Germany   The Florence of the Elbe   a long time ago  and survived to tell this tale  a novel somewhat in the Telegraphic schizophrenic manner of tales of the planet Tralfamadore  where flying saucers come from  Peace   I m usually not in trouble with my reading for several chapters  but is this case my troubles began at the title page  The author uses flashes forward and back in time  He spends a great deal of time on a planet called Trafalmadore and sometime in the war ravaged area of Germany  during the end of World War II  I was playing catch up constantly  This is a story for the patient reader that can follow an endless squiggle on a piece of paper from one end to the other  I enjoyed his direct and indirect styles as they merged on the page sometimes insightful like this quote early in the book while contemplating if he is writing an anti war book   Why don t you write an anti glacier book instead   His story is that how can war be good if this is our experience of war and on the other hand stopping future wars has as much a chance as stopping glaciers  Trafalmadore is a Planet and is very confusing  I believe this is intention as it is an analogy to the authors  experiences in the war  He uses Trafalmadore to explain the war and he asks how can you explain war  Some of his digressions to Trafalmadore are interesting  but most are difficult to comprehend  One particular scene at the end of book gives us another gripping example of the horrors of war  In this scene the characters are all hiding is a meat locker while Dresden is being bombed  After Billy Pligrim came out of the meat locker he witnessed the aftermath of the firebombings of Dresden  It looked like the moon  was what the author had to say  This visual and many others like it serve to remind us of the utter and complete destruction mankind is capable of doing  This book while it may be difficult to follow and disturbing in its reference has been assigned to many a young reader to digest  I suggest you prepare yourself for an arduous journey and have plenty of time to reread passages than can be confusing at best  In the end I had as much difficulty making sense of the book as Billy Pilgram had making sense of the war  For that the writers objectives were achieved  There is not much new to say about a book which has had many things said about it already  If your reading this review  and it s unlikely that you are  I will not review the book so much as whether or not you should read it or not  First  if you have ever read and liked a Vonnegut book and haven t read Slaughterhouse Five  do so  There is a reason this is considered on e of the finest pieces of American literature  It is poignant without being condescending  funny without being  too  absurd  He uses the device of time travel  but not in a science fiction type of way  Vonnegut famously hated science fiction   His prose is minimalist as it gets  but in this book particularly he still displays some fantastic passages  The one that comes to mind immediately is the bit about the war movie in reverse  Just brilliantly divised and written  it is a small  3 paragraph excerpt of what made Vonnegut so great You should read this book  if only because it is a seminal piece of literature and reading it will mean you are that much more hip  But if you are afraid of committing money and time to such a book which can admittedly be a love it or hate it type of deal  read one page in the book store before you buy it  You will immediately know whether you  get  Vonnegut s heavily sarcastic  minimal writing voice  If you are not immediately turned off by it  buy it  This is a rare book that reads quick  but will make you laugh out loud and think deeply along the way  So it goes   I had never read anything by Kurt Vonnegut before  but recently something I downloaded on Audible brought him to my attention so I thought I would give one of his books a try  I have to be honest  about 20 pages in  I considered giving up  but then I asked my Facebook friends if anyone had read the book and if it was worth reading  I only received positive feedback  so I pushed on  It definitely got easier to read as the story developed What originally caught my attention about Vonnegut was that he was an ex soldier and antiwar activist  The audio promo I had heard talked about Vonnegut s books being popular among college students and making the readers think about things in a different way  Slaughterhouse Five is fairly short  the copy I had was 200 pages  and is the kind of book you may want to read more than once to fully grasp the messages Vonnegut portrays  Some of those messages include war  death  time and money success  It is certainly thought provoking and I would not hesitate to read another book by Vonnegut  One of the best books I have ever read   I said that to Harrison Starr  the movie maker  one time  and he raised his eyebrows and inquired   is it an anti war book   Yes   I said   I guess   You know what I say to people when I hear they re writing an anti war book   No  What do you say  Harrison Starr   I say   why don t you write an anti glacier book instead   What he meant  of course  was that there would always be wars  that they were as easy to stop as glaciers  I believe that  too And even if wars didn t keep coming like glaciers  there would still be plain old death  Those words at the beginning of the book spoke volumes to me and could not be more full of truth Something so few seem to understand is that there comes a time when what has to be done simply must be done  It doesn t matter how many are opposed to it  And you don t have to like it  nobody has to like it  But it isn t going to alter the fact that what has to be done must be done  When it comes to war    I don t like it either  Many times when considering such atrocities as war I have found myself thinking of the men and women who must fight them  Mary O Hare says   the wars  will be fought by babies   and they are  They re fought by young men and women who risk their lives and sacrifice their innocence for the rest of us    for those of us unwilling because we are too scare or because we simply do not care for the idea of war and the horror it creates  Those men and women  whether they like it or not  are at least capable of acknowledging the fact that no matter how opposed to war we may be    no matter how much we may hate it    it will always be and in some cases it simply must be  But still there are others who hate it so much  who are so opposed to it they refuse to accept this fact  This is not to say that all wars are necessary  Many are not  But some are  It is an unfortunate fact that sometimes it takes evil to defeat evil  Such is the world we live in and such is the nature of our species  On the topic of opposition to war    a thought occurred to me while reading chapter 3  Vonnegut writes about Billy Pilgrim traveling from the war to August of 1967  Pilgrim is driving in his Cadillac on his was to a Lion s club meeting and Vonnegut briefly describes the sights Billy sees at a  stop signal  in the  middle of Ilium s black ghetto   He compares what Billy sees to the towns torn apart by war during the second world war I couldn t help but stop and think to myself that it s funny how we are so quick to protest war when our soldiers are off fighting in another country  how some are so quick to condemn a war taking place in another country and those fighting it  Yet we fight little wars in our own country everyday  There s gang wars between men and women who once might have been friends    brother s  sister s  neighbors  battles started over people s differences in race  orientation  gender  etc   But so few are willing to protest those wars when they turn violent as some often do  In fact in some case we encourage the violence and the bloodshed and when people to stand up and say enough is enough they are told to sit back down and letting the waring parties  get it out of their system   It s funny how in America we condemn the fighting of wars in another country but seem to welcome war between ourselves in our own streets and our own backyards  We condemn the slaughtering of  foreign enemies   condemn the destruction some of the homeland of others  But then we condone the slaughtering of our brothers and sisters  our own neighbors and condone the destruction of our own homes  our own neighborhoods  It s hypocrisy and so many seem to be blind to it and too many refuse to open their eyes and admit when they re wrong  Such seems to be the American way and it s truly unfortunate Most consider Slaughterhouse Five and anti war book  I did not read it as such  to me it did not come across as an anti war novel  Rather it seemed a novel that tells the truth about war  that it is ugly and horrid but that it will always be and that sometimes it is an unfortunate necessity  I don t think it s fair to slap the anti war label on it simply because it tells the gritty truth about war rather than trying to glorify war and only showing the positives of war  To me  it is not an anti war book but rather an honest war book  The only issue I had with the book was Vonnegut s frequent use of the phrase  so it goes   at the end of a thought    mostly commonly the end of a thought dealing with death  At first  its use irritated me  However  before long I realized its significance and importance of it and its meaning  To me  the phrase pointed out the fact that sometimes the outcome of something is simply beyond our control    whether it s because at some point we end up losing control of a situation or that we didn t have control of it from the start  Things can t always turn out the way we would like them to  Such is life and we must learn to move on because life can t and won t stop simply because didn t turn out the way we would have liked   He does it so effortlessly it s hard to comprehend how Vonnegut managed to put together a terrific anti war novel that  has almost no characters   and almost no dramatic confrontation   but he succeeded brilliantly  There s no better way to depict post traumatic stress disorder than to have your main character  Billy Pilgrim  come  unstuck in time   to describe him as being  simultaneously on foot in Germany in 1944 and riding his Cadillac in 1967  Many people who read this book get hung up on the science fiction element  Billy being kidnapped by aliens who can see in four dimensions  including being able to see every moment in time as if it s happening right now   The Tralfamadorians are a metaphor for Americans who try to intellecturally explain away war crimes committed by our side during WWII  like the firebombing of Dresden  as a necessity of war  and therefore avoid assigning blame  To depist these apologists as an alien species from another planet is absolutely brilliant  I liked this book a lot  especially because of how explicit the author is when the protagonist  Billy Pilgrim  travels back in time  I think the whole theme of PTSD was something that needed to be brought attention too because of how it affected so many people after world war II  and this was one of the novels that did just that  Although  it gets a little confusing as Billy starts to time travel a lot faster once you get into the novel  The author s use of frame story I actually found humorous  but also shows you how reliable the narrator is  I feel like if you read this through a PTSD lens or a nihilistic lens  you d understand the novel more and understand the point the author is trying to make  This novel definitely gave way to a more understanding of the affects of war on veterans  Overall  Vonnegut definitely does a good job in executing his own feelings about war in this novel as it presents Billy s first hand view of war and the deterioration of mental state after war  Slaughterhouse 5  by Kurt Vonnegut  is a story about memory  time travel and the futility of war  The author was a prisoner of war in Dresden when it was fire bombed by the allied forces in 1945 killing 135 000 people and devastating the city  This experience is pivotal to the story  As its narrator he opines that  like Lot s wife  we are not supposed to look back lest we be lost  His protagonist  Billy Pilgrim  has come unstuck in time  travelling backwards and forwards through his life  What is recollection  memory  thought  if not a type of time travel  We went to the New York World s Fair  saw what the past had been like        saw what the future would be like         And I asked myself about the present  how wide it was  how deep it was  how much was mine to keep  Billy Pilgrim considers time to be like space  In his view death is simply another moment  a feature on the path of a life  People will continue to exist if remembered  We will all live forever no matter how dead we may sometimes seem to be  The tale told is a collection of memories  a non linear life story  In many ways Billy would be considered ordinary  a son  husband  father  successful optometrist  In other ways he was extraordinary  prisoner of war  plane crash survivor  time traveller  alien abductee When he starts to share some of his more bizarre memories his daughter remonstrates with him  fearing that he is losing his mind  He asks  what is normal  Bookstores are filled with books about sex and murder  the news is of sport and death  people pay to look at pictures of others  like themselves but with no clothes on  they get excited about the price of things that do not exist called stocks and bonds  These things are accepted yet when someone tries to talk of what is not understood it is not believed  it is assumed that it cannot have happened At one point in the book Billy is watching a war film backwards  American planes  full of holes and wounded men and corpses took off        Over France a few German fighter planes       sucked bullets and shell fragments from some of the planes and crewmen        a German city was in flames  The bombers opened their bomb bay doors  exerted a miraculous magnetism which shrunk the fires  gathered them into cylindrical steel containers  and lifted the containers into the bellies of the planes        everything and everybody as good as new        factories were operating night and day dismantling the cylinders       so they would never hurt anybody ever again  War is accepted yet it kills and destroys The observations on attitudes are razor sharp  The story resounds with wit and wisdom as it challenges normality  Billy may have conflated fact and fiction at times but who is to judge what is real in anyone else s life I loved this book  I fear that my review cannot do justice to the impact of the writing  I want to quote so much  better that you just go and read it for yourself  Kurt Vonnegut s  Slaughter House Five  breaks the foundation of a well written story with its outright blatent disregard for filtering out all the darkness of the world  It is a thrilling tale for anyone to read You are a slave to the order of this universe  That is our theme  the book is full of this fact with the main character Billy Pilgrims constant time traveling adventures where no matter what he is forced to obey his fate and act through each moment of his life  Vonnegut is his own style in of itself as a whole  his satirical voice mixed with his strait down to earth attitude is what makes this book so interesting  The book is the odyssey of Billy Pilgrim as it follows him everywhere in his adventures of time travel and sorrow  it delves into its characters not as people but as other pieces of the puzzle that is the fabric of time  Billy Pilgrim travels to so many places as you follow him on his adventure yet each place he arrives in is in such great detail to the senses that you immediately realize where you are  The plot is of course a roller coaster rides with many twists and turns  Billy s time traveling takes you everywhere through his life such as places where he is wed with his wife to floating through the void of death that everyone will one day great in that book  This book is only and can only be compared to another book by Vonnegut being that he was too far ahead of our literary field as an artist of worlds I recommend this book to anyone who wants to loose themselves in a story  anyone who wants to become attached to another world as such this book is  This book will captivate you in its maze of a world and keep you there until its wild ride is over  Ho trovato questo romanzo in una hit parade  I migliori 100 libri di fantascienza   Conoscevo l autore solo per sentito dire  e credevo appartenesse alla letteratura  alta   insomma non sapevo cosa immaginarmi  per questo  incuriosito  ho letto il libro  Il libro viene catalogato come fantascienza probabilmente per la bizzarra capacita  del protagonista di muoversi casualmente nel tempo  tra fasi diverse della sua esistenza  Questo appare dapprima un espediente narrativo di bassa lega  ma si rivela un ingrediente fondamentale per determinare il tono generale del racconto  freddo  apatico  alienato  Fanno da sfondo la guerra  la prigionia  e fuggevoli accenni ad una  vita normale  di cui si e  comunque solo spettatori  So it goes   cosi  va la vita  e  la frase che scandisce le traiettorie di vita dei personaggi  suggellando con disincanto ogni lutto La guerra appare tanto inevitabile quanto inutile  la sorte propria ed altrui determinata dal caso Billy Pilgrim  il protagonista  proprio in virtu  del fatto che vive ogni avvenimento come passato  presente e futuro simultaneamente  non si indigna  non reagisce  anche solo emotivamente a nulla di quel che gli accade  L umanita  che incontra  e che osserva come in un acquario  e  analogamente definita in negativo  malata  ferita  o rabbiosa  nel migliore dei casi cerca di sopravvivere  nel peggiore non ci riesce Un tale materiale potrebbe lasciare immaginare una lettura sgradevole  o noiosa  ma non e  affatto cosi   le immagini evocate con tanta apparente freddezza entrano lentamente sottopelle  e non ti lasciano piu     si capisce perfettamente perche  questo libro sia considerato una pietra miliare dell antimilitarismo  Da leggere       Or The Children s Crusade  Why doesn t the full title now appear on either the cover or title page of this e edition  It just struck me as strange  like seeing a poster for  Dr  Strangelove  without  Or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb   The promise to call the book  The Children s Crusade  always struck me as a pivotal moment in the first chapter    the author s promise that this will not be a book with a role for an heroic John Wayne or Frank Sinatra that will glorify war or warriors  There are almost no characters in this story  and almost no dramatic confrontations  because most of the people in it are so sick and so much the listless playthings of enormous forces  One of the main effects of war  after all  is that people are discouraged from becoming characters  Why then  is this book still so riveting  funny  and enjoyable  I attribute it to the essential humanity of its author and his conversational presence throughout Maybe a new definition of becoming  unstuck in time  revolves around reading a book you loved as a 15 year old almost 45 years later and realizing that it is not juvenilia  that not only do you still love it and that it still seems fresh and easy and new  but that it probably played a key role in the way you have viewed the world since reading it in 1970  I haven t read anything by Kurt Vonnegut in recent decades  but I ll be revisiting more of his books very soon

to my second reading of this book  I felt sort of hopeless like my namesake  Billy  in this book about life  but unlike him I don t travel through time This book is easy to read but not easy to understand  alot like playing poker  There is content swimming just under the water in this book  as the reader I found myself putting things together and comparing things to my own life  Which is what a good book does  This is more than a good story   Slaughterhouse Five  is one of those books people either love or hate  which is what attracted me to the book  While I believe any book should be reviewed and rated based on the strength of the writing and storytelling alone  context always helps  I understood how Vonnegut arrived at the story he wanted to tell  and I also had just the slightest understanding of historical context and background about the firebombing of Dresden before I jumped into the novel  There are countless reviews and summaries of the book here on Goodreads so I won t bother with that  But I will conclude with this  If you attempt this book for the first or second time  approach with an open mind  The other element that made a huge difference for me was that I listened to the audiobook narrated by Ethan Hawke  This allowed me to focus on the storytelling and not my own frustration and difficulty following a plotline as disjointed as the memories and mindset of our protagonist  Billy Pilgrim   Slaughterhouse Five is incredibly hard to review  because I have no idea what to talk about given the wealth of topics the novel either directly covers or simply implies  such as PTSD  death  time  war  and even the nature of fiction itselfhonestly  all of these topics were generally things I didn t notice when I first read it  I didn t see any connections to mental illness and I didn t read it as a piece of meta fiction  I read it literally  I never questioned the sanity of the main character  I decided just to go along the ride with him  and even from that narrowed view of the book it is still one of the best books I ve ever readthe story follows Billy Pilgrim  a soldier in World War 2 who is captured by the German army during the Battle of the Bulge and is then shipped from one prison to the next ending up in a re purposed Slaughterhouse in Dresden  throughout this time he travels through time and experiences his entire life in a mixed up order  allowing Vonnegut to essentially tell Pilgrim s entire life story at once  which includes not only his time in the war  but also time at home with his family  and the time he was imprisoned and put on display in a zoo by aliens from the planet TralfamadoreSlaughterhouse Five is a thoughtful  intelligent and genuinely funny book that I read as being about futility and accepting the inevitable  it is one of my favorite books of all time and without wanting to say too much more about it  I will simply say that it is a must read for all literature fans  and you should definitely check it out This book leveled me out  To me it showed someone dealing with what war had done to them  Like most people who cope with tragedy Kurt uses humor to deal with the horror that he lived through  Having fun with it instead of making everything black  After reading this I since have adopted the phrase  So it goes  whenever I encounter something that is an ugly reality  Some people believe that Mr Vonnegut was a pessimist for the way he viewed the human race  I completely disagree   I have no idea why it took me so long to read this book  The best part is that I loved it  couldn t put it down  AND I can cross one more piece of great lit off the to read lit  Nice   If only more writer s had Vonnegut s combo of humor and imagination  This is good stuff  The entire time I was reading it  I couldn t imagine how they could make a movie of this so I watched it the second I closed the book  Yeah  Had I not read the book  I would have had NO IDEA what was going on   mr  gurntz  reverend  we have a little problem  i heard the english teacher is planning to teach that book mrs  allyson  slaughterhouse five  isn t that an awful name ren mccormick  that s a great book  slaughterhouse five  it s  it s a classic mr  gurntz  do you read much mrs  allyson  in another town it s a classic ren mccormick  in any town mr  gurntz  tom sawyer is a classic   And so it goes     I loved the whole concept behind the book and how the story line was structured  In total I just loved this novel  There are some books that you can almost see being taught in English classrooms  You can almost see the notations penciled in on the margins next to key passages  the handouts typed up explaining the important characters and symbols  and the charts scratched on chalkboards outlining general themes  Slaughterhouse Five has actually been taught in classrooms but never to me  Now that I m past my high school English class days  I m actually longing for class discussions and mandated annotations  This relatively little book about the scattered life of Billy Pilgrim  WWII vet  optometrist  and alien abductee  may be an easy read  but there is a lot of meaning buried in those words It s hard sometimes to catch it all  For most things  I have a faint awareness of its existence  like its living in the corners of my eyes but whenever I try to turn my head it dissipates like smoke  and all I m left with is a penetrating feeling that I just witness something powerful There are some bits of meaning that I can spot more easily  The anti war messages are almost obvious  Death  destruction  and cruelty were spread pretty evenly on both sides  and nothing is glamorized  One could even argue that all Billy has is an extreme form of PTSD I can kind of see that there are the messages about time  Vonnegut masterfully weaves the different parts of Billy s life into one continuous storyline  linearity here is thrown out the window as is often in Post Modern literature   It places everything into perspective  life and death  they all happen at once  Though  what exactly he is trying to say with this writing technique  I couldn t tell you Slaughterhouse Five is a novel that people can write papers and even books about  In fact  people have  There s so much meaning in there  I haven t even scratched the surface   Sometimes it feels like I can t possibly be shown how to see it all that is hidden within Vonnegut s words But then again  does it matter  An English class can help you see deeper within the story  but there s a beauty of only faintly knowing  The lingering impression of emotional weight and power that I spoke of before is almost enough  It s enough to know that you ve read and witnessed something you can t even possibly fully understand  but you appreciate it for its greatness anyway  Yeah  pinning down the themes would be nice  but it s not always necessary   Be warned  Spoilers ahead  To me  black humor is one of the trickiest things to pull off  There is a lot of black humor that I don t enjoy  and it is hard to put my finger on what contributes to a piece s success or failure  What I do know is that Kurt Vonnegut always does it right  and Slaughterhouse Five doesn t take a single misstep  in spite of the fact that it is exceptionally dark The protagonist  Billy Pilgrim  has had the tar beaten out of him by life and World War II  After the war  he slides right back into his life as a student of optometry and has a nervous breakdown soon thereafter  Twenty years after the war  he is in a plane accident  of which he is one of two survivors and in which he has his head bust open  There is so much senseless violence  suffering  and cruelty in the world that Billy recedes into his own mind and science fiction to make sense of it  One of the things that makes Slaughterhouse Five such an incredible read is the way that Vonnegut marries his form with the function it serves  The simple sentence structures and short paragraphs make the writing itself seem like the product of a mind suffering from post traumatic stress disorder  Everything is stilted and brief  like a man walking on wounded legs  unsure when a knee might give way and send him crashing to the earth  Each element of the story is like a geometric proof  one laid out after another as though at the end something logical will be constructed and a Q E D  can be found  But of course  logic falls apart  and B does not follow A  let alone C follow B  In fact  due to Billy s being unstuck in time  even the simple logic of chronology is unable to remain in place Billy s getting unstuck in time is brilliant at every level  From a pure storytelling perspective  it allows Vonnegut to place his climax in 1945 and the bombing of Dresden while at the same time telling us about the life Billy lived afterwards  Even more meaningful  though  is the way it reflects the fracturing of Billy s mind in the ugliness of human made atrocities  Billy is trying to find a way to come to terms with all the meaningless death and destruction around him  and through the help of Kilgore Trout s science fiction novels  he dwells on the concept of time as the fourth dimension and the way in which events could be viewed with the permanence of a landscape  If you were to walk over a mountain range  you would start at the foothills  where the mountain is  born   Then  you would move over the collection of peaks and crags as though experiencing the life of the mountain range  When you come to the end  back into the foothills on the other side  the mountain has  died   and if you could only walk in one direction  that mountain would be forever  dead  to you  But we have the ability to step back and see the whole mountain range from a distance  we do not celebrate its birth or death in space because it is forever revisitable by us  If time worked the same way  we would have no need to celebrate a birth or death in time because we could revisit any portion of the life as easily as we vacation in the Rockies  This approach cleverly reduces  death  to a mere inevitability and just a small portion of an entire structure How perfect to put that in a novel  where time is literally fixed  We can revisit any portion of Billy s life in the novel  and it will always be the same  word for word  Nothing will ever change between those two covers The ramifications of this approach to time is that it  like a mountain range  is a permanent structure  unchanging  What has happened has always happened and always will happen  You cannot do anything other than what you have always done  Free will  and the notion that we somehow make decisions that influence the course of things to come  is done away with  The solution  then  to one problem  forces us into another  But for Billy  who feels out of control anyways  he much prefers the notion of permanence in time to the notion of free will  Slaughterhouse Five is  of course  an anti war novel  And as I ve said in my posts about Animal Farm  1984  and The Grapes of Wrath  a political novel is only as good as its artistry  Nobody wants to read a lecture  and nobody turns to novels for a collection of facts  We want characters and drama and thought  and philosophy to chew on about how life works and how we are to live it  If Slaughterhouse Five were simply a collection of all the ways in which war destroys lives and culture  it would be a crappy book  It is the humor and the characters and the messiness of life that make this such a wonderful book  Early in the novel  Vonnegut discusses this idea of an anti war book and is told by someone that he might as well write an  anti glacier book    What he meant of course  was that there would always be wars  that they were as easy to stop as glaciers  I believe that too  And even if wars didn t keep coming like glaciers  there would still be plain old death   He s under no illusion that a book can stop wars  or that wars are the only source of death and mayhem  Still  he knows that novels  and other forms of entertainment  do have an effect on people and their willingness to support or go to war  Mary  his friend s wife  is angry at the narrator for wanting to write a book about the war because he s likely to ennoble the acts   You ll pretend you were men instead of babies  and you ll be played in the movies by Frank Sinatra and John Wayne or some of those other glamorous  war loving  dirty old men  And war will look just wonderful  so we ll have a lot more of them  And they ll be fought by babies like the babies upstairs   So Vonnegut promises Mary that  there won t be a part for Frank Sinatra or John Wayne  in his novel  And there is not  Nothing is glorified about the war  There are no great speeches or rousing of the troops  There are no flag waving moments of intense patriotism  He observes in the final third of the novel   There are almost no characters in this story  almost no dramatic confrontations  because most of the people in it are so sick and so much the listless playthings of enormous forces  One of the main effects of war  after all  is that people are discouraged from being characters   Which brings us back to the lack of free will in the Tralfamodorian construct of time  Wars  like glaciers  advance on us  and the machinery cannot be stopped by any art or even any individuals for that matter  we are no more than  listless playthings of enormous forces   Nothing we do can change anything anyways Now that is some dark shit right there  I m not sure you can get much darker  so why isn t this the most depressing novel on the shelves  Because Vonnegut fights against those enormous forces with humor  wit  and powerful observations about people  In that humor and laughter that is thrown in the face of the inevitable  there is something incredibly uplifting  It is the dance band on the Titanic playing as the ship scuppers  There is an element of hope that says that if only enough people could see the ridiculousness of what is happening  maybe something could happen  Okay  we know it won t  But  what if   But  it won t  And that s what makes Slaughterhouse Five  and all the Vonnegut novels I have read  successful black humor stories  That cycle of despair and hope       it s so human  He says in the first chapter that he loved Lot s wife for looking back as Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed   because it was so human   That s how I feel about Vonnegut through his writings  I love him because he was so human  All his wisdom and wit never come as an attack from the outside  because he always knows that the massive mess that is humanity is his own lot  his own home  He is the uncle at a large family gathering who is scathing in his comments  but who makes us all laugh and understand ourselves  He can say what he says because he is part of the family  he still comes to the gatherings  unlike some other family members who have sworn us off completely  And when I think of the human being I want to be in this life  I want to make Uncle Kurt proud  Ce classique de la science fiction clairement anti guerre se trouvait dans quelques une de mes diverses listes depuis bien longtemps  sans que je sache vraiment ni son genre ni son theme  Je pensais simplement que c etait un incontournable horreur science fiction  Mais bel et bien a es milliers d annees lumieres de ce a quoi je m attendais Quel livre etrange   D abord le ton  naif  decale  voilant a demi et si finement une declaration sur les horreurs et l absurdite de la guerre D entree  on suit Billy Pilgrim  un personnage qui ne maitrise rien de sa vie  dont chaque decision n en est pas une mais plutot une orientation forcee par quelqu un ou quelque chose d autre  Sa vie  avant meme son premier voyage dans le temps  semble etre manipulee par tous les caracteres plus forts qui l entourent  De son enfance a ses etudes  son boulot  la guerre  on le suit d incident en poussee qu il subit dans un etat second  ponctue de ses reflexions decalees sur les evenements  Les temoignages de guerre eux memes voient leur horreur soulignee par des moments absurdes et des bonds dans le temps qui semblent tout a logiques dans leur absurdite  Les extra terrestres sont hilarants et bourres de grandes declarations sur l absurdite de l humanite qui s entete a poursuivre ses grandes entreprises et ses atrocites sous des pretextes qu ils veulent logiques aveuglant ses pions de propagande idealisant la guerre  voilant la decadence de leur civilisation  Quelques extraits de discours justifiant les bombardements atomiques puis de livres d histoire glorifiant la decimation de villes entieres au nom de la lutte contre le grand ennemi  le Mal  sont particulierement geniaux  rappelant le but de l auteur  Celui ci ponctue son recit du leitmotiv philosophique des Tralfamadoriens  So it goes   evoquant une histoire humaine cyclique  de repetitions de massacre au nom de causes qui n en sont pas  Absurdite  Genie  Un drole de livre qui a regale mon cote cynique accompagne du questionnement constant  qui du  je  et du  il  est le personnage  le narrateur et l auteur Effectivement un incontournable  A mettre entre toutes les mains de lecteurs de science fiction et meme de curieux de reflexion alternative sur les civilisations occidentales et la guerre  A fascinating read which I would probably have loved even more as a young adult  Some of the philosophies presented within  the Tralfs  all time is one philosophy in particular  carry an appealing if somewhat impractical method of rationalizing loss  The disjointed structure keeps the book engaging almost throughout  though it bogged a bit for me during the episode featuring the British POWs  Overall  memorable and well worth exploring  I did not think it was possible for a labeled  anti war  book to be so refreshingly non judgemental at the same time as matter of factly exposing the horrific stupidity that is war  There is just so much to this book  and I m still processing it  that I might just have to read it again soon  This should definitely be required reading in schools  churches and homes Perhaps not as funny as other Vonnegut books I ve read  it is so far the most heartbreaking and poignant  I read this book a LONG time ago and on memory alone  when I was adding books on here  I rated it 5 stars  A lot has happened since I first read the book  I became an adult and had a family of my own for starters  That sort of thing changes your perception of the world  I remember as a teen being a little bothered by the  so it goes  being repeated so often  I understood how intentional it was  but at that age  I think I didn t quite appreciate why it had to be repeated over and over  This time around  I was listening to it the novel  While the voice didn t exactly fit what was in my head  it didn t take me long to adjust  The icing on the cake was the interview at the end  It s only maybe 9 minutes long  but it was really  really good  I recommend getting this to listen to  my copy was from the local library on Overdrive   online lending so I got to listen on my phone  just for that  There is something about hearing him speak about his work and the war  the real people  and who he felt was the one and only person who profited from the attack on Dresden Back to the novel  It slips in and out of fiction and reality  but I wouldn t always place my money on knowing which is which  You don t get a tidy ending because  well  life isn t always like that  Sometimes things happen that make no sense at all and you never get to find out why   Matadouro 5  e o segundo livro do Kurt Vonnegut que eu leio  Tinham me falado que o livro era melhor que  Cafe da manha dos campeoes   mas eu nao sabia que era TAO melhor  Tudo bem que dizem que Cafe da manha e para voce ler depois de ter lido alguns livros do Vonnegut  pois e quase como se fosse um apanhado de personagens de outros livros  Por algum motivo  foi o primeiro livro do autor que eu li e gostei  Matadouro 5 e melhor No comeco voce vai ter um pouco de dificuldade para acompanhar a estoria  Fala sobre Billy Pilgrim em tres periodos distintos de sua vida  So que e quase como se fosse uma viagem no tempo continua Em um momento ele esta como prisioneiro de guerra em Dresden  Em outro ele e o homem mais rico de sua cidade do interior  mas sua filha acha que ele e maluco por acreditar em extraterrestres  Em outro momento voce ESTA com os Ets  servindo como uma especie de  animal  no zoologico das galaxias e acasalando com uma bela mulher   I m embarrassed to admit it s taken me this long to read this classic  but I finally did  I was surprised as to how short it was  But then again  most novels back in the day seemed more like movies  where as the average novel now translates into mini series length   And who says we have shorter attention spans His language melts like chocolate  You read a paragraph  and then suddenly a whole chapter is read  The somber tone hypnotized me  and I saw it all played out as a movie  But not like the version that was made in 1972  This was more surreal than that   more like in the style of My Chemical romance s  black parade  and johnny Depp stared as Billie  akin to his performance as Ed Wood  I realize Billie is supposed to be funny looking  but Johnny was made up to be funny looking  With all that said  I LOVED This and can t believe the ignorant reviews I ve read on Goodreads  I guess subtlety and sardonic humor is lost  Either because of the over use of technology or what  but the severe lack of insight and lack of ability to comprehend the humor and the argument of free will or not  and if this was just all made up in Billie s mind  Anyway  what ever  Go read your pop fiction and have everything spoon fed to you  I don t care  Speaking of which  I want to believe that Billie was really unstuck in time and he was indeed captured by Aliens  I m hoping that this will happen to me one day   One of the best anti war stories of our lifetime Slaughterhouse Five  written by Kurt Vonnegut  is the life story of Billy Pilgrim  Billy becomes unstuck in time  he lives in different times in his life from moment to moment  so the story is not told in chronological order  He learns more about living in the different moments of his life when he is captured by aliens and taken to Tralfamadore  The Tralfamadorians do not see time as we do they see it all at once and can live in whatever moment they wish  for they are unstuck in time There he lives in a zoo with Hollywood actress Montana Wildhack  From there he travels back to his service in WWII  the attack on dresden  his life after the war  his life after a plane crash  and many other moments up until his death  I really love Vonnegut s writing style especially in this piece because it s very grim and dry  Throughout the book the humanistic nature of the events reveal themselves  and we learn that things just are as they are without reason  Ultimately  the best we can do is relive the happiest moments  for there s no point in dwelling on misery  The way he wrote the book also bettered my understanding of the tralfamadorians perception of time  He could ve easily written all the events as they occurred chronologically  but he didn t  In fact  the way he wrote the story made it more compelling and more understandable  The joke is on you when you start this booking thinking how funny Vonnegut is  This book takes you through the post history of a character s terrible experiences during WWII  It s not only written so realistically that it put you right there in the action  but it s also clever enough to keep you interested  and subtly takes advantages of so many psychological  philosophical  and literary theories that it d take a busload of professors to ever unwind it all   I m proud to say that I m teaching one of the most banned books in America  No parental complaints  no fussy kids  The times they are a changin   It s a fun one to teach  Kids are deceived by the breezy style into thinking that they  get it   Then they we go back and look at the way it s all structured and  without fail  have to admit that there was a lot about the book that they missed  Teenagers humbled by a book  It hardly ever happens  Huzzah  Mr  Vonnegut  First book from the author I ve read  Good stuff  Aliens  War  What s not to like   5 stars Brilliant  disturbing and thought provoking  This is the thought that was provoked Somewhere in a galaxy far  far away  before and after death  Voltaire and Vonnegut  Candide and Billy Pilgrim sit down together in a bar to decide upon the true location of the best of all possible worlds  So it goes   So they were both trying to reinvent themselves and their universe  Science fiction was a big help    What you doin   Kurt Vonnegut   may be my all time favorite line  I love reading aloud with my 15 year old daughter  We swoon over our favorite passages  loving the language  we marvel over meanings  we search for connections  So when I paused to ponder and re read a biblical allusion  placing Billy Pilgrim as a Christ like figure  Emma watched my face change and gave words to the expression she saw  Laughter ensued  Is Billy a time traveller  a messiah  a warrior  a mental patient  an oracle  a physicist  or a pawn as a character in one or all of Kilgore Trout s novels  The story told in postcard sized paragraphs and powerful images folded and spiraled me through time  I learned to see time as the Tralfamadorians do  as Vonnegut presents it  persistent and real at all points all the time  There is no continuum  no sequence  Present  past  and future are one  Thank you  dear daughter  for continuing to love language and literature with me  Before I go into my feelings toward this book  I must first address that i was under the impression this book was read with ease    That is true  however  this story is presented in a very unconventional fashion  Without a sound character base and constants of jumping between time frames  the story can appear hazy at times Despite the irregular presentation  Slaughterhouse Five touches on the classic battle between fate and man s ability to act on their own free will to change the future  Alongside the intense storyline there is a dark and clearly violent tone to the story which help give the reader a deeper understanding and feel for the destruction and emotion brought out by war Although some readers may find some of the events to harsh  for them to be appreciated as a form of dark humor  I was fascinated by the obscure story  However  I did find myself finishing the book with an eery but thought provoking view of Kurt Vonnegut s story  I have to admit  I didn t read Slaughterhouse Five for a long time because the reputation intimidated me  In college  I heard that it was a confusing book involving time travel  alien civilizations and the bombing of Dresden told in a non linear way and the reader had to put in a lot of work to grasp the story  This description is only partially true  and the book is brilliant  thought provoking and well deserving of its reputation as a classic  but it s NOT confusing in my opinion  Vonnegut tells the story in an interesting way  but the actual prose itself is clean  tight and does an excellent job of bringing the reader along through the story of a man who has become  unstuck in time   i e  remembers things in a non linear fashion  The primary literary device Vonnegut uses is one that tells the story of a man who was in WWII  taken as a prisoner of war  lived through the bombing of Dresden and  at times  successfully integrated back into society and at other times lost touch with reality due to the horrors he saw  The way the story is told is one that jumps around in the man s life  building to the remembrance of exactly what happened during his time as a POW and his attempts to cope with it afterward  The narrator does not judge  and this leaves the story open to the reader s interpretation as to whether what we are reading is what actually happened  or is a glimpse into the mind of a mentally ill man The images in the book are funny  horrific and sad  and Vonnegut does an amazing job of grounding it all so that nothing seems over the top  despite the strangeness of the events if taken at face value  I raced through the novel  pulled along by the prose and putting the pieces together as I went  Don t be intimidated by the reputation of the book being confusing  it s a well written book that comes together like a jigsaw puzzle  but is complex enough that what you see in the finished picture is based on what you bring to the book  Highly recommended  Epic  Everyone should read this book  Listen  Billy Pilgrim has become unstuck in time  I love Vonnegut s terse  yet rich storytelling  Re read this for the first time since 2004  I mostly paid attention back then to the aliens and the time travel  which I thought was awesome  It is awesome  And I understood that I was supposed to get that this was all a response to horror  Now that I know more about the bombing of Dresden  I find it all the more poignant  But I am troubled by the inaccuracies of the body count in the book  the narrator of the book paints Dresden as being equivalent to Hiroshima  which just isn t true  Maybe Vonnegut was leaning on faulty research  I m not sure  But man  this is a really poignant book  and like pretty much nothing I ve ever read  I keep coming back to the idea that  when witnessing a historic catastrophe  the rest of one s life pretty much doesn t matter  except for the fact that you have to just keep living it  Billy Pilgrim experiences his entire life over and over again  and isn t terribly moved by any of it  because how could he be  If you could personify post traumatic stress disorder and get it to stand up and talk  this would be it  It s a master work  Vonnegut managed to express and convey the absurdity of humankind s continuing failure to grasp the consequences of their actions  It s left to characters like Billy Pilgrim to pick up the pieces and make sense of something completely nonsensical  I was struck by Vonnegut s keen understanding of time  I don t think it s a view point that one can appreciate at its fullest until they ve experienced a particular kind of life altering event  to me  this is what this book accurately conveys    the effect of a shattered mind  It s a book of pieces  And like with anything you happen to break  gluing it back together means some pieces don t fit like they should  you end up with extra ones  and some are missing completely  While this book can be both absurd and surreal  in this way  it is the most real thing I ve ever read  One of the greatest books I ve read  But the expectations from Vonnegut were so high after reading Sirens of Titan  that my final emotions were not like  OMG  this changed my life   However in couple of month after finishing the book  when the knowledge and emotions settled down  I slowly realized how great book this is and how pity that expectations exist at all  Slaughterhouse Five is definitely no less masterpiece than Sirens of Titan  For the next book on my reading journey  I decided to go with Slaughterhouse Five by Kurt Vonnegut who was born in Indianapolis  Indiana So far I ve really been mixing up my genres  First a fantasy book  followed by a coming of age novel  and now black comedy and satire I didn t really know what to expect going into Slaughterhouse  because to be honest I really didn t know anything about it other than it has been highly revered and when I watched Footloose  Kevin Bacon said it was a classic and the preacher didn t like that Chapter one had me confused  I had no idea what was going and what was being said  so naturally I reread it  On the second time through  I realised that it had to have been Vonnegut s voice  not a characters  Sure enough  when I Googled to read more about him  Vonnegut was at Dresden  The first chapter felt to me as though it was Vonnegut trying to write about Dresden  and failing  so finally he decided to just decided to write a story about Billy Pilgrim instead Billy is a fatalistic character  who  in stressful times of his life  claims to time travel  For the most part I think we re meant to believe him  giving his knowledge of events such as his death and a plane crash he was involved in  Often times it feels as though Billy has no free will and is shuttled this way and that all his life  Free will seems to be a reoccurring theme throughout the novel  When his father throws him in the pool to learn to swim  he is forcibly rescued when he decides to sink to the bottom  or when he s made to stand on the edge of the Grand Canyon  There are plenty of times when Billy is discussing this with the Tralfamadorian s  the aliens who abducted him   who think Earth is the only planet with free will because we think time is linear  rather than simultaneously  The phrase  So it goes   is repeated several times throughout the book after any and all mention of death  From soldiers in the war  to victims of an airplane crash to Billy s dog  All murders  accidents  or natural deaths   So it goes   It certainly drives home the fact that death is inevitable and happens often and is something person will experience at some point or another The capacity for destruction that war carries is another topic discussed frequently  Some characters believe it to be necessary  some don t  Billy seems to not have an opinion given that everyone is going to die at some point  During his travels through time  Billy brings us along to experience the fire bombing of Dresden and we can feel the impact of just how many lives are being lost  the young girls from the showers  the German officers  the workers fleeing home to be with their families  It brings into question how far must it go  There is one specific passage  that I d like to link here  Perhaps my favourite of the novel  Billy is watching an old war film backwards  American planes  full of holes and wounded men and corpses took off backwards from an airfield in England  Over France a few German fighter plans flew at them backwards  sucked bullets and shell fragments from some of the planes and crewmen  They did the same for wrecked American bombers on the ground  and those planes flew up backwards to join the formation The formation flew backwards over a German city that was in flames  The bombers opened their bomb bay doors  exerted a miraculous magnetism which shrunk the fires  gathered them into cylindrical steel containers  and lifted the containers into the bellies of the planes  The containers were stored neatly in racks  The Germans below had miraculous devices of their own  which were long steel tubes  They used them to suck more fragments from the crewmen and planes  But there were still a few wounded Americans  though  and some of the bombers were in bad repair  Over France  though  German fighters came up again  made everything and everybody good as new When the bombers got back to their base  the steel cylinders were taken from the racks and shipped back to the United States of America  where factories were operating night and day  dismantling the cylinders  separating the dangerous contents into minerals  Touchingly  it was mainly women who did this work  The minerals were then shipped to specialists in remote areas  It was their business to put them into the ground  to hide them cleverly so they would never hurt anybody ever again The American fliers turned in their uniforms  became high school kids  And Hitler turned into a baby  Billy Pilgrim supposed  That wasn t in the movie  Billy was extrapolating  Everybody turned into a baby  and all humanity  without exception  conspired biologically to produce two perfect people named Adam and Eve  he supposed  That part really just struck something inside of me  Something I can t even begin to explain Incidentally  this book caused a lot of controversy when it came out  People called it  anti Christian  and  anti war  and it was banned in several places  I was aware of that much at least  again  from watching Footloose   Sure there s an excerpt of a character s book where someone time travels to meet Christ  and sure there s another part that says that  there s nothing intelligent to say about a massacre  regarding Dresden  but I wouldn t call this book  anti  anything  Using that logic  one could call it anti free will  It s not  It s simply questioning them So  all in all  if I m giving this a score out of five  I d go as follows 5 5I think Vonnegut really wrote from his soul here  questioning the things he wanted discuss  writing the words the he felt  A couple times in the novel  it s almost as if he d slip and say something like  I was there   or  I saw that too   As though writing his experiences from the war through the eyes of Billy Pilgrim was a sort of therapy  and there s nothing I could ever fault with that  There were some moments in the book where I found myself cringing and or laughing out loud  I think that s important  and I ve not read a book that kept the humour alive while discussing such heavy matters  and that s something I really applaud Vonnegut for  Wish I could travel back in time and to Dresden before the war  Would have been quite the city trip  Have a thing with postmodern novels  Glad I finally came round to reading this absolute classic  Deserves it s wide acclaim  Absolutely loved it for its clearcut language and images and its straightforward dealing with such a weighty subject  Conveys a lot in only a few pages  which are highly readable at great speed  It definitely goes  Slaughterhouse Five has earned a reputation for being an anti war book  But no  it s not  Not really  This novel rather is an attempt to redefine war The thing about war is that it will always exist  Even if there is no war  there will always be death  So it goes Bill Pilgrim claims that  on his daughter s wedding night  he was captured by Tralfamadorians and flown to the planet Tralfamadore to be exhibited in a zoo  On this planet he is introduced to the strange beliefs of the Tralfamadorians  All things will happen the way they happen because that is the way that things are meant to happen  There is no such thing as time  Time is but made of moments  and  all moments  past  present  and future  always have existed  always will exist   During this entire story Bill travels through time  backwards and forwards  To the time during the war  the time after  and the time before  He even experiences his death several times  and in this way  the novel is able to present death as an aspect that pales in significance to the grander scales of life  The story itself fails at being a story  There is no character development  no climax  not even a substantial plot  really  And in this failure is what makes it great  This story is pure chaos  absurdity  and randomness  This failure is a translation of Vonnegut s refusal to make meaning out of war and death  which are both as senseless and meaningless as  po tee tweet   I had zero expectations as to the story or writing style going in  All I knew was that it was one of the classics  I always thought it was a horror story based on the title  I believe I first heard of it in Disturbing Behaviour  a late 90s movie  I was pleasantly surprised to find it a very comical  disturbed and scattered recollection of a mans life  I don t know how deep into the psyche this book is attempting to delve  but on the story level   it was intriguing and fast paced  When looking closer  I can draw conclusions based on the mental shock of being one of the few survivors of the largest military massacre of the time  by being held prisoner in the meat room of a foreign slaughterhouse  and how that can lead to a complete mental breakdown and delusional episodes  Especially with all the attention to PTSD  after last years American Sniper drew critical praise for the stark light it casts on the lack of support given Stateside that led to Chris Kyle s death  So it goes Overall  I really enjoyed this novel and would recommend it to others for certain  I ll likely read it again in the coming years  Oh  and for those of you wondering if it really is a horror  the answer is both no  and yes  This is a great anti war story  I m always suspicious of anyone telling war stories  generally the greater the story  the less I a  Believe and b  enjoy  My Grandparents taught me that  To recall the real horrors of war must be an incredibly hard thing to do  My Grandfathers never did  one was a POW in Japan during WW2 and one was in the trenches in WW1  Escapism was a huge thing for them  it s the only way they coped with the memories and this is explored brilliantly by Kurt Vonnequt  It s a nice spin on memory  reality  your life flashing before you eyes and what is important  War is glorified too much  his line  My father died many years ago now    of natural causes  So it goes  He was a sweet man  He was a gun nut  too  He left me his guns  They rust   hits the chord right on the head  I like a bit of sci fi too which helps but this is a book written from the brain  not the heart  the brain  It should be read  Slaughterhouse Five is a fascinating story and perhaps the most bizarre novel I have ever read  It is an enlightening journey that so clearly demonstrates the destructiveness and trauma of war  I especially loved Vonnegut s messages about free will and time  as communicated by the Tralfamadorians    definitely ideas to be revisited  Overall  Slaughterhouse Five proved both depressing and eye opening So it goes   If you protest  if you think that death is a terrible thing  then you have not understood a word I ve said  WOW  How beautiful and brilliant is this book  I really don t even know what to write or how to explain how special it is  Right from the first few pages you get the feeling that the author knows exactly what he is doing and that he has a very unique voice  It is about Billy who witnessed the Dresden bombing and got to know an alien life form on a planet called Tralfamadore  There he learns a new way of thinking about life and time  The presented ideas are so remarkably beautiful that they may change your life  No kidding  Basically humans do not experience life and existence in its entirety  our view and outlook is blocked somehow  These Tralfamadorians experience life in four dimensions  Wait    I don t know if I should write more about it right here because you may want to read the book and experience these stunning passages yourself  I seriously just wanted to write about this philosophy and how it can apply to the existence of the whole universe and how beautiful life is but I think you should learn about it from Vonneguts writing  I am serious  this book is just breathtaking and you really have to read it  To imagine this most gentle giant underneath the Dresden cinderbox  and surviving to write this novel is impossible  This  Cat s Cradle and others should alert the Nobel Prize committee  Vonnegut was greater than the sum of his words  He is an immortal  For us  and our generation  he was the John Lennon of our souls  Slaughterhouse Five will stand the test of time as one of the quintessential books of our time  Listen  Billy Pilgrim is a thin cover for the author  Vonnegut recounts his capture in WWII  as a forward artillary observer during the Battle of the Bulge  His work in a syrup factory as a prisoner of war in Dresden  Germany and his subsequent stay in a slaughter house during the Allied fire bombing of Dresden  a city with no military importance  One of his best works  worth reading multiple times   This is my new favorite book  The way the book is written is just amazing  It s like poetry mixed with stream of consciousness but still a novel with a plot  Billy Pilgrim is the main character  an interesting and adaptable person  I like the off hand way Vonnegut addresses death  so it goes  This book is a crazy mesh of war  aliens  time travel  relationships  life and death  I think I ll read it again  Well  it happened  I fell in love with Vonnegut  yet again  I haven t read much of Kurt since my younger days  and I have been missing his sarcasm and intelligence  He makes a profound statement about war through the adventures of Billy Pilgrim  He also has a lot to say about family life  but in more subtle ways  I look forward to analyzing this masterful work of juxtapositions with my classes this year  Absolutely an amazing book  When i bought it i could not put it down   The first time I read Slaughterhouse Five  I hated it  It required in my Junior year of high school and it was too jumpy and weird for me to understand  A few years later  I picked it up again and wanted to give it an honest try on my own time  not the school s  Second time around  I loved it  The skipping around didn t bother me  It s best if you take your time with this book and just let it sink in  Occasionally the main character would  disgust  me with just his grossness  I m sensitive to stuff like that though  Kurt Vonnegut did a great job at creating the character  though  He nailed what he was going after It s definitely a book you have to read a time or two to fully understand  but it s worth it  I wouldn t have children read it  but a lot of teenagers and some adults I m sure would enjoy  It boils down to the type of person you are I recommend giving it a honest shot though  I read this for the first time 20 years ago I ve just re read it  In my eyes it has not diminished with time It gives outstanding illustrations  verbally  of futility   ridiculousness  and I still can t read the  comic  bits without a dark  heavy feeling of horror  I find this book to be simultaneously tragic  disturbing  heartbreaking  penetrating  compassionate   but most of all  honest  Wonderful book  Didn t expect it to be the kind of book that it was  The writing style was superb and intriguing  and it was short and sweet  This is one of those books you ll either love or hate  Confusing at times because Billy Pilgrim has become unstuck in time and bounces around his life  He s a prisoner of war in Dresden during WWII  he s a middle aged optometrist and he s living in a zoo on another planet called Tralfamadore with a hot actress named Montana  all in no particular order  The story is witty  profound and unnerving   Read this for the first time since high school  when it was one of the gateway drugs that moved me from sci fi nerd to literature nerd  an important stage in nerd pupation An absolutely necessary book about fatalism and war and memory and aliens  How Vonnegut manages to balance all of those in a darkly comic anti war novel is a mystery I have not begun to unravel  So I ll stop here  The first chapter had me a little scared  What with the narration from Kurt Vonnegut talking about how he wrote the book and referencing its own  not very well known  subtitle  A Children s Crusade and even telling us the first and last lines of the novel  I got a big If on a Winter s Night a Traveler vibe  and I did NOT like that book Luckily  Chapter 2 tells us about Billy Pilgrim getting  unstuck in time  and the mood of the book shifts more toward an unromantic version of The Time Traveler s Wife  There s no easy way to summarize this book  It jumps around to different parts of Billy s life  from his time spent on an alien world where he s forced to mate with a porn actress  to his time in the titular building in Dresden shortly before the city is destroyed in WWII  Billy easily flicks back and forth to multiple parts of his life throughout the book  learning from the aliens who kidnap him to live   see his own life in four dimensions  These Tralfamadorians teach Billy how life and death  every action and reaction are just fixed points in time  everything that happens does so because it always has happened  Therefore death is just one more thing that is unavoidable   So it goes   Just because someone dies  doesn t mean they never lived and the Tralfamadorians can always choose to view the happy moments they want to see  It s hard to know for sure if Billy is in control of his time traveling or if he s just a slave to it  I feel like this book would be something worth studying  I m sure there is a lot of symbolism and subtext that could heighten the satire but as an adult reading it for something other than English class  I was proud I picked up the repeated color motifs  orange and black  blue and ivory   I m really interested in how the movie turned out  I didn t even realize it was ever turned into a film    As a novel  I loved how it flowed  after it officially started in Chapter 2   It only took me two weeks to read because there were some days I couldn t find time to pick it up  I could easily see this being reread over a weekend if I didn t have anything else to do  I first read this book many a moon ago but was prompted to pick it up again after reading Antony Beevor s recent offering  Ardennes 1944  Hitler s Last Gamble   Kurt Vonnegut is mentioned in Beevor s book as it was during the Ardennes offensive that he was captured by the Germans  And as Vonnegut says at the beginning of Slaughterhouse Five   The war parts anyway  are pretty much true  It tells the story of one Billy Pilgrim  prisoner of war and accidental time traveller  who experiences and survives the notorious air raid on Dresden in February 1945 The thing that struck me on rereading the book is that there is actually very little about the air raid itself  But I guess given Vonnegut s troubles authoring this work and the horrors that he witnessed  that isn t surprising I haven t got much else to add other than to say it s sad  funny and a genuine masterpiece  The most poignant part of the book for me is where Billy Pilgrim watches a movie about American bombers  backwards  The bombers shrink the fires below them and gather their bombs back up into their bomb bays  German fighters suck bullets back out of the sky  The bombers land  The bombs are then dismantled by women  separating their dangerous contents into various minerals  The minerals are then put back in the ground so they can never hurt anyone again If only  I read Slaughterhouse Five as part of Crash Course Literature s reading list  http   youtu be F6g7S2W27Kc list PL8d      I loved reading Slaughterhouse Five  Kurt Vonnegut s sarcasm makes for a compelling read and I feel like Slaughterhouse Five was my gateway into Kurt Vonnegut  Now I m hooked Slaughterhouse Five presents a series of moments from a WWII veteran s life out of order  As Kurt Vonnegut mentions  Billy Pilgrim has been unstuck from time  I enjoyed how the story seemed to move naturally through Billy Pilgrim s life  despite the fact that nothing was happening in order  This book also had fantastic  funny characters that move through Billy s life as he passively accepts what is happening around him  Overall a wonderful and funny read  Oh  also  there are aliens  What s not to like  I highly recommend reading this book for the sci fi historical fiction mix  this is my new favorite book  the constant back and fourth keeps you on your toes and the story line is riviting  i never wanted to put it down  this might be a book i read more than once  i just love it so much i could die  and so it goes    this was fantastic  I wish I had read in High School  though I wouldn t have enjoyed it as much back then as I did now    but still  I feel a tinge of regret at not having read it  This was my first Vonnegut book  and it was much better than I thought it would be  Vonnegut writes like a mad scientist with a sense of humor  it is a classic  yes  but its a classic for a reason   First  before I delve into this review  I would like to make one thing explicitly clear   I give this book  Slaughterhouse Five  a five star rating  If someone were to ask me why without giving me adequate time to think about a proper response  I would simply say   I could not tell you why I love it  but I do   Now  for the explanation that I must meticulously muster  yet will still only shadow what is truly amazing and only found in the words of this book  I will try my best to at least show an inkling of the splendor and unique wonder found in this book The main plot in this book is that a man  Billy Pilgrim  is seemingly an extraordinary man  He has been through war  been through many disasters  and   according to him   endured an alien abduction  He very strongly focuses on all of these aspects  jumping through a long timeline for past  present  and future  As the reader goes along  we learn more about Billy and his sporadic ideology  He was never the brightest man it seems  but he got through life  Billy was in World War II  surviving through the bombing of Dresden  almost dying from his own American troops due to their feverish need to eliminate everyone in this peaceful town  This on its own is enough to traumatize a man  After this  he has supposedly been abducted by aliens  These  aliens  apparently kept him on their home planet in a zoo   this will be very important later  They taught him an absurd yet comforting way of thinking that  if the reader keeps an open mind and considers deeply  is actually a very philosophical thought  This would be a matter of time  Humans think of time in a linear path  These aliens simply believed that this is not true  You can live in any timeline you want  no matter how far ago it was or how far in the future it is  They focus on the good in life  and avoided the evil  They believe that you never truly die  for you are alive in the past and can visit this time  whether it be literally or metaphorically  This completely alters Billy s mindset throughout the book  Then  some time after this  Billy gets into a plane wreck  and only after this event does he reveal his  experience   From here  we begin to see the truth of everything unfold I will not expand on what was truth and what was imagination any further to prevent spoiling this phenomenal story  Rather  I will explain what makes this so exotic in my eyes  The story ultimately has no timeline and very little character development on the surface  At the end  however  if the reader is meticulous enough  a whole new character evolves  Billy Pilgrim is not just a nut job who is confused by the world  At the end  he is completely changed  Multiple times  increasing as the reader gets closer to the end  a simple phrase is repeated over and over  So it goes  The reader could easily see this as a sort of shrug off as to whether or not he believes in the prior statement  But with close observation  it has a different meaning  After every death  every hardship  Billy ends it with  So it goes    absolutely unchanged by what has happened  We see no remorse  No pain  No thought of it whatsoever  Just a simple  So it goes   I feel this shows an indifference to Billy and the world  almost a sociopathic wall created in his mind  He sees these things as just that   things  And this is the most enthralling part to me  for it shows one extreme idea  Billy gives the reader a glimpse of what trauma can really do  Not fear  Not terror  Not paranoia  But a distance between someone and the world  The distance of which creates a pillow from emotion  causing a void  not allowing him to feel  but be lost in his own mind  This is what is incredible   This book is just amazing  This is the first book I have read from Vonnegut and I am happy to say that I am enticed to read his other novels as well  I was reading this book for fun because I saw that one of my favourite author loved his books  so I gave this book a shot  I began reading it and I simply couldn t stop  Suddenly I was reading this for history class because it did contain such real historical content for my final  project  which was the bombing of Dresden  Germany  The philosophical and satirical contents toward war  government  religion  free will  and terrestrial beings is conveyed profoundly  This book gave me such a simple understandings on a POW s perspective and the protagonist s bizarre time travel adventures from earth to this planet call Tralfamadore  His crazy life led me to think about the realities of war and life  Definitely a read   I finally found some more time to see what Kurt Vonnegut Jr  was all about since first reading his excellent Orwellian short story Harrison Bergeron  Part war story  part science fiction  part satire and part something else  Slaughterhouse Five is one of those rare books that is both funny  absurd and moral at the same time  much like the Tralfamadorian books in Slaughterhouse Five  actually  that are read in a single  all encompassing instance   It centers around the World War II bombing of Dresden  an action now seen as unnecessary and excessive on the part of the Allies  Did Vonneguts book have a role to play in this new perception of the bombardment of Dresden  Who knows  Either way  Slaughterhouse Five is one for the times  and since I hear that many of these characters resurface in his other books I d be happy to read another book by his whenever I stumble upon one   What a way to start off a year of new reading  The copy of Slaughterhouse Five that I picked up is a  Vintage  re print and as such the back copy was replaced by some editorial hype  I am happy to say that for once the hype was justified  This is a powerful novel of introspection and social commentary on the fragility of human lives and the long standing strength of human memory  Vonnegut minces no words  even going so far as to say how the novel will begin and end right there in the opening pages  So it goes  Even though the subject matter is dark and often times difficult to stomach Vonnegut approaches it in such away that you can t help but pull a wry smile even as you re reading about one of the greatest tragedies in human history  Vonnegut himself writes  There is nothing intelligent to say about a massacre   And even if that s true this has come as close to it as I can imagine right now   This is just brilliance in its purest form  Brilliant writing  brilliant form of storytelling  brilliant message   one of the best books I have ever read  Vonnegut is a brilliant novelist and the treatment of this book  though disjointed at times  made for another great read  I refer to him often when discussing black humor in my creative writing class  I did notice elements of this story I had never noticed when I read it the first time many years ago  I suspect it s because I was told by a friend that Slaughterhouse Five is  mandatory hipster reading  or because I read more about his life and had no idea previously that Slaughterhouse Five was somewhat autobiographical following Vonnegut s own experiences during WWII  Anyone think that Billy Pilgrim s last name was chosen on purpose  I read a review once that suggested it may have been chosen to illustrate a pilgrimage of sorts   a pilgrimage to death  Regardless  read it  You won t be disappointed  Definitely my favorite Vonnegut book next to Cat s Cradle    Slaughterhouse Five was a book that was interesting from the very beginning  Although I got confused during the second chapter  it was interesting enough for me to keep going  After a while  I just ended up getting even more confused  However  it was all resolved in the end  Throughout the novel  Billy Pilgrim jumps through time to various points throughout his life  The sporadic nature of these jumps allow the reader to see the world that Billy has experienced in contrasting ways  Glimpses of the firebombing compared to his experiences after the war allow the reader to see what war can be like for the people in it  All in all  I believe that Slaughterhouse Five was an interesting book that gave readers an inside look at the war  At times  it can be rather confusing  However  I would still recommend it to other people to read   Listen  Billy Pilgrim came unstuck in time   Kurt Vonnegut created a masterpiece with Slaughterhouse Five  a genuine piece of brilliant and sardonic genius  If you were forced to read this in high school and hated it  go back and read it as an adult  Like Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury  this book means more and makes so much more sense with some life experience behind you   When I first read this book in college  I hated it and thought it overrated  Later I read it and couldn t put it down  Billy Pilgrim unstuck in time can t forget watching the allies bomb Dresden  and not matter how far away he tries and seems to get  in the end it destroys him  It isn t an anti war novel it is an anti bombing and an anti anti humanity novel  A great book  One of the best things I ve read in a long time and my first read by Vonnegut  The reader is weaved back and forth in time  in and out of story after story  from one related incident to another  and yet you never seem to find yourself lost  Vonnegut mixes his anti war sentiments with comedy  science fiction  and an interesting view on death  dying and the grief process  Slaughterhouse Five has earned a reputation for being an anti war book  But no  it s not  Not really  This novel rather is an attempt to redefine war The thing about war is that it will always exist  Even if there is no war  there will always be death  So it goes Bill Pilgrim claims that  on his daughter s wedding night  he was captured by Tralfamadorians and flown to the planet Tralfamadore to be exhibited in a zoo  On this planet he is introduced to the strange beliefs of the Tralfamadorians  All things will happen the way they happen because that is the way that things are meant to happen  There is no such thing as time  Time is but made of moments  and  all moments  past  present  and future  always have existed  always will exist   During this entire story Bill travels through time  backwards and forwards  To the time during the war  the time after  and the time before  He even experiences his death several times  and in this way  the novel is able to present death as an aspect that pales in significance to the grander scales of life  The story itself fails at being a story  There is no character development  no climax  not even a substantial plot  really  And in this failure is what makes it great  This story is pure chaos  absurdity  and randomness  This failure is a translation of Vonnegut s refusal to make meaning out of war and death  which are both as senseless and meaningless as  po tee tweet   I had zero expectations as to the story or writing style going in  All I knew was that it was one of the classics  I always thought it was a horror story based on the title  I believe I first heard of it in Disturbing Behaviour  a late 90s movie  I was pleasantly surprised to find it a very comical  disturbed and scattered recollection of a mans life  I don t know how deep into the psyche this book is attempting to delve  but on the story level   it was intriguing and fast paced  When looking closer  I can draw conclusions based on the mental shock of being one of the few survivors of the largest military massacre of the time  by being held prisoner in the meat room of a foreign slaughterhouse  and how that can lead to a complete mental breakdown and delusional episodes  Especially with all the attention to PTSD  after last years American Sniper drew critical praise for the stark light it casts on the lack of support given Stateside that led to Chris Kyle s death  So it goes Overall  I really enjoyed this novel and would recommend it to others for certain  I ll likely read it again in the coming years  Oh  and for those of you wondering if it really is a horror  the answer is both no  and yes  This is a great anti war story  I m always suspicious of anyone telling war stories  generally the greater the story  the less I a  Believe and b  enjoy  My Grandparents taught me that  To recall the real horrors of war must be an incredibly hard thing to do  My Grandfathers never did  one was a POW in Japan during WW2 and one was in the trenches in WW1  Escapism was a huge thing for them  it s the only way they coped with the memories and this is explored brilliantly by Kurt Vonnequt  It s a nice spin on memory  reality  your life flashing before you eyes and what is important  War is glorified too much  his line  My father died many years ago now    of natural causes  So it goes  He was a sweet man  He was a gun nut  too  He left me his guns  They rust   hits the chord right on the head  I like a bit of sci fi too which helps but this is a book written from the brain  not the heart  the brain  It should be read  Slaughterhouse Five is a fascinating story and perhaps the most bizarre novel I have ever read  It is an enlightening journey that so clearly demonstrates the destructiveness and trauma of war  I especially loved Vonnegut s messages about free will and time  as communicated by the Tralfamadorians    definitely ideas to be revisited  Overall  Slaughterhouse Five proved both depressing and eye opening So it goes   If you protest  if you think that death is a terrible thing  then you have not understood a word I ve said  WOW  How beautiful and brilliant is this book  I really don t even know what to write or how to explain how special it is  Right from the first few pages you get the feeling that the author knows exactly what he is doing and that he has a very unique voice  It is about Billy who witnessed the Dresden bombing and got to know an alien life form on a planet called Tralfamadore  There he learns a new way of thinking about life and time  The presented ideas are so remarkably beautiful that they may change your life  No kidding  Basically humans do not experience life and existence in its entirety  our view and outlook is blocked somehow  These Tralfamadorians experience life in four dimensions  Wait    I don t know if I should write more about it right here because you may want to read the book and experience these stunning passages yourself  I seriously just wanted to write about this philosophy and how it can apply to the existence of the whole universe and how beautiful life is but I think you should learn about it from Vonneguts writing  I am serious  this book is just breathtaking and you really have to read it  To imagine this most gentle giant underneath the Dresden cinderbox  and surviving to write this novel is impossible  This  Cat s Cradle and others should alert the Nobel Prize committee  Vonnegut was greater than the sum of his words  He is an immortal  For us  and our generation  he was the John Lennon of our souls  Slaughterhouse Five will stand the test of time as one of the quintessential books of our time  Listen  Billy Pilgrim is a thin cover for the author  Vonnegut recounts his capture in WWII  as a forward artillary observer during the Battle of the Bulge  His work in a syrup factory as a prisoner of war in Dresden  Germany and his subsequent stay in a slaughter house during the Allied fire bombing of Dresden  a city with no military importance  One of his best works  worth reading multiple times   This is my new favorite book  The way the book is written is just amazing  It s like poetry mixed with stream of consciousness but still a novel with a plot  Billy Pilgrim is the main character  an interesting and adaptable person  I like the off hand way Vonnegut addresses death  so it goes  This book is a crazy mesh of war  aliens  time travel  relationships  life and death  I think I ll read it again  Well  it happened  I fell in love with Vonnegut  yet again  I haven t read much of Kurt since my younger days  and I have been missing his sarcasm and intelligence  He makes a profound statement about war through the adventures of Billy Pilgrim  He also has a lot to say about family life  but in more subtle ways  I look forward to analyzing this masterful work of juxtapositions with my classes this year  Absolutely an amazing book  When i bought it i could not put it down   The first time I read Slaughterhouse Five  I hated it  It required in my Junior year of high school and it was too jumpy and weird for me to understand  A few years later  I picked it up again and wanted to give it an honest try on my own time  not the school s  Second time around  I loved it  The skipping around didn t bother me  It s best if you take your time with this book and just let it sink in  Occasionally the main character would  disgust  me with just his grossness  I m sensitive to stuff like that though  Kurt Vonnegut did a great job at creating the character  though  He nailed what he was going after It s definitely a book you have to read a time or two to fully understand  but it s worth it  I wouldn t have children read it  but a lot of teenagers and some adults I m sure would enjoy  It boils down to the type of person you are I recommend giving it a honest shot though  I read this for the first time 20 years ago I ve just re read it  In my eyes it has not diminished with time It gives outstanding illustrations  verbally  of futility   ridiculousness  and I still can t read the  comic  bits without a dark  heavy feeling of horror  I find this book to be simultaneously tragic  disturbing  heartbreaking  penetrating  compassionate   but most of all  honest  Wonderful book  Didn t expect it to be the kind of book that it was  The writing style was superb and intriguing  and it was short and sweet  This is one of those books you ll either love or hate  Confusing at times because Billy Pilgrim has become unstuck in time and bounces around his life  He s a prisoner of war in Dresden during WWII  he s a middle aged optometrist and he s living in a zoo on another planet called Tralfamadore with a hot actress named Montana  all in no particular order  The story is witty  profound and unnerving   Read this for the first time since high school  when it was one of the gateway drugs that moved me from sci fi nerd to literature nerd  an important stage in nerd pupation An absolutely necessary book about fatalism and war and memory and aliens  How Vonnegut manages to balance all of those in a darkly comic anti war novel is a mystery I have not begun to unravel  So I ll stop here  The first chapter had me a little scared  What with the narration from Kurt Vonnegut talking about how he wrote the book and referencing its own  not very well known  subtitle  A Children s Crusade and even telling us the first and last lines of the novel  I got a big If on a Winter s Night a Traveler vibe  and I did NOT like that book Luckily  Chapter 2 tells us about Billy Pilgrim getting  unstuck in time  and the mood of the book shifts more toward an unromantic version of The Time Traveler s Wife  There s no easy way to summarize this book  It jumps around to different parts of Billy s life  from his time spent on an alien world where he s forced to mate with a porn actress  to his time in the titular building in Dresden shortly before the city is destroyed in WWII  Billy easily flicks back and forth to multiple parts of his life throughout the book  learning from the aliens who kidnap him to live   see his own life in four dimensions  These Tralfamadorians teach Billy how life and death  every action and reaction are just fixed points in time  everything that happens does so because it always has happened  Therefore death is just one more thing that is unavoidable   So it goes   Just because someone dies  doesn t mean they never lived and the Tralfamadorians can always choose to view the happy moments they want to see  It s hard to know for sure if Billy is in control of his time traveling or if he s just a slave to it  I feel like this book would be something worth studying  I m sure there is a lot of symbolism and subtext that could heighten the satire but as an adult reading it for something other than English class  I was proud I picked up the repeated color motifs  orange and black  blue and ivory   I m really interested in how the movie turned out  I didn t even realize it was ever turned into a film    As a novel  I loved how it flowed  after it officially started in Chapter 2   It only took me two weeks to read because there were some days I couldn t find time to pick it up  I could easily see this being reread over a weekend if I didn t have anything else to do  I first read this book many a moon ago but was prompted to pick it up again after reading Antony Beevor s recent offering  Ardennes 1944  Hitler s Last Gamble   Kurt Vonnegut is mentioned in Beevor s book as it was during the Ardennes offensive that he was captured by the Germans  And as Vonnegut says at the beginning of Slaughterhouse Five   The war parts anyway  are pretty much true  It tells the story of one Billy Pilgrim  prisoner of war and accidental time traveller  who experiences and survives the notorious air raid on Dresden in February 1945 The thing that struck me on rereading the book is that there is actually very little about the air raid itself  But I guess given Vonnegut s troubles authoring this work and the horrors that he witnessed  that isn t surprising I haven t got much else to add other than to say it s sad  funny and a genuine masterpiece  The most poignant part of the book for me is where Billy Pilgrim watches a movie about American bombers  backwards  The bombers shrink the fires below them and gather their bombs back up into their bomb bays  German fighters suck bullets back out of the sky  The bombers land  The bombs are then dismantled by women  separating their dangerous contents into various minerals  The minerals are then put back in the ground so they can never hurt anyone again If only  I read Slaughterhouse Five as part of Crash Course Literature s reading list  http   youtu be F6g7S2W27Kc list PL8d      I loved reading Slaughterhouse Five  Kurt Vonnegut s sarcasm makes for a compelling read and I feel like Slaughterhouse Five was my gateway into Kurt Vonnegut  Now I m hooked Slaughterhouse Five presents a series of moments from a WWII veteran s life out of order  As Kurt Vonnegut mentions  Billy Pilgrim has been unstuck from time  I enjoyed how the story seemed to move naturally through Billy Pilgrim s life  despite the fact that nothing was happening in order  This book also had fantastic  funny characters that move through Billy s life as he passively accepts what is happening around him  Overall a wonderful and funny read  Oh  also  there are aliens  What s not to like  I highly recommend reading this book for the sci fi historical fiction mix  this is my new favorite book  the constant back and fourth keeps you on your toes and the story line is riviting  i never wanted to put it down  this might be a book i read more than once  i just love it so much i could die  and so it goes    this was fantastic  I wish I had read in High School  though I wouldn t have enjoyed it as much back then as I did now    but still  I feel a tinge of regret at not having read it  This was my first Vonnegut book  and it was much better than I thought it would be  Vonnegut writes like a mad scientist with a sense of humor  it is a classic  yes  but its a classic for a reason   First  before I delve into this review  I would like to make one thing explicitly clear   I give this book  Slaughterhouse Five  a five star rating  If someone were to ask me why without giving me adequate time to think about a proper response  I would simply say   I could not tell you why I love it  but I do   Now  for the explanation that I must meticulously muster  yet will still only shadow what is truly amazing and only found in the words of this book  I will try my best to at least show an inkling of the splendor and unique wonder found in this book The main plot in this book is that a man  Billy Pilgrim  is seemingly an extraordinary man  He has been through war  been through many disasters  and   according to him   endured an alien abduction  He very strongly focuses on all of these aspects  jumping through a long timeline for past  present  and future  As the reader goes along  we learn more about Billy and his sporadic ideology  He was never the brightest man it seems  but he got through life  Billy was in World War II  surviving through the bombing of Dresden  almost dying from his own American troops due to their feverish need to eliminate everyone in this peaceful town  This on its own is enough to traumatize a man  After this  he has supposedly been abducted by aliens  These  aliens  apparently kept him on their home planet in a zoo   this will be very important later  They taught him an absurd yet comforting way of thinking that  if the reader keeps an open mind and considers deeply  is actually a very philosophical thought  This would be a matter of time  Humans think of time in a linear path  These aliens simply believed that this is not true  You can live in any timeline you want  no matter how far ago it was or how far in the future it is  They focus on the good in life  and avoided the evil  They believe that you never truly die  for you are alive in the past and can visit this time  whether it be literally or metaphorically  This completely alters Billy s mindset throughout the book  Then  some time after this  Billy gets into a plane wreck  and only after this event does he reveal his  experience   From here  we begin to see the truth of everything unfold I will not expand on what was truth and what was imagination any further to prevent spoiling this phenomenal story  Rather  I will explain what makes this so exotic in my eyes  The story ultimately has no timeline and very little character development on the surface  At the end  however  if the reader is meticulous enough  a whole new character evolves  Billy Pilgrim is not just a nut job who is confused by the world  At the end  he is completely changed  Multiple times  increasing as the reader gets closer to the end  a simple phrase is repeated over and over  So it goes  The reader could easily see this as a sort of shrug off as to whether or not he believes in the prior statement  But with close observation  it has a different meaning  After every death  every hardship  Billy ends it with  So it goes    absolutely unchanged by what has happened  We see no remorse  No pain  No thought of it whatsoever  Just a simple  So it goes   I feel this shows an indifference to Billy and the world  almost a sociopathic wall created in his mind  He sees these things as just that   things  And this is the most enthralling part to me  for it shows one extreme idea  Billy gives the reader a glimpse of what trauma can really do  Not fear  Not terror  Not paranoia  But a distance between someone and the world  The distance of which creates a pillow from emotion  causing a void  not allowing him to feel  but be lost in his own mind  This is what is incredible   This book is just amazing  This is the first book I have read from Vonnegut and I am happy to say that I am enticed to read his other novels as well  I was reading this book for fun because I saw that one of my favourite author loved his books  so I gave this book a shot  I began reading it and I simply couldn t stop  Suddenly I was reading this for history class because it did contain such real historical content for my final  project  which was the bombing of Dresden  Germany  The philosophical and satirical contents toward war  government  religion  free will  and terrestrial beings is conveyed profoundly  This book gave me such a simple understandings on a POW s perspective and the protagonist s bizarre time travel adventures from earth to this planet call Tralfamadore  His crazy life led me to think about the realities of war and life  Definitely a read   I finally found some more time to see what Kurt Vonnegut Jr  was all about since first reading his excellent Orwellian short story Harrison Bergeron  Part war story  part science fiction  part satire and part something else  Slaughterhouse Five is one of those rare books that is both funny  absurd and moral at the same time  much like the Tralfamadorian books in Slaughterhouse Five  actually  that are read in a single  all encompassing instance   It centers around the World War II bombing of Dresden  an action now seen as unnecessary and excessive on the part of the Allies  Did Vonneguts book have a role to play in this new perception of the bombardment of Dresden  Who knows  Either way  Slaughterhouse Five is one for the times  and since I hear that many of these characters resurface in his other books I d be happy to read another book by his whenever I stumble upon one   What a way to start off a year of new reading  The copy of Slaughterhouse Five that I picked up is a  Vintage  re print and as such the back copy was replaced by some editorial hype  I am happy to say that for once the hype was justified  This is a powerful novel of introspection and social commentary on the fragility of human lives and the long standing strength of human memory  Vonnegut minces no words  even going so far as to say how the novel will begin and end right there in the opening pages  So it goes  Even though the subject matter is dark and often times difficult to stomach Vonnegut approaches it in such away that you can t help but pull a wry smile even as you re reading about one of the greatest tragedies in human history  Vonnegut himself writes  There is nothing intelligent to say about a massacre   And even if that s true this has come as close to it as I can imagine right now   This is just brilliance in its purest form  Brilliant writing  brilliant form of storytelling  brilliant message   one of the best books I have ever read  Vonnegut is a brilliant novelist and the treatment of this book  though disjointed at times  made for another great read  I refer to him often when discussing black humor in my creative writing class  I did notice elements of this story I had never noticed when I read it the first time many years ago  I suspect it s because I was told by a friend that Slaughterhouse Five is  mandatory hipster reading  or because I read more about his life and had no idea previously that Slaughterhouse Five was somewhat autobiographical following Vonnegut s own experiences during WWII  Anyone think that Billy Pilgrim s last name was chosen on purpose  I read a review once that suggested it may have been chosen to illustrate a pilgrimage of sorts   a pilgrimage to death  Regardless  read it  You won t be disappointed  Definitely my favorite Vonnegut book next to Cat s Cradle    Slaughterhouse Five was a book that was interesting from the very beginning  Although I got confused during the second chapter  it was interesting enough for me to keep going  After a while  I just ended up getting even more confused  However  it was all resolved in the end  Throughout the novel  Billy Pilgrim jumps through time to various points throughout his life  The sporadic nature of these jumps allow the reader to see the world that Billy has experienced in contrasting ways  Glimpses of the firebombing compared to his experiences after the war allow the reader to see what war can be like for the people in it  All in all  I believe that Slaughterhouse Five was an interesting book that gave readers an inside look at the war  At times  it can be rather confusing  However  I would still recommend it to other people to read   Listen  Billy Pilgrim came unstuck in time   Kurt Vonnegut created a masterpiece with Slaughterhouse Five  a genuine piece of brilliant and sardonic genius  If you were forced to read this in high school and hated it  go back and read it as an adult  Like Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury  this book means more and makes so much more sense with some life experience behind you   When I first read this book in college  I hated it and thought it overrated  Later I read it and couldn t put it down  Billy Pilgrim unstuck in time can t forget watching the allies bomb Dresden  and not matter how far away he tries and seems to get  in the end it destroys him  It isn t an anti war novel it is an anti bombing and an anti anti humanity novel  A great book  One of the best things I ve read in a long time and my first read by Vonnegut  The reader is weaved back and forth in time  in and out of story after story  from one related incident to another  and yet you never seem to find yourself lost  Vonnegut mixes his anti war sentiments with comedy  science fiction  and an interesting view on death  dying and the grief process  Czytalem rozne ksiazki o wojnie  Te opisujace akty heroizmu oraz te  ktore ukazuja nam okrucienstwo konfliktow zbrojnych  Jednak to  Rzeznia  ze swoja oszczedna i nieco dziwaczna forma rozbila mnie na kawalki  Powracajace raz po raz  zdarza sie  jako podsumowanie ludzkiej tragedii   niby obojetne a jednak w calym kontekscie ksiazki wielce poruszajace  Bo coz innego mozna powiedziec kiedy czlowieka dotyka tragedia  Moim skromnym zdaniem  ksiazka rewelacyjnie pokazuje to jaki wojna moze miec wplyw na psychike czlowieka  jak ja zmienia  Jak wszystko inne staje sie     nierealne  Mozna mowic  ze ksiazka jest glupia  infantylna czy wrecz nudna  Owszem nie ma w niej opisow batalistycznych  desantow spadochronowych i ratowania ostatniego z braci Ryanow  Zamiast tego otrzymujemy naprawde szczera opowiesc o tym  ze wojna nie konczy sie wraz z zawieszeniem broni lecz w umyslach prostych zolnierzy towarzyszy im przez reszte zycia    The first book I ever loved    Slaughterhouse Five is a turning point in my life  I read it maybe a little over two years ago  and now I ve read at least as many books since as I had up to that point  Most of my reading life has been spurts of 2 to 3 books separated by a year of inactivity  For over 2 years now I ve always had a book to read  thanks to Vonnegut s gentle nudge  see  enormous shove   into a category of literature I didn t know existed  Fun  Was I reading the wrong books  I guess so  Had I been reading the right books I don t think this would have taken me by surprise the way it did  Can a novel be a bleak semi autobiographical WWII narrative  a time and space traveling science fiction adventure  and poignant dark comic cultural commentary at once  all while being somehow comforting in the face of omnipresent  inescapable death  I doubt I need to answer that incredibly specific rhetorical question  This book can be and is that and then some  So I guess my point it  read it  If you re into that kind of thing  This book is one of a kind  created by a one of a kind author  Kurt Vonnegut  this gave me a reinvigorating enjoyment of books  Not to say that books have become stale for me  I have just been reading serious  and seriously problematic books  with problematic characters  and problematic story lines  which grow unappetizing after a while  However  the entire erratic life of the characters  as well as the life style of the plot  has poured the much needed drops of excitement back into reading  It s always good to know that I can stray away from my favourite genres  and still be able to have a laugh or two along the way  Back to the review  Kurt Vonnegut is a master of immersion  or should I say Kilgore Trout is a master of immersion  Either way  both create novels which are  quite literally  out of the universe  In more than one scenario I ve laughed incredulously  smiled sheepishly  and shaken my head in unfathomability  Billy pilgrim is an utter failure of a war hero  the lowliest of the low  and his cynical approach to life should completely make the reader feel abject  yet he does exactly the opposite  There aren t many notable characters in the book  but Billy Pilgrim  however  is one of them  He s pessimistic and has lived with the worst demons one can be placed in a cage with  yet he has come out unscathed  He s like a conduit which gives enjoyment to others through stripping it off of himself  Anyway  the novel gives enough of a review of itself than I can  So  with that said  there s only one thing left to do for anyone who doesn t know if they want to read this novel  Read this novel  Vonnegut is the king of satirical novels  and now a favourite author of mine  I expected   Slaughterhouse Five  to be a pretentious  overly serious postmodern novel  Oh boy  was I wrong  It is smart AND enjoyable  a trait which only really few books posess  Although this is a war story  I had to laugh a lot during this one and permanently marvelled at all these crazy ideas  Just finished this book  It took me two days to read  It is two in the morning right now This is one of my favorite books  Upon finishing it  I felt a little overwhelmed  Like I had lived a lifetime  It s all starting to settle now  though  I m sure waking up tomorrow will be refreshing   Oh  shit  you don t need me to recommend this to you  This is another one of those ones you just kind of can t get by in life without reading  I will say that there are superior Vonneguts  though  SIRENS OF TITAN  CAT S CRADLE   but this is the classic sine qua non the others  So it goes    Excellent  Although  I m rather late to the Vonnegut bandwagon  so I imagine that s not a groundbreaking conclusion  This book was strangely perfect    all the disjointedness and lack of linear narration is offset by lots of interesting parallels and motifs which tie the whole thing together   I can t explain why but I just really loved this story  There s just something so powerful about the way Vonnegut tells this story  it s just amazing  It s not easy though and even though it is sad  it is funny  yet you can t laugh because this is serious  It s just one of a kind and I love it   My review may be biased I love Vonnegut  This book is an easy read  but only because he was such a talented writer  In this book he deftly infuses a message  humor  irony and pure intelligence into a short story of a man plagued by his experiences and the question of what is the purpose of life  One of the best Anti war books I ve ever read  One of my favorite books of all time  Few other books have amazed me and taken me on a whimsical journey through time and history but in totally separate ways  Slaughterhouse 5 is one of those books that sticks in your mind long after you have read it  so it goes  It s such a simple tale and yet so profound  I read this book about 3 weeks ago and it hasn t left my thoughts  I m so glad I read it when I did one of my favourite books ever  Loved it  There are so many books that are considered  must reads     classics   that it usually makes my ass twitch when someone recommends one  I always liken it to eating my vegetables  but this is deep fried   covered in cheese sauce delicious  I really don t care WHAT it is  A truly fantastic book  I read it all in one day  275 pages  I couldn t put it down  This is the first time I ve read Vonnegut and I definitely want ot read more of his work  The way Vonnegut uses humor in his writing  while writing about horrible and painful events  is truly amazing  Instead of preaching about the senselessness of war  this book makes you feel the senselessness of war by being senseless  Reading it is an experience unlike reading any other book  It s weird  absurd  tragic  horrific  and funny all at the same time  An astonishing feat of writing  When I heard it was science fiction  I thought it would take place in the future  not the present  It is a book about war  It could be said to be anti war  but it s just so plain  Not boring  It just captures details about war that are so ordinary  so real  and so sad I loved it  It took me a long time to get around to this book  The first Vonnegut I read was Mother Night  and I loved it  I really enjoyed this  too  but I m not so sure I understood the significance of certain elements quite as well  Still  it was definitely worthwhile  and I d read it again  I just listened to the audio book version of this novel  to which I was introduced via the film which was made based on it in the 1970s  I guess it was this personal experience with the book that heightened my enjoyment of it  I ve always identified with the protagonist  Billy Pilgrim   because he is such a complete anti hero  he doesn t do much  but life keeps happening to him  He s a real introvert who lives in his head and stumbles through calamities  the firebombing of Dresden in 1945  a place crash in which he is one of only 2 survivors  being kidnapped by aliens from the Planet Tralfamadore   He becomes unstuck in time  drifting throughout incidents in his life in random order  much like a daydreamer or somebody suffering from dementia  Being older now  having suffered a brain injury myself  and having a large store of memories and ample time to range about them  I guess I feel a special kinship  Mark Twain said that he had survived hundreds of calamities  some of which actually happened  I identify with that too  This book is a wonderful meditation on life as a process of surviving calamities and doing so with some style  Interestingly  the Serenity Prayer makes several appearances as part or people s coping mechanism for doing this For an audio book  this was a quick listen  under 6 hours  including an interview with the author   For the fully sighted  it would be a quick read  I most highly recommend it  In the opening chapter  Vonnegut tells us he promised the wife of his war buddy that he would not glorify the war novel he was going to write  Instead we have a war book as only Vonnegut could write  full of bizarre science fiction  poignant passages  and a fantastic  but horrific  story  It s one of those books that sticks with you long after you ve read it  clinging like campfire smoke  You can t help but consider its relevance from time to time  and that is the gift of reading that which is worth being read  if only to reform stale thought and perspective  My first Vonnegut book  read in High School AP English  Sparked a passion for satire  Vonnegut at his very best   neurotic  bitter in the extreme  utterly reductionistic  shattered and an incredible advocacy of unconditional compassion   This book is my most memorable and favorite reads  Vonnegut s anti war commentary is astute and searing  His fragmentation and fantasy become the ideal vehicle for placing the reader in the mindset of the disaffected soldier  a witness to great death and destruction  Brilliant  Veldig fascinerende bok  Jeg stoppet rett som det var opp ved passasjer som matte leses om igjen fordi de var sa godt skrevet  og ofte ogsa utrolig morsomme  Boka hopper fram og tilbake i tid og sted  og krever leseokter av en viss lengde  Jeg skal definitiv lese mer Vonnegut  Slaughterhouse Five was the kind of book that just stunned me   it is full of tender and absurd images juxtaposed with realism so violent and ambivalent that it feels unreal  In reading this book  I was transported to that moral grey ground where not only do babies fight one another for reasons they don t understand  but are so damaged by the end of it that they fail to fully understand the events that happen around them  Vonnegut s real skill lies  however  not in his lyrical expression of war  but in his structural brilliance   the story flits back and forth in time as the main character  time travels   and it feels not only natural  but necessary  There are so many haunting scenes in this book that I couldn t stop thinking about it for many days afterwards  I needed time afterwards to process it  It sits somewhere in your soul  Yet expertly  the story itself is so tightly woven  with beautiful repetitions and a near perfect symmetry that  on finishing  truly feels like a full and complete journey Really  I couldn t begin to explain how purely talented Vonnegut is as an author  The best testimony is just to go and read it for yourself  Something will change in you afterwards  It s the best kind of book  OK folks  this is not a light read  but it s amazing  I read in in a couple of hours  and I loved it  The character Billy is interesting  and all in all it s just a fascinating and very special novel  I recommend it to everyone whos looking for a great classic book to read  It was definitely an interesting read  Kurt Vonnegut s direct and honest prose gave names and descriptions to places and experiences I have not and hopefully never will have to face  but the desensitized and purposefully understated personal account of Billy Pilgrim s has the desired effect  It s clear that Slaughterhouse Five leaves readers with an eery haunted yet humorous shroud that lingers for some time  The hilarious yet hilariously inappropriate content only highlights the human ness of war and makes the story so much more personal and paints war in a light that never allows it to be overshadowed by the glory and valor that muddy up a majority of the genre of novels recanting WW2  truly living up to the books alternate title  The Children s Crusade   Bloody excellent book  and that s high praise for someone who doesn t say that a lot about books published after 1950    Horrifically depressing too  of course  in that quiet  underlying way that I m particularly fond of  Great style  and very clever execution   Billy Pilgrim is unstuck in time  And it s the best thing to happen to literature since Death kindly stopped for Emily Dickenson  A re read of this classic is a must to remind me every now and then of the absurdity of existence  and of how hopeful is that very concept  I absolutely loved this   it has to be one of the best books I ve read  Although described by many as science fiction  this couldn t be further from the truth  Part memoir  part  anti  war novel  A staggering book and one I ll come back to many times  WW2   aliens   time travel The author took big risks and it payed off   I ve never thought that I d like Kurt Vonnegut s writing this much  I enjoyed his short stories but I wasn t that impressed  I m completely hooked now though  I haven t read a book concerning WWII that didn t make me cry  WWII is a part of my heritage that I just can t push aside  so it does get it every time  Well  it used to at least  Vonnegut s black humour made me laugh rather than cry  I still thought he delivered a strong message  but the day he did it was unique   I didn t mind the repeating of  So it goes   There was a clear reason behind it  and it did not in fact appear often enough to make me sick of it  I also love spare prose  It can be dry  of course  but combined with Vonnegut s sense of humour  it worked really well  I m still on the fence on whether I should give this story 4 or 5 stars  I figure  however  that the immense enjoyment I got from reading  Slaughterhouse 5  warrants a 5   Good God  what do you say about this book Do you really just comment on the supposed genius writing style of the author  Or do you simply mention his mastery of literature in black humor and satire Now  maybe Vonnegut didn t want that stuff talked about and maybe he wrote simply to get the demons out  but that is what needs to be talked about  Yes  I laughed when the dark humor hit me out of nowhere  but this book is a real look inside the trauma inflicted by warfare  In America  we compartmentalize   Oh that was a nice book  and set it aside  when the issue needs addressing  Not just the issue of physical warfare  but also spiritual conflict  And though I may not understand what Vonnegut went through  I certainly hear him and his message  This book was on my mental to read shelf for a long time before I got around to reading it  and boy am I glad that I finally did  I had high expectations of Slaughterhouse Five and it didn t disappoint  Slaughterhouse Five is a book that makes you feel and think  It does what all great books do   it offers you a chance to step into a new perspective and explore a different point of view  If contemplated properly  it might even permanently change the way you view the world  Having never read Kurt Vonnegut before  I was delighted with his prose  His writing is witty  intelligent and descriptive  I will definitely be picking up his other works at some point  All in all  I would recommend this book to almost anyone who has the ability to read the written word  I think that everyone can find something valuable in this book  I know I certainly did   I can say with no reservations that this book is one of the most powerful I have ever come across  Vonnegut s message is vivid  observant  and above all  highly clever  It explores unique ideas while still adhering to it s chief purpose  to convey a realistic and effectual message about the truths of war SH5 is without a doubt one of the most intelligently written books I ve ever read  yet it s message is delivered in a very matter of fact manner  The metaphor is not lost here  Vonnegut s intent is to recognize that war is not convoluted  it is not just  only senseless  So it goes I had a terrific experience with this book  and would gladly recommend it to any interested reader  SH5 is quite possibly the best satirical novel of it s kind  A great Sci fi novel under the guise of a great WW2 story  Very simple prose  with hidden depth that Vonnegut is so great at  Short   but a completely fulfilling story with great characters  Highly recommended for people who want to get into sci fi  By far the best book I have ever had to read for school  It was so good but just a bit confusing  That didn t make me deduct any stars though  The story line was great and the characters were splendid  I will definitely be re reading this at some point  I loved  loved  loved this book    I would definitely recommend it to someone looking for something a little different to read  I have now made a new goal to read every book written by this man    Anybody that s read them  any suggestions for the next one  Forever fave This sci fi satire on war has helped shape my views on life and made me not fear death  That being said  I probably couldn t synopsize this book to save my life  Like most Vonnegut  the ideas here are more important than the actual story  Brilliant  brilliant book Still thinking about it 2 days later Not a light read Curious if other books have used a similar timeline So it goes              Reading it again  less then a year later Blisteringly brilliant book Wow  Gave me a new understanding of the capabilities of sci fi to illustrate for you some of the deepest problems of existence  I particularly liked the viewpoint on time  It amazed me how it might be possible to experience time in other  formats   This is one of the best novels I ve ever read  though I will say I haven t read that many novels and a lot of those were not as acclaimed as this  which is considered Kurt Vonnegut s masterpiece  I ve yet to read any other of Vonnegut s books but I doubt he ll be able to top this one  It s a perfect mix of black humor  introspection  profundity  and shocking but devastatingly truthful comments on human nature  As I was reading the book my views and opinions changed several times  and I found what he was saying about time  particularly that everything has already happened and is still happening  actually quite comforting  Not that this is what Vonnegut had intended  of course The book follows Billy Pilgrim  a classic anti hero  throughout his life  though the story is told in non linear fashion and he is older in one sequence then younger the next  Vonnegut explains that this is not a strange storytelling device but rather how the concept of  time  is actually viewed from other planets  One of these planets is Tralfamadore  whose inhabitants kidnap Billy Pilgrim and a young female movie star and display them mating in a zoo  It is here Billy learns the true nature of time and begins to finally see his life the way it is actually occurring  This is the perspective from the which the story is narrated Despite the bizarre and often heavy plot  Vonnegut manages to also sneak in a few hilarious scenes as well as a powerful anti war message  particularly his graphic portrayal of torture at a concentration camp in the firebombed city of Dresden  Lest we forget  he also introduces his alter ego Kilgore Trout  an out of print science fiction writer with just two fans  Billy Pilgrim and his friend from a mental institution  Trout steals the show at a marriage party and takes on a life of his own throughout the book Overall I couldn t have liked the book more  It was a fast and entertaining read but also one that makes the reader stop and think  There were parts of the book for me where it felt like every page was a revelation   There are almost no characters in this story and no dramatic confrontations    Vonnegut notes himself  but the brilliance of the book speaks for itself  it s one of those books of life that have to be re read at certain stages of life Profound  Humorous at times and regularly absurd  but in ways that accentuate the essential lack of humanity present in war  Vonnegut writes in one of the most compelling ways one can write about such a fundamentally current matter  One of the first  science fiction  books I ever read  Really whet my appetite for the genre  Vonnegut does not sacrifice character development for quirks of plot  Surprisingly easy to follow  despite all the jumping about in time   I m definitely still feeling a lot of feelings about this book   both about war and people and the history of my country    but also about things like why write at all if you can t write like Vonnegut  So incredibly beautifully done  Is it really possible to write a laugh out loud  intellectually challenging novel about an horrific act of war  Well  it is if you re the masterful Kurt Vonnegut  You can t claim to love contemporary fiction if you haven t read this   At first the title startled me  Though I ve read one of his short stories before  so I figured it was a play on words  Along with that the cover of the book was funny  usually skulls are scary but not this one  Now red is used for good and bad  so I didn t really know how to feel about it  The comment from the Boston Globe on the front was another reason why I was interested in this book  I was sure I wanted to read this book after the New York Times said it was  Very tough and funny    sad and delightful    very Vonnegut   The first page got me hooked  The key word for me was war  Anything that has to do with war keeps my attention  Of course Vonnegut was speaking in first person because he actually was in a war   Yes it s a paradox  a fiction and non fiction  And it is maybe the best book I ve read in the last 5 yrs or in my life   The whole absurdity of writing about a bombing  the sarcasm that Vonnegut reflects on himself and the society he lives  comes out excellently in this book  Vonnegut writes short sentences   the essential  the banal  that reveals the darkness and the satire of this life  But his sarcasm does not turn into cynisicm  it crashes like a wave on a rock  into tears of sadness of how fragile we are  and how other that tiny bit more than others  So it is not only about the war  it s about human character  about being a writer  about how baffled we are  It s about subject matter one cannot write about A story about It s exactly the book for me  I ve always for some reason been drawn to fictional narratives which rely on elements of non fiction  to convey meaning and ground the story in reality  To be more specific  my tastes are sad and silly books which get at something I consider really important  Who gives a shit about middle earth  A lot of people I guess  but not me  Middle earth doesnt exist  The Tao of Pooh is another book I consider perfectly in line with my tastes and a good book for comparison  While the two are nothing alike narratively  structurally they are  They both set out to discuss important topics with originality and depth  in such a way that the reader is able to understand and interpret the story from two different angles  One angle  the easier one from which to view the story  Billy Pilgrim  the protagonist  is trapped in Germany during WW2  and as an optometrist in N Y  and on Traflamadore as an animal in a zoo  Trapped  and yet living out these moments  one by one  sometimes enjoying them  other times wishing he were dead  He s  come undone  in time and space and the story moves seamlessly from one moment to the next  describing Billy s life  or rather  how he s come to view life  From angle two  we know Billy s life is not as it seems  He s suffered a great deal  and still is suffering  even now  So it goes  I was prompted to read this book because Kurt Vonnegut s name has for some reason been cropping up a lot lately  I didn t choose Slaughterhouse Five because of the genre or because I thought the story would appeal to me in anyway  I simply wanted to know what the fuss was all about  It s everything it promises to be  a bazaar anti war novel depicting the futility and inevitability of war filled with satire towards human nature it also seems to depict a surrender and the acceptability of the lack of free will prominent through out the novel   what will be will be   so it goes     accept it  focus on the good moments and get on with it   I didn t particularly like the structure of the book although its merit towards portraying Vonnegut s message is undeniably very effective  even necessary  Right from the beginning you know how the story will end  just like the personal and individual outcomes of war  this story on a personal character level has no surprises  no winners  Vonnegut writes that   t here are almost no characters in this story  and almost no dramatic confrontations  because most he people in it are so sick and so much the listless playthings of enormous forces  One of the main effects of war  after all  is that people are discouraged from being characters   Pilgrim s time travel often reads as a series of dreams  dreams or escapes that punctuate his horrific wartime experiences  they leech the power from those atrocities by enabling the reader  and Pilgrim himself  to distance themselves from the immediacy of Pilgrim s situation and allowing the reader to reflect on the messages in the book  Vonnegut s text is disturbing  sometimes entertaining but fundamentally entertainment doesn t seem to be the object of this book  Although I can t say I enjoyed the story it is a book that I keep returning to  thinking about random passages and ideas while reflecting on Vonnegut s ability to mingle the serious with the absurd without diluting the severity of his message or the facts of the war  I m glad I ve read this book but am not convinced I will be reading any of his others  there is a lot of power in this little book and although Vonnegut s ideologies in places reflect my own  I found this book s insistent urging to challenge and question the way I see the world quite disturbing   so it goes     Total genius  I had heard of this book over and over again  yet knew nothing about it other than the fact it was a book based on World War II  I enjoy war novels  however need to be in a certain frame of mind to tackle them  So  finally  I got around to giving Slaughterhouse Five a go  Why did I wait so long  Yes  it s set in the war  particularly framed around the bombing of Dresden  but I wouldn t call it a typical war book in the slightest  Vonnegut s insight and often hilarious take on human nature  the philosophy death  the totally off the wall character of Billy Pilgram  the presense of aliens and time travel  the insight into how a pysche can fracture  the writing style and wit  all amount to a book I couldn t put down and could easily read again  I felt slight shades of Catch 22  but even that s not a fair comparison  This is much more about people and life  than war itself  Read this Slaughterhouse Five  Don t wait   It seemed an appropriate read for riding the train from Warsaw to Berlin  Riding the train backward from WWII  Vonnegut reads differently as an adult than a high schooler and was worth the revisit  The literalness fades away   My first foray into the world of Vonnegut  Upon finishing this book  I declared that I would certainly ready everything else by this author  Since making that declaration  I am less committed    Vonnegut wrote a lot  and some of it is awesome  Some of it is less awesome but still interesting  And Slaughterhouse Five is entirely awesome Part sci fi  part WWII novel  part satire  part I m not sure what else  This is the story of Billy Pilgrim   his experiences in Germany at the time of the Dresden firebombing  His experiences years later  back in America  as an optometrist  And his experiences  throughout  of time travel and imprisonment in an alien zoo on the planet Tralfamador And so it goes    I must admit that war books are not usually my thing  but I liked this one  In this novel Vonnegut grabbed the readers attention by including many characters  which allowed the readers to see that everyone had different opinions of war  Although the main character  Billy Pilgrim was definitely something else  The Author combines fantasy with realism fictionalized memoir  comedy  and horror  The book shifts time and place from paragraph to paragraph without warning  It is about aliens and WWII  It all works so perfectly  Although I believe that this book was written for adults  it is a good read for teens Slaughterhouse Five is a truly creative and incredibly entertaining book and is highly recommended   This book really resonated with me  I zoomed through it  which is pretty rare when I read classics  and I loved Vonnegut s unique brand of antiwar writing  It isn t every day you read an antiwar novel with a comical twist  and time travel  Half the time I didn t know whether to laugh or cry  and the other half of the time I was doing one or the other  Humor  the frame story  the bizarre sci fi aspect  certain repeated phrases  metaphors  comparisons  all were arrows pointing to one resounding moral conclusion  It is clear that the author s purpose is decidedly pacifist  but he doesn t let the teaching of a lesson get in the way of an interesting story and captivating novel  with developed characters   One of those books I have to read every couple of years to restore my balance Don t ask me why wallowing in the unpredictability and uncaring nature of the universe restores my balance but well there you go   As though a bed time story  Kurt Vonnegut illustrates the splintered life of Billy Pilgrim  who experiences time as broken fragments  Billy Pilgrim is portrayed as a World War II veteran  prisoner of war survivor of the firebombing of Dresden  optometrist  husband  and father  Through the confusion of events  Billy also portrays the role of a human on Tralfamadore in a zoo where he is accompanied by Montana Wildhack  As the author of Slaughterhouse Five  Kurt Vonnegut does a phenomenal job through the use of mystery  hope  and meaning  Kurt Vonnegut places the reader within the story through the wanting to understand the concepts taught within the feature  As a reader  I gained the experience of reflection as I not only longed to understand the many lessons of time  but also as I was given the chance to reflect upon the simple meanings of life so often defined throughout the story  The most important thing I learned on Tralfamadore was that when a person dies he only appears to die  He is still very much alive in the past  so it is very silly for people to cry at his funeral  All moments  past  present  and future  always have existed  always will exist  As a lesson portrayed by Kurt Vonnegut  the reader is introduced to the unimagined ideas of time and evolution  The story line is portrayed as a brilliant story  but it is simply the lessons and concepts sparked from the book that separates the significance from most other books I have read  While reading Slaughterhouse Five  I felt there to almost be a responsibility to take notes concerning these brilliant lessons  as though I were to prepare for some final exam awaiting me near the end of life  as though these lessons may be used to guide the path and choices one takes Compared to most books I have read  Slaughterhouse Five was the first book I longed to revisit and learn from since it does not simply tell the story of a war veteran  but Kurt Vonnegut writes a story that always has and always will outline the complete entity of reason  Demasiado gracioso para ser cierto  Asi fue  So it goes  so it goes  so it goes  so it goes   La trama de este libro es afanoso  por no decir imposible  de clasificar  Por un lado esta el contexto historico  una trama de La Segunda Guerra Mundial  y lo que fue el bombardeo de Dresde  Hecho poco conocido y realmente catastrofico   tal vez sea un cuento de ciencia ficcion y de viajes en el tiempo  o por otro lado ser una autobiografia de la vida de Bill Pilgrim     Dificil de clasificar no  Juntemos todos estos factores en un libro  le anexamos la idea del  Eterno Retorno  de Friedrich Nietzsche y lo salpicamos con dos toneladas de humor negro  y algo asi seria el resultado  Este libro es una maravilla  te gusta o no  aqui no existen puntos medios  El tiempo es ciclico por lo que puede resultar dificil de entender  pero te vas adaptando rapido a esta manera tan peculiar de escribir de Kurt Vonnegut  Sin lugar a dudas una novela completamente antibelicista  extrana  surrealista y atipica como interesante  Asi es  WW2   aliens   time travel The author took big risks and it payed off   I ve never thought that I d like Kurt Vonnegut s writing this much  I enjoyed his short stories but I wasn t that impressed  I m completely hooked now though  I haven t read a book concerning WWII that didn t make me cry  WWII

the serious with the absurd without diluting the severity of his message or the facts of the war  I m glad I ve read this book but am not convinced I will be reading any of his others  there is a lot of power in this little book and although Vonnegut s ideologies in places reflect my own  I found this book s insistent urging to challenge and question the way I see the world quite disturbing   so it goes     Total genius  I had heard of this book over and over again  yet knew nothing about it other than the fact it was a book based on World War II  I enjoy war novels  however need to be in a certain frame of mind to tackle them  So  finally  I got around to giving Slaughterhouse Five a go  Why did I wait so long  Yes  it s set in the war  particularly framed around the bombing of Dresden  but I wouldn t call it a typical war book in the slightest  Vonnegut s insight and often hilarious take on human nature  the philosophy death  the totally off the wall character of Billy Pilgram  the presense of aliens and time travel  the insight into how a pysche can fracture  the writing style and wit  all amount to a book I couldn t put down and could easily read again  I felt slight shades of Catch 22  but even that s not a fair comparison  This is much more about people and life  than war itself  Read this Slaughterhouse Five  Don t wait   It seemed an appropriate read for riding the train from Warsaw to Berlin  Riding the train backward from WWII  Vonnegut reads differently as an adult than a high schooler and was worth the revisit  The literalness fades away   My first foray into the world of Vonnegut  Upon finishing this book  I declared that I would certainly ready everything else by this author  Since making that declaration  I am less committed    Vonnegut wrote a lot  and some of it is awesome  Some of it is less awesome but still interesting  And Slaughterhouse Five is entirely awesome Part sci fi  part WWII novel  part satire  part I m not sure what else  This is the story of Billy Pilgrim   his experiences in Germany at the time of the Dresden firebombing  His experiences years later  back in America  as an optometrist  And his experiences  throughout  of time travel and imprisonment in an alien zoo on the planet Tralfamador And so it goes    I must admit that war books are not usually my thing  but I liked this one  In this novel Vonnegut grabbed the readers attention by including many characters  which allowed the readers to see that everyone had different opinions of war  Although the main character  Billy Pilgrim was definitely something else  The Author combines fantasy with realism fictionalized memoir  comedy  and horror  The book shifts time and place from paragraph to paragraph without warning  It is about aliens and WWII  It all works so perfectly  Although I believe that this book was written for adults  it is a good read for teens Slaughterhouse Five is a truly creative and incredibly entertaining book and is highly recommended   This book really resonated with me  I zoomed through it  which is pretty rare when I read classics  and I loved Vonnegut s unique brand of antiwar writing  It isn t every day you read an antiwar novel with a comical twist  and time travel  Half the time I didn t know whether to laugh or cry  and the other half of the time I was doing one or the other  Humor  the frame story  the bizarre sci fi aspect  certain repeated phrases  metaphors  comparisons  all were arrows pointing to one resounding moral conclusion  It is clear that the author s purpose is decidedly pacifist  but he doesn t let the teaching of a lesson get in the way of an interesting story and captivating novel  with developed characters   One of those books I have to read every couple of years to restore my balance Don t ask me why wallowing in the unpredictability and uncaring nature of the universe restores my balance but well there you go   As though a bed time story  Kurt Vonnegut illustrates the splintered life of Billy Pilgrim  who experiences time as broken fragments  Billy Pilgrim is portrayed as a World War II veteran  prisoner of war survivor of the firebombing of Dresden  optometrist  husband  and father  Through the confusion of events  Billy also portrays the role of a human on Tralfamadore in a zoo where he is accompanied by Montana Wildhack  As the author of Slaughterhouse Five  Kurt Vonnegut does a phenomenal job through the use of mystery  hope  and meaning  Kurt Vonnegut places the reader within the story through the wanting to understand the concepts taught within the feature  As a reader  I gained the experience of reflection as I not only longed to understand the many lessons of time  but also as I was given the chance to reflect upon the simple meanings of life so often defined throughout the story  The most important thing I learned on Tralfamadore was that when a person dies he only appears to die  He is still very much alive in the past  so it is very silly for people to cry at his funeral  All moments  past  present  and future  always have existed  always will exist  As a lesson portrayed by Kurt Vonnegut  the reader is introduced to the unimagined ideas of time and evolution  The story line is portrayed as a brilliant story  but it is simply the lessons and concepts sparked from the book that separates the significance from most other books I have read  While reading Slaughterhouse Five  I felt there to almost be a responsibility to take notes concerning these brilliant lessons  as though I were to prepare for some final exam awaiting me near the end of life  as though these lessons may be used to guide the path and choices one takes Compared to most books I have read  Slaughterhouse Five was the first book I longed to revisit and learn from since it does not simply tell the story of a war veteran  but Kurt Vonnegut writes a story that always has and always will outline the complete entity of reason  Demasiado gracioso para ser cierto  Asi fue  So it goes  so it goes  so it goes  so it goes   La trama de este libro es afanoso  por no decir imposible  de clasificar  Por un lado esta el contexto historico  una trama de La Segunda Guerra Mundial  y lo que fue el bombardeo de Dresde  Hecho poco conocido y realmente catastrofico   tal vez sea un cuento de ciencia ficcion y de viajes en el tiempo  o por otro lado ser una autobiografia de la vida de Bill Pilgrim     Dificil de clasificar no  Juntemos todos estos factores en un libro  le anexamos la idea del  Eterno Retorno  de Friedrich Nietzsche y lo salpicamos con dos toneladas de humor negro  y algo asi seria el resultado  Este libro es una maravilla  te gusta o no  aqui no existen puntos medios  El tiempo es ciclico por lo que puede resultar dificil de entender  pero te vas adaptando rapido a esta manera tan peculiar de escribir de Kurt Vonnegut  Sin lugar a dudas una novela completamente antibelicista  extrana  surrealista y atipica como interesante  Asi es  So it goesA classic of American literature  Vonnegut is an all time favorite of mine  and he should be one of yours  Read this book  I read through this in less than 24 hours  one of the greatest books I ever read  Its witty  funny  clever and so many other superlatives  Poo tee weet  A masterpiece which is really difficult to explain   a pungently artistic experience  with an amazing language and style  Fell in love with Vonnegut  just wow  One of the best books I have ever read about war Along with THE THINGS THEY CARRIED  But subtle  and complex  Disturbing imagery  For mature readers   Simply great  Everybody should read this  a completely different satirical view on war  Briliant humor hides really deep ideas about war  life and much else  The narrative structure of this book is such a powerful act of imagination  it just never leaves you  An eloquent expression of horror at our inhumanity   please visit Weighing A Pig Doesn t Fatten it for more reviews A VIOLENT LIGHT AND A HUMFirst thing first  this is no science fiction book  It s a book about human life  war and the non existence of free will  The time travel elements are a metaphorical narrative device to convey a sense of being mentally disoriented  among other things  The science fiction elements are metaphorical as well  and the book explicitly talks about SF in that regard  So  I would rather qualify this book as a novel in the grotesque tradition  All this doesn t mean a SF fan shouldn t read this short  quick book  because  well  you should  Slaughterhouse   Five is brilliant  It remains very fresh   crisp  it s creative  poetic and captivating  contains highly imaginative imagery  and makes very  very sharp and deep observations about  well  a lot of things Vonnegut manages to both convey feelings of dread  meaninglessness and cynicism  and at the same time keep up the wonderous joy of life via a healthy dose of absurdism and lightheartedness  While the book certainly has a message and Vonnegut is very open about his viewpoints  he doesn t fall in the trap of making his Dresden book a moral sermon  It doesn t try to be serious  it just presents things as they are  In that way  it had the same feel as the 3 war books from the 40ies and early 50ies by famous Belgian writer and Nobelprice contender Louis Paul Boon   masterpieces as well  all three translated in English as My Little War  Chapel Road and Summer in Termuren  Let me end with a quote by one of the book s aliens  describing their literature to the protagonist  Obviously  the quote is meta  but not annoyingly so  since it s so brutally honest and upfront about it  There isn t any particular relationship between all the messages  except that the author has chosen them carefully  so that  when seen all at once  they produce an image of life that is beautiful and surprising and deep  There is no beginning  no middle  no end  no suspense  no moral  no cause  no effects  What we love in our books are the depths of many marvelous moments seen all at one time  Needless to say  I believe Kurt Vonnegut succeeded splendidly by the standards of his own mission statement 5 5PS   I wouldn t call this an anti war book at all  By Vonnegut s own admission  he could ve just as well written an anti glacier book  And so it goes  Hilarious and sad  Beautifully depressing  if I ever am severely traumatized and lose my shit I hope a book like this will be written about me  One of my all time favourite books  read when I was 15  and I like to think therefore it hada big influence on me  I m sure I had certainly never read anything like it before  I went on to read everything KV ever wrote  I know people who can t handle the ridiculous elements of his writing but to me it is a perfect satire of the paradox that human beings are capable of extreme cruelty yet also great compassion and love  The fact that Vonnegut remained so compassionate towards his fellow humans after what he experienced in Dresden  and the war in general  is a lesson on the importance of retaining our humanity even in the face of great  dare I say  evil  I had never read this before so I just grabbed it for a plane ride  I was not disappointed  This book was a real milestone  along with Catch 22  in the books that use black humor to explore the horrors of war  Pretty much created a whole new motif or mini genre  and very well done It starts off a bit slow but once you get into the story of Billy Pilgrim it becomes both humorous and deeply touching at the same time It may be a bit dated for younger generations  but it still hit home with me I did find the  so it goes  thing a bit annoying after a while  but I guess that was really part of the point he was trying to make  mjry srbzy amrykhyy dr

Crusade  was like riding a roller coaster The narration is very unique  A non linear time travel fantasy war book   This is one of a kind  Mind that this book was written in 1969  so it goes It starts of with the writer convincing the readers that the theme of this book wont be similar to other war glorifying fictional classics  This is a non fictional fantasy satirical       hence you can put this book into many categories  This book is for all generations  The theme of this book is about the fallout of war  It portraits a new evil side of the war  So it goes Whenever we Google WW2   the top hit will definitely mention the holocaust  Nazi  Gestapo  pearl harbor  London bombing  Hiroshima  Axis  Allied  Poland  Communism  East and West Germany  Hitler  Mussolini   Panzers  Submarines  spies  Iwo Jima  Inglorious basterds etc   But there is no mention about the friendly fire  No one cared about the idiot who gave the firing order without deliberating  No one discussed the killing of the friendly fire  So it goes In this book  we see the war from the eye of a Private who shouldn t be in the war in first place  He is immature and very emotional  A weakling recruited by US army stuck in the friendly fire zone  I flinch at the thought of what would happen if I was in that situation  Will I be cursing my own people or I will be praising them after winning the war  His time travel and abduction by aliens  So it goes Tralfamadorians  as the author calls the aliens  I like them and their logic about how they see the time  They see time as snapshot and they pick a good snapshot and live in that moment  So it goes Author uses  So it goes  phrase many times in this book  He places them brilliantly whenever there is a change in scenario  death  comic  satire etc  So it goes  themonkey Why am I just discovering Vonnegut  This book is positively human and sometimes I felt like I was listening to it rather than just reading it   Wow  what a great take on WWII and the Holocaust  It s serious and has a lot of social commentary yet really funny  Beautiful piece of literature  Mi hatvats kar  orowm amerikats i nats ist generale nkaragrowm e  t e inch pisin e ir eowt yamb amerikats in  Amen inch  arzher  mer aysore haskanalow hamar  Every time I read Kurt Vonnegut I remember that there are no rules when it comes to writing  Those who say there are need to read Slaughterhouse 5  Great book  Full of dark humour  historical events  and science fiction  The writing style is so easy to read that I flew through it  I read this book when I was 15  1993  and had little to no appreciation for it  Now that I am 35 and have seen what war can do  this book has a whole new meaning and influence  Vonnegut writes almost as if his passages are written for social media   across times and places  He has thoughts that we are scared to tell   the idea of marrying a plump woman is ok because it is a good life  The imagery places you at the scene where you can feel the emotions of the soldiers  sense their disillusion and fear  and almost smell the prisoner trains and rotten corpses  I highly recommend this read  Vonnegut was ahead of his time  So it goes  Another book that was impossible to put down and not be affected by  After this I read many Vonnegut books and none disappointed   Amazing  Death  life  war  and yet everything is so simple Just read it  and you ll see Everything was beautiful  and nothing hurt  One of my all time favorite books  Clever and extremely insightful  This book truly moves me as well as making me laugh hysterically  This book was amazing  Just brilliant  It s been a long time since a work of fiction has impacted me in the way that this one has   i made my book club read this  it s hysterical  heartbreaking  and historical  plus  it s a good anti war book to read these days  Bizarre  but easy and fascinating to read  The book is a quick read and  So it goes   which apparently was written 106 times in the book   Oh man  Vonnegut is the best  Okay not the best but oh man  Vonnegut is awesome  So sweet and so sad and so funny and so weird  Vonnegut s dark humor satire is blended with both sci fi and historical elements to create the classic we know and love today  This was the first Vonnegut novel I ever read  and it didn t disappoint  His erratic narrative pulses with so many provocative and poignant thoughts about humanity and government and violence and war  Although I can t sit here and write that I understood everything about the book  that I know exactly what makes Vonnegut great instead of crazy  I can still say that he made me think very deeply about what it means to be a writer and about war in general  and for that  this deserves 5 stars   Motto  There is nothing intelligent to say about a massacre Notes completed from the study guide  http   books google nl books id Gc_SL    So it goes  follows every mention of death  no matter its nature  death is equally important regardless the cause  and death goes on after the war   Death is inevitable  and there is a feeling of frivolity that emerges from the way it is said  probably related to the Tralfamadorian idea that nothing can stop existing  and you can revive anything through time travel  to which humans don t have access yet     Attitude towards death  acceptance  sorrow  humour  outrage  The despair over the insanity of war is emphasised by the glacier metaphor  You can stop a war just as much as you can stop a glacier  And if they didn t exist  there would still be the plain old death  So it goes  StructureThe subtitle of the book  The Children s Crusade  manages to   debugle with terrible efficiency the widespread macho images of heroic soldierhood    P  Freeze  Moreover  he reminds us that humans have a long history of cruelty  from the crusades in the Middle Ages  thousands of children have been recruited to go from Europe to Palestine to protect the holy land  to the war in Vietnam The disjointed narrative  structure  is nevertheless easy to follow  Could he have written about all the things in the novel using linear  Aristotelian narrative  beginning  middle  end   It is a   juxtaposition of absurdist irony  We see the use of the stream of counsciousness technique  pioneered by Joyce  Faulkner  Virginia Woolf     the past is revived through memory  the present is revived through perception and the future through anticipation  The novel is anticipative  and rather anti climatic  no suspense   Billy knows how he is going to die  Paul Lazzaro   he knows how the universe will end and unveils an important event easily at the beginning of the novel  Edgar Derby dies for taking a tea pot that wasn t his   It is a   bewildering blending of fact and fiction   P  Freeze  The first chapter  about the creation of the novel  makes the novel a metafictional work  The novel is highly subjective    All of this happened  more or less   At the same time  the first chapter of the novel also makes it a frame story  as it is   a fictional story within an autobiography  All notes above demonstrate that the novel belongs to the Postmodernist movement in arts Themes    Major themes  time  death  war  mental illnessThe theme of time and time travel Time doesn t point in a single direction  past to future     Listen  Billy Pilgrim has come unstuck in time   SF that anticipates the findings of Stephen Hawking The Bible  Judeo Christian Bible  and its moral   Before you kill somebody  make absolutely sure he isn t well connected   Billy has been compared by some critics  W R Allen  with Jesus  They both bring the message than one should accept his death with calm  It wasn t that Christ didn t die on the cross  but that he accepted his death and  in this way  defeated mortality  The biblical theme is also reflected by his name  Pilgrim   Another reference is the correspondence between the couple Montana   Billy  and Adam and Eve  Billy is expelled from the zoo   garden after he learns of the true nature of time and space for conscious beings  The theme of schizophrenia and mental illness  escaping reality  through hallucinations   in the war  Billy becomes unstuck in time for the first time  probably as a response to the unbearable ordeal  He is then abducted by the Tralfamadorians  where he escapes his banal wife and life to be with Montana Wildhack and have a baby  Billy links the experiences of the war with those of civilian life  the team of Austrians who come to rescue him is mistaken for German soldiers The war    this is an anti war book  and especially a book opposing the war in Vietnam and trying to tear down the glamourous  full of heroism image of war that was being promoted in the media  This is a novel about the gap between the technological advance of the human race and the human ability to meet the same level spiritually  The references to Sinatra and Wayne are meant as a critique to films like Sands of Iwo Jima and from Here to Eternity  which present the soldiers as masculine  maverick heroes  Death  or fatality and futility of life  Life against death in life  Tralfamadore is an anagram of FATAL DREAM Historical context or mentionsKurt Vonnegut Junior was 22 when he was captured during Bulge Battle at Luxembourg  the last great German counteroffensive  aiming to re capture Antwerpen  and that took place on the Belgian  Ardennes  front and the front in Luxembourg  The battle itself was a very hard fight for the Allies  during a harsh winter  However  Vonnegut didn t get to go through a lot of the battle  because he was captured on the 3rd day  That is why he isn t talking too much about it either  Kurt Vonnegut is  a German American who had strong anti German sentiments as a Cornell Studend and then survived  ironically  the destruction of Dresden by the Allies as and American Soldier in German captivity  thus cannot but ssume a meditating stance Dresden Firebombing was a controversy attack over Dresden that caused the deaths of at least 135 000 civilians  although the city didn t have military importance  so the attack had no tactical value  In 14 hours  there were 3 000 tons of incendiary explosives dropped over the city  Vonnegut calls it   the greatest massacre in European history   since the number of deaths was around the sum of those of Tokio and Hiroshima Nagasaki  The Vietnam War  the second one  the American War  was taking place when the book was published  There are many references to this war  the most important being the Green Berets  the popular name of the US Special Forces   a military organisation that Robert  the son of Billy  belongs to  KV takes an ironical stance towards the WWII veterans whose sons enroll in the American Army to fight in the next war  A cycle of war seems to engender another The Children s Crusade    in 1213  30 000 children were recruited and sent to Palestine to defend the holy land in the name of Christianity  None made it to Jerusalem  they died or were enslaved en route the firestorm in Tokion and the nuclear bombing of Hiroshima Nagasaki CharactersBilly Pilgrim    Like the author  he is born in 1922 and he is murdered in Chicago on February 13  1976  seven years after the publication of the novel and on the anniversary of the Dresden Firestorm  He is a   fully realized  schizophrenic persona  He is an optician  As a veteran of war  he should symbolically make other people see right  but he is unable to  Billy is not trying to moralize the story  He is not just talking about it  he witnessed it    I was there      or    That was I  That was me  That was the author of this book   Roland Weary    indeed weary  but not really a RolandPaul Lazarro    symbol for the fact that the experiences of the war will always haunt you and might kill you even long after the war  when you expect it the less Valencia    parody of consumerism  All the women in the book are seen as machines for making babies  just like all men become numbers   a count of corpses created by military science   Another similar mention is how the Germans see the cars of prisoners of war as machines that turn air and food into feces and language  The real Vonnegut tells his sons not to work for companies that make war machinery and to express contempt for people who think we need machinery like that Billy s son    see abovethe Tralfamadorians    look like a plumber s friend  a household tool for unclogging pipes   being symbol of the apparently superior consciousness or knowledge they offer to Billy  their role being to cleanse the perception of the protagonist  Related booksJourney to the end of the night by Celine  about the WWI Catch 22  by HellerCritical receptionThe book was very successful  not only because it described atrocities the Americans hadn t really known about  but also because it was offering a strong anti war message at the height of the Vietnam war Critics tend to confuse Billy s  or the Tralfamadorian  way of looking at the world  which is hopeless fatalism  with the author s position  Albeit Billy and Pilgrim share some biographical data  the character is inspired by a comrade  and V makes it clear during the novel that he is not Billy  It is also hard to believe that Vonnegut would want us to find right a schizophrenic s view of the world  including his ideas about free will   Isn t this what war actually was  Aren t the Tralfamadorians the same as the ruthless powers that were driving the war  treating people as animals or useless  powerless entities  trying to rid them of free will  Vonnegut wants to warn us agains the perils in believing in fatality  in that we can t do anything to stop war  He humanises the characters  but he reveals the fact there are enormous deterministic forces that transform all the novel s characters in playthings  or even machines    so sick and so much the listless playthings of enormous forces    We have to keep in mind that this is a satire  and that Vonnegut looked at his readers as if they were performers  and   limiting factors  at the same time The stance of K V  is seemingly impartial towards the men on the front lines  whom he is actually humanising  He knows that innocent people were dying on both sides     That V 1 s and V 2 s were at the very time falling an England  killing civilian men  women  and children indiscriminately    but he speaks against the greater forces that drive wars At the end  we don t hear the bombs exploding  but the birds chirping  Poo Tee Weet                       Quotations and other ideas  God grant me the serenity to adapt to the things I cannot change  courage to change the things that I can change  and wisdom always to tell the difference   Among the things that Billy could not change were the past  the present  and the future        Dresden has happened  is happening and will always happen      We lose the good moments easier than the bad ones  Humans find it easy to think that the good things come to an end  but we can look at things differently  the bad things  the atrocities  can t be erased  they support the Tralfamadorian theory  they can be seen like stretches of mountains  and they will always exist    Earthlings are great explainers  I am a Tralfamadosian  seeing all time as you might see a strech of the Rocky Mountains  All time is all time  It does not change  It does not lend itself to warnings and explanations  It simply is  Take it moment by moment and you will find that we are all  as I ve said before  bugs in amber  Mentions of Space Time travel  time warps and the speed of light    The doctors agreed  he was going crazy  They didn t think it had anything to do with the war  They were sure Billy was going to pieces because his father had thrown him into the deep end of the YMCA swimming pool when he was a little boy  and had taken him to the rim of the Grand Canyon    They both found life meaningless partly because of what they had seen in the war        Billy had seen the greatest massacre in Europe s history  which was the firebombing of Dresden  So it goes  They were trying to reinvent themselves and their universe  Science fiction was a big help    We had forgotten wars were fought by babies        It s the Children s Crusade    The visitor from outer space made a serious study of Christianity  to learn  if he could  why Christians found it so easy to be cruel    You needn t worry about bombs  by the way  Dresden is an open city  It is undefended  and contains no war industries or troop concentrations of any importance   Do you remember finale of Star Trek the Next Generation in which Picard s consciousness keeps switching to different times during his life  That s essentially this book  All glibness aside  I found this book creative and fascinating  Conceptually  I really enjoyed getting to know Billy Pilgrim as he became  unstuck in time  from one point in his life to another  How did he come into this  Either Billy suffered a mental breakdown  or he was abducted by aliens and taught to experience life as a whole rather than sequentially  Vonnegut never explicitly says which it is  I lean toward the former explanation  but given Vonnegut s proclivity for the absurd  I can t discount the latter  It was shortly after reading Slaughterhouse Five that I realized I want to study English Literature for the rest of my life   Slaughterhouse Five can be a bit difficult to read at first  but as the timelines weave and come together  everything absurdly starts making some sense  That being said  though  I can understand why some readers dislike the book  it s erratic and bizarre and illogical    but maybe that s the whole point  Reading Vonnegut is definitely an acquired taste  one that only strengthens with time  patience  and maybe a little exposure to some of his other works  All in all  Slaughterhouse Five is definitely worth a read  I found the book to be quite enjoyable and liked the author s black humor and wry satire  I first read this kind of plot in Elif Shafak s novels  doesn t mean that she is the inventor  But I do amazed by this kind of plot  The layers are like my mother s cake  And it s so delicious  1st  a struggle writer in his process of writing his experience during WW2 into a novel which he names as The Slaughterhouse Five2nd  Billy Pilgrim s before during after WW2 lifeBilly is Vonnegut s  the narrator  character  It s pretty much like a novel within a novel  While the narrator s life is depicted in a very realistic form  Billy s story is told in a science fiction kind of thing  3rd  Billy s traveling to the Trafalmadorian s planet  So  Billy is a time traveler by now  which is still a great debate in our American novel class either he tells the truth or he s just being delusional  So it goes  Poo tee weet  This book was not at ALL what I was expecting  For years the title and authors name intimidated me   Slaughterhouse Five  sounds incredibly heavy and unforgiving  The authors name   Kurt Vonnegut   conjures the image of a stalwart German man that wears his military uniform recreationally and whose baseline speaking voice is shouting Turns out   Slaughterhouse Five  is an easy  quick read with lots of humor that you re kind of scared to laugh at  I didn t expect such silly language at times  he uses the word  wang   For real  and it to be so satirical  Billy Pilgrim travelling through time  getting abducted by aliens  This is not at all what I was expecting The book itself is outstanding  Remarkably structured  funny  and with a poignant message   A classic  and vocal of many different subjects than just eh bombing of Dresden in WWII  To be honest  before reading this  I had no idea what it was like  I thought the book would be dry with history  I was delighted when I was two chapters in and wasn t  The first  and last  chapters of the book are told differently than the middle of the novel  in the sense that Vonnegut is speaking directly to the reader  and the story of Billy Pilgrim isn t exactly progressing The rest of the book is NOT like that  and is deserved to be read by all  It s a short read too  and without excuse to be finished within a week  The anniversary of the bombing of Dresden was as good an excuse as any to revisit this  Some reviews have been longer than the book itself  which as with many Vonnegut books has a combination of fact  fiction and science fiction mixed together   and the split time narrative is a major factor in the strength of the book   the straight WWII pieces  post war resettling and sci fi Tralfamadore  to highlight certain themes  flip together meaning that themes and big points don t feel laboured and can pack a punch It may be considered his signature book  but it s not Vonnegut s best   but it is very  very good  Salughterhouse Five is one of the best war books I have ever read  It manages to convey the utter horror of warfare and still make you laugh  Following Billy Pilgrim  an inept soldier in the Second World War  the author takes us from the Bombing of Dresden to a zoo in outer space  as Billy is not only a time traveller but also a prisoner held by the fourth dimensional Tralfamadorians  Although on the surface it may seem like a silly science fiction  Vonnegut is able to mix the absurd and very serious into a tale that confronts the aftermath of war on the people that survive and those that die  So it goes This book will stick with you long after reading    Asa merg lucrurile

to the boobs or you will miss out on some important context   Aside from that  it is the peerless tale of war torn Billy Pilgrim who witnessed the firebombing of Dresden  has become unstuck in time and sorta flashes all over the place in a Virginia Woolf esque type of narrative WTF  This story contains aliens  porn stars  optometry and PTSD  It is also a grand and moving tale underneath what appears to be a lot of absurd nonsense  Gotcha People don t really die in this book  they just pass away  So it goes   It s difficult not to like this book  I laughed and cried  often from the same page  always at the wrong thing  It s an incredible book  All those ideas about life  time and inevitableness of death  And so it goes  My third Vonnegut  Unsure if I would consider it my favourite Vonnegut so far  I think I just might  Kurt s unique writing style is credited to his war time endeavors  at least that is my conclusion  this book  Novel has always sounded a bit childish  is taking a very sarcastic approach to the philosophy of life  Kurt relates himself to many of the things in this book  the underlying themes contain humanity  life  and personality  again  many of the things in this book are literal imprints of his life  I strongly enjoyed this book  as he spoils  surprises  and makes us laugh  at the terrible existence we have somehow managed to call  Humanity  Sit down  get a nice breeze  and read a good book  Slaughterhouse Five is a daring comedy of the soul  It s narrative in a narrative portrays a world where everyone acts like a fool and everything that has happened  will have happened and is happening all at once  this will make sense once you read the book   The actual story is a riveting adventure through the eyes of a WW2 veteran recounting the life and times of another veteran  named Billy Pilgrim  It is almost impossible to characterize the experience of the work without reading it yourself  What can be said  however  is that it is a grim and foolish view of humanity in times of war and times of boredom  Took about a third to get into but became utterly gripping  Easily one o the best books I have ever read   khtb fntzy w Tnz syh jlby st khh khml dr fDy dbyt mdrn amrykhst mn wq  wnh gt r dwst drm Probably my favorite book of all time  All at once it is funny  sad  thought provoking  absurd and exciting  This was a re read  It was probably about ten years ago I first read it and I remember liking the book a lot but not much else Around 30 or 40 pages in I had the impression that while I was enjoying the book  perhaps my younger self had over esteemed it And then I read the rest of the book and it turns out it s pretty much perfect  Vonnegut is sparse and flippant with a subject that is others must surely treat with reverence but his style allows not only the writing of a unique book but also for him to land some of the most incredible blows against war  religion and the arbitrary cruelty of mankind Wonderful  Sometimes I felt I was reading a witty essay or memoir rather than a novel  Still  I enjoyed Vonnegut s amazing creativity and wit and look forward to reading Breakfast of Champions or Galapagos  Here  Vonnegut  citing Irving s The Destruction of Dresden  once considered to be an authoritative account  suggested that 135 000 people died in the Dresden air raids  and we now believe that far fewer  20 000 according to Wikipedia  died  This unfortunate exaggeration makes me worry that Slaughterhouse Five may contain other misleading suggestions as well   Yes  I realize air raids are hellish whether the fatalities were 20 000 or 135 000   This book is a mixture of war and Sci Fi novel I really enjoyed  and highly recommended it A novel that centres on the bombing of Dresden and the surreal time shifts and experiences of Billy Pilgrim s life told in flashback episodes mixed up with his rantings about Aliens and Tralfamadore Billy to a certain extent has a normal life  he has married and raised children but his life is taken over and consumed between elements of sci fi novels  wartime experiences and other mixed up ideas after a breakdown and subsequent incarceration in a mental hospital The whole novel deals with the theme of the effects of war  the atrocities that are committed and how that affects the human psyche Well written with some horrific details of war and a man s slow descent into madness   I cannot remember why I suddenly decided to read Slaughterhouse Five  I think I might have seen an article written about it  or perhaps the bombing of Dresden during World War II that mentioned it  Whatever it might have been it was enough to capture my interest and I picked it up I had heard about the book before  after all it is the type of title that stands out  Slaughterhouse 5 or The Children s Crusade A Duty Dance with Death In the real world author Vonnegut was a member of a group of American prisoners of war  who were put to work in the German city of Dresden  They were present during the Allied bombing of the city  something the writer claims with some justification  was more devastating and horrendous than the atomic blast that destroyed Hiroshima The only reason he and his fellows survived was that  with the lack of any proper accommodation  Vonnegut and his fellows were given quarters in an disused abattoir  Schlachthof funf Obviously telling such a story would be no easy task  so Vonnegut weaves the truth that he witnessed into a tale that can only be described as Science Fiction  but it is much more than that working in a number of different ways that as a piece of writing is quite extraordinary Ostensibly it is the story of Billy Pilgrim  a young man who goes to war  Through a series of events  mostly unfortunate he finds himself as a prisoner  ending up in Dresden during the bombing  where we are informed by the author that he was there  a shadowy figure in the background  But it is more than that as Pilgrim is a man unstuck in time  According to him he was will be abducted by aliens  Aliens who see time differently to our constricted linear perception  where it flows forward  To them time is open  a place where everything happens all at once  where death is just something that happens  but it is not all the end as your life is something that happens simultaneously  Someone might be dead  but you still see them    If that makes any sense at all   Vonnegut explains it so much better Through this method we are shown all of Pilgrim s life  as he pulls us to different parts of his life  allowing us to see it all  in what might seem to us Earthlings a disjointed manner  but it complete by the time you finish the novel  with Dresden being the centre piece So we see his early years  his marriage and his career  his time at war  his success and failures  his time abducted by aliens and his death  So it goes There is more to it though  The first chapter is Vonnegut telling us what is to come  How fictitious this part of the book is  is open to question  but it concludes with the writer telling you how the book will begin and how it will end  Quite incredible The book is definitely a modern classic  well written but in a style that it can almost call it s own  For myself  even never reading it many of the character names were familiar   Billy Pilgrim  Roland Weary and Kilgore Trout   a pulp science fiction author who appears in a number of Vonnegut s novels For such a short read it is crammed full of material  without ever feeling crammed  something that perhaps shows a master at work  and something that many would be writers could learn from  Also sitting on my too read pile I have David Mitchell s Cloud Atlas  another book that plays fast and loose with chronological narrative  it will be interesting to see how the two of them compare But in this instance  the small scale story paints an evocative picture  and shows a moment of war history that is horrendous  conveying that horror without the need for graphic description  just how it was as a group of survivors crawled out of their bunker and saw just what modern warfare could do to the man made world around them  So it goes  One of my favorite books  Aliens  time travel  alternate dimensions as a critique of war  Badass Tengo una deuda moral con este libro  Me salvo el alma en el momento mas indicado   Read this book  Any impression i give you or review i try and give will not do it justice  Read it Resenha aqui http   lualimaverde wordpress com 201    I was interested in Kurt Vonnegut as a science fiction writer  I d only heard his name in passing from other science fiction authors  so I picked up  Slaughterhouse Five  not knowing what to expect I need to stop doing that  Slaughterhouse Five  is brilliantly horrifying  beautifully appalling  The style is graceful and scattered  like a barely remembered nightmare or overheard secrets The narrative is compelling and repulsive at the same time  It is not for the light reader  or the delicate stomach  It depicts war as it is  ugly  filthy  as unavoidable as it is appalling  Having read Vonnegut s letters  had to rereread Slaughterhouse Five  Still great  Great book Took me forever to finish it  ought to read it after a few years again    Five stars from the one trapped in the amber of this Vonnegut reading moment  So it goes  Classic  This is the first Vonnegut book I ever read and needless to say I was hooked  I might have read this thirty years ago  I definitely read it last week  Glad I did  I couldn t put it down  I seriously want to read it again  Right now   Loistavaa  Kerrassaan loistavaa   Everything was beautiful  and nothing hurt   Once in a while there comes a book whose ending saddens you   because it ended  Because the unique experience of you reading it for the first time evaporated  Gone  This is one of those books  The weirdest thing  it is about nothing in particular  Sure there is the bombing of Dresden  but there are also aliens  optometrists  time travel  plane crashes and other things  Sprinkled with pearls of wisdom like   It is in fact a crime for an American to be poor  even though America is a nation of poor  Every other nation has folk traditions of men who were poor but extremely wise and virtuous  and therefore more estimable than anyone with power and gold  No such tales are told by the American poor  They mock themselves and glorify their betters   Gold    This all happened more or less    I would have expected a better hook  But actually the line is brilliant  It speaks to the idea that the book is like a witness statement regarding a crime  The story is not necessarily factual  It s the way one person remembers it  I loved the idea that time is not necessarily linear  Why can t we remember the future or live at any point along the line of our existence  Maybe we actually do  but in the moment we don t realize we are jumping around  That would explain why I walk into a room and have no idea why I went there    P z myn chyzhyy khh byly qdrt tGyyr an r ndsht   gdhshth   Hl w abndh bwd   bh pyshnhd mrHwm arsh grgny    rmn bsyr  ly y bwd

was in high school  So it goes   Oh shit  I ll come back and talk about this later probably but wow  Amazing  incomparable writing  Vonnegut writes with ease and panache  crafting in the readers  mind absurd scenes that border on Monty Python ish  This book will make you laugh out loud any number of times  then make eyou wonder why the hll you are even laughing at such a miserable and sad life situation  Rarely does a reader have the skill and know how to so easily write in the way that Vonnegut writes  in a way that it comes out natural and comical  Not unlike Catch 22   definitely a classic   and most definitely one that will go in your favorites shelf  Aristourgema    Sustenetai anepiphulakta  Kai DEN einai sci fi   Easiest and most enjoyable read I ve had for a while  So it goes  the most poignant use of the word  wang  I ve seen in a long time The book that turned me on to Vonnegut  No one can match his wit  This is one of the most profound novels that I have ever read   Re reading this book after 40 years  It still holds up   One of the best anti war novels written in my opinion  Throughout the novel  readers can experience the dehumanization caused during World War II and the impact it had on soldiers after the war  Through the use of a frame narrative  we also gain understanding of characters such as Billy Pilgrim and the Tralfamadorians  I really like this book because I think that it touches on the fact that we have become involved in a never ending cycle of going to war instead of cherishing our humanity  we just boost our nationalism by representing our country well during times of war  but we sacrifice the lives of others in the process  This is an amazing book that touches on ideas such as the physical and mental destruction of war through the use of aliens  and a soldier that has been harmed in every way possible during the war   According to my cover  the Boston Globe felt that Slaughterhouse Five is  Poignant and hilarious  threaded with compassion and  behind everything  the cataract of a thundering moral statement  with compassion being what sets Vonnegut apart and makes him a not jerk and makes him sentimental but not bordering on weak and pathetic  Which speaking from experience is a tough line to walk On top of that I am forever here for antiwar anything that is not preachy but clever and honest and witty and sensible Also  I told you we are landsmen  Kurt and I  I wasn t sure if I was reading the right book at first because of the way the introduction starts  So it goes  But I was  and I loved it  It s short  but that frees up time to read more Vonnegut  It s also brilliantly put together  Other authors  many authors  write in the same shape  But Vonnegut had the brilliant sense to put a name and story behind the switching of time  For this aspect of the novel alone I say it is worth reading this book  Even if a war story may not be typical on your shelf  the unique writing makes everything worth it   This book had something of a yo yo effect on me  At some points I was able to connect with it deeply and laugh out loud  and at others I got sort of lost  which is OK because this is was going on the list of things to be read again anyway  But for now I m tired and hungry and my brain is dead  So it goes  Five stars because it s rare for a book to make me laugh quite like this one did  I can t remember exactly what it was  and don t feel like digging around for it  but I ve definitely laughed at the bits that were making fun of politicians   Wow  Very hard to describe my emotions after finishing this  A book that will take me days to fully process what it all means  It takes the notion of war is hell and flips on its head by showing how stupid war is  This isn t a book about glory and heroism but about a far less explored side of war especially World War II mainly because it deals with American POWs in Germany  The unconventional structure of the book works and it is clear that the main character  Billy Pilgrim  is suffering from some kind of PTSD which explains why he truly believes he was abducted by aliens and lived two lives  Fantastic book  Time travel has never been this meaningful before  Still an all time favorite after the bajillionth time  I wish I hadn t waited so long to read this  So very good  I can t believe I didn t read this till now  Amazing  Read it and re read it and re read it when I was 15 I think if you are calling this anti war  or even debating whether it s anti war or not  you are missing the point  It s a novel about war  War never changes  war is f cked up  and war will change a man The fact that this is so hotly debated just shows what a profound work this is  I also think it mirrors Vonnegut s actual life in more ways than just the war recollections  He was thrust into the  anti war  scene and he kind of just went with it  Saying several times in speeches that he was just repeating things for a paycheck  Not unlike Billy Pilgrim s  yea  so that happened  attitude about the events of his life   I loved it so much more the second time   Immensely powerful  this novel should be read by everyone  Sadly  it s just as timely today as it was when it was written  This is an amazing book  I read it back in college 20 years ago  and I wanted to read it again   you pick up so many new things with repeated readings that you didn t pick up the first time   the symbolism  the little details  etc  This book has emotionally difficult material in it  It is meant to be disturbing  And it s incredibly well written and well structured   its unique structure makes it all the more compelling I d say it belongs in the legit category  Pulsing  Disturbing  Soothing  Brilliant  Like our own memories  Slaughterhouse Five does not come to us like a movie on the big screen  complete with a beginning  middle and end  Memories are often fragmented and lack a proper time frame  They do not announce their pending arrival and they leave us before we are through with them or long after our tolerance has waned  They leave things out or put things in to fool us into believing truths that aren t reality based  They soften with time or harden our souls  They string us together in life and in death  So it goes  Vonnegut you spectacular man  So it goes  Loved  One of the best things I ve read   I m late to the party but I Love this dude  Knocked down a lot of walls in my teenage brain  wow  there s no doubt  it s my greatest  Not having read this book since 8th grade  I wanted to see if it was as magical as I remembered it as a kid  The thing that struck me most was how timely it still is   how it seems to have been written for NOW more than any other time in history  I suspect that 100 years from now  readers will still feel the same way  that it is written for them about a time in the now   though I hope that I m wrong and we all figure out how to live better by then  I think Vonnegut would have wanted that too though he probably didn t believe it to be possible  Deceptively powerful Brilliant  Slaughter House Five tells the tale of Billy Pilgrim who attempts to carry on with living after being a prisoner of war in Dresden  Germany  Billy copes by contriving a comfortable life for himself  but his experience during the war never mentally leaves him  Reality becomes distorted  and his time as a POW is transformed into being a captive in a zoo on an alien planet  During his flashbacks of the war  the reader sees soldiers as individual cogs doing whatever must be done to survive  the horror of war becomes matter of fact   Fascinating and satisfying  unique  Don t hit thirty without reading this  Possibly my favorite book of all time  Listen  this book is fantastic  In the second paragraph of the book  Vonnegut likens Dresden of 1967 to Dayton  OH only with even more open space  I know what he means  In the 1970s I saw Warsaw with its wide  airy boulevards lined with hastily erected post war architecture  It took me a while to recognize that I was looking at the strange  invisible scars left behind by the War  Shall I say  a special case of the art of negative space Billy Pilgrim finds himself in the late 1944 Luxemburg war theatre as a chaplain s assistant  During the last great Nazi effort  known as the Battle of the Bulge  his unit is captured by the Germans and is being transferred to Dresden as POWs  Billy is a strange guy  Most importantly  he is absolutely harmless  In fact  one might question if he really has an opinion about anything  More than that  Does he even comprehend what is happening around him  At one point an arrogant professor  his roommate in a hospital ward  even questions if he suffers from echolalia Well  he doesn t  He is keenly aware of all that surrounds him  He is an exceptionally perceptive man  He is Kurt Vonnegut himself  And more  Billy ends up traveling with a UFO to Tralfamador  an alien world hundreds of light years away around a distant star  OK  Vonnegut was also able to travel in space  but only to Titan  a mere few light minutes distance from us  The Sirens of Titan   Plus  Billy can see the future hidden in a unique fourth dimension  So  I d say that Billy Pilgrim is an improved Vonnegut  at least a v  1 01 Through the eyes of this somewhat unstable and infinitely benevolent character  we get insight into the bombing of Dresden  a late WWII event that the author personally experienced  An event that hugely impacted Vonnegut s thoughts and life  An event that  using his own heartbreaking humor  left him as the sole beneficiary of a major destruction by means of profitable book sales of Slaughterhouse Five The book covers a time frame between 1944 1970s  but most of the action happens in late 1944 to early 1945  We get insight into human suffering during WWII but also into peacetime tragedies  an airplane crash  a case of carbon monoxide poisoning  etc    The narrator also ponders over free will and the non linearity of time  Billy learns about these philosophical concepts during his stay with the Tralfamadorians who exhibit him and a pornographic model in their zoo  Although being a zoo spectacle doesn t sound like much fun  although      Billy doesn t seem to mind it  He uses well his time in the zoo to father a child with his cage mate and also to absorb a good deal of the aliens  wisdom  Later he makes a good living back on Earth by sharing his newly acquired knowledge with receptive audiences Among the more  earthly  sagacity  we learn how dignity can be taken away in the name of love  We also get reminded that if one wants to hire a hitman  the travel expenses will have to be calculated into his fees  With a twisted  Vonnegutian  wink  a monograph written by H  W  Campbell Jr   informs us about the American mentality toward poverty  The only problem is that Campbell is an American turned Nazi propaganda playwright and his essay was intended to guide Nazi captors in dealing with American POWs  Despite the disreputable author of the monograph  what he wrote feels remarkably timely  Rest assured  Vonnegut pays his respect to this traitor genius by acknowledging that he had probably the highest IQ of all war criminals  Vonnegut at his best  Utilizing Billy s unrestricted capacity to go back and forth in time  at one point we take a brief journey from a bombing round all the way back to Adam and Eve  Who else but Vonnegut could give us such a hilariously thought provoking time voyage The secondary characters in the story tend to make brief appearances but their personalities are masterfully drafted  Here are a few of my favorites  Paul Lazzaro  the vengeful little guy  Roland Weary  who has hard time finding a wimpier companions than himself but when he does  he beats them up  Edgar Derby  who steels a tea can and gets executed for it  Valencia Merble  the not so attractive but truly loving wife  the control freak Barbara  Billy s daughter who likes to express her displeasure with her father s unconventional behavior At the end  one may think anything about the bombing of Dresden  war in general  or the philosophy of the Tralfamadorians  but escaping the charming satire and moving humanism of this book is almost impossible  Give this book to your 13 year old son  I believe in time travel now   Wow  I feel like writing a book report  I learned everything from this book  Kurt Vonnegut  Jr  is a genius   So it goes   Rosewater said an interesting thing to Billy one time about a book that wasn t science fiction  He said that everything there was to know about life was in The Brothers Karamazov  by Fyodor Dostoevsky   But that isn t enough any more   said Rosewater    Another time Billy heard Rosewater say to a psychiatrist   I think you guys are going to have to come up with a lot of wonderful new lies  or people just aren t going to want to go on living    Everything was beautiful  and nothing hurt   ktb  fwq l dh dr nkwhsh jng This is a really interesting read for those interested in the Second World War  and in the ethics of war in general  Through the appalling bombing of Dresden in 1945 Vonnegut condemns the actions of war as barbaric  and criticises wars as  Children s crusades  where innocence is butchered mercilessly  The bombing of Dresden is an interesting topic in history as whilst it helped the allies defeat Hitler s fascism  it killed more people than the dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima  This is a highly moral read and very well written  I would recommend to all as essential reading   If you finish reading this book and understand it completely  then  quite simply  you ve not read it properly  But it is the intellectual wrestling match that this book provides that makes it so very good  Time travel  an abduction  by aliens  no less   and an almost inhumane indifference to death through the wonderful  and so it goes  that is repeated throughout  this book is a stream of contradictions  Some will come away reading it definitely thinking it weird  but let it wash over you and drag you into lunacy   I couldn t even tell you why I gave this book five stars  It was weird  It was quirky  It tied oddball things together in complex and unexpected ways  Its narrative was so far beyond  non linear  that it almost defies classification  The characters weren t even particularly likeable  I feel like I need to read it again  and probably again after that  to maybe begin to understand its brilliance  or maybe it s just a bunch of idiosyncratic nonsense  masquerading as deep  philosophical insight because it s just so weird and quirky and unexpected  and nobody wants to admit they don t get it  But I don t think so    Billy Pilgrim s tale of the bombing of Dresden  time hopping and the Tralfamadorians takes you on a ride that has you smiling one moment  confused the other and deeply touched the next  It has you questioning your faith in human nature as you see human nature more clearly and in turn question the way you question things  and readily accept things   Slaughterhouse Five  is the kind of books that resonates with you and can never be understood in just one read  but you forget this until you pick it up again and reach the end with only a little bit more understanding than you had in the beginning but so many more questions  So it goes   Fucking Vonnegut  man This book changed my life  I tried to read 1984 earlier and found I could not get through it    too predictable and  wooden     I think Slaughterhouse Five is much closer to the mark  yet not quite the iconic book that Orwell s 1984 or Animal Farm turns out to be     Perhaps Vonnegut s view of the world cannot be used by flag wavers anywhere  Perhaps he is not simplistic enough  Perhaps he is just a bit too pessimistic for most Americans  Perhaps there is a genre problem    it is not science fiction    it is not fantasy    it is not even a vision of the future    it is a vision of the world that fits whether Billy Pilgrim goes back a thousand years to the past or to the now    the Tralfamadorian  can you beat that word   conceit that all things are happening all the time at once works perfectly for the theme that humankind the herd that humankind is is mad  has always been mad  and will always be mad    It absolutely changed me too  I think it will change how I write   An all time favorite  Kurt Mother Fucking Vonnegut One of my favorites  Devastating and sublime   This may be the strangest book I ve ever read  It jumps through time  there are aliens  the first time I read this book  I finished with my brain scrambled and no idea what was going on  so therefore  I decided it was terrible About a year later  I picked up the book again and  wow  I m not exactly sure what changed for me  but reading it again was like a revelation  this is a remarkably clever book  The sentences themselves are short and simple  often coming across as quite matter of fact  but the book as a whole is just brilliant and so intelligent  I found myself going through an underlining particularly poignant quotes  and hardly any pages were left untouched I m not quite sure how to describe this book  but if you haven t already  100  give it a try  Poo tee weet So it goes      Wonderful  It s strange to me that I managed to read so many other Vonnegut novels before reading this big hit  however  I m so glad I did  I don t feel like he can top this one  So much of the subject matter and philosophies were things I ve encountered before in my life  yet the novel raised so many new questions and new ideas  things after studying literature  war  and sex for 4 years I ve never thought about  If you haven t read this  read it  It s not a page turner story wise  but thinking wise I couldn t put it down   Zapowiedzialem swoim synom  ze pod zadnym pozorem nie wolno im brac udzialu w rzeziach ani cieszyc sie na wiesc o masakrze wrogow   Dziewiatego dnia wloczega umarl  Zdarza sie  Jego ostatnie slowa brzmialy   Myslisz  ze tu jest zle  Tu nie jest jeszcze tak zle   Jej obecnosc zle wplywala na Billy ego wylacznie dlatego  ze byla jego matka  Bylo mu wstyd  czul sie slaby i niewdzieczny  poniewaz matka zadala sobie tyle trudu  zeby mu dac zycie i utrzymac go przy zyciu  a jemu wcale sie to zycie nie podobalo   So it goes  Wow  Double Wow  So it goes       and so it goes   So it goes  So it goes  War books give me a hard time reading cause the characters are always suffering and trying their best to scape reality  Even though the main character somehow knew about what was going to happen in Dresden  he couldn t do anything about it  Things had to turn out the way they were expected to  And that s where Kurt extraordinary accomplishes telling that free will is non existent in war  Billy couldn t even decide if he was going to be left alone to die or not  In general  Vonnegut gives us a lesson on valuing life  We could just get wiped out because of a being from outer space pressing a button  We never know  Nothing is certain  I love it how he portraits all of our hidden desires in Billy s time facets  He gives the different scenarios where we could find ourselves in  it s just a matter of really thinking and materializing what we want to be or what we want to achieve  It s just a matter of valuing our free will and do whatever we want to do  obviously without harming others  We have that chance  People who are obliged to go to war or to do any other thing  don t   Dresden was bombed on this very day 71 years ago  So it goes Slaughterhouse Five is satirical take on human apathy  It is a commentary on the futility of war  It is also a kaleidoscopic take of fate and free will  Billy Pilgrim   the protagonist  is an American soldier in Germany during WWII  He later gets kidnapped by aliens from Tralfamadore  who can see time in ways that humans cannot  The rest of the book revolves around him jumping back and forth in time and finally finishing off the book in Dresden  Germany  when it got bombed by the British  RAF  and USAAF The humour is absurd and profound in equal measure  There are few moments that take you by surprise and make you think hard Very enjoyable and engaging  Can t wait to read Cat s cradle next  When I began  I wasn t really sure what to think  Vonnegut didn t capture my attention as quickly as other authors  but like the authors that actually count in my book  he did it thoroughly To say I enjoyed this book isn t exactly to say I was happy with any of it  It s bleak  it s dark  it s depressing as hell  It s about World War II  it s about the terrible things that happened then  and worst of all the things that happened afterwards to soldiers who came home broken and confused  It s a cry for help for PTSD  It reminds me very much of Hemingway s The Sun Also Rises in that much of the memory of war is repressed  only to come forth later My friend suggested this to me because this is one of his favorite books  He is also very anti war  Having finished this  I understand why  Despite being dated with references to Dresden  this novel still carries today in how soldiers are looked over  how little the human brain can comprehend and absorb horrors all at once  and others This book left a profound impact on my psyche  and it ll take me a few days to digest what exactly the shape of that impact is  This is my first novel of Kurt Vonnegut but it s my third read from him  Btw  2BR02B was amazing Reading this has got to be the highlight of my beach vacation  Nope  I m not talking about the great food I gobbled up nor the clear blue waters and that  magic island  trip we had  I m talking about THIS  THIS book   This was really entertaining and I am honestly such a fan of Vonnegut s writing style  Hilarious and heartbreaking at the same time  Ugh  just really good All I have to do now is to get my friends to read Vonnegut so that I can have someone to relate to me   pumps fist Hey  listen  There are no telegrams on Tralfamadore  But you re right  each clump of symbols is a brief  urgent message    describing a situation  a scene  We Tralfamadorians read them at all once  not one after the other  There isn t any particular relationship between all the messages  except that the author has chosen them carefully  so that  when seen all at once  they produce an image of life that is beautiful and surprising and deep  There is no beginning  no middle  no end  no suspense  no moral  no causes  no effects  What we love in our books are the depths of many marvelous moments seen all at one time    No wonder this is considered as a classic so basically the story is about that one Billy Pilgrim who gained the ability to travel through time  but only within his life span  Vonnegut who was a war prisoner with Pilgrim tells and unfold the peculiar story of his friend in a totally random order that makes sense  because when you can time travel  chronological order becomes redundant  or so it goes  Vonnegut s creative and witty remarks and style of writing made the journey even more enjoyable  describing how Pilgrim fought and was captured in WWII  worked as a optometrist  survived a plane crash and abducted by aliens to be put on display millions of miles away from earth  then admitted to a mental clinic when tried to share his story with others  I particularly enjoyed the backwards scene of the American fighters  the irony of Pilgrim s life and war and the novels of Kilgore Trout which I would read if they were real    why me    That is a very Earthling question to ask Mr Pilgrim  Why you  Why us for that matter  Why anything  Because this moment simply is     It s embarrassing that I hadn t read Slaughterhouse Five until now  It s also embarrassing that I liked it this much  It s like only just now reading 1984  and then gushing to all your friends about it  Ugh  But anyway here s my thoughts  There s an interview of Kurt Vonnegut somewhere where he says that Billy Pilgrim was based on one of his actual war buddies  a guy who wound up dying of the  Thousand Mile Stare   The horrors of war got to him so much that he retreated inside of himself  rejected all food or water  and wasted away  In short he visited Tralfamadore and never returned It is established early on that Billy Pilgrim gets abducted by four dimensional aliens  the Tralfamadorians  who tell him that they see all of time at once the way humans can see distance  In this way they reveal that everything that has happened is inevitable and nothing can be changed  The best you can do is look away to a more pleasant time  The rest of the book is defined by this time shifting  quietest philosophy  It isn t just that the scenes are told out of order  with the ending first so we know the fates of the main characters the same way the aliens would  It s also Billy s total passivity to the horrors and cruelty around him  his blithe and almost uncomprehending acceptance of violence and misery  It s ok that the allies bombed Dresden  it s ok that your psychopathic fellow soldiers hate your guts  it s ok that you marry a woman you don t love or that you have kids you barely know  it s fine that your life sucks  That s the way it s always supposed to be  So it goes  Just mentally travel back to that time you took a nice nap  or back to Tralfamadore where the aliens have abducted a beautiful supermodel to be your girlfriend  They even built a comfy home for you That Tralfamadore is an escapist fantasy is made clear by the scene where Billy finds a girly mag that luridly speculates on the fate of the missing celebrity  That Billy s abduction resembles a letter to Penthouse   then they kidnapped Marilyn Monroe and she totally became my space wife    is not an accident  But it might not be as clear that the Tralfamadorians are villains  Critics have accused this book of justifying violence with its  so it goes  fatalist philosophy  but they miss the point  The aliens are depicted as totally heartless in their omnipotence  This is a book about the dangers of escapism  on the problems of turning your head toward something more pleasant  This book accuses society of having a thousand mile stare  We all have collective PTSD and we retreat inside of vapid power fantasies and schlock  In doing so we shrug our shoulders to the miseries of the world with an impotent  so it goes   A searing reckoning in plain and certain terms  Slaughterhouse Five derives its immense power from its very simplicity  The calmness of tone should not be taken as a lack of emotion  but as the recognition that all the emotion in the world cannot change the past  present  or future  acceptance should not be mistaken for endorsement  merely as recognition that any attempt to apply reason to absurdity can only lead to additional destructive illogic  Indeed  the unexpressed anger is the structuring absence that predominates the novel  it brings to mind an R E M  lyric from the equally anti war  Ignoreland    I know that this is vitriol  no solution spleen venting  but I feel better having screamed  don t you  Vonnegut Jr  updates Ecclesiastes for the twentieth century  with  So it goes  taking the place of  All is vanity   that phrase is the one that sticks with readers  but the motif that might be even more essential is the thrice repeated exhortation of the narrator  imploring us   Listen   He just wants us to know  he was there  He sets up his narrative by calmly laying out the beginning and the end  acknowledging the utter impossibility of doing what he is about to do  and preemptively announcing the book a failure  and then defies himself by doing it anyway  and succesfully beyond all imagination The story keeps the reader unstuck emotionally  in that cliched region between laughter and tears  the sensation  the need  to do either  both  builds and builds until a line  arbitrarily  demands the release of this pent up emotion  and then the counter resets and the building starts again  It occurs  at these moments of release  that it does not matter much whether one laughs or cries  neither response is more useful or appropriate than the other  I gave this book 5 stars because of all the emotions I felt upon finishing it  It took me a few months to finish it  meaning that I did not find it exciting enough to read it fast  though the book is short enough to possibly be read in one sitting  The main character  Billy Pilgrim  is really strange  and his life story  mostly revolving around World War II  is told in a sometimes hard to follow mess  because Billy has the ability to  time travel   in the book  it comes across as him living different parts of his life out of order   He claims to have been abducted by an alien race too  an aside which is important for your understanding of the character  I wasn t expecting science fiction in this book about war  but I actually found it to be enjoyable  I didn t like Billy  but I m pretty sure he wasn t written to be likable  I didn t give this book 5 stars for the characters  or the writing style  which I liked but others might find frustrating to follow  The reason I liked this book so much can be best summed up by a quote from the book about the book   It is so short and jumbled and jangled  Sam  because there is nothing intelligent to say about a massacre  Everybody is supposed to be dead  to never say anything or want to say anything ever again  Everything is supposed to be very quiet after a massacre  and it always is  except for the birds  And what do the birds say  All there is to say about a massacre  things like   Poo tee weet   This book is so simple  yet its message is an important one  Regardless of how people feel about the rightness or wrongness of war  most can agree that it is a terrible thing  And instead of romanticizing war by censoring ninety percent of everything  making the reasons for fighting out to be black and white  or even writing strong  courageous soldiers instead of the scared little boys who were actually fighting  Slaughterhouse five simply portrays a story about how terrible war is for everyone  I highly recommend this book   Spoilers warning for my favorite quotes  Slaughterhouse Five is an amazing book  really two books in one  that is easy to read and entertaining despite the potentially dark nature of what the book is nominally about  the firebombing of Dresden  The part actually told by Vonnegut is only the first chapter and some bits at the end  For the rest  rather than a traditional war narrative  this book weaves a complex story together from various periods of history in a non consecutive fashion  This means the narrative isn t exactly linear  but is explained by the interesting and stoic main character Billy Pilgrim and his time traveling hopping around the universe  The book still makes sense  though  and is very enjoyable thanks to Vonnegut s masterful blending of different time periods This was my first Kurt Vonnegut book  and I didn t know what to expect about his writing  I think the best way to approach this book is to think of Vonnegut as primarily an idea man who really wanted to tell a story using an interesting experience from his life  Yet  he had neither the clean and organized story that would traditionally comprise a book of this type nor the inclination to write it as such  as he explains in the book  Therefore  he includes many different great ideas  and the story seems to flow around or defer to the ideas rather than the ideas to the story Favorite quotes  I wish you and your family also as to your friend Merry Christmas and a happy New Year and I hope that we ll meet again in a world of peace and freedom in the taxi cab if the accident will    2   Is it an anti war book    Yes   I said   I guess    You know what I say to people when I hear they re writing anti war books    No  What do you say  Harrison Starr    I say  Why don t you write an anti glacier book instead   What he meant  of course  was that there would always be wars  that they were as easy to stop as glaciers  I believe that  too    3  And we were flown to a rest camp in France  where we were fed chocolate malted milkshakes and other rich foods until we were all covered with baby fat  Then we were sent home  and I married a pretty girl who was covered with baby fat  too  And we had babies    7  He used to ask me sneeringly sometimes why I hadn t been an officer  as though I d done something wrong    10  The nicest veterans in Schenectady  I thought  the kindest and funniest ones  the ones who hated war the most  were the ones who d really fought    11  I wrote the Air Force back then  asking for details about the raid on Dresden  who ordered it  how many planes did it  why they did it  what desirable results there had been and so on  I was answered by a man who  like myself  was in public relations  He said that he was sorry  but that the information was top secret still  I read the letter out loud to my wife  and I said   Secret  My God from whom     11  Then she turned to me  let me see how angry she was  and that the anger was for me  She had been talking to herself  so what she said was a fragment of a much longer conversation   You were just babies then   she said   What   I said   You were just babies in the war like the ones upstairs   I nodded that this was true  We had been foolish virgins in the war  right at the end of childhood   But you re not going to write it that way  are you   This wasn t a question  It was an accusation   I I don t know   I said   Well  I know   she said   You ll pretend you were men instead of babies  and you ll be played in the movies by Frank Sinatra and John Wayne or some of those other glamorous  war loving  dirty old men  And war will look just wonderful  so we ll have a lot more of them  And they ll be fought by babies like the babies upstairs   So then I understood  It was the war that made her so angry  She didn t want her babies or anybody else s babies killed in wars  And she thought war were partly encouraged by books and movies  So I held up my right hand and I made her a promise   Mary   I said   I don t think this book of mine is ever going to be finished  I must have written five thousand pages by now  and thrown them all away  If I ever do finish it  though  I give you my word of honor  there won t be a part for Frank Sinatra or John Wayne  I tell you what   I said   I ll call it the Children s Crusade   She was my friend after that    14 15  I wake to sleep  and take my waking slow    I feel my fate in what I cannot fear    I learn by going where I have to go    Words of the Wind by Theodore Roethke  20  And Lot s wife  of course  was told not to look back where all those people and their homes had been  But she did look back  and I love her for that  because it was so human  So she was turned to a pillar of salt  So it goes  People aren t supposed to look back  I m certainly not going to do it anymore  I ve finished my war book now  The next one I write is going to be fun  This one is a failure  and had to be  since it was written by a pillar of salt    21 22   The most important thing I learned on Tralfamadore was that when a person dies he only appears to die  He is still very much alive in the past  so it is very silly for people to cry at his funeral  All moments  past  present  and future  always have existed  always will exist        It is just an illusion we have here on Earth that one moment follows another one  like beads on a string  and that once a moment is gone it is gone forever  When a Tralfamadorian sees a corpse  all he thinks is that the dead person is in bad condition in that particular moment  but that the same person is just fine in plenty of other moments  Now  when I myself hear that somebody is dead  I simply shrug and say what the Tralfamadorians say about dead people  which is  So it goes     26 27  All this responsibility at such an early age made her a bitchy flibbertigibbet    29   Like so many other Americans  she was trying to construct a life that made sense from things she found in gift shops    39  Billy had a framed prayer on his office wall which expressed his method for keeping going  even though he was unenthusiastic about living  A lot of patients who saw the prayer on Billy s wall told him that it helped them keep going too  It went like this  God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change  courage to change the things I can  and wisdom always to tell the difference  Among the things Billy Pilgrim could not change were the past  the present  and the future    60   Rosewater said some interesting things to Billy one time about a book that wasn t science fiction  He said that everything there was to know about life was in The Brothers Karamazov  by Feodor Dostoevsky   But that isn t enough any more   said Rosewater  Another time Billy heard Rosewater say to a psychiatrist   I think you guys are going to have to come up with a lot of wonderful new lies  or people just aren t going to want to go on living    101  She upset Billy simply by being his mother  She made him feel embarrassed and ungrateful and weak because she had gone to so much trouble to give him life  and to keep that life going  and Billy didn t really like life at all    102   How s the patient   he asked Derby   Dead to the world    But not actually dead    No    How nice to feel nothing  and still get full credit for being alive    105  Billy didn t want to marry ugly Valencia  She was one of the symptoms of his disease  He knew he was going crazy when he heard himself proposing marriage to her  when he begged her to take the diamond and be his companion for life    107  So Rosewater told him  It was The Gospel from Outer Space by Kilgore Trout  It was about a visitor from outer space  shaped very much like a Tralfamadorian  by the way  The visitor from outer space made a serious study of Christianity  to learn  if he could  why Christians found it so easy to be cruel  He concluded that at least part of the trouble was slipshod storytelling in the New Testament  He supposed that the intent of the Gospels was to teach people  among other things  to be merciful  even to the lowest of the low  But the Gospels actually taught this  Before you kill somebody  make absolutely sure he isn t well connected  So it goes  The flaw in the Christ stories  said the visitor from outer space  was that Jesus Christ  who didn t look like much  was actually the Son of the Most Powerful Being in the Universe  Readers understood that  so  when they came to the crucifixion  they naturally thought  and Rosewater read out loud again  Oh boy they sure picked the wrong guy to lynch that time  And that thought had a brother   There are right people to lynch   Who  People not well connected  So it goes  The visitor from outer space made a gift to Earth of a new Gospel  In it  Jesus really was a nobody  and a pain in the neck to a lot of people with better connections than he had  He still got to say all the lovely and puzzling things he said in the other Gospels  So the people amused themselves one day by nailing him to a cross and planting the cross in the ground  There couldn t possibly be any repercussions  the lynchers thought  The reader would have to think that too  since the new Gospel hammered home again and again what a nobody Jesus was  And then  just before the nobody died  the heavens opened up  and there was thunder and lightning  The voice of God came crashing down  He told the people that he was adopting the bum as his son  giving him the full powers and privileges of The Son of the Creator of the Universe throughout all eternity  God said this  From this moment on  He will punish horribly anybody who torments a bum who has no connections    108 110  God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change  courage to change the things I can  and wisdom always to tell the difference    209  The Population Reference Bureau predicts that the world s total population will double to 7 000 000 000 before the year 2000   I suppose they ll all want dignity   I said   I suppose   said O Hare    212    It s my first review of 2016 and I m gonna try to stay on top of reviews this year  so we ll see how well that works     All this happened  more or less   In my head there s this difference between good books and great books  Good books give me a warm fuzzy feeling  Great books make me want to curl up and die because I will never write something that good and why do I have to love it so much  This is a pretty freaking good book  It takes a certain amount of talent to write a story this good that features an insane dude  time traveling  and aliens and war and whatever else was in that novel  I don t remember half of it anymore  I ll need to read it again and write notes in the margins to figure it out  This isn t necessarily a linear book  We hop to the past  the future  and the present  only according to the book all of this  is  the present   Confused yet   It doesn t need to be linear  In a way we re reading something very similar to the aliens  books in the novel      each clump of symbols is a brief  urgent message    describing a situation  a scene  We Tralfamadorians read them all at once  not one after the other  There isn t any particular relationship between all the messages  except that the author has chosen them carefully  so that  when seen all at once  they produce an image of life that is beautiful and surprising and deep  There is no beginning  no middle  no end  no suspense  no moral  no causes  no effects  What we love in our books are the depths of many marvelous moments seen all at one time That s exactly what this is  Little blocks of scenes  snippets of a man s life that are sometimes horrifying and sometimes totally mundane  They don t make much sense if you try to put them together in a decent plot  I m not sure there even is a plot but hey  that s cool with me  I m a total sucker for the weird books  the ones that disturb me and make me think  I love books I have to read again  sometimes multiple times  if I want to understand them  This is one of those books  I don t know what it s saying yet but it s saying something  It talks about life  and humanity  and time  For the first read of 2016  this was amazing   GOD GRANT ME THE SERENITY TO ACCEPT THE THINGS I CANNOT CHANGE COURAGE TO CHANGE THE THINGS I CAN  AND WISDOM ALWAYS TO TELL THE DIFFERENCE   So it goes  Wow  This novel was funny  It would really take a terrific writer like Kurt Vonnegut to make a war novel funny  Some examples  Billy coughed  when the door was opened  and when he coughed he shit thin gruel  This was in accordance with the Third Law of Motion according to Sir Isaac Newton  This law tells us that for every action there is a reaction which is equal and opposite in direction This can be useful in rocketry   Did that really happen   said Maggie White  She was a dull person  but a sensational invitation to make babies  Men looked at her and wanted to fill her up with babies right away  She hadn t had even one baby yet  She used birth control  Need I say more  I have had tried to read so many books about wars  and I had to leave some of them halfway  This book is the best one I ever read about wars  Kurt Vonnegut created this wonderful story of his own to talk of his own experiences in the war  I absolutely loved the protagonist s character  There was this sequence in which he describes a bombing backwards  It reminded me how incapable we are to do that  to create life  to build in a matter of seconds  to suck bullets out This book helped me realize nobody wins in a war  and how wars are fought by children  who had to face the consequences of choices they didn t make Slaughterhouse Five is indeed a masterpiece  Fun exploration of non linear narrative structures and genre crossover from sci fi  historical fiction  and memoir  The clunkiness of the crossovers is part of the book s charm  The book has a lot of themes but I think in particular it s a strong defense against the  ideal victim  narrative of war  or the idea that anyone deserves to die or live in pain  I personally didn t like the protagonist  but thought it was clever to make an unlikeable protagonist that the reader has to root for given his circumstances  I love Vonnegut s style and his endearing cynical humanism  though I have to say that I do not see the human race as base and pointless as he does  But I also have to confess that  while I ve read almost all his books and can cite certain images and scenes from most of them  if you gave me a title and put a gun to my head  I d be hard put to describe to you the plot  His plots just seem to slide out of my memory as if on Teflon  Which is a kind of blessing  actually  because it means I can read and re read them and always be moved by his simple  moving prose and his piercing observations about human character    or at least the darker side of human character  This is at least the third time that I ve read this book  and as a measure of my own simplicity of mind  it s the first time I noticed that a character of some minor consequence is Howard W  Campbell  Jr   an American turned Nazi who is the main character of Vonnegut s  Mother Night   which I ve read probably four times  As Vonnegut would say  so it goes  Anyway  I loved this book again as I have each previous reading  In an afterword to the audiobook version I read this time  Vonnegut describes the movie made from it as  one of the great pacifist movies   but I do not see the book or the movie  which I ve also seen  as  pacifist  so much as  anti war   although I guess its  nothing matters and what if it did  undertones qualify it at least as passive  Whatever the case  the delicious language and spare style reinforced a commitment I m making to read at least one Vonnegut a year for the rest of my life  Next  I believe I ll take up  Breakfast of Champions   which I ve always thought of as my favorite of his books  though please don t ask me to describe the plot   Though I can tell you that its description of Veteran s Day vs  Armistice Day in the preface is one of the great works of all literature   Slaughterhouse Five was simply an amazing book  Throughout every chapter  every page  my mind was constantly wanting more  I didn t find myself bored or struggling to get through it  Vonnegut is very harsh when describing the experiences of Billy Pilgrim during his time as a prisoner of war  Every moment in Billys experience was described in full detail  and even the gory parts weren t held back The most vivid description was when the prisoners  from all over the world  were being shipped from one holding area to another  Vonnegut describes the horrible stench of mens feces  and other bodily fluids  and the pure torture that the train ride was  The whole book makes the war experience very clear and truly shows how horrible it is  Being a prisoner of war had astonishing effects on Billy  and this is shown through his constant flash backs  that he views as time travel  from his childhood  to war time and all back to current day  Also  he has a made up world full of aliens  that he thinks is real  which shows just how messed up Billys mind got from the war  I think that the made up Alien world is Billys way of coping with his everyday life  The make believe planet is supposedly perfect  at least in Billys eyes  so he travels there when he wants to feel better and okay will life  Just the fact that he views flashbacks as time travel and a make believe place as real  shows how profound the effects of being involved in a horrible war were on Billy  or could be to anybody else  Overall  I d recommend this book to people who like to think deeply  Some parts are kind of hard to fathom  but at the end of the book you ll be left speechless  It truly made me think about my life and compare it to Billys  Im thankful for my healthy state of mind after learning of Billys kind of crazy state   Schlachtof meant slaughterhouse  Funf was good old five   page153  I don t know if  war books  are quite my forte  I do know that I enjoyed this one  I feel that not only is this a wonderfully unorganized novel  it is a necessary one for my understanding of human nature  Between aliens  WWII  and modern abnormalities in the protagonist  Billy Pilgrim  this book was a rarity  But Billy wasn t a hero  He hated the war  wanted to escape every moment of it  He never fought in Dresden  yet he was a survivor  Billy was a survivor with PTSD  Told in flashbacks to the war  or perhaps flashforwards to life with the mental illness  And I may be wrong  but it seemed to me that Tralfamadore may have been a mental hospital that he was placed in following the war  Whatever the case  Vonnegut never fails to impress me  Every work of his that I ve read has fooled me into following the oddity of characters until I grow attached to them somehow  to leave me thinking about the book for long after  This one was no different  So it goes   3 I suspect that I am one of very few people who had never read this book  This being confirmed by some of my goodreads  friends   I had my task before me  I have to say that over all I enjoyed it very much  It took me a few chapters to get used to his repetitive nature  and in the end grew to appreciate it  His descriptions  particularly of characters  stand out to me  It was a random  bristly beard  and some of the bristles were white  even though Billy was only twenty one years old  He was also going bald  Wind and cold and violent exercise had turned his face crimson  He didn t look like a soldier at all  He looked like a filthy flamingo   Rosewater was a big man  but not very powerful  He looked as though he might be made out of nose putty   The gun made a ripping sound like the opening of the zipper on the fly of God Almighty   Out he went  his blue and ivory feet crushing the wet salad of the lawn  This is great stuff  definitely now among my favorite books of all time  Last one     who taught that those who die are meant to die  that corpses are improvements  So it goes  Does the end of a book ever feel like a death to you  You can revisit it  but really  it s over  And so it goes  I am looking forward to Cat s Cradle now  My God  this book slapped me right across the face  I was transfixed and could not put it down  I can t believe it took me so long to read this important work of art An excerpt from the book to sum it all up  You were just babies then   she said  What   I said  You were just babies in the war    like the ones upstairs  I nodded that this was true  We had been foolish virgins in the war  right at the end of childhood  But you re not going to write it that way  are you   This wasn t a question  It was an accusation  I    I don t know   I said  Well I know   she said   You ll pretend you were men instead of babies  and you ll be portrayed in the movies by Frank Sinatra and John Wayne or some of those other glamorous  war loving  dirty old men  And war will look just wonderful  so we ll have a lot more of them  And they ll be fought by babies like the babies upstairs  So then I understood  It was war that made her so angry  She didn t want her babies or anybody else s babies killed in wars  And she thought wars were partly encouraged by books and movies So I held up my right hand and I made her a promise   Mary   I said   I don t think this book of mine is ever going to be finished  I must have written five thousand pages by now  and thrown them all away  If I ever do finish it  though  I give you my word of honor  there won t be a part for Frank Sinatra or John Wayne  I tell you what   I said   I ll call it The Children s Crusade    When I bought this book paying double price for number of pages  I was quite depressed  But this 177 page classic did what most of the books fail to do  to present a terrible and macabre situation in an awfully casual and indifferent tone  I have never read a book that mocks value of lives to this level  and that too with a touch of humour  Nearly 135000 people were killed in Dresden  Germany more people than in Hiroshima   a place totally inhabited by civilians with no military or artillery resources what so ever  This was a very illogical attack  Is logic even exists in war   and was tactically kept away from public so that people don t start hating America    It had to be done   Rumfoord told Billy  speaking of the destruction of Dresden  I know   said Billy  That s war   I know  I m not complaining   The way this story is presented with continuous time traveling back and forth that the whole life of Billy seems as a whole picture in every line mixed with millions of emotions  The absurdity and illogicality of war is depicted aptly with introduction of the theory that nothing is there called free will   How  how did I get here   It would take another Earthling to explain it to you  Earthlings are the great explainers  explaining why this event is structured as it is  telling how other events may be achieved or avoided  I am a Tralfamadorian  seeing all time as you might see a stretch of the Rocky Mountains  All time is all time  It does not change  It does not lend itself to warnings or explanations  It simply is  Take it moment by moment  and you will find that we are all  as I ve said before  bugs in amber   You sound to me as though you don t believe in free will   said Billy Pilgrim  If I hadn t spent so much time studying Earthlings   said the Tralfamadorian   I wouldn t have any idea what was meant by  free will   I ve visited thirty one inhabited planets in the universe  and I have studied reports on one hundred more  Only on Earth is there any talk of free will   Billy simply had no control over whatever was happening with his life and that s the sole concept of war  isn t it  And guess what the more painful  you can t do nothing about it but accept your FATE  Can you respond to your death prophecy like this He declared  I  Billy Pilgrim  the tape begins  will die  have died  and always will die on February thirteenth  1976    Billy predicts his own death within an hour  He laughs about it  invites the crowd to laugh with him   It is high time I was dead   he says   Many years ago   he said   a certain man promised to have me killed  He is an old man now  living not far from here  He has read all the publicity associated with my appearance in your fair city  He is insane  Tonight he will keep his promise  There are police around him as he leaves the stage  They are there to protect him from the crush of popularity  No threats on his life have been made since 1945  The police offer to stay with him  They are floridly willing to stand in a circle around him all night  with their zap guns drawn  No  no   says Billy serenely   It is time for you to go home to your wives and children  and it is time for me to be dead for a little while  and then live again   At that moment  Billy s high forehead is in the cross hairs of a high powered laser gun  It is aimed at him from the darkened press box  In the next moment  Billy Pilgrim is dead  So it goes  This casually letting go of lives with  So it goes  is the USP of this book  showing us how really small and cheap lives are There is not many cases  where the author got emotional in such a difficult and inhuman situation  getting emotional is the most normal thing to do here   But when he did  is was magic  There were diffident raps on the factory window  Derby was out there  having seen all  He wanted some syrup  too So Billy made a lollipop for him  He opened the window  He stuck the lollipop into poor old Derby s gaping mouth  A moment passed  and then Derby burst into tears  Billy closed the window and hid the sticky spoon  Somebody was coming  A total city which was one of the most beautiful cities in world  was diminished to mountains of rubble  and Billy was returning home  Billy opened his eyes  A middle aged man and wife were crooning to the horses  They were noticing what the Americans had not noticed  that the horses  mouths were bleeding  gashed by the bits  that the horses  hooves were broken  so that every step meant agony  that the horses were insane with thirst  The Americans had treated their form of transportation as though it were no more sensitive than a six cylinder Chevrolet    Billy asked them in English what it was they wanted  and they at once scolded him in English for the condition of the horses  They made Billy get out of the wagon and come look at the horses  When Billy saw the condition of his means of transportation  he burst into tears  He hadn t cried about anything else in the war  All I can say now that  this is the best  best anti war black comedy I have ever read  Oh  I forgot  the author himself was there in Dresden when it was slaughtered  So it goes  I can t exactly say why I enjoyed this one  but I really did What drew me to find a book by the author was this quote by him  What do men want  They want a lot of pals  and they wish people wouldn t get so mad at them Why are so many people getting divorced today  It s because most of us don t have extended families anymore  It used to be that when a man and a woman got married  the bride got a lot more people to talk to about everything  The groom got a lot more pals to tell dumb jokes to A few Americans  but very few  still have extended families  The Navahos  The Kennedys But most of us  if we get married nowadays  are just one more person for the other person  The groom gets one more pal  but it s a woman  The woman gets one more person to talk to about everything  but it s a man When a couple has an argument  they may think it s about money or power or sex  or how to raise the kids  or whatever  What they re really saying to each other  though  without realizing it  is this  You are not enough people  I met a man in Nigeria one time  an Ibo who has six hundred relatives he knew quite well  His wife had just had a baby  the best possible news in any extended family They were going to take it to meet all its relatives  Ibos of all ages and sizes and shapes  It would even meet other babies  cousins not much older than it was  Everybody who was big enough and steady enough was going to get to hold it  cuddle it  gurgle to it  and say how pretty it was  or handsome Wouldn t you have loved to be that baby     Kurt Vonnegut  So it goes  And so  in the span of two days  I finish this rather simple book which  initially  seemed like Nothing Much  Yet here I am  writing a reflection of sorts because this book  in its narrative convulsions  has left some sort of metaphorical bruise on me  Perhaps it will go away quickly  For now  though  I can recall most of the feelings I had as I read through the novel Any war book  when written  should be handled with responsibility and knowledge  One must know the ins and outs of war and its repercussions because mass slaughter is not a topic which should be dealt with in a light fashion  Vonnegut handles the issue wonderfully I feel  as I close this book  as if I am emerging from a long crusade  hah  or journey  as if I  too  have been alongside Billy Pilgrim during his many adventures of sorts  In the beginning  however  I had no idea where I was going  In fact  when I first began to read the first  and then the second  and then the third  and so on  chapter of the book  I thought this would be another boring war novel  The only reason I read past the first chapter was because the narrative wasn t too boring and there were quotes on the back cover proclaiming this book to be a  funny  sad  and delightful  book   I guess quotes on the backs of books actually do things  As I read through the book  I mostly observed and read  Only when I closed the book did I stop to think about the overall message and the rather confusing aftertaste that this plot had left me  At first  I was confused  What did I just read  And then it slowly creeped on me how profound this book really is    And here I am  my memory of the book clear enough to create a puddle for me to splash around in as I write this review  or an excuse of a book review  What I get out of this book  now  is the idea that life goes on   so it goes    death is not permanent  simply an illusion of time   and that any war is a children s crusade of blindly flailing soldiers who had  previously  been optometrists or doctors or professors or high school teachers  That war is simply the haphazard bringing together of lost humans with eclectic thought processes  ranging from the belief in Tralfamadore to a false sense of wisdom to useless patriotism  I know I may be very wrong  but these are my impressions Many ideas underscore the plot of this story  One of them is repeated multiple times in this book  It is   So it goes   Perhaps it is now my favorite quote because it poignantly expresses everything in life  Well  someone died  This happened  Life ended  Life began  But what does it all mean  Nothing  The world goes on  So it goes This  to me  is a powerful message because it isn t just about  nobody cares what happens to you   It s the fact that there are greater forces in this world  as the Tralfamadore aliens say  that govern what happens in life  It is not so much a matter of fate  destiny  or will  but simply fact  Time is an illusion in which we live and accept as reality  but what will happen will happen and what has happened has happened   The moment is structured in that way   I love that line  too  It almost lifts the burden off of every second of life  every hesitating moment in which we reflect or look down at our toes and ask ourselves   What am I doing right now   and more importantly   Am I doing the right thing   Sometimes  the prospect of trying to do the  right things  in life is daunting  intimidating  It seems too lofty an expectation for feeble minded humans to fulfill  Perhaps it is  And this book  Slaughterhouse Five  untangles those scary mysteries  Perhaps there is a right answer to life  a  best choice  to all decisions  But does it matter  What will happen will happen  The moment is structured that way  Each moment is  There is nothing we can do  we are who we are and we will do what we will do Vonnegut also touches on the idea of death and eternity  He says that life will run its course and that we will live a life that is eternal because once we exist  our existence will last to the infinities in every dimension  This is an idea which I  too  have contemplated in my own silences  To see it written in such an odd yet poignant way is exciting  It is true  I think  Our existence is affirmed by ourselves  in a way  and once we are here  we are here forever  Time  to us  is a one dimensional one way highway  but that does not mean that what has passed no longer exists and what will happen is yet to be made   But that s just abstract theory meddling  Another idea that Vonnegut underscores is that Billy Pilgrim is one representative of every soul in not just war but also life  We are all like Billy Pilgrim  like Roland Wary  like Paul Lazzaro  like Edgar Derby  We are all lost  groping for answers  tripping over our own thoughts  We are all afraid  searching for a friend  fearing loneliness  yet losing friends  running into tough luck  We are all unstable  lashing out in times of fear  promising ourselves protection while  at the core  being unsure of our own existence  We are all proud to some extent  trying to convince ourselves that we are in control  sometimes losing that confidence and realizing that we are victims to an intangible self element which we will never quite understand The more I think about it  the more I like this book  I would rate it very highly  but I feel as if I should not rate this book  That it exists as it exists  and that you  yes  you   should pick it up and skim through it one day  perhaps a very detailed skim  so that you too can understand how beautiful this confusing narrative is It is also of interest that this book is written in a very matter of fact  light tone  Wikipedia calls it a satirical novel  and it is indeed a very satirical one  Mostly because it makes war such a  matter of fact  topic with such ridiculous inserts  especially Kilgore Trout s novels   How can these light  seemingly absurd details weigh into the topic of war and Billy Pilgrim s struggles  In exactly the way we view our own selves and their happenings  Vonnegut s narrative style creates such a tangled mop of ideas and happenings that it resembles closely how we try to deal with our own ridiculous lives  Funny  isn t it  the way we try to deal with the future as if we will be prepared for what will happen  when really  we know as much about what will happen tomorrow as we do about the beginning of the universe  Vonnegut s use of comedy solidifies the illusion of life and uncertainty and also how frivolous this entire  life  thing is  And  thus  the frivolity of  war   What will happen tomorrow  Nobody knows  Perhaps we ll live  Perhaps we ll die  So it goes Everything which happens in this book  seemingly sudden  seemingly ridiculous  seem to outline the very important fact that life is life and what happens happens  So it goes  Vonnegut says  So it goes  Classificacao 4 5 estrelas para o melhor livro anti guerra que ja li  Uma historia confusa  sem linha do tempo definida  infinitamente triste  e ainda sim engracada  ironica  comoventemente sarcastica A forma em que o autor escreve   e como o protagonista e relatado   pode ser um tanto confusa no inicio  com todos os saltos temporais  fatos verdadeiros e ficcionais  ja que o autor foi realmente um soldado que vivenciou o bombardeio de Desdren  durante a Segunda Guerra Mundial Por muito tempo adiei essa leitura  ja que o livro e constantemente comparado ao Catch 22  com o qual tive imensos problemas para ler  Mas  sinceramente  fora o humor ironico  nao encontrei nenhuma semelhanca e me encantei mais com a escrita de Vonnegut  com toda a certeza  O humor auto depreciativo e as figuras de linguagem que ele utiliza  de forma tao sarcastica  comovem desde o instante em que o leitor percebe a imensa tristeza por tras da historia O enredo nao e apenas nao linear  como tambem muda de ponto de vista ao longo da narrativa  a tal ponto que se confunde o que e o personagem ficcional e o que e o autor  o que encanta ao longo do texto e tras com mais intensidade a sensacao de realidade e sinceridade do autor Recomendo que assistam os dois videos feitos por John Green  no Crash Course  que podem ser encontrados aqui e aqui O livro inteiro e quase um quote gigantesco  apesar de todos os saltos temporais  os sintomas de estresse pos traumatico e a forma enganadoramente desumana como lida com a morte  mas uma frase e especial  What we love in our books are the depths of many marvelous moments seen all at once  Acho que nem precisa dizer  mas para todos os leitores e especialmente para os apaixonados pelo tema Segunda Guerra Mundial  esse e um livro praticamente obrigatorio  Mari The Reader   After reading over the reviews of from people who did not enjoy this novel  I can say that I am a little upset by the shallow criticism of this book  Once I have finished a book  I like to  let it sit  for a day or so to wrap my mind around it all   this being the time I read said reviews  I have finally come to this conclusion  those who gave it a poor rating did not understand the purpose or comprehend the piece fully  For instance  one complaint I found from someone was the over usage of the phrase  So it goes   She claimed that it was enough to drive her insane because she came across it so many times in the novel  However  since it was meant to represent Billy Pilgrim s unique outlook on life and death  I felt each one of them necessary  Every time a death was mentioned  this phrase follows immediately after to remind the reader that this person or animal is only dead in this one moment that has been described  but alive and well in plenty of other moments  In another review I skimmed  someone gave it one star because of the  error  in the title  So trivial  I thought this book was a wonderful adventure that was meant to challenge people think on a non linear plane and alter their previous conceptions of time and space  Behind all of these jumps in time and bizarre encounters with an alien species is a man who was so deeply altered by his experiences in WWII that he has convinced himself he is a time traveler  Vonnegut has given us a glimpse of what is going on in this veteran s head as he tried to have a normal life with a family and career of his own  I would like to recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a unique adventure that  in its own way  provides a unique insight to the working minds of those who have seen and experienced what most of us could never imagine   Slaughterhouse Five was on my  to read  list because of its acclaim  so for me it was medicine that I wanted to take  This was an uncomfortable novel  but certainly an important one  as Vonnegut painstakingly outlines his anti war stance and the far reaching consequences of war Billy Pilgrim is a reluctant participant in war and his experiences in Dresden are always with him  He suffers from post traumatic stress disorder  and spends his life  traveling in time  along his personal timeline due to his experiences with space aliens who have a non linear approach to time  For them  what has happened has happened  and always will happen  This is a pretty hard novel to describe  especially when one s brain is addled by jetlag  but is one that will stay with you  and provide many points to ponder I listened to this on audio  which helped me move along as it was pretty dense and hard to follow because of the time jumping  Eventually I got into the rhythm of it and was glad to have read it The time travel device was interesting  for me I likened it to reflecting on memories  or visiting old haunts  The process of reflection transports you back to that time and place  and to who you were then  and hence we are all time travelers once in a while  I ve never read anything by Vonnegut before  so I thought I d start with his best known to start me off  This book touches on some very controversial topics without addressing them as such and almost making a joke out of them  For one  the levels of sanity and mental health of the main character Billy Pilgrim and I wondered whether all the events mentioned actually happened  The most obvious one would be whether Billy was actually abducted by aliens and held in a zoo  the time jumps are also something to speculate over  but also just happening to live near his favorite author and surviving a plane crash  During the war it is likely that Billy saw numerous unthinkable acts  or heard disturbing stories  and he was very clearly unwell for the entire time he was a prisoner of war  It is my interpretation that Billy never actually makes it out of the war  so it goes  At least not through the course of this book anyway  and that all his experiences of his future  his fate  his wife and other planets are actually just his method of dealing with the atrocities that he has witnessed or is currently surrounded by  It is stated that Billy is not the most intelligent man  probably around average if his thoughts and actions are anything to go by  and perhaps this would be his unconscious method of dealing with the war  After all  most  maybe all  I m not too sure  of his time jumps occur while he is in some state of unconsciousness  Whilst on Tralfamadore he questions almost as if asking an unknown deity why the human race is so cruel and why they cant live together in peace  and the answer he receives is that it could not be any other way  because everything has already happened  After this moment he seems to embrace his insanity to further help him deal with the brutalities of war  because he makes himself believe it has to be this way  which is why he is unfazed by everything that happens after that Overall  I thoroughly enjoyed this book  Whilst it was an easy read  it was packed with a hidden complexity that keeps on expanding the more you think about it  I recommend it highly  This book give you an understanding of the harsh reality of war  what really happens in them  the violence  the death  the carnage  the emptiness  In this book Vonnegut tries to empart upon his readers his feelings about war to the point where you can almost feel how deeply it has affected him It is so short and jumbled and jangled  Sam  because there is nothing intelligent to say about a massacre  Everybody is supposed to be dead  to never say anything or want anything ever again  Everything is supposed to be very quiet after a massacre  and it always is  except for the birds  And what do the birds say  All there is to say about a massacre  things like  Poo tee weet  The question hangs throughout the book   What happens after war  Billy Pilgrim is the answer to this question  He is broken and ruined  the things he saw in the war weighs down on him  it shows how it ruined his relationship with his family  it haunts him even years after it has passed  The Tralfamadorians teach acceptance and living in the moment  relishing good memories and accepting bad ones  This book is without a doubt a classic  If your into the universe and whether it actually exists or contains a meaning in life then Slaughterhouse Five is for you  At a first read I thought the book was confusing and out of order  Till the second time I read it I through I understood a bit more better  The idea of Tralfamadorians is more interesting than I thought it was  Vonnegut did an excellent job of writing about WW2 with a side of humor served with it  I think that this book actually did get me thinking a lot and almost broke my mind at some point  I feel like it does help me question about the things in life in general and the idea of WW2  One concept in which I believe to find most interesting is time traveling  I feel like the topic can be discussed in a numerous amount of ways and this book can be used as evidence to back up claims  At some point I think you as the reader will want to argue with Billy Pilgrim about his experiences  To tell the difference between reality and insanity goes hand in hand to discuss after reading this book  Though it can be argued about what this book really represents I enjoyed it much to the extend to highly recommend this to others   Years ago  while studying screenwriting  the class I was in viewed the movie Slaughterhouse Five because of its sly dramatic structure  At the time  I remember thinking that the movie was a brilliant visual example of Post Traumatic Stress  with triggers and dissociation  coming unstuck in time  and flashbacks  Since then  I periodically return to the movie to remind myself of how dramatic structure can be done  but I hadn t read the novel  In fact  I hadn t read any of Kurt Vonnegut s novels  but still admired and respected him greatly Now  I ve read the novel Slaughterhouse Five and I thought it was brilliant  Vonnegut shows what living with PTSD would be like  and I believe that he was writing from direct personal experience  As a prisoner of war  he was captured after the Battle of the Bulge   he survived the Allied firebombing of Dresden during WWII  Structuring the narrative with flashbacks allowed him to approach the firebombing of Dresden in an oblique  safe way  and contrast the war experience with civilian life after the war  Billy Pilgrim can be a frustrating character to follow    he s extremely passive  reacting to his circumstances or not  but never being an active participant in the experiences  Vonnegut allows himself to be The Narrator and is never far away  sometimes stepping into the scene and identifying himself and something that he said  While he wrote the book during the Vietnam war  and there are those who believe he s also commenting on the social upheaval in America at that time as well as the war itself  I thought his canvas was much broader  accessing an anti war stance through his own personal experience of what war does to the human psyche One thing I especially liked was the first chapter  Vonnegut takes the time to talk about himself to set up certain sounds  circumstances and events that became triggers for dissociation  or Billy Pilgrim s time travel  and memory touchstones  A careful reading of the first chapter will reward throughout the story  therefore  and bring the psychological experience into sharper relief  So it goes   This phrase sentence appears after every mention of death of any kind  whether a human death  animal  etc  At first  it struck me as being kind of glib  but after a while  it became a punctuation mark on a universal truth    the impermanence of physical existence  Death is inevitable  It s not a matter of if  but when and how  Oddly  it never sounded like resignation to me  just an acknowledgement  I m glad that I finally read this short novel  my first experience with Vonnegut s writing  I plan to read more of his work  I respect this book and Kurt Vonnegut for the terribly perfect writing he did in it  but I really did not enjoy this book  I don t think many people enjoy this book  though  so that s okay  It s depressing  pessimistic  and disturbing in all the appropriate places  It is a fantastic anti war novel  though I shouldn t simplify it so extremely  While I did not find it as hard to read as Catch 22  mainly because it was not the same repeated message ad nauseum   it still is a difficult book to read  like reading a book about racism or genocide  I m glad I read it  I m glad I won t read it again   The first Vonnegut book i ever read   the best  i wanna read it again   watched the movie made after reading the book it was okay    i absorbed as much Vonnegut as i could after this one   he rarely lets me down i ve not read quite everything he s done but i intend to    everything he did seems golden in my book  back in the 90 s i jammed around a little bit and knew some guys in a band called Laughterhouse 5  THAT was a brilliant name for a punk rock band  What a satire science fiction philosophy work of art this book is When i was reading it something terrible happened in my life   i stopped reading it to deal with things   eventually i picked it back up   finished it   5 big ideas in the book still ring in my mind today   i guess i would have learned all this at that time  even if i hadn t been reading Slaughterhouse     too many coincidences synchronicity going on for me to keep track    anyway Those ideas were Time is not necessarily linear to all of us Unreliable narrators are everywhere Revenge is NOT  the sweetest thing in life  Post traumatic stress disorder is very very real Just think  So it goes  where death  dying and mortality occur  In it  he  Mr Rosewater character  claims that Dostoevsky s novel  The Brothers Karamazov  contains  everything there was to know about life     I just about agree with that    Vonnegut also references The Marriage of Heaven and Hell at one point  when talking about William Blake   Yes siree   Me   my wife made a trip to Indianapolis  Vonnegut museum   they have quite a nice little library museum shrine to the man  I recommend going sometime if you are a fan  There are never enough good things to say about Vonnegut or his books I would be so bold as to say if you don t like him you would probably not be someone i would want to be friends with  This story begins with a small introduction by the author  This does little to explain what is to come  or even who the author is  but serves to give a brief introduction to the idea of the novel to follow and its main character Billy Pilgrim  From the second chapter on  the story of Billy Pilgrim is told in third person  with the occasional reference from the author to himself as he does appear from time to time  The narration of the entire story is straightforward and to the point  with little embellishment of the plots taking place  making it feel like a true account of the events unfolding The interesting thing about this story is that it takes place across many  many years and quite a few different settings  but most of it occurs out of sequence  The main character Billy has the ability to drift through time  or so he says   and so tells the story of his time in the war  particularly his time in Dresden  through these random time leaps  My favorite setting was Tralfamadore  the alien planet to which Billy was abducted sometime in the 40 s  This story line has little to do with the rest of the plot  but does add an interesting element to the story overall  Being an anti war book  obviously there is a war setting as well  Billy survives the bombing of Dresden  and Vonnegut draws a beautiful comparison between Dresden post bombing and the surface of the moon which I adored Of course the overall message or moral of this story is that war is destructive and never worth the waging  Vonnegut s descriptions of the horrific aftermath of the bombing of Dresden  the treatment of POWs  and the effects of war on the soldiers after they have returned home truly brings to light how damaging war can be on a personal level as well as a global one  This novel is considered to be the greatest anti war novel ever written and I am inclined to agree with this  and not only because I am already a massive fan of Vonnegut s work I have never before read an anti war book  so I have no other experiences to compare this to  but I definitely plan on picking up some more books along the same lines as Slaughterhouse Five  I am without a doubt an anti war advocate  not that I do much actual advocating   and believe that wars are mostly caused by man s arrogance and belief in their own entitlement I did say that I was a fan of Kurt Vonnegut before I read this book  but in all honestly I have only ever read one other novel of his  I read Slapstick  Or Lonesome No More   a few years ago and absolutely loved it  It immediately became one of my favorite books of that year and Vonnegut just as quickly become a contender on my favorite authors list  As much as I loved Slaughterhouse Five  I think I do prefer Slapstick just because the material is more suited to my interests  But really  they are of equal quality Overall I absolutely loved this book  I always love Vonnegut s writing style  it is unlike any other author I have read  The characters were very well developed and by the end of the story I felt as though I actually knew them and had hears Billy s story from Billy himself  The time travel aspect was done very well  very subtly as to not overpower the message the book was trying to convey  I have one more Vonnegut book waiting for me on my shelf that I am very much looking forward to getting to  and I plan on eventually reading all of his works  I just feel that his stories and his way of telling those stories are so unique and different from anything any other author is doing now  I definitely encourage anyone interested to pick this book up  I think it is a great book to start with if you are interested in reading Vonnegut but don t know where to begin  and it is just a wonderful novel overall  I love d  Cat s Cradle  Easily one of my favorite books  so I had to get my hands on as much Vonnegut as possible  It is just now  retrospectively  that I truly appreciate the complexity of the book  The fantastical elements of fourth dimensions and alien abduction  and the very real reality and cruel irony of war are mixed together so well  The cyclical narrative and the time jumping contribute to a sense of chaos and disorder  while cementing the idea that things that are meant to happen  just happen  It is funny and nuanced  often at the same time  After this work  I did a little extra reading about it because I was still trying to work out how I should view the war  because while Vonnegut clarifies that this is his book about Dresden  so much of the work is centered on other things  I read  and I agree  that the Tralfamadorian model of time is meant to show us that there are good moments  and that those moments are  have and will happen forever  But there are also terrible  awful moments  moments like the bombing of Dresden  and they re permanent and fixed in time  too  And that s how life works  So it goes   I never read this book in high school  and in fact I didn t know anything about it  which probably explains why it took me so long to pick up  For some reason  I confused  Slaughterhouse Five  with  The Jungle  by Upton Sinclair  which never really interested me Anyways  I loved this book   What an interesting plot  In fact  it made me wish that some of the fictional characters were real so I could read some of their novels    Small spoiler but Billy Pilgrim  the protagonist  ends up being  unstuck in time   transporting to memories in the past or in the future  what a weird idea  a memory of the future  and because of this  he has such an interesting outlook on life since he knows what s coming I was really confused for the first half of the novel  it was easy to read  but hard to follow  if that makes sense    being  unstuck in time  makes for a very jumpy timeline  I ll have to re read this someday The novel was bitter and poignant and surprisingly humorous  I d recommend it to anybody Also  Ethan Hawke did an awesome job narrating the audiobook of this  I am Billy Pilgrim  Reading Slaughterhouse Five for a second time is itself a  coming unstuck in time   zapping this reader back to the nineteen year old self who read SH5 the first time around  And then the reader finds himself  from one paragraph to the next  a few decades older  on another continent  reading those same pages This book is about  among so many other things    the anarchy of memory It s about trying to marshall the accumulated experience of a lifetime into some kind of cohesive  coherent narrative  It can t be done  At least not the  cohesive  part  We don t live  we don t remember  with a narrative arc that wins over literary agents or whoever  We are walking down a hallway at work while a fragment of a song carries us to some other part of our lives from years before  and then back again  remembering what we re supposed to be doing  urgent bullshit sending us hurtling into the future  and and andAnd Slaughterhouse Five  This supposedly nonsensical  herky jerky  cut and paste storytelling is Vonnegut s honest attempt to relect the way we experience life  Which is what literature is supposed to do Coming unstuck in time  At nineteen  I just knew that post modern lit was going to be my thing  But then my post modern manifest destiny got derailed  as I was left cold  again and again  by every so called post modern book I came across  Coming unstuck in time again  and here I am now  at forty four  concluding that Slaughterhouse Five is easily the most successful  readable  and  authentic  post modern novel I ve ever read  Sure  there are a few nods to Heller and Pynchon here and there  but whereas Pynchon makes my blood curdle with his cynical and cryptic hyper goofiness  Vonnegut s absurdity is earned  real  lived through  I love absurd humor when it pops up and spontaneously speaks to me as a reflection of those terrible and not so terrible unanswerable questions about life that I hide from in every other waking moment  That s the absurdity here  Not the wink wink literati glitzo absurdity of Pynchon that makes me slam his books shut At the end  this is a very touching and gentle novel  despite the cut up format  Within this bold innovative framwork  it effectively demonstrates the complete idiocy of war    A very traditional tale of woe  So it goes It s also a surprisingly easy read  Vonnegut s lightness of touch is deceiving  though  Because Slaughterhouse Five will stay with me  and indeed it has stayed with me  or to be precise  it has stuck with me  while I ve been getting unstuck in time  Finding a book that makes you pause to reevaluate yourself isn t common for me  but I can t stop thinking about this novel This novel stresses a hopeless theme towards war  with an anti war tone combined with the perspective of someone that knows that we simply accept war  Because  in this novel  nothing can be altered  even if Pilgrim knows it will happen  And planets away  even without all our issues  war is present  It has been  and will be for God knows how long Billy Pilgrim is a character that you can both relate to on every level and on not a single level  Billy  with his perspective of time travelling and Tralfamadore  is unstable for all the reader knows  He could be  in this universe  correct  or he could be just a bit off  from both the war and his father  And with the open narrator  it leaves the reader all that much more room to think I have the feeling that no matter how many more times I pick up this book  I will never bore of Billy Pilgrim  or Dresden  or Tralfamadore  My second favorite anti war novel after  Johnny Got His Gun   This novel is about so many themes but primarily  at its base  it is about war and the negative effects of war on the people who participate in the military  the people who are affected on the ground  the people who are left behind and even the post war generation as Billy Pilgrim s son finds his way to Vietnam Vonnegut is such a great story teller because while he imparts this really heavy information   a great example being the animal cruelty as they use the hurt and starving horses to go plundering the empty houses of the victims of Dresden  he is able to tell it in a way that has a light touch without losing the importance of the message This book has been around for a long time and I won t rehash it  I just recommend for those that haven t read it to pick it up and spend some time with it  For high school students  grab the study guide and really understand what you re reading  and for those that have already read it  read it again  Let s raise a glass to the departed Vonnegut and say  So it goes    SO IT GOES Okay  so this was my second Vonnegut book after a loooooong time after reading the first one and oH MY GOD IT WAS AMAZING  This makes me war to pick up every single one of his works and read them again and again  First I was absolutely enthralled with the style of writing  As simplistic as I found it  it still kept me interested  The way of writing as though your grandpa is telling you an old war story was comforting and also gave me that awe shocked look on my face  as though I could never believe these things actually happened to people As for the story itself  I think it is widely known that this IS a fictional book  however it has to be taken into account that Vonnegut himself fought in the war  and a lot of these stories did actually happen  even though the names have been played with Moreover  I also really loved the messages I personally got out of this book  I liked Vonnegut s passive way of dealing with death   so it goes    Although I can see how some people may have found it offensive  what I got was that death happens  it s inevitable  and life moves on for the rest of the world after someone dies  even if that someone is you I read this book extremely quickly  given the amount of things I had going on this week  and that too was a really good sign to me  This is definitely one of my favourite books of all time  EVERYTHING WAS BEAUTIFUL AND NOTHING HURT  Billy Pilgrim came unstuck in time  and ate while he was dead  He survived the bombings in Dresden  which killed 1 35 000 people  He became an optometrist and married to a rich man s daughter  So it goes The author  who himself was present during the bombings in Dresden  which killed more people than atomic bombing of Hiroshima or Nagasaki  fact which is contested  according to some sources the numbers of killed were around 25 000   presents fictional yet semi autobiographical account of the time with an eccentric literary style rarely found  Its first chapter is actually a preface  somewhat fictional   wherein Vonnegut talks about how he came about to write the novel and also why the book is also called  The Children s Crusade   The narration is disjointed and uneven  all the while trying to connect the time of Billy in the army with his later life  The protagonist rarely shows emotion or realization of any kind  which reinforces the impartial nature of the novel  In introduction to the 1976 edition  he wrote  The Dresden atrocity  tremendously expensive and meticulously planned  was so meaningless  finally  that only one person on the entire planet got any benefit from it  I am that person  I wrote this book  which earned a lot of money for me and made my reputation  such as it is  One way or another  I got two or three dollars for every person killed  Some business I m in  Regarded as a great anti war book  ironically  it was banned in schools and removed from libraries  There is no sacrifice  courage or patriotism to find in this book  it mockingly presents the war in its raw form  Having a darkly comic style  the book as a whole questions the bombing and ultimately the war  There is no thrill  suspense or charm of any kind  yet it is difficult to put the book down  It presents the war as it is  with almost no opinions and reservations whatsoever Read it for Dresden  for spotless and correct depiction  for the taste of something which is not fresh or delicious just curious  I didn t really get this book the first time I read it  I think  in a sense  that is a sign of its brilliance  If you are expecting some grand human tragedy about the folly of war  this is not it  It is something far more ambitious and strange  Vonnegut s crazy  time hopping narrative refuses to allow any meaning to emerge out of the ashes of Dresden  Nothing I have ever read manages to convey the sense of the incomprehensibility of war Just a tip   when you read the first chapter   CONCENTRATE  This book had this strange ethereal quality about it whilst reading it  There was a plot  yet there wasn t too  there were characters  yet they didn t all seem to exist in reality  there were ideas  yet they could be read in so many ways and I think the fact this book could be read in so many ways is what made it so great for me One thing which really stood out to me is the concept of time and how the past  present and future are all happening and have happened  as if life is the endless cycle going round and round  I found this quite an apt description given that this book heavily focuses on war as it suggests it s a thing we never really want  a thing we re forced into  but a thing which will always shape us  Like other people reviewing this  even though were quite a few hints of an anti war message throughout reading this  I don t think that was the central point  I think Vonnegut just showed how war and humanity are always entwined  and there s nothing we can really do about it  which I guess is why Billy always seemed quite passive in regards to it The science fiction aspect of the story surprisingly didn t bother me as much as I thought it would  It was just another way humans tried to deal with horrible things  It was quite touching to see how intricate this world was and how much it meant to Billy  and it certainly did make you really think about the lasting impact of war and how the horrors of it never really end  as I think we focus on the war itself too much and not what comes after it A fantastic book  and it s certainly made me want to read more from this author   Trout  incidentally  had written a book about a money tree  It had 25 dollar bills for leaves  Its flowers were government bonds  Its fruit was diamonds  It attracted human beings who killed each other around the roots and made very good fertilizer   God I love this book  This is of course followed by the apparent Vonnegut magnum opus phrase of  so it goes   The irony of that phrase is people asking about its significance here and there  But it s the Tralfamadorians who explain it   it just is   Slaughterhouse 5 is the halfway point between Catch 22 and Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy in plot  if you could call it that  absurdism  and satire  It s biting  funny  sarcastic  nihilistic  and somewhat hopeful all at the same time  It s a shame the book doesn t have more of a climax and isn t a bit more accessible  but that s also its greatest joy  There s so much ridiculous shit that goes on in Billy s escapades  or in his mind  that s written so fluidly  descriptively  and in some cases disgustingly that when it finally stops grinding at a lightning pace on the rails it flies on  it s kind of nice to hear poo te weet as a summary of what you ve just read  It s a messy and absurd life  and Slaughterhouse 5 is a compulsively readable and thoroughly indulgent little novel that holds up the glass to society but also does some fun tricks with it and twirls it around space and time  So it goes  The purpose of Kurt Vonnegut writing this book was to put his experience of World War II and the Dresden raid into words and make hopefully to make money off of it  The main theme of this book  I think  is the inevitability of fate  Vonnegut successfully portrays this theme with the Tralfamadorians  The Tralfamadorians can see in the fourth dimension while  Earthlings  can only see in the third dimension  In the fourth dimension the Tralfamadorians can see every moment that has happened and is to happen  all at the same time  Because of this  the Tralfamadorians know everything that is to ever happen  This is why Billy Pilgrim says  so it goes  recurrently in the book  because he nor anyone else can prevent or change what is fated to happen This book is written in a narration and description style  It is a narration because it is the telling of a story through events  even though it is not in chronological order  It is a description because Vonnegut makes the reader  at least for me  feel like they are experience the events first hand  I think that these styles worked for Vonnegut because I was engaged throughout the entire story and never lost interest in it I am not usually one to like classics  but I enjoyed this one  I liked that the plot was non linear because  even though it was confusing at the beginning  it made the book exciting and it made me feel like Billy Pilgrim was actually time traveling or  unstuck in time   The only thing I disliked about the book was the way that Billy died  I did not like that Paul Lazzaro hired someone to kill Billy as revenge  I did not like that because the impression I got of Paul was that he was one to make threats  but not carry through with them  Besides that  I would not change anything about the book  Slaughterhouse Five is unlike any book I have ever read  but it has made me want to read more of Kurt Vonnegut s books  This is a book that we all read years ago when it was first published  Kurt Vonnegut took the sci fi community by storm with his fresh style  Time travel is always popular  but he included it in a very unique way  Billy Pilgrim is such an unlikely hero and the satiric tone of the retelling of events of the war opened many discussions  So many years had passed between my first reading and this one  that my memory was not clear about actual themes  etc  I believe that now  with more experience and age  I appreciated the entire book in many ways I could not when I was young  Also  the prologue and epilogue conversations  this was an audio reading  were especially special  They sounded so low key  as though the conversations were being held in my living room and lent another level of understanding  I am seriously considering reading this in print all over again just so that I can better appreciate the style of writing at a slower pace and in that manner think over some passages more leisurely  I first read Slaughterhouse Five around the age of 15  and it didn t do much for me  it didn t have a clear  linear plot line that I could get into  I was a smart kid  sure I got that the firebombing of Dresden was horrific  and was acutely aware that war is pretty pointless in general  I just didn t get the story  it was just weird I read it again in my mid 20s and liked it a lot more  I found it to be a poignant  darkly funny commentary on the absurdity of war and human existence in general  It still wasn t one of my favorite books  though  or even my favorite Vonnegut story  having also read Breakfast of Champions  Cat s Cradle  The Sirens of Titan  and Welcome to the Monkey House by then Most recently I read it about three years ago  in May of 2011  at 36 years old  Upon my third experience  I found it to be one of the most moving books I ve ever read  blisteringly witty and insightful  absurdly hilarious  yet all with a really painful  personal undertone that only Vonnegut s experience as a POW could have given him  At this point it s probably tied for my favorite of his  along withMother Night  It s amazing what a couple decades of life can do to one s perspective  So it goes It s one my my favorite books  it s widely considered one of the best novels of the 20th century  and it s 18th on Modern Library s best novels of all time  If you ve never read Slaughterhouse Five you need to drop everything and read it now  If you read it in your youth  or even as an adult  and you didn t quite get it  read it again It s worth a second and third and fourth read  I am really looking forward to reading it again in my 40s  The writer of this review finished reading this novel at 6 41 in the evening  February 11  2015  Somewhat disturbed  slightly dismayed  and most definitely rattled  she sat and thought Sat and thought  Sat and thought  An airplane flew past  its passengers all 30 000 feet lost in their own cubicles of lives She had been handed war in a milk carton  Do not drink it  Mr  Vonnegut instructed her  but simply peer into the flimsy cardboard box  Look at the inside  Dip a finger inside  And then she accidentally spilled its contents all over herself Spoiled milk  spilled milk  war The stain would fade  but that single act of spilling  that mere instant  would never ever be entirely gone  Ten years from now she will sit in a seminar on World War II  and remember the milk Twenty years from then  she will happen to cross paths with a veteran in that corner supermarket  and the slaughterhouse will resurface Little  random beads of daily life skitter around  Some will slip by  Other beads will stick on  And a select few of these beads will be blue  ivory  and wartorn Sometime between this century and the next  this girl will have decomposed to dirt and slivers of bone And so it goes  This is Vonnegut  so I can t see going into too much detail    butBeautifully crafted  Weird but haunting  Vonnegut s story revolves around Billy Pilgrim  a small town optometrist who was a POW in WWII  Billy time travels  and  was abducted by aliens and shifts his consciousness nearly continuously from beginning to end  Plot isn t front and center in the book and the narrative just glides to the end  And all of a sudden it s over  But it doesn t even matter  It s so well done that the usual concern of getting where we are going is secondary to how we get there  Vonnegut s apparent point that war is terrible and life is full of difficult moments is brought home through his use of the repetition of the phrase  So it goes  along with giving Billy the ability to jump from time and place to remove himself from difficult situations  Several times  mainly in bits featuring the aliens  the concept of focusing on the happy parts of life is emphasized  Although I don t know that I d describe Billy as happy at any time in reality  Billy had to escape reality to find happiness following his experiences in war  I m glad I finally read this  It was not assigned in school so until now I hadn t picked it up   Sure  I could attempt to write a review of  Slaughterhouse 5   but I cannot say it better than Wisecrack  Check this youtube video out  https   www youtube com watch v JBY9q   What I can say  though  is how much I appreciated this book  first and foremost for the head line message it offers  WAR IS ALWAYS A BAD THING Sometimes we tend to forget this  Sometimes we don t care because the wars raging our world seem not to affect us first hand  Often they happen far away and we simply shrug  thinking  this does not touch me   Well    wrong   it does  It always does  even though you don t notice  Near  far  wherever  WAR IS ALWAYS A BAD THING and its victims are too often innocents   and if you count yourselves among said innocents  that might as well mean you  In today s society we seem to have forgotten the meaning of words like  humanity  and  compassion   It might very well be that you are not first hand involved in war  but so many others are  one way or another   most of them not choosing to be involved  but simply are put in the middle by circumstances  War is a choice   a very bad one at that    and yet for some there s no possibility to say  no   to simply get away WAR IS ALWAYS A BAD THING Remember that  A banned bookDeciding to read this book as my first Kurt Vonnegut book was a little intimidating  I didn t know much about the author himself other than how highly praised he was as a modern American writer and pacifist  After this book  I now see how well deserved those praises are I had no expectations going into this novel  The jarring and jumping around narration took a little while to acclimate  however  this device is very well utilized in telling the main character s  Billy  story and his coping mechanisms  The science fiction element is a bit out there  but in relation to Billy s traumatic experience  it can be believable how a survivor could resort to this outward thinking  I also like the running motif of  And so it goes   however morbid it may be  I most likely would not have fully appreciated the theme or moral of the story if I d read this back in high school  Having 20  years of life and work experience  witnessing the world s various wars  seeing the destructiveness and consequences of war for both sides  especially the innocent bystanders and those left behind  has brought perspective and made the book more relatable  even timeless I definitely would recommend this book to everyone  I have become a fan of Vonnegut s writing  honest  straight forward  and unafraid  Easily the best book I ve ever read where I simultaneously have no idea how to sell someone on reading it  It was on my to do list because it popped up on a list of 100 Books to Read Before You Die  It got bumped to the top of my to do list because  after a three month break from reading for fun to edit a book I wrote with a friend  I wanted to start with something short and also on a lot of historical  Best Of  lists  That way it would be win win  If it was great then it was great  If I hated it  then at least I had a new opinion on a historically popular book that I only had to dedicate 200  pages worth of my time to reading Fortunately  it was great  The gist of it is that Billy Pilgrim is abducted by aliens who don t see life as a linear series of events  After the abduction  Billy s life is told to us in a non linear order where one page he s fighting in World War 2 and the next he s being born  Maybe a lot of my love of the book came from how impressed I was that Vonnegut managed to tell such an insane sounding idea in a way that completely makes sense as you re reading it  The other part was the writing itself  It s beautifully written in a very unique way  It s not poetic like Shakespeare  it just seems like a stream of consciousness from a man with a decent vocabulary  Still  between the structure of the story and the simplicity of its pieces  it ended up being more revealing about life than any other book I ve read My greatest frustration with it is that I can t pitch it to someone in a way that even I find convincing as to why they should read it  That two sentence summary I gave sounds like madness  But despite that  I ve rarely been more pleased with how I decided to spend my time than I was with the time I spent on this book  I usually give a full summary of the books that I ve read  but suffice it to say that this book is basically about war and the horrible effects of it  It is satirical  not unlike James Heller s Catch 22  One of the main differences between the two works is that Heller s novel is massive  approximately 500 pages  whereas Slaughterhouse Five is a slight 215 pages  This is not to say that Vonnegut doesn t impact readers as much because this work is definitely gut wrenching  The horrors of war are honestly explored through Billy Pilgrim s mental breakdown  He travels back and forth in time  detaching himself from the present whenever he is triggered by latent war memories  The descriptions of his moments in war are insufferable  There are men with blood soaked feet wishing for their mama  train cars packed with shell shocked soldiers who just want a decent place to sleep  and freezing men who are forced to wear the coats of dead soldiers  It s all too much  but it s so true  One of my favorite passages in Slaughtehouse Five is on page four when the narrator is talking about writing a book about what happened in Dresden  a place where an unspeakable war atrocity occurred    You know what I say to people when I hear that they are writing anti war books    No  What do you say Harrison Starr    I say   Why don t you write an anti glacier book instead      What he meant  of course  was that there would always be wars  that they were as easy to stop as glaciers  I believe that  too  This passage couldn t have been more true during World War 2  and is still true today in 2014  Vonnegut s masterpiece is a reminder of what war is  it s debilitating  absurd  dehumanizing  and downright ineffective  It s an important read for all of us  Wow   I discovered my first Vonnegut on a second hand book stall in Brighton when I was nineteen  and fell in love for a lifetime  I soon read  Slaughterhouse five  and have been uplifted and consoled ever since by Vonnegut s idea of each life s consisting of indestructible moments  always there  never not there  revisitable  I got permission to quote his moving summary of this idea in a memoir I wrote for a dear friend who died  and I wonder if it was Vonnegut  not me  who won the New Delta Review Non fiction prize for that piece  Reading  Slaughterhouse five  as a book group pick now  I see how much darker it is than I had remembered  Billy Pilgrim s time travelling  and his Tralfamadorian view of indestructible moments  many happy  none tragic  can be read  as those around Billy read it  as evidence of post traumatic stress rather than as visitation by wise aliens  For Vonnegut and for me too  they are no more than ideas that help to keep human folly and loss from becoming unbearable  Deceptively simple  A profound masterpiece  Foreword  this is much less a review than my own personal exploration of my journey of understanding when it came to Slaughterhouse Five  I find reviewing classic novels fairly difficult given their widespread knowledge within modern culture  So much has already been said that there s no chance what I am writing is in any way original  And so  I felt that an exploration of my personal experience with the contents of the book was the best approach  Read at your own peril Call it what you will   literary fiction    classic novels    books of literary merit   but I have never been one to actively enjoy such literature  a fact that I find disappointing in my reading habits  Sure  I excelled in my english classes throughout my education and had no trouble grasping the concepts in such novels  but when it came to my personal reading list I have had little to no interest in stepping back into the literary waters  In recent memory the only two  classic  novels I ve read that weren t for an assignment were The Picture of Dorian Grey and The Jungle and neither of those were very complex in the themes presented within their pages So enter Slaughterhouse Five  a novel that has been on my to read list for literally years  Heralded as one of the quintessential anti war novels and a personal favorite of my father  there was no adequate reason for why I kept not reading it  I love the works of George Orwell  Ray Bradbury  Isaac Asimov  all of whom I categorize under the same  literary sci fi  blanket that I place Vonnegut  If there was any novel that would ease me into the waters of literary merit  it d be this one  And so  finally  after years of postponing it I sat down and read Slaughterhouse Five I didn t get it Don t get me wrong  individually I think I understood the different themes Vonnegut was going for  The overall sense of predetermination vs  free will that Billy struggled with after his meeting with the Tralfamadorians  I understood the difficulty in putting into words the horrors Billy the narrator witnessed after the bombing of Dresden by the allies  But I couldn t piece these two themes together and figure out what Kurt Vonnegut wanted the readers to take away from the novel My lack of understanding felt like a failure on my part  Here was this book that so many people told me I d love  a book that carries weight in the book community and yet contained science fiction elements that are much maligned amongst  serious readers   And I couldn t understand how it all came together  My disappointment with myself was nearly palpable Thankfully the internet has made the locating of critical essays on the subject easily available to me and after some  out of class  analysis I figured out key pieces of knowledge that I was lacking in that hindered my enjoyment of the book  For starters  although I swear we spent the majority of 8th grade learning about WWII  I don t recall ever being taught about the fire bombings at Dresden  Honestly  I should have done research on the matter as soon as it was mentioned as it is the crux of Vonnegut s authorial motivations  Secondly  I thought that the bookend chapters outside of Billy Pilgrim s story were from the point of view of a narrator completely unrelated to Vonnegut  I feel that perhaps this has more to do with my modern expectations of a novel than any failing on Vonnegut s part  Once I figured out that what the narrator was saying could be read as Vonnegut s thoughts and fears  the themes fell into place So what did I learn in the end  I believe that the questions of predetermination and whether or not humans have free will was the only philosophy that Billy Pilgrim could adopt in order to cope with what happened at Dresden and his experiences in the war  This philosophy  although not necessarily the same worldview Vonnegut holds  is directly connected to Vonnegut s struggles to write a novel in response to the fire bombings  Both Billy and Vonnegut witnessed the aftermath of the fire bombings and both are overwhelmed by its magnitude  It is easier to comprehend the atrocity if you simply adopt the Tralfamadorian viewpoint of  so it goes   The fire bombings were going to happen  there was nothing anyone  neither Billy or Vonnegut or those giving out the orders could do to stop it  It erases or at least eases the sense of guilt that remains after seeing the needless destruction and death caused by the bombings  In the end  the fact that in order to mentally cope with the atrocities of war Billy had to either have a literal intervention with aliens or suffered a complete mental break with reality and hallucinated the Tralfamadorians is one of the harshest critiques of war that I have seen  We as people brought so much death and pain to our fellow humans that the soldiers who witnessed the end result would rather invent an alien race abducting them and absolving them of all guilt than live with reality  WWII is often referred to as the last  great war  but it not only destroyed those involved physically with their lives but also mentally scarred those who survived So it goes  First Vonnegut Jr  book I ve read  and it wasn t what I was expecting  Don t really want to write something super long and overly analytical   but I will say these things   Kurt Vonnegut is actually a genius  The more I think about it  the more I realize how intelligently written this novel is  Vonnegut is a talent writer  no doubt  mixing beautifully poignant words with a sort of sarcastic  apathetic humor to create an equally harrowing and hilarious book  But he s gone beyond eloquence and subtly laced the themes and ideas brought forth by characters in the book throughout the entire story    Easy read  I have ADHD so sometimes reading can get to be a chore  Slaughterhouse Five was not a chore at all  It didn t demand any special effort in order to retain my attention  Genuinely engaging  though I should note that I had a pre existing interest in WWII material    Classified as  Sci fi   but the content that would ordinarily be classified as such seems  to me  to be more of a metaphor    I didn t ever feel as though I was reading a science fiction novel  just a very creatively told story about a difficult subject  That is all And if you didn t find the above helpful  then perhaps learning that Chuck Palahniuk and Douglas Adams are two of my favourite authors will help you decide if you might like this book   Veteran s day has come and gone and I found myself rereading this as a pure coincidence  The first time through I was admittedly a little too young to get some of the symbolism  the sharp  satirical wit of this novel  And I still might not  get it  all  But what I took away this time was  War can be both necessary and the worst thing humanity has ever done and continues to do  Presidents and generals issue orders to young men and women to fight and die for various reasons  to stop the nazis  to stop communism  to stop genocide  but to commit people to war is to turn them into casualties of it  Some die  some are wounded  and some make it back alright  but having seen the absurdity of it  having seen life extinguished en masse  having accepted their own fate a time or two  their outlook of existence is changed forever  We can read history books about the valor of our country and others  about good men and women who devoted themselves to a greater purpose than their own life  And we can read novels like Slaughterhouse Five which attempt to show us the absurdity of violence  the pungent stench of it  the charred remains  Both are equally important so that we know what a good cause is  that we should fight only when it s absolutely necessary  and never for an instant forget the cost  When I read this book in high school I hated it  I didn t like how self referential it is  that Kurt Vonnegut refers to himself in the first person a number of times  At point in the novel he points out how the book has no action and no characters that make any choices or grow in any way  When reading this the first time  I acknowledged that this was true and it pissed me off  Today  this would still piss me off for most novels  if they were exceptionally long  Thankfully  this is a relatively quick read such that a book with this style and for this piece of social commentary  I find that it works I decide to re read the book after watching the Crash Course Literature episode about the book on youtube This time reading the novel I understood how it was a commentary on the futility of war and how people don t have choices amidst the chaos of it  This time it really worked for me and I thought it was an excellent novel   Slaughterhouse Five is one part science fiction and nine parts harrowing realistic fiction  Kurt Vonnegut has a unique writing style  In frank terms  it relates the scrambled eggs of a life that leads Billy Pilgrim through time  Billy Pilgrim remains passive through love and war  aliens and optometry  The Tralfamadorians taught him that every moment has happened  will happen  and always will happen exactly as it must  That it is about as effective to be anti war as it is to be anti glacier  Billy walks through life experiencing incredible incidences that have little to nothing to do with his personal choices  Billy Pilgrim is coming unstuck in time  All at once  he is a prisoner of war in Nazi Germany  father of two in Ilium  New York  an alien tourist attraction  and a senile widower  We see Billy from birth to death  from a very non linear standpoint  Vonnegut shows us the pointless side of life through the eyes of an indifferent protagonist  Bloodshed  loss  birth and death    they all bleed together for Billy  He can see the beautiful  and the painful  sometimes they make him cry  but he never hurts  His headstone would read  Everything was beautiful and nothing hurt   The Tralfamadorians look at only the beautiful things in life  they ignore all the bad things because there is nothing they can do to stop them  This doesn t particularly make Billy feel better  As it is frequently mentioned in the book  so it goes  I give this book five stars because I ve never read anything like it  It looks into the human mind with surprising clarity  It never romanticizes events or makes them anything more or less than they are  Almost every novel is written about characters who all have great passion for life and love and drama  But where Slaughterhouse Five lacks romantic characters  it exceeds expectations in thoughtful reflections on the world we live in  The only question left unanswered was  Poo tee weet   I recommend this book to everyone over the age of twelve   This book is a hard book to explain for various reasons  so this is going to be a kind of short review  Slaugherhouse Five is a pretty excellent sci fi book that I wish I read earlier  It circles the life of Billy Pilgrim  who was at Dresden when it was annihilated  There are a few things that make it different from other novels of this sort  First  post Dresden  in order to deal with the pain of the war  Billy reads a ton of science fiction Billy is then  taken away  to the planet Tralfamadore  where time is not as finite as earthlings make it  On this planet  Billy falls in love with a star named Montana Wildhack and has a child before returning to earth  Secondly  on earth  he time travels  which means that the book is not in chronological order  There is not necessarily any major antagonists or climaxes or anything of that sort  and each chapter is a foreshadow and or a flashback due to these time travels I enjoyed Vonnegut s elaboration on the idea of time  as well as his the writing style he has in this novel  I love how everything sort of ties in at the end  the narrator s entrance back into the book  the  Poo to weet    etc  It s a mix of history  science fiction  war  and pretty much a ton of genres mixed into one amazing novel  I overall really liked this book   I really don t know how to review this book  Not because it was bad  mind you  because it was far from bad  More because there is almost too much to say that I can t even say a fraction of it  Plus it really is such a cleverly constructed book that I feel like I can t do it justice  I can say something about it being anti war  because that s what I ve heard about Slaughterhouse Five and I do get a sense of that from the book  but I m not really qualified to say much about it  I ve taken a few days to digest Slaughterhouse Five  and I ve not gained any more insight towards it  Okay  the writing style  Perfect for the story  Matter of fact  short  sharp sentences  Random facts  Each in itself is a simple statement  but put them all together and we get a mosaic  made up of fragmented ideas  Plus it felt vaguely reminiscent of The Book Thief  with the climax of the story not tied to specific linear storyline events per se  but with the how  How the events came to be  the necessary circumstances to bring them about  To quote a certain Miley Cyrus   Ain t about what s waiting on the other side  it s the climb   And then the story itself  It really was quite brilliant but in so many ways that it escapes me  I just can t pin it down  Was Billy Pilgrim really a time  and space   traveller  or was he just mad  I don t know if there s meant to be an answer to this  or if it s deliberately vague  I loved the little moments that Vonnegut inserted the narrator into the story  It took away from the fantasy and made it real  made it poignant  It really made me pause  I had to take a break from reading  and think  About what  I m not sure  but I found myself suddenly grounded after drifting along on a surreal adventure I think my favourite thing about Slaughterhouse Five is how bleakly it portrays our lives  We really are insignificant things  caught in something called  time   filled with our own self importance and need to achieve things  be somebody  do something  This really hit home with Billy Pilgrim s marriage to Valencia In short  great read  will definitely be chasing up Vonnegut s other novels   From what I gather from Wikipedia  Vonnegut s other novels center around characters that made cameo appearances in Slaughterhouse Five   Hopefully it will leave you slightly less befuddled than I am now So it goes  I had heard about Kurt Vonnegut before I read this book  But except for the name  I knew almost nothing about him or his books  Hence  I did not have any expectations  I thought this was just a book among others and not something special  But I was wrong The book starts with a chapter that I thought was a foreword by the author  He writes about how hard it was to write the book  his sources and how he struggled finding a good story  I later understood that this is actually a part of the book and everything he says is a part of the story  His life and the life of the main character Billy Pilgrim is connected Even though just some few pages in the book actually describes it  the theme of the book is the allied bombing of Dresden in February 1945 and maybe war in general  How stupid and useless it really is  Is this an anti war book  Yes  I guess  But it is strange  Strange  interesting  dark and with some comical parts  But in a sad way  But mostly strange Billy Pilgrim is  unstuck  in time  He cannot control it  but suddenly he experience past and future parts of his life  He is a soldier in WW2  is captured by the Germans and lives as an prisoner of war  He experienced the bombing of Dresden and struggle with his life after that  One day he is abducted by aliens and forced to live in a zoo on their home planet  He lives  dies and lives  Jumps back and forth in time Is he really unstuck in time  Is he really abducted by aliens  Or is it just his way of dealing with the war All I know is that the book is strange  interesting  sad and a little bit funny in a dark and tragic way  It is a kind of timeless book that makes you think The book is a classic I recommend  but I do not except everybody to like it  It is something different and I guess you have to read it yourself to understand  I first read this book in Mr  Shalcrosses  class in my junior year of high school  To this day  I recall that class with very fond memories  In particular I remember vividly writing an essay on this book The thesis was this  that the whole novel was a Swiftian satire of the idea of surrendering to fate  At the beginning of the novel  powerless characters march through a depressing forest and are captured  The protagonist   unstuck in time   flits between scenes in his life with essentially no agency  People are born and die  So it goes  While I thought vaguely that there was a kind of logic to such an outlook  I suddenly  realized  that the book was actually directly opposed to it  The moment of revelation came in the scene where the Trafalmadorians destroy the universe in a failed experiment they know in advance will lead to this result  Argument From Apocalypse  If an ethical system would lead to the destruction of the universe  then it is a bad ethical system  As I have gotten a bit older  my views have softened a bit  I do still think that this is a book that should boil one s blood  Get people to fight and struggle against war and stupidity  rather than submit  But there is something to an Amor Fati as well  Not all struggles can be won  to be upset over the inevitable is madness  and human agency is limited  It is finding the right balance between fighting and accepting that is the message of this novel  and in my opinion it is the best book out there on the subject   So it goes So goes one of the most horrifying novels I have read in my life  I have just reread  Slaughterhouse Five  by Kurt Vonnegut  which I first read about 40 years ago  in translation Billy Pilgrim is unstuck in time and relives various fragments of his life  in the US  in Europe during World War II  when he meets Kurt Vonnegut  the author   in particular during the destruction of Dresden  and as a zoo exhibit on planet Tralfamadore  It took me over a week to read this short book  I just could not stomach the truth about the wretched human species  I am embarrassed by being a member of a species that burns their members in ovens  bad guys  the Germans  did that by millions in concentration camps  or boils schoolgirls alive  good guys  the Americans  did that by thousands in Dresden   I am embarrassed by how wars are in the very human nature  how mass murders cannot be avoided  How the wars are fought by children  when most adult soldiers are dead  How absurdly random human lives are I do not like the Tralfamadoria bit and do not much care for the Kilgore Trout story  yet this is a great book  a must read  a masterpiece  The blurbs on the cover scream  Poignant and hilarious   Yes  absolutely  Hilarious and very  very  very sad   Nobody held it against him that he dropped jellied gasoline on people  But they found his halitosis unforgivable  But then he cleared that up  and he was welcome to the human race   And poor Edgar Derby  who has survived the unimaginable horrors of war  is executed for stealing a teacup  I really think that whoever is proud to be a human might be an idiot  Birds are smarter  they can say  Poo tee weet  Five stars    VONNEGUT S Slaughter house   five thrilled me with aliens from a planet called Tralfamadore abducting a person named Billy Pilgrim before WWII  The theme of the book is Alienation and Loneliness The life lesson is to be courageous  The authors style is serious I like that it is written in this style because the author gives a big sense of seriousness Its funny without laughter Yes because it talks about the war and the place in Dresden The author s narrator s voice is serious and sturdy It is unique from the other books i have read  The characters in this book are Kurt Vonnegut Bernard O Hare Mary O Hare Billy Pilgrim Roland Weary Edgar Derby Paul Lazarro Valencia Barbara and Robert Yes you can see them as a person because the author gives imagery so you can picture the person in your mind I like the characters but my favorite character is Billy Pilgrim because he is in WWII and before the war he got abducted by aliens and they took him to their planet called Tralfamadore and after they were done testing him they took him back to WWII My favorite quote is  if you protest if you think that death is a terrible thing then you have not understood a word I ve said   The setting of the book is in Dresden in the year 1967 It compares to the world i know because the same things happening with ISIS Yes the author does make me feel apart of the setting because he gives great imagery to where i can picture it in my mind Yes i can because he gives great thoughts for imagery to where you can close your eyes and picture it and you can picture being in Dresden in the year 1967  The plot is about a Guy named Billy Pilgrim that is in WWII and is remembering the past in the war and about him getting abducted by aliens before the war started they took him to a planet called Tralfamadore and they ran tests on him and soon after they transported him back to the war And in the future he remembers the war and what happened so he tells people what happened before and after the war  Yes i can compare this book to cat s cradle Yes this book relates to current events because the ISIS is a good example No this book does not connect with me on a personal level   I recommend reading this book you haven t read about WWII until you ve read this book  This is the story of Billy Pilgrim  a soldier who does not carry a gun and would probably end up shooting himself with it if he did  He becomes a prisoner of war and experiences the bombing of Dresden  After the war Billy insists that he was abducted by aliens  No review I could write would better this by John Sutherland  On the night of 13 February 1945  three months before the end of the Second World War  Kurt Vonnegut was a POW sheltering in an underground animal slaughterhouse during the devastating fire bombing of Dresden  Slaughterhouse Five  Schlachthof Funf  was the shelter from the slaughter   We got through it  Vonnegut wryly recalled   because we were quartered in the stockyards where it was wide and open and there was a meat locker three stories beneath the surface  the only decent shelter in the city  So we went down into the meat locker  and when we came up again the city was gone and everybody was dead  We walked for miles before we saw anybody else  all organic things were consumed   Vonnegut and his fellow American POWs  exhumed at dawn from their underground coffin  were set to work  corpse mining    excavating blackened bodies for a second cremation on open piles  The live meat took care of the dead meat Vonnegut survived the slaughter to write Slaughterhouse Five  1969   Thousands didn t survive  In the novel  Billy Pilgrim  the unheroic hero  is a POW in the same shelter as Vonnegut during the devastating fire bombing  He too survives   but he goes crazy  Vonnegut published many personal accounts of his Dresden experience   as well as that in Slaughterhouse Five  The following is from an interview in 1974   I was present in the greatest massacre in European history  which was the destruction of Dresden by fire bombing     The American and British air forces together killed 135 000 people in two hours  This is a world s record  It s never been done faster  not in the Battle of Britain or Hiroshima   In order to qualify as a massacre you have to kill real fast   But I was there  and there was no news about it in the American papers  it was so embarrassing   RAF estimates later downscaled the civilian casualties to a  mere  35 000  But Vonnegut s point stands  Fiction  like history  has been generally silent about Dresden  Victors  as Hitler said  write history Lives of the Novelists  A History of Fiction in 294 LivesThey also forget the embarrassing bits  Vonnegut himself had almost insuperable personal difficulties writing his  Dresden novel   He had to forge an entirely new  schizophrenic  technique  weaving realism  SF schlock  little one eyed green men from Tralfamadore  resembling toilet plungers   and slapstick social comedy into a startlingly innovative pattern The thesis of Slaughterhouse Five is T  S  Eliot s   mankind cannot bear too much reality  Life is so horrible  that only fiction can deal with it   and  crucially  the more horrible the life experience  the more fantastic  unrealistic  the fiction  After Auschwitz  Theodor Adorno famously declared  poetry was impossible  One of the underlying contentions of Slaughterhouse Five is that after Dresden  fiction  specifically  War and Peace  fiction of the old Tolstoyan kind  is impossible  A way out of the impasse was science fiction  Billy Pilgrim  a time and intergalactic traveller  or  more likely  merely nuts  ends his post Dresden pilgrimage incarcerated no longer by Nazi Germany but by aliens from the planet Tralfamadore  some 446 120 000 000 000 000 miles from earth  whither he has been transported by flying saucer  widely believed in during the 1960s      Interestingly  Vonnegut himself did not call Slaughterhouse  Five a  novel  but  more awkwardly   my Dresden book   Billy Pilgrim is not Vonnegut but a fellow POW called Joe Crone who did not survive the war  Crone was  like Billy  comically malcoordinated  a soldier doomed always to be the platoon klutz  He let himself starve to death before the firestorm and is  buried somewhere in Dresden wearing a white paper suit   Vonnegut resurrected him Vonnegut did not  in the conventional sense  write Slaughterhouse Five   it rose out of his subconscious like a slow bruise  Immediately after the war he found he could not remember the event   There was a complete blank where the bombing of Dresden took place     And I looked up several of my war buddies and they didn t remember either         The first line of first page   All this happened  more or less So it goes  Fatalist  but not defeatist  You have to laugh at yourself or you d cry your eyes out if you didn t  am I wrong  Vonnegut  what a quirky guy  he was our late end of the 20th Century Mark Twain  the biting humor can make my eyes water  if only I could be so adroit in my observations of the world  I try  really I do  I just love his way of telling it like it is and then going over the edge of reality into aliens and time traveling  Was it all about PSTD  surviving as a POW in Germany during the bombing of Dresden is nightmarish enough  why not Whatever  sometimes a writer has to do what a writer has to do to tell the story  making up shit as we go along  and throw in a few aliens to make a point  So it goes  this phrase occurs 106 times  Don t be silly  I didn t count them  I discovered that bit  o trivial trivia on the internet   There were times I wanted to run screaming into the night only because he s right  And it s because he s right and has the audacity to bite the reader in the nose one time too many with truths in disguise of fiction that this book is very often  banned  for its being indecent  anti Christian  irreverent in its relevance  if that makes any sense  Banning books because of their content makes no sense to me whatsoever   come on  ban one of my books   Just that it is still considered controversial sings its impertinence to be timeless  Individuals  or groups  who initiate the banning of certain books are insecure in their beliefs and just can t stand someone else having an opinion that goes against their grain  get a hold of yourself  Please  It s only a book  a book for goodness sake  not just any book  shhh  listen  hear the words  It s Slaughterhouse Five So it goes  This book is terrifying  Vonnegut maintains a light tone throughout that  just like a person who constantly says hateful things followed by claims that they are  only joking   lets you know that he s deadly serious  As I read the book  which I knew was about the fire bombing of Dresden during World War II  I kept waiting for the moment that Billy Pilgrim  the protagonist  would witness the horrible event that had inspired the work  and that hangs over it like a shroud throughout  I expected to be horrified with dramatic depictions of the horror and the cruelty and the needlessness of the attack  I expected to be pummeled as if I were reading a literary equivalent to Saving Private Ryan s opening scenes from the Normandy invasion  Instead Vonnegut treated the incident with the same banality and hidden human tenderness with which all the cruelties and absurdities of life are treated throughout the book  And I realized that was far more horrific than any R rated depiction of graphic violence I d ever seen  More disturbing  More powerful  And in many ways that matter more than visual depiction  more true  This is one of the most powerful books I ve ever read  and certainly the most haunting  effecting account of war or violence I ve ever experienced in any storytelling format  So it goes     PTSD  mustard gas and roses  blue and ivory  barbershop quartet  various triggers  Kilgore Trout  Billy relates to the time warps in his flashbacks and the sci fi nature of his books  One book was about robots who dropped petroleum     on towns killing the people in it but they were judged instead on their halitosis  Once their halitosis was remedied  they were accepted by others  Ha    Soldiers killed for freedom and justice and whatever but they were  killing  to achieve it  supposedly  The bombs and fires    violence as the equation for peace    soldiers in the war having no character  in terms of personality  morals    all of that goes away when you re in the war    Great similes  feet like blood pudding from wearing the clogs  ughhh   coughing colonel s lungs rattled like greasy paper bags  bugs in amber  The passive attitude towards death and death s frequency   so it goes    Billy s son Robert as an image of how joining the military  specifically the Green Berets  changed his character into a seemingly better man    Some funny parts  O Hare s wife asking if O Hare and speaker want more ice  Speaker says there was plenty of ice already due to her hostile attitude   Great lines  the big hollow man who was so full of loving echoes  Philosophy of time  things just happen  there s not necessarily a reason  and what difference does a reason make   All moments  past  present and future  always have existed  always will exist  When I grabbed this book in the early hours of the morning I did not mean to actually read it  I had others plans  I had chosen something else  For some reason  though  I decided to take a look at the first sentence  who am I kidding  I always do that when I buy a new book   I guess life really does happen to us while we are busy making others plans  for I only put the book down for a nap  It was the last thing I saw before I fell asleep and the first thing I reached for when I woke up What is Slaughterhouse Five about   All this happened  more or less  It s about everything and nothing  at the same time  Kurt Vonnegut wrote it in such a brilliant way  I am still in awe  It s so much more than what it seems to be at first  I was really not expecting this  Billy Pilgrim leads us across the four dimensions  across time as it is and as it will forever be  Past  present and future  Always there  always ready  always now  if so you wish it to be  I think you guys are going to have to come up with a lot of wonderful new lies  or people just aren t going to want to go on living   We do what we have to do to survive  We convince ourselves of certain truths  we tell ourselves certain stories    and we carry on  or at least we try to  That s one thing Earthlings might learn to do  if they tried hard enough  Ignore the awful times and concentrate on the good ones    The book follows Billy Pilgrim  a young man who doesn t really fit in anywhere  as is a soldier in the last year of WWII  He is captured and endures awful conditions  He and the other POWs are one day cleaning the windows in Dresden  spend the night sheltered in a meat locker in the slaughterhouse while bombs fall above  and find total destruction the next day  130 000 have died and they  the POWs  have no food or water  How can that not change a person  How can one deal with that  How can people see and do horrific things and then come back to regular life  Since we can t seem to stop fighting with and killing each other  these questions are as relevant today as they were then The book looks at the lines between life and death  between reality and fantasy  and between internal and external processing of information  Billy processes everything internally  he is abducted by aliens who try to help him understand life on Earth  he is half dead when in the war and half living when he is back at home and working as an optometrist  His mantra of  so it goes  when someone dies and appearances of the aliens who use the 4th dimension  time  to do away with death remind the reader of the relationship between life and death  and to note each death  The Dresden deaths  the death of Billy s wife and all the others along the way are mentioned as a sign of mourning that loss This is an anti war book  The senseless destruction of war   of people  of homes  of ways of life are conveyed through an underlying sadness in the book  It also spoke to that generation of soldiers who came home and didn t talk about their experiences  Billy s family didn t know the details and perhaps didn t care to know  though his wife asked about the war   Billy dealt with his pain through time travel and trips to an alien world  On one hand  it s a testament to the resilience of the human spirit  on the other hand  it s a sad commentary on mental health care It is not only a wonderful book  but it grabbed me emotionally and wrung my heart   I loved this book  Before I read this one  I had read Cat s Cradle  and I wasn t in love with it  I really enjoyed Cat s Cradle  but I was a little disappointed  as everyone just sings Vonnegut s praises  Now I know why  I liked this book a lot better than Cat s Cradle  and it s not one of my new favorites Plot  I don t even know what to say about this plot  It was so different  and didn t have a linear structure  but yet it wasn t confusing  If any other author attempted this it probably would be very confusing for the reader  but I was following along the entire time  I m not even going to give a plot summary other than it leads up to the bombing of Dresden  and it involves time traveling aliens  It s a great time  I thought the pacing was much better in this than Cat s Cradle  I was more intrigued  and I was never bored  I liked how it switched time periods every so often  so if I was bored with one time  then bam  it would switch to a different time  Besides just the plot itself being very amusing I loved the messages behind it all  I loved the themes it presented about war  and time  What really made me think were what it  or rather  the aliens  said about time  All the ideals that they talked about in the novel really made me put the book down  and think about time  life  and death differently  I honestly just think the plot of this book is genius Writing  I loved the writing in this  I loved how straightforward it was  while still having wonderful metaphors and similes throughout  Sometimes when you have writing like this  where the sentences are shorter  and there s a lot of dialogue  you can loose some of the more  poetic  aspects  and I m glad that this book didn t loose them  I loved the word choices  and how some of the metaphors  such as the prisoners being liquid  extended to more than just one moment in the novel  I thought it was really funny  and it had me chuckling at times Characters  There s not too much to say about the characters  as this book really wasn t about the characters  but about what they represented  Although  I did like them more  and I was more attached to them  than the ones presented in Cat s Cradle  I actually did have some feelings towards them  and I think they were crafted really well  I liked how they were all unique  but yet still believable Overall  This was quite a short review  only because I feel like there s not much to say about this book other than   go read it  I really think it s a great piece of literature  and I really  really enjoyed it  I will be checking out more of his work in the future  but I m not sure if anything will be able to compare with this one  Aside from the occasional sentence fragments that made the story a bit awkward  Vonnegut conveys his message clearly and through a great story  The phrase  so it goes    I felt  was a tally of the death and destruction that the war in the novel caused  while at the same time reminds the reader that death is a part of life and cannot be stopped  I m hearing that Slaughterhouse 5 is not an anti war novel  and I imagine that for those who didn t see it as one were bored out of their mind because there was no climax or it ended rather boring and with a  what now   Kind of feeling  But that was the point The point through out the whole novel was to see how absurd war was  How absurd that Edger Derby was killed for taking a teapot after a city with no military standpoint was destroyed and how that city was destroyed particularly for revenge  or at least that s what it seemed like for me   If you read this book and didn t see how absurd war can be  you are either as cruel and ruthless as Professor Rumfoord or as dumb as his wife  the simple syntax of the content is easy to follow  yet carries a strong punch  every sentence leaves you with a sly smile and a slight chuckle   sometimes laughing out loud with strange people staring at the weirdness of the reader  Vonnegut is a great  satirical writer that knows how to get into your head and tickle your pink matter  all puns intended   the way the scenes are painted with a nude imagery and perverted innuendos place a good feeling of human nature in our hearts and opens our minds to start thinking about what perspectives other beings might have on this race  we might not be so bad after all  even though billy makes it clear that we cannot change the future  he is lugubrious about his destiny and thinks of how things could have been so much better if only he had done something differently  there are very important lessons in this book regarding human nature and how family will always be there for you  even if you have some sort of psychological grudge in your subconscious blaming yourself and your childhood experiences about your current situation  the hobo is also another example of how the author emphasizes the need to be detached from insignificant human events  and to remind ourselves that there s is always someone in a condition requiring help  and we can t do anything about it but help ourselves and our surroundings  what we can t see is beyond our control  I highly recommend this book to people looking for an exciting  satire that contains contemporary themes that still resonate with some of the issues in the Middle East and Eastern Europe  Great book  OK  I should start this review by saying English is not my native language  so there is a big possibility for me to make mistakes  Don t pay any attention to them  or correct me  I ll say thanks A few months ago  I got a translated copy of Slaughterhouse Five to my hands  I read it  I loved it  Later I read it in English  I loved it  I never thought of writing anything about the book  You see most of the time I have these love of hate relationships with books  So my opinion about this one  as I said before   I loved it Today  sitting with my relatives  I understood that there is a way for me to review this book  My mother You see my mother reads very rarely  she prefers watching TV in her free time  saying she doesn t have time for reading   and when she does read some book her friends recommended  it takes months for her to finish it  Not to mention she says she hates anything fantasy  blood  sci fi  war  guns  torture  etc  related Anyway  I was very exited after I finished Slaughterhouse Five  It was the best book I read in quite some time  so I just naturally went to my mom  showed the book and said    This is a book about war  time travel  aliens and it has a mental illness  You must read it   My mom laughed  Buuut I convinced her to at least try it  And what do you know  She finished the book in three days and now she can t stop recommend it to everyone  I mean it  Everyone  The conclusion to this review is simple  Stop reading reviews  Read the book  Nobody will ever read this review  there are so many others on here for this book  Guess what  I don t care This is my favorite book  It s simple yet complex  funny yet tragic  truth yet fiction  insane yet it makes perfect sense  Kurt Vonnegut seems like he would have been such a great man  If I could bring back 5 people from the past to have dinner with  I would bring 5 Vonneguts  His writing gets inside your thick  know it all skull and makes you realize that everything you know is wrong and everything he says is law This book  like all of Vonnegut s writing  has many different messages  It s against war  mainly  but there is so much more within that  The moral of the story  for me at least  is this  nothing in the world is alright  but everything is going to be alright  I won t bother to talk about the plot  what plot    but I will say that this book changed me  I am a pessimistic optimist and I owe that all to Vonnegut s books  You learn something new every time you read one  and Slaughterhouse Five is a great place to start  Give it a chance  embrace the weirdness  and fall in love I hear the girls in college read a lot of this guy s stuff  Ladies  eat your heart out  I read this book in one day  The friend who recommended it to me read it in one day as well  I had no intention of doing so  and had no idea of what to expect  All I had heard was that it was a classic war novel  with a brilliant sense of imagination and humanity  and so I figured I d give it a shot  being a classic and all  I started it in the morning  and found myself lost in the experience  one of the likes I have never had before  Somehow  my day of reading felt secluded  as though it stood apart from my daily life  ignorant of the reasons behind my interest  Like a bug trapped in amber In this work  Vonnegut somehow manages to balance a few of my favourite  contradictory aspects of literature  It seeps with eloquent absurdity  and fits in moments of poetic excellence  being extremely quotable  I was most surprised by its incredibly poignancy  that shined regardless of the frequently one dimensional characters  in fact  to quote Vonnegut himself   One of the main effects of war  after all  is that people are discouraged from being characters   They feel allegorically relevant  and fitting for the novel s length  The novel is to the point  but when I say that  i m not referring to a straightforward writing style  but rather an efficient execution that just feels    important  Not to mention that the use of recurring phrases and situations is masterful  and the story s structuring is ahead of its time  For example  the opening chapter is misleading  and yet one of the strongest introductions I have ever read I ve never had so much to say about such a short work  and yet  I m speechless  At the moment  it s my second favourite novel  Maybe I m biased  as many of my favourite novels are classics  but this novel truly feels timeless  and above all  weirdly accessible  A favourite  It sinks in and its message  whatever it is  endures  Misery  justice  hopes and horrors  pain and prospects  peculiarly human things  and Vonnegut cracks into them and says so much in so few words  After all  there is nothing to say after a massacre  You must have heard the immortalised words  so it goes   They follow every death  instance of misery and tragic irony   So it goes  is a sombre acceptance of human fate and frailty   of  Billy  whose head  was encased in a steel sphere he could never take off  and who  had no choice but to say to himself   That s life    It is simultaneously full of resentment  anger and brimming with indignity  Vonnegut screams from behind the pages of simple language and allegory  As he writes in the first chapter  Slaughterhouse 5 isn t an anti war book  It s simply a war book  As such  Slaughterhouse 5 is barbed with emotional sensations   I mean to say  it s sad  Miserable  Funny  It s a confusing  intelligent mess After you read the book  and choose  for whatever reason  not to immediately read it again  reread the first chapter at least  Perhaps my favourite part of the whole book occurs there  and it s didactic  Here it is  I looked through the Gideon Bible in my motel room for tales of great destruction  The sun was risen upon the Earth when Lot entered into Zo ar  I read  Then the Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the Lord out of Heaven  and He overthrew those cities  and all the plain  and all the inhabitants of the cities  and that which grew upon the ground  So it goes Those were vile people in both those cities  as is well known  The World was better off without them And Lot s wife  of course  was told not to look back where all those people and their homes had been  But she did look back  and I love her for that  because it was so human So she was turned to a pillar of salt  So it goes   This book was so good  I want to read more of Kurt Vonnegut s work  he is a great writer  It was really funny but tragic at the same time and I liked the repetition of certain things  so it goes   To me this book was sort of like Farewell to arms and the time traveller s wife  I also liked the realistic WWII aspect paired with the time travel and aliens science fiction aspect  There were also a couple illustrations with some quotes that was kind of a fun surprise  everything was beautiful and nothing hurt   This book was not at all what I thought it would be Billy Pilgrim is the main character and the narrator knows him because they fought together in the war  Billy is a terrible soldier  he is super inept and is never even given a weapon  He is captured with some other Americans by some Germans and they are held at an old slaughterhouse in Dresden  Germany called Slaughterhouse 5  Throughout this time  Billy travels through time  but in chapter 2  you are given his whole life story and it is then broken down further  I normally hate books where they tell you what happens right away but enough was left out in this one to still make it interesting and new  Billy grows up to be a successful optometrist and makes lots of money because he married a rich girl  Valenica  who is sweet but very fat  At one point  Billy is involved in a plane crash and Valencia is told he will either die or be a vegetable  Valencia gets in a car crash because she is so upset and dies of carbon monoxide poisoning going to the hospital  Billy is also kidnapped by an alien race and put in a zoo with a famous actress that was also captured  The aliens are peaceful and only want to observe the humans  I thought the aliens were super interesting  They can see in 4 dimensions and interpret time a lot differently than we do and people are not dead but alive but everyone is alive at different points in time  I loved this book  I am normally averse to most WWII literature  but I already knew I liked Vonnegut as an author  so I figured I d try it out  I started out mostly confused as to what was going on  It wasn t until about half way through the book until I conceded and just went on spark notes to figure things out  Once I did however  the book really opened up to me  and I started to enjoy it  The use of time leaps as a plot device was quite a creative concept and I really liked the way the author used it to show the chaotic nature of war and how war continues to actively affect ones life far after it ends Vonnegut adding in the Tralfamadorians also revealed a lot about Billy Pilgrim s character  It showed the resignated attitude he had developed toward life  as well as his cynical belief that there is no free will  A belief fostered by his miserable journey as a POW  Overall  Vonnegut proved himself wrong  In the first chapter he says that there is nothing good or intelligent to say concerning war  when in fact the unique writing style and creative plot of Slaughterhouse 5 ended up being both of those things  Definitely would recommend this book to anyone looking for a deep and powerful book to read   So it goes That single phrase is repeated throughout this book  creating a rhythm we the central character s life as a series of vignettes  He has been unstuck in time  but if the Tralfamadorians are to believe  all of time is always happening simultaneously and so it doesn t really matter what we receive the story in This book is about was  but not the glory of war  not the fighting  the winning or the losing  Just how it goes  The phrase sums up the whole world perfectly  It is simple and matter of fact the story is somber and honest  sometimes slightly comical but always deeply moving  Was Billy Pilgrim really abducted by aliens who helped him to see the world more clearly  or was he driven mad by the horrors of war  in the end it doesn t really matter It gives a view of lived shaped by a war that they mad pretty much just stumbled into  It doesn t so much make you pause and think as opens up your whole mind to thoughts as you continue to read  It s abstract narrative makes it a book not easily summed up in words  It is certainly one i will not forget in a hurry  A book I can t believe it took me so long to read again  So it goes  The often absurd tone of this novel perfectly reflects the absurdity of war  I m pretty amazed that I know as little as I do about the Allied bombing of Dresden  It s really glossed over in history class  and in history in general  Part of the reason why I ve always loved Vonnegut is that he is so darn witty in that simple  rather smart ass style of his  Following the thread of a plot isn t as important in this novel as is finishing the book with overall feelings of amusement  sadness  and pleasure  And I must say I felt all of them    An American near Billy wailed that he had excreted everything but his brains  Moments later he said   There they go  there they go   He meant his brains  That was I  That was me  That was the author of this book     Kurt Vonnegut  Slaughter House Five Boy  where to begin    well  first of all  of course  is the  So it goes   I have to imagine that among a few of the millions of people who have read this book by now since Vonnegut published it in 1969  45 years ago  were a little annoyed by what is practically a writing tick  And I m sure that any high schooler half my age  but less time travel experience   can explain what it s meant to illustrate  that  98  of the time around abouts  the phrase  So it goes  pops up in relation to death  or dying  or people getting bombed or even if it s Jesus up on the cross  it s effective for the simple reason that  after a while  and not too long  it becomes something else  Though this book is MANY things   a crazy science fiction piece about how to be peaceful with aliens bringing destruction to the universe  a partial non fiction study of the Dresden bombings and what lead up to them  a look at what it means to be a person drifting through time  both physically and mentally  mostly physically   and a  WAR  book that satirizes the fuck out of it    it s really a poem  and a sad one for the  babies  that died in war and were made to fight with guns and bullets and bombs and planes and so on  So it goes is the poetic marker not unlike one would see in one of Ginsberg s poems from the Beats or something  Or maybe I m reading into that too much The other thing is    and I should get out of the way this could very well be my new favorite book  Ever      well  it IS such a ridiculous satire  but so stone poker faced  Vonnegut doesn t screw around  His writing is crisp and very often to the point even as he is circling around  or especially because he circles around and floats about  the story that he s telling which is about Billy Pilgrim unstuck in time  Sentences don t go on long  Like that  So it goes  This makes what is a comedy of horrors and or a horror of comedy  so appealing and engaging  It s not that it s an easy book to read  per say  but rather you want to keep reading it  sentence after sentence  page after page  That s one thing And of course the whole time travel aspect is just outrageously clever and astonishing and really makes you figure out how this guy could be so much of a mixed bag as Billy knows so much   almost everything   about himself  about the war  about the future  about everything  And yet Vonnegut doesn t go over what are important things that Billy SHOULD and DOES remember  as opposed to going back in time to see   so he will go in time and see his work on a patient s eyes in 1958  but remember being in the cellar when the bombs were falling and  miraculous as it is  he didn t die  so it goes  DAMN IT  I can t stop can I But death    oh man  this is one of the big ones  I thought a lot about life and death  more than almost any other book I can think of  in reading this  I was reminded of what was the other book I put in the top tier of books that had a profound impact on me  Weisel s Night  which looked at people dying as just a cold hard fact of things  I also thought about other books that looked at the Fear of Death  in capital letters  a little less directly but still with a serious eye like Tampa  which is also about trying to cheat the passages of time  Vonnegut wants to look at it all  and he does  and he does it so goddamn EFFORTLESSLY  or seemingly so  And yet  there s a lot of anger and pain in this book  and when it comes to the point where Billy is in the hospital bed following the plane accident  where his wife has died so it goeses   and that old Army writer is next to him pontificating about Dresden this and Hiroshima that and Billy addresses simply that he was there and it was  fine  because of Trafalmadore    I couldn t help but thinking Vonnegut hurt his fingers typing out that shite  It s not just about being  anti war  or simply about that  though of course the time and context of when the book was written counts so much   and the author  himself  directly  addresses Vietnam and MLK and RFK near the end  so it wasn t just my imagination   it s about trying to just get a handle on what the hell we are all doing here  what the universe is  And most importantly  Vonnegut wants to make light of  satirize  and yet discuss with dead fucking seriousness  what we can do about it  Maybe not much  Or a little  Try as we might This passage stuck out at me near the end of Chapter 4 between Billy and the aliens  How did I get here   It would take another Earthling to explain it to you  Earthlings are great explainers  explaining why this event is structures as it is  telling how other events may be achieved or avoided  I am a Tralfamadorian  seeing all time as you might see a stretch of the Rocky Mountains  All time is all time  It does not change  It does not lend itself to warnings or explanations  It simply is  Take it moment by moment  and you will find that we are all  as I ve said before  bugs in amber   You sound to me as though you don t believe in free will   said Billy Pilgrim   full round of applause from this reader  just for that alone   Vonnegut may be making fun of the fact that all of us humans  whether we like it or not  carry the power of free will  And yet    what if we just don t have it at all  Everything is designed  We re all baby making machines built to die some day  and yet    live forever as well too     So much to think about  All the ideas  And  unlike Mr  Trout  better writing It s funny too how I have actually started to read this book multiple times  Why I didn t go on  I don t know  A couple of times it was before I had read a couple other Vonnegut masterworks   Cat s Cradle and  another favorite  Breakfast of Champions   other times I just had other stuff to read  But that first chapter alone made me intrigued like hell  What unfolds after this first chapter is a book full of rich characters  many of them ugly specimens of humanity  the fellow soldiers  most of them anyway with the exception of the teacher who stands up to Howard W  Cambpbell Jr  are all scum basically and so vividly described that you can see the wild costumes and rabid mouths   but others actually good people who don t want other people to die  on the contrary are wanting to help people to live like the doctors and nurses and Billy s hysterical fat wife  Oh  and Billy s son  One more thing as I type so much of this review  This was an extremely clever commentary  and one I could just read a lot into  Robert Pilgrim isn t mentioned too much in the book  though when he is it s for the most part as the  Green Beret  and  also  that Billy doesn t really think much of him at all  He s described as a aimless youth without much on his mind and a drop out    and then the military makes him a  Man   Could he have had a chance without the Green Berets  I wonder  Ironically he becomes the thing that Billy wasn t in war  he rarely had a gun   and yet is almost like a footnote in Billy s wild traversing in time  Another Machine built for war  one supposes GO READ THIS BOOK  NOW  READ IT NOW  STOP WHAT YOU RE DOING  GET YOUR HEAD AND HANDS OUT OF THE PORN BOOK SHELVES AND PICK THIS UP  AND SO ON  AND SO IT GOES    Subtlety and simplicity combine to create the most powerful book I ve read  What makes Vonnegut great is his ability to lace melancholy with hilarity  to write fatuously yet cleverly and to sell a profound message with no advertising  Slaughterhouse 5 is a book about events  characters  war and   time travel  It s absurd  I find it truly amazing how this silly little book holds such power  I think it boils down to the fact that the book merely relates a story  our protagonist passes no judgements  we are left to believe what we will believe  There are snippets of profoundness     You were just babies in the war   like the ones upstairs     One thing Earthlings might do is ignore the awful times and concentrate on the good ones  but we are not bombarded  like Dresden   Vonnegut tends to remain impartial and the prose always remains simple and uncluttered  Vonnegut s penmanship is beyond impressive  thats why the novel has such power  He has created an enlightening story that is never didactic  he is able to deliver wisdom without pomposity  This book goes straight to the top shelf  5 STARS  What a haunting  bizarre  fever dream of a book  and I mean that in the best way possible   I am not going to lie  I had difficulty getting into the book in the beginning  The structure was just a tad too overwhelming when I was trying to tackle about 5  of the book at a time  It was when I finally sat down and finished the last 60  of the book in one sitting that I was able to really appreciate the absurdity of the Trafalmadorian plot line and the lack of chronological structure While on one level this book discusses the senselessness of war through the lens of a fatalist and almost catatonic Billy Pilgrim  on another level it looks at the pointlessness of the entire universe  as it has existed  currently exists  and will exist  through the lens of the Trafalmadorians  I actually savored this nihilistic take on the  human condition   pardon the self indulgent cliche   I particularly enjoyed the summaries of Kilgore Trout s books  which served as interesting parables  my favorite one is about the money tree that sprouts dollar bills and diamonds  attracts humans to fight under it and kill each other so that they can serve as fertilizer for the ever growing tree   Vonnegut really packed a lot into this short book  Every chapter  all the seemingly random conversations and imagery  all serve to give us a real glimpse into Vonnegut s brilliant mind  I feel like this book will end up giving me something new and different to chew on every time I read it  but more on that in 2024 when I plan on picking it up again  So it goes   This is exactly this satirical sci fi novel is all about  The unhinged  mania possesses the reader so it goes  The POWs captured in the Slaughterhouse five exactly explicate how the battles of war played on loonies   or to be loonies  For the protagonist being an optometrist is not wiothout meaning too  Extending the idea for vision  for sight  the insight of Kurt Vonnegut sweeps the comprehension with a storm  Another planet Tralfamadore seems a part of you  deep inside as you proceed to lose the grip of understanding  more precise term would be Illusion of Knowledge   Who likes the war  However  still    so it goes    Howard W  Cambell  Jr   now discussed the uniform of the American enlisted in theSecond World War  Every other army in history  prosperous or not  has attempted toclothe even its lowliest soldiers so as to make them impressive to themselves and othersas stylish experts in drinking and copulation and looting and sudden death  The AmericanArmy  however  sends its enlisted men out to fight and die in a modified business suitquite evidently made for another man  a sterilized but unpressed gift from a nose holdingcharity which passes out clothing to drunks in the slums When a dashingly clad officer addresses such a frumpishly dressed bum  he scoldshim  as an officer in an army must  But the officer s contempt is not  as in  other armies avuncular theatricality  It is a genuine expression of hatred for the poor  who have no oneto blame for their misery but themselves A prison administrator dealing with captured American enlisted men for the first timeshould be warned  Expect no brotherly love  even between brothers  There will be nocohesion between the individuals  Each will be a sulky child who often wishes he weredead   My mother has always loved Vonnegut because  as she often says  he writes just a little to the left of reality  This is one of those books that I am honestly surprised I haven t read already  How did I miss him when I was picking up my mother s love of Ray Bradbury and Heinlein  Now this book isn t general classified as  science fiction   but that s what the tone of wonder and awareness reminds me of  Also the aliens  but I ll get to them in a bit In many ways  I think Kurt Vonnegut s life must have felt a little to the left of reality  At the age of 23  he was captured by the Nazis and held as a prisoner of war in Dresden  Germany  There  he witnessed the firebombing of Dresden  arguably one of the deadliest targeting of civilians in World War II  I think this must have given him a unique perspective both on death and on life Slaughterhouse Five starts out with a narrator  that is never directly identified as Vonnegut himself  only heavily implied  describing his journey and his decision to write a book about Dresden  While it appears that the narrator is the main character  in chapter two the book switches abruptly from first person POV to third  As it turns out  the narrator is only watching the story unfold  In truth  Slaughterhouse Five is the story of Billy Pilgrim  himself a prisoner of war and a witness to the fire bombing of Dresden  But in a way  that is only window dressing  Billy Pilgrim has become unstuck in time  He flits between moments of his life at random  jumping from the war to his wedding to his senility as an old man  back and forth and all moments in between  From what I ve heard  this makes it difficult for some readers to follow  but I had no problems At its core  Slaughterhouse Five is an anti war book  Not because the author condemns the soldiers or the generals or the civilians at home  In the very first chapter the book announces itself a failure because  nothing intelligent can be said about a massacre   So it doesn t even try  It skirts around the bombing in a surprisingly elegant  though at times sporadic  dance of moments and thoughts and strangeness  Perhaps the strangest aspect of this book is not its schizophrenic structure  but it s delving into the fantastical  At one point in his life  Billy believes he is abducted by aliens and taken to live in a zoo where he is given a missing adult film star as his mate  The planet s name is Tralfamadore  The reader experiences Billy s time on Tralfamadore as vividly as the bombed out wreckage of Dresden  There he learns that each moment exists forever  That when someone dies  they are only dead in that moment and there are plenty of moments before where they are not I think this is integral to the book  Aside from being arguably the entire point  I feel it justifies the structure  Slaughterhouse Five is not a long book  but I felt no urgency when reading it  It wasn t an edge of your seat kind of book  I had almost no interest in what happened next  but I loved reading it  I loved each individual moment in the book which to me felt whole and satisfying on its own  It made me take notice of each word in a way that I am not generally so aware  In many ways this creates an attitude of inevitability  that what is has been and will always be  because the moment exists forever  Children will always go to war and be killed  Humans will always look for answers and be disappointed One subtlety that appears near the end is the question of whether or not this is all real  This question is not asked directly  and Billy Pilgrim never once doubts his extraterrestrial experiences  but then we  the readers  see aspects of his visions pop up in the work of a second rate scifi author  Did Billy really get kidnapped by aliens  Did he really live in a zoo on Tralfamadore  Or is all of that just a delusion caused by the trauma of witnessing a massacre  Does that make his experiences any less real And then it was over  The ending as strange  as startling  as disturbing  as enjoyable as the rest of the book had been  So it goes   This review was first posted on my blog  http   insideonemind wordpress com 20    All of this happened  more or less   Oh  how wonderful it is to finally understand why this opening line is so famous The book is framed by an apparently semi autobiographical account of how the author came to write his famous anti war story  This meta technique surprised me  as I didn t realise  postmodernism  was quite so old  Then I got to thinking about how calling anything  modern  is so obviously screwing yourself over in the future that it doesn t make any sense and while pondering the supreme ridiculousness of it all I got distracted from writing this very review  So it goes  Okay  I willing to bet that almost every review of Slaughterhouse Five on the internet uses the term  so it goes  semi ironically at some point  and I ve already done the exact same thing  so I ll try to avoid doing so again but can t make any promises  It s already proved far too tempting  I was slightly taken aback by the first few chapters  because I was confused at how such a seemingly silly story had come to be considered a modern classic  Not that I wasn t enjoying it  you understand  it s just that  quirkiness  isn t a trait one would usually ascribe to a  classic  novel  As it turns out  that s the very genius of the book  The realisation gradually creeps up on you without you even noticing  Slaughterhouse Five highlights the horrors of war by juxtaposing it with its irreverent tone and satirical story I remember joking with a friend that  so it goes  is written more times in the first chapter of the book than  old sport  is written in entirety of The Great Gatsby  It wasn t long afterwards that I clocked onto the fact  so it goes  was written after every mention of death or mortality in the novel   Every  Single  Mention   And  so it goes  is a phrase which concisely sums up the entire book  The humour and eccentricity of the term initially masks the fact that Billy is disturbingly detached from the horrors of war I realise I m not writing anything particularly insightful here  My enjoyment of the most famous  and frankly  the most obvious  aspects of the book probably read like a half assed secondary school English essay  but hey  I liked what I liked I think you can ascertain how good any book is by its impact on your everyday life  Personally  I m sure that for the rest of my life  when I m casually browsing the sci fi section of a bookshop  I ll be keeping a half hopeful eye out for a Kilgore Trout novel  I just finished this book for the second time I don t remember when I first read it   I was probably a teen or in my early 20 s  The names and some of the literary devices became reminiscent after a few pages but other than that I couldn t seem to remember reading it It was all very brand new to me  It had a depth and simple poignancy that I think I missed the first time around  I probably viewed it with that detached   this is about war  has a male protagonist  the vocabulary is antiquated  etc  mind set  I had that with a few other books as a young adult  such as Catcher in the Rye But this book was different  There were no great climaxes  just as the author stated  Such is life Good days happen  Bad days happen  Just try to focus on the good ones Because the bad ones will take you off in a ship to Tralfamadore I cried when I read the last two pages of this book I cried because it was over and nothing was truly resolved I cried because it was horribly tragic yet plainly true I cried because the critic in me on the first few pages wanted to once again hate this book because of all the things I thought it wasn t But now  because of all the things I am twenty years later  I cried   Slaughterhouse Five by Kurt Vonnegut Jr  was a mix of different genres for me  not to mention the first audiobook I listened to  Slaughterhouse Five blends fiction  Science Fiction  narrative story telling and war history together into a very bizarre story around a time slipping soldier who served during World War II and witnessed the fire bombings of Dresden  Told from the perspective of an old war veteran  who attempts to bring attention to the atrocities of the Dresden attack  Vonnegut weaves a story around a young soldier named Billy Pilgrim  who discovers he can travel through time to different points in his life  re living them  Billy  however  tells the story of what he saw of the war  when he is actually present in the war   his life before and after  and most notably  his experiences with the Troufamidorians  a race of aliens who are able to view time and space  past and present as a human might view a mountain range What makes the story amusing and worthwhile is the story telling itself  Especially in audio  Vonnegut takes the reader along on a painless story about the pains of war and the soldiers involved  By the end  at least this reader felt like he sat alongside an old war veteran who retold his experiences at a whim  Sometimes the experiences were comical  sometimes brutal and sometimes unbelievable and bizarre  I think I ll find it difficult to say anything meaningful about this book because although it s written in an amusing style it is about terrible things   the experiences of members of the American army during the fire bombing of Dresden in the Second World War  Vonnegut himself was in Dresden at this time  as he says in the first chapter  but writes the story through the eyes of Billy Pilgrim  a chaplain s assistant who became a successful optometrist after returning from the War but who also became  unstuck in time    he may be in Dresden during the war one minute  and then 40 years ahead in his life the next  writing letters to the local paper about the planet Tralfamadore and how he was kidnapped by its inhabitants and kept in an intergalactic zoo for over 6 months  It manages to be both light and tragic simultaneously  Hmm I m not sure what to say next  only that I thought this book was excellent and I will be reading more of Kurt Vonnegut soon  Although it has some science fiction overtones  it is primarily a book about how horrible people are to each other  so I don t think despisers of science fiction should worry  Para mim  esta obra tem uma das definicoes de viagens no tempo mais interessante e original que li  Usualmente nas viagens do tempo  o viajante pode se encontrar  consigo mesmo   pode alterar todo o futuro ao pisar uma mosca  ou pode dar saltos temporais de centenas de anos  No matadouro 5 as viagens temporais sao feitas durante o espaco temporal da vida da personagem  Billy salta entre os varios episodios da sua vida  adormecendo por vezes no campo de prisioneiros alemao e acordando numa viagem de aviao que efectua 25 anos depois com o sogro  Billy tem a nocao destes saltos e sabe em cada momento o que aconteceu acontecera  mas nao tem por isso intencoes de alterar os acontecimentos  vive os apenas  Assim como Billy nao teme a morte  porque como ele diz  morrera e vivera outros momentos inumeras vezes  infinitamente Podera ser um conceito estranho mas que torna a narrativa simplesmente fantastica  entao imaginem  assim que comecamos a narrativa  Billy diz nos que sobrevivera ao ataque aereo de Dresden  conta nos quem morrera fuzilado e onde  assim como a meio do livro assistimos a morte de Billy  etc  etc  A ordem dos acontecimentos nao tem a sequencia temporal comum  mas apenas as dos saltos de Billy  Esta muito bem escrito Para alem disto o sentido de humor com que a historia nos e contada chega a ser irreal  tudo nos e apresentado como um facto da vida  algo que nao e possivel mudar  dai o autor estar constantemente a repetir se com o  Assim foi   E a vida   E por isso curioso e chocante ver como Billy aceita todos as injusticas e azares que lhe acontecem  mas que ao mesmo tempo o salvam de morrer mais cedo  Isto porque ele ja sabe como e que as coisas irao acontecer  porque ja  la  esteve ou ja as viveu antes Adorei  Bem escrito  personagens fantasticas e um sentido de humor negro mas delicioso Nota  Os momentos  historicos  sao tambem muito interessantes  Ficamos a saber que no ataque a Dresden morrem cerca de 100 000 pessoas  a maioria civis  ou seja  morreram mais pessoas neste ataque aereo Americano  mais uma vez  do que em Hiroshima  Just re read this after I don t know how many years  It s strange how memory tricks you  I remember a lot more Tralfamadore  and a lot less Dresden  I d entirely forgotten the first chapter  which I now think may be the most memorable  and certainly the most important  I was surprised to find a miniature version of Martin Amis   Time s Arrow embedded in Slaughterhouse 5  Vonnegut delivers on his first chapter promise not to write a war story in which there are parts for Frank Sinatra and John Wayne  War isn t about heroism  it empties heroism of its meaning  So it goes  As Vonnegut says in his preface  he knew many decent men who were pilots and bombardiers  It s important to remain non judgmental  but also to listen  to remember what these decent and well meaning people accomplished through their machines   LISTEN   starts the story of Billy Pilgrim in Chapter 2  and is an urgent refrain throughout the book  Again  as Vonnegut says in the preface  it s not about  man s inhumanity to man  but the inhumanity of many of man s inventions to man   I probably wouldn t have understood this book had I read it too early in life  It s a complex  almost ludicrous narrative that toys with time while illuminating a first hand perspective of the aftermath of the Dresden bombing  partly auto biographical  partly wtf genius  I don t know how Vonnegut managed to interweave such a crazy  brilliant story with his experiences in WWII  but that s what makes him the genius and me the googly eyed fan girl Here s the original 1969  New York Times review  which describes it far better than I ever could  http   www vonnegutweb com sh5 sh5_ny    Vonnegut keeps the emotion choked back while the reader is tossed about in time  hit by the writer s caustic wit  but there is sorrow too  almost unseen  damming up with every page  When it finally hits  it hits hard  This book makes me really glad I m a person and not a cat  cats have it pretty damn good most of the time   and is one of the ten books I d wish for if marooned on an island   Slaughterhouse Five has a distinctive style that instantly draws the reader in  It s quirky  shameless  and undeniably real  Instantly we know what the book is going to be about  but that doesn t ruin the surprize  Vonnegut makes us want to know the journey The devices that Vonnegut uses  like Billy s being able to become unstuck in time and the planet Tralfamadore   give the book a slight sci fi overtone  though the reader knows better  It s almost too real  delving into the psychological results of war 12 09 08In finishing the book  I have a much bigger respect for the novel  It is a book that makes you think  but it also makes you glad that you did  Vonnegut writes this anti war novel knowing full and well that anti war novels will never stop war  It s not about stopping war  it s about viewing it the way that it truly is  It s a harsh look at how we glamorize war and also the soldiers fighting in it   That s not to say that soldiers are not to be respected  they absolutely should be  but they are not fearless machines and war affects them  I don t think that Vonnegut is saying that the worldview of the Tralfamadorians is right  I think he s making a point that this is how we see war when we become so numb to it  People die  so it goes  War happens  so it goes  I think the book is brilliant  although sometimes a little too real for my tastes   This genre defying work is part war novel  part science fiction  part non fiction  it follows the life of Billy Pilgrim and his adventures in America and Germany during and after World War Two  He also sometimes finds himself helplessly propelled through time and space  and adopted by a race of aliens called Tralfamadorians  who teach him about the nature of time and the universe  Although short  this is a remarkably complex book  The story jumps between Billy s experiences in the war  to his life after the war  and his time on Tralfamadore  The varied components of the book   the time travels  the memories  the flashbacks   may at first seem bizarre and disconnected  however there are threads running through the novel  countless parallels between Billy s war experience  his space adventures  and his home life  For instance  in Germany Billy meets an American war prisoner who takes pleasure in exacting disproportionately gruesome revenge on people  and animals  he feels have wronged him  Later in the book a statement from President Harry Truman announcing the atomic bombing of Hiroshima declares that the Japanese  have been repaid many fold   These threads are everywhere if you look carefully for them  making this book a fantastic one to read many times over  In addition  this book is incredibly emotional   simultaneously farcical  funny  bizarre and tragic  It bears a strong resemblance to Catch 22   the absurdity  humour and anti war messages are very similar   but I think Slaughterhouse Five conveys much more of the sadness and tragedy of war  and the plight of those who survived  A must read for all Earthlings  Billy Pilgrim s travels through time and war is exceptional because it s completely ambiguous  Billy lives through the monumental and decimating bombing of Dresden as a prisoner of war  He makes it out of the war in one piece physically  but mentally  the man is in tatters  Vonnegut gives us this story about time travel and war  anti war really   but it s never really clear if Billy is truly a time traveller or just a man suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder  PTSD  The extravagant and terrifying accounts of war can be gruesome  but realistic  Billy suffers time and again  but has these moments where he escapes to a different time and a different place  Sometimes his suffering is horrible and gut wrenching  Other times  it is so bad that it becomes laughable  Vonnegut s dry humor is impossible to ignore  but it s so blatantly honest at times that it feels wrong to laugh I was surprised by how much I enjoyed Slaughterhouse Five  It s different from other books because nothing is really clear at the end  Most of the story could be a delusional man s PTSD hallucination  but that s one of the best things about it  All the bad or strange things that happen to Billy happen either during the war or because of the war  When people say that this book should be banned because of vulgarity  violence  and promoting deviant behaviors  I just want to say  go read it   This book is not promoting any of that  This book is Vonnegut s anti war proclamation and it s exquisite in both its complexities and ambiguities  I have a feeling that I ll read it again and again Opening line  All this happened  more or less    pg  1Favorite line   1   All moments  past  present  and future  always have existed  always will exist    pg  27Favorite line   2    That s one thing Earthlings might learn to do  if they tried hard enough  Ignore the awful times  and concentrate on the good ones     pg  117 So it goes      Billy Pilgrim has become unstuck in time  We witness as he travels through time and lives out various times in his life  We witness the firebombing of Dresden through his eyes  We witness his abduction by aliens from the planet Tralfamadore  We witness his time as a prisoner of war during WWII  We are also shown his personal life with his wife and children  The story begins the same way it ends  with a  Poo tee weet   What an amazing novel   I read this many years before  so I figured I would reread it for class  I must say that it was better than I remember it being  I have never read a novel that was presented in this manner  It is a loop that ends the way it begins  There is no linear plot  we are just given the instances that Billy Pilgrim witnesses as he travels through time  Billy is not your traditional  strapping hero  He is a weak man that is easily forgettable by most people he meets  except for one soldier that he served with in WWII  That soldier promises Billy something awful in the future  and delivers  Billy knows what events will happen in his life  he has witnessed it many times  including his own death  I would love to use this novel in the classroom  I would use it in an AP English class because of the non linear plot and the situations included  I feel students could get much out of this novel  They can see a novel presented unlike any other they have read  Great discussions can spur from this novel  I could see this novel being contested because of the sex  but I feel it is nothing that pulls away from the real story  This is a novel that will stick with its readers for years   This is the sort of book that you want to force your friends to read when you have finished it so you have someone to discuss it with  It is a hard plot of sell to other people   Billy Pilgrim  an optometrist who was at the bombing of Dresden in WWII becomes  unstuck  in time and is abducted by aliens  But it isn t really about that   it is about war  death and being human  The story flits back and forth through different times in Billy s life as he  and Kurt Vonnegut  try to come to terms with what they saw in Dresden  The bombing itself is given little in the way of detail   because Vonnegut was in an underground shelter  so therefore is Billy  We do see the aftermath though   the rubble  burnt bodies  people cooked in underground shelters   and it is all described almost passively  The same mantra repeats throughout the book upon someone or something dying   so it goes But make no mistake  this is an anti war novel  Soldiers are young  fighting for forces that don t really care about them  It is full of dark humour and poignant moments but there are no moments of war bravado  no heroes  As Billy says about the bombing  Everything is all right  and everybody has to do exactly what he does  And that is true  but those that have seen such awful things have to go on living afterwards and come to terms with what they have seen   and that is really what the book is about  We can only hope to have more nice moments to exist in than we do bad ones  As Vonnegut says  There is nothing intelligent to say about a massacre  So it goes  I would like to start by saying that the one perk to being sick is that you get to read pretty much non stop  So this review may be slightly influenced by the fact that I pretty much read this book straight through and that  while reading it  I was on all sorts of cold and flu meds that can  hmmmm   mess with the mind  when taken in high doses  But I digress  This book absolutely consumed me  I have read Vonnegut before  but never any of his acclaimed work  and I can see why Slaughterhouse Five has warranted acclaim  He describes very intricate and esoteric elements of PTSD with words that are not only direct but eloquent  He is Bukowski McCarthy Faulkner Kundera Burroughs Dickens all entwined  The story was original while still retaining historical accuracy  in the places that warranted historical accuracy  and left me with an overwhelming sense of conviction  that Vonnegut s word was god  There was a certain trust that Vonnegut established  a  just let go  trust me  kind of relationship where I never once found my self straying from the story  Normally  I feel like I can  doze off  a bit in a story  The mind swings away from the text to more internal thoughts  and with your typical work of fiction  you can come back to the text and be sure you haven t missed anything too important  I mean this as important to the reader  I know the author would deem everything important   But in SH5 I never once strayed away  Every word is well placed and necessary  This sort of trust that Vonnegut builds allows the reader to really sway and bend with the protagonist  I can say very honestly that there were times that I felt I too was coming  unstuck in time   Like the text was taking me where it needed me to go  and I went without hesitation  Overall  this is a masterful work of prose and of the english language   Slaughterhouse Five turned out to be a very different book than I had anticipated going into it based on some descriptions I had read of it  At times the book was tragic  other times poignant and other times a bit comical      sometimes all 3 at the same time  Wherever Billy s story took us on this story that centered around his time in World War 2  there was always a sense existential fatalism to the tale that was driven home frequently by his key phrase in this book   so it goes      At times that phrase was an interesting device  at times it was annoying  at times I thought it was overused but by the end it was clear that his use of that phrase was really a cliff notes version of his fatalistic view of war  tragedy and inevitably of loss presented here  Overall I liked the book quite a bit  though initially the stream of consciousness style narrative made it a bit challenging to become engaged in the events that were unfolding  But  once I settled into the groove I was able to join Billy s  pitiful  time in the war and his unthinking acceptance of the events that unfolded in his life regardless of their impact on him  It was also a book that challenges one to make sense of this life and question where meaning can be found so in that regard  this book was a success and better than most because it entertained while making you think and reflect So all in all  I enjoyed this tale quite a bit  While this was my first Vonnegut novel  having now acquired a taste for him  I m sure it won t be my last   I ve read some of Vonnegut s books out of sequence  which turned into a happy accident in terms of understanding this whole Dresden situation   Armageddon in Retrospect  came out after Vonnegut s death with a forward by his son  It includes letters from Vonnegut to his family while he was stationed in Germany and a vivid account of being a war prisoner picking up debris in bombed out Dresden  I recommend reading the two books close together  Vonnegut just keeps me coming back for more  and hits on many classic Vonnegut points that I relish  These include time travel  crazy people trying to make sense of their craziness  the terribleness of war  and of course Kilgore Trout  the science fiction author  I was unaware of the tragedy of Dresden until I started reading Vonnegut s books  This tragedy has clearly shaped the way he thinks about war and the blatantly unnecessary bombing of a beautiful city  Billy Pilgrim  a prisoner of war  dentist  husband  father  time traveler and alien abductee  is the glue in this story  His sad plight seems to expose what war can do to a person s mind  and through his eyes we see what it does to everyone else involved  Many people die  Then Billy dies  So it goes   Perhaps I m the only person on the planet that doesn t see this so much as an anti war novel  as an accurate account memoir of war novel  And perhaps  I believe that people are generally either supportive of our military  and not necessarily supportive of the government s use of our military  or not  I don t hold to the ideal that people are actually  pro  war  as they are more understanding that options sometimes run out for the powers that be  And  maybe that s where my miscommunication is and that is what makes someone  pro  war by definition  Maybe the  anti  war people simply do not see war as an option Neither here nor there  What I adored about this novel was Vonnegut s ability to capture a moment  He did not make things pretty for the sake of making them pretty  but rather made things real  Understandably  this is primary factor in why this novel has earned its place among the ranks  no pun intended   The writing genuinely makes this book multi generational  In a later interview conversation with his attorney  Vonnegut said one thing that sums up the entire point of Slaughterhouse Five  and probably the entire point Billy Pilgrim s existence   What I have said about the bombing of Dresden    not one person has benefited  but me   I would argue that is what Vonnegut is trying to say with Slaughterhouse  A once beautiful city  laid to ruins  and for no purpose  Easily  the war had laid the same ruins upon those who survived it  Whether pro war or anti war  war changes people  It is not something sloughed off with the uniform  or faded in time  but ultimately becomes a part of their DNA  For Billy Pilgrim  he was moved into another world  beyond the limits of time  and for the remainder of his life  merely a shell of man incapable of truly living  One person  One example  But not one person has left one war unchanged  In that same interview  Vonnegut said one other thing that stood out  His attorney referenced the war  the bombing of Dresden  and the subsequent Slaughterhouse Five  Vonnegut s response   I got lucky  I wouldn t have missed it for the world   He never clarified as to which incident he was referring  That is what makes Slaughterhouse Five timeless  We see it in whatever light we choose   They were serious times  the Vietnam War  the Equal and Civil Rights movements  the Kennedy  Kennedy  King assassinations  What did it all mean And then along came Kurt Vonnegut  heck at the time we had never heard of the  Post moderns   But  he was one of them  The so called post moderns are hard to define because it s a broad umbrella  but in Vonnegut s case  he was the antithesis of the somber modernist writers and their quest of finding some great meaning in our chaotic world In Vonnegut s world  you re born  you live  you die  In the meantime  a lot of stuff happens  It s a long life  There is no deep meaning  Like most people   Slaughterhouse Five  was the first of his novels to break through my radar  He had written several other books before it  but this one brought him acclaim  The characters are bounced around  not fettered to time or timeframes or conventional storylines or anything conventional  It was great fun  I loved it and quickly raced through most of his earlier books afterwards  Most state that the central theme that runs throughout his work is our  lack of free will   It s the sail that drives his ship  Stuff happens  We have little control  In Slaughterhouse Five  the protagonist  optometrist Billy Pilgrim  pops in and out of various parts of his life  both on Earth and the alien planet Tralfamadore  It s a thrill ride  just hang on  That s all that Billy can do  Here s a passage   Billy had a framed prayer on his office wall which expressed his method for keeping going  even through he was unenthusiastic about living  A lot of patients who saw the prayer on Billy s wall told him that it helped them to keep going  too  It went like this   God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change  courage to change the things I can  and the wisdom always to tell the difference   Among the things Billy Pilgrim could not change were the past  present  and the future   Indeed  Somewhere in my estimable liberal arts education  I missed reading any of Vonnegut s work  Probably because I was educated in the halcyon days of pre 9 11 when we didn t have to think about war yet or what it meant  I m kind of glad I didn t read it when I was younger  I don t think I would have related to this book as well  or would have appreciated what the characters faced if I didn t have adult responsibilities thrust upon me  I think life experience played a significant role in my reasons for connecting so strongly with the narrative I like how Vonnegut plays with the arrow of time  If you watch any documentaries or read anything about particle physics  you would know that all of those smart guys in physics are wondering why we re on a track  this one track  and what it means in relation to the Universe as a whole  Vonnegut s use of time skipping  and living life almost simultaneously is genius  and well done  The track could be followed  It explains  The Time Traveler s Wife  a whole lot better  and why I couldn t make it though that book The setting is unusual  The bombing of Dresden is  still  overlooked  I took a History of WWII class in college  and other than pointing at Dresden on a map  not much was mentioned  The concentration camps  H bombs  paratroopers  and naval manuvers were covered very well  along with the social implications here at home  However  no one says anything beyond  Dresden was bombed   I don t know that that little piece of history will ever change in the face of so much carnage and evil elsewhere  Pointing it out in books such as this will keep the memory alive Please see my blog    www amandaaltenhofen blogspot com for the rest of this review  It was too long to fit here  Vonnegut is not a cynic  Now that s out of the way  I would recommend this book to anyone who has the ability to laugh  Because it will make you do that many times over  This book is about WWII and the a character named Billy Pilgrim who becomes unstuck in time and travels through many dimensions of time without control of his time hopping  This book is a fire breathing satire on WWII  any war really  and the human condition  There are moments that could break your heart  Such as the scene with Princess the German Shepard dog and the old and young men Nazis   See book   Before getting out your tissue box or thinking you don t want to read this because of guts and gore or depression  I know it s another WWII book  what else can be said really   consider Vonnegut s philosophy   Laughter and tears are both responses to frustration and exhaustion  I myself prefer to laugh  since there is less cleaning up to do afterward   This philosophy of his allows him to create real  tangible characters for the reader and you almost forget it s about WWII or anything beyond the emotions and lives of his characters  I ve heard that Vonnegut  when writing a book  wrote every page as many times as he needed until he got it right  When he got to the end  there was no further editing  And although in writing fiction  one very rarely comes up against a word count like say in writing an academic essay  much can be learned from Vonnegut s precise and concise prose   This book really resonated with me when I first read it at 9  It s since been fifteen years  When I realized I could scarcely remember Billy Pilgrim and his experience in Dresden  I found this unacceptable and decided to read it again Essentially  the plot follows Billy Pilgrim in the time shortly before  during  and after the Dresden bombings in WWII Germany  Intermittently  Billy purportedly time travels to various other points in his life both willingly and incidentally  whether it be to escape unpleasantries or reminders of other times in his life  Part of his thoughts are devoted to understanding the perceptions of the Tralfamadorians  who Billy believes to have abducted him later in his life  Interestingly  Billy presence in his own life is comparable to being omniscient because Billy believes injuries sustained during a plane crash  in which he is one of two survivors  allow him to time travel to various points of his own life  So Billy might be on a train being transported to concentration camps with other American prisoners of war while simultaneously on his honeymoon ten years later  It might sound confusing described like this  but it s quite brilliant  and to be frank no third party description will do the intricacies of the narration any form of justice Now  at 24  I am doubly in love with Slaughterhouse Five  Having almost a second first experience in reading it  I can easily say this work of Vonnegut genius easily makes my top 3 or 5 books ever  The voice of narration is addictive  No matter what preceded  I smiled each time I read  So it goes   Tralfamadore had to grow on me  but I like that the reader is left to wonder if Billy s experience of being abducted was real or a figment of his imagination  As for Billy himself  he s one of the most entertaining  thoughtful  optimistic oafs that could possible be thrown into active warfare  He is at once both believable and unbelievable  and his commentary may describe something simple that actually speaks volumes about society and morality  It s really incredible  Admittedly  part of the reason I love this so much is that my appreciation that much deeper as a fellow writer an artist  for this is literary artwork I don t see making it fifteen more years before I give this another read  that s for sure   Listen  Billy Pilgrim has come unstuck in time  So begins Kurt Vonnegut s most famous work  Slaughterhouse Five  This novel is Vonnegut trying to find meaning in his experiences in WWI  he survived both the Battle of the Bulge and the 1945 bombing of Dresden  and he struggled for the rest of his life with the things he witnessed during the war  Slaughterhouse Five is an anti war novel that also isn t an anti war novel  As Vonnegut acknowledges in the opening chapter  one might as well write an anti glacier book as an anti war book     there would always be wars     they were as easy to stop as glaciers   he writes  And yet  it s important for him to write about his experiences in the war  to try to make sense of them  and do whatever small part he can to make people understand the horrors of modern warfare Slaughterhouse Five tells the story of Billy Pilgrim  a man who  as the first line of the book lets on  comes unstuck in time  he randomly travels to different moments in his life  That s not the only strange thing about him  though  in middle age  he is abducted by aliens and taken to the planet Tralfamadore  where he is kept in a zoo exhibit furnished with furniture stolen from Sears Roebuck  Included in these tenuously linked events is the bombing of Dresden  which Billy  and Vonnegut  survives by hiding with other POWs in an underground meat locker I first read Slaughterhouse Five a few years ago  and this novel is unlike any I had previously read  It is a very fragmented little book  jumping around in time and space from Billy s childhood in Illium  New York to a veteran s hospital in Vermont to a POW camp in Germany to his exhibit on Tralfamadore to his marriage bed with an undesirable woman named Valencia Merble  It s a strange  non linear book different from anything that came before it  but it had to be different  Vonnegut couldn t use a traditional form to talk about Dresden  his book couldn t be one of John Wayne heroes and happy endings because that s not how modern war really is  Instead  we have this little novel with very few characters  most of which are flat and almost cartoon like  The form of the book  as well as its content  conveys that war is absurd and so are the people who fight it Slaughterhouse Five is filled with absurd occurrences  Billy s fellow American soldier Edgar Derby survives the firestorm that is the bombing of Dresden only to be killed by the Germans via firing squad for  plundering  a teapot while recovering bodies from the ruins of the fallen city  This actually happened to a man Vonnegut knew  although I believe this man was caught stealing a jar of pickles rather than a teapot  This realism is partly what makes the book so wonderful  Vonnegut uses the technique of metafiction  placing himself in the story at crucial moments of Billy s war experience  saying   that was me   or  I was there   These little reminders that these things really happened during the war  that he didn t just make them up as interesting plot points  add so much truth to the story  The reader is reminded it s not just fiction This book is an excellent novel about the futility of war with notes of both existentialism and nihilism More book reviews at Books Speak Volumes  The interesting thing about this book is that the author Kurt Vonnegut has gone through all of the things told by Billy Pilgram  Vonnegut is telling us his story through Billy Pilgram s point of view and also through other characters around Billy  There are so many things that could be told about this book  Like I wrote in my reduction  one of the key scenes is when the Jews were departed in the car boxes across Germany  The people were all together  united  fighting through the pain  knowing that there is always hope and they will survive in the end  All of the stories about WWII including this book show the relationship between people  Someone who you don t even know becomes your best friend because of the circumstances around you  Slaughterhouse 5 also reveals the horrible truth about the treatment of the Jewish people  What is fascinating is that Vonnegut went through this himself  The best way to really understand what someone has gone through is to put yourself into his shoes  In this case we can t do that However  through this book we do not only read facts about WWII  we also understand how a person who has experienced the disasters feels afterward  I recommend this book to everybody who likes to read about the World War II because it s one of the best sources of the war   This was the first Vonnegut book I had ever read  It only took me a week  Forgive my ignorance about Mr  Vonnegut and his great writings  I ve read a couple of his short stories and didn t even know they were his  Anyway  I bought it on a whim  read it  and I was not disappointed Even though Vonnegut has a snappy  humorous tone that would be  unsuitable  for a serious message  and the bulk of the story is presented in a non chronological fashion that throws most slow witted people off and annoys them to death  because the bulk of the story is unimportant   it was still easy to glean Vonnegut s message off of the story Billy Pilgrim goes through segments of his life  knowing and understanding exactly what was going to happen to him  and when  after the time he came into contact with the Tralfamadorians  who explain his condition of  becoming unstuck in time  to him as well  Because of this  he releases all pretense of free will that he had with his limited understanding of the fourth dimension  and becomes nihilistic and apathetic  He doesn t care about the true cause of his death It s a self fulfilling chain in a way  however   wouldn t his apathy  upon knowing the future  cause the future that he saw  Therein lies a paradox  Either that  or Vonnegut was implying that either the Tralfamadorians were only making generalized predictions  but what about the detailed ones    or that the future was entirely changeable upon learning about the occurrences of the future  but Billy just didn t give a crap But I get the message  We have  free will   and we shouldn t be fighting wars  even though all things are temporal and eventually die  we should make the best of them  That s basically it  This is my favorite book of all time  Vonnegut s choice of not relating the events in chronological order really kept me interested the first time I read it and I could not put it down  There is also a cameo by my all time favorite character  Eliot Rosewater  who is in some of Vonnegut s other books  This is one of those novels that when you finish reading the last sentence and close the book  your chest fills up and you feel content and changed  It made me realize that I have to live in the moment and not worry about petty things  The idea that  all moments  past  present  and future  always have existed  always will exist  gives me hope  If I believe in that idea  then in some moments my little cousin is always alive and in other moments I am always in love or always having  good old days  with my friends  so no matter what happens I have those to cling to Closing my eyes and  time traveling  like Billy Pilgrim gets me through really tough times  I only wish I could travel forward sometimes  What does war do to the human mind  War in the modern world is a collision of events that challenge our beliefs  War is a tragedy that humanity seems unable to escape  We are all hoping for peace  yet wars happen in all kinds of places The plot of this book by Kurt Vonnegut is this     on the other hand let me tell you about literature The world of literature is somewhat distant to the world of war If you re expecting a book on how to run an abattoir  you might be disappointed  The title is both accurate  yet misleading  Why do you want to know how to run a Slaughterhouse  Are you some kind of sicko This is not a book about how to murder people and dispose of the bodies okay  Jeepers    Slaughterhouse Five is about an average kind of guy caught up in events beyond his ability to understand  He gets caught up in   events war time displacement  things happen  do you know what I m saying Adolf Hitler wrote a book while in prison that was one of the important documents that influenced the German people before and during World War Two Mein Kampf  My Struggle  is famous as a turgid poorly written calamity of a book that Hitler used to explain his thinking about his hopes for Germany and what he believed  He had political ideas that drove him to seek power The power of ideas  even dangerous evil ideas  should be considered in every education system The average person is not made to fight in any war  but  so what  You have to be a good citizen  Patriotism is a powerful argument  so when war breaks out  just get your ticket and take the ride   Science fiction is a broad classification system that means stuff happens that might be challenging to your ideas  Why Kurt Vonneguts books are called science fiction is something of a mystery They could just as easily be called cans of soup And so it goes Peace  Slaughter House Five by Kurt Vonnegut is a adventurous tale where the protaginist  Billy Pilgrim  is subjected to a life of being kiddnapped by aliens and taking trips through time  This book is about how a man re lives key moments that happened in his life  All while he s being kiddnapped by aliens and they give him guidence about time and space  Even though they imprison him he s not there very long due to him time traveling all the time  The book starts out very confusing but once you get into the story line of the book  you ll be hooked  Kurt Vonnegut did an excellent job combinding the two most popular topics of fiction  the concept of aliens  and the all time favorite of time traveling  This book is now one of my favorites for its well planned comedy parts and also for its detail and avid descriptions that drag the reader into the story  If you haven t read this book then I d advise that you pick it up and see why Kurt Vonnegut s Slaughter House Five is a great book to read during your free time  Slaughterhouse five by Kurt Vonnegut  is about a man who reexperiences his life due to time traveling  The novel takes place during the 1900s which include locations such as Europe  United States  and even in a faraway planet  Billy Pilgrim  the protagonist  gets captured by alien and to make his disapeerance unsuspicious  they use time travel  so that it was assumed that he never disapeered from Earth to being with  Although the plot fluctuates from time to time  it is intresting because you have no idea what to expect next  His time travels are extemely unexpected and all take place in different scenarios  from his time in the world war  his peaceful time in another planet  or in an era where even his family believed him to be insane  Because the plot is inconsistent  I believe is what makes it good  because normally a inconsistent story would be horrible  but this is purposely done this way making the sequences and plot twists unexpected and well thought out  while understanding the character s thought and perspective on every single situtation he faced and refaced  This book is excellent and altohugh confusing at times  is worth reading  This Novel is one of the most crazy book I have read so far It goes into the mind of how people act during war and after war  War leads people to do this that they don t do when they are not at war  Vonnehut gets in the mind of his chacuter and he should their bad side  Human are always trying to get power over each other and they will try to do this all the time  It fouse on one charcter his name is Billy and it s show how he is trying to get back into a norman life but he had a hard time  He is back home and he is always time travel and goes to a differnt plant  He goes to this plant and he see how they lived in peace and how everyone there gets alone and are friend  while he is there he tinks why get human live like this  He than gets his anwer and he see if there human there will always be war because people are all power hurger  Human always want power over each other and that is what Vonnegut is getting at  This novel would be loved by people who love war stroies that goes deeper than just people die it shows you how people act around each other  It not just about war but it more about how war affect people in many way and how people really change after war no matter who you are  This is what it about and how it show how people act around each other   Slaughterhouse 5 is widely recognized as an anti war story but should also be considered a story about spirituality  The essence of time travel and science fiction flow in and out of the Writer Narrator s philosophy of life and death so swiftly  so elegantly that I felt more like I was peacefully meditating than I was actually reading a story about a POW who barely survived WWII Slaughterhouse 5 is literally the address of the slaughterhouse that Billy Pilgrim was ensconced in during the War  but it is my opinion the author wants the reader to consider the world we live in to be a slaughterhouse  And what a slaughterhouse it is  War is everywhere  The news  the streets  the insides of so many homes  Many of the children s books my kids read are imbedded with glorified war themes  Today alone my kids read  by way of the newspaper and random children s books  about the following wars  Afghanistan  Iraq  Bosnia circa 1995  the French and Indian War and the Revolutionary War  Killing isn t just on TV  It is everywhere  So it goes The mantra  So it goes  is written after any mention of any death throughout Slaughterhouse 5  I never got used to reading  So it goes   I never expected it  Each time I read it  I felt a little bit sadder and a little bit weirder  Now that I think about it  that is how I feel about  Amen  The author gently compares and connects Billy Pilgrim to Jesus  Billy Pilgrim is  for the most part  a tearless guy  To my understanding  so was Jesus  The placement of the lyrics to  Away in a Manger  in the story made me  for the first time  consider Jesus as a tearless but sad person in a kill crazy world  Ironically  the thought made me cry  The thought of Billy Pilgrim as Jesus did  too There is much to say  much to ponder in this story but for now I just want to say that Vonnegut was ahead of his time  His approach to spirituality and endlessness touched my heart  I enjoyed many surprises in this book and will cite two just for fun  On page 34 he writes    Get off the road  you dumb motherfucker   The last word was still a novelty in the speech of white people in 1944   Slaughterhouse 5 was written in 1966  It is 2010 and white people still have no business saying  motherfucker   Someday I will stop trying  Another funny moment takes place on page 183 describing the car in which Valencia dies    Reagan for President   a sticker on the bumper said   Funny  So was the reference to Norman Mailer  Kurt Vonnegut s book is brilliant  I will think about it and him for a long time   NOTE  This is a review of an Audio Book version of it  but still contains my thoughts on the narrative so is still valid As I have said on this blog  I listen to audio plays whilst out walking  and I decided to give a novel a chance  would I be able to focus on it whilst covering the miles  I chose a novel I was familiar with  Kurt Vonnegut s science fiction classic Slaughterhouse Five The story is well known  as are some of its lines   Billy Pilgrim has come unstuck in time   Listening to a novel rather than reading it forces to focus in an entirely different fashion  certainly I became more aware of the music of the piece  the cadence and fall of the voice  This reading was helped dramatically by Ethan Hawke  whose pitch was just right  You sense not a reader reading a work  but a man who knows and understands the work  he is breathing it Vonnegut s characters are unforgettable  from Billy Pilgrim to the novelist Kilgore Trout  the pornographic actress Montana Wildhack  and the Tralfamadorians themselves  Vonnegut s alien race who abduct Billy Pilgrim and place him in a zoo  Of course Vonnegut s novel is about more than this  it is about the firebombing of Dresden during the Second World War  it is about servicemen surviving after the war  it is about guilt and action  fate and free will  It is a highly influential work  a satirical science fiction novel that transcends its genre and a genuine American classic of literature As an introduction to the world of audio books I couldn t have chosen a better one  Ethan Hawke brings to life Vonnegut s classic tale with panache  and the production from Blackstone Audiobooks was first rate   My father asked me if were I sure that mr Vonnegut was a writer  Somebody else noticed that Vonnegut fulfilled the hard task to join contemporary novel research with popular successful Graham Greene  one of the sharpest english writer of last century  described the very young Vonnegut  at his second novel  like the best american writer  That s to say that a Cult writer also generate very different opinion  going to touch  or to destroy  orthodoxy milestones  My personal opinion is that his freedom of mind was well supported by his philosophical wisdom and by his huge fantasy  And His not literary education gave him a sensitive different point of view  So he was one of the funniest writer ever  like M Twain or A Bierce  one of the wisest  one of the most modern and smart in using literary tools  And the most Human ever  And this last feature is the magic that turn talent to cult This book is the most famous  due to the autobiographical subject  and being very modern in the plot  in the warm relation between writer and readers Sorry  he s a cult writer  and my personal cult writer  so not intentioned to offence any religion let me finish this opinion according to my own ritual way Seyou around Kurt Vonnegut Jramen Wow Kurt Vonnegut writes like your interior monologue on its fastest  funniest  most manic day  After a few hitches of surprise  I fell right in  Nominally  the book is about the fire bombing of Dresden  Also the quirks of families  group dynamics  survival  time travel  alien abductions  and the experience of the above in what may or may not be a case of mental illness There is so much there  all of it drawn so lightly and easily  that I don t think I could do it justice and I won t try  I will mention one of my  stop dead  moments  the protagonist is dozing in the back of the cart  two days after the fire bombing of Dresden  having the first quiet moment he s had in weeks  He wakes up to realize that two local doctors are clucking over the state of the horses hitched to the wagon  thirsty  with damaged hooves and bloody mouths  He climbs out of the wagon  sees the state of the horses he s been neglecting  and starts to cry for the only time in his war experience  All around him the world has lost its mind  decent people and children have been killed  casual brutality is everywhere  The only tragedy manageable enough for his mind to begin to handle is those horses  his humanity finally has a space to assert itself and he cries  It took my breath away  I may want to amend this review  because it really deserves more than 4 stars  However  I reserve the fifth star because I m afraid I d just be reviewing it on the virtues of it being a classic well deserved of its place in the pantheon of literary fiction  Plus  this is my first Vonnegut  shhhhh  This book was read with absolutely no expectations  I d never read any Vonnegut and I d insulated myself from listening to various opinions and critiques and analyses and slavish devotions and fannishness  Enough so that I had no idea what was in store  What I found was more than I could have asked for  Is it strictly science fiction  I would say no  just in the sense that can one really believe Billy Pilgrim experiences all that he says  Doubtful  but intriguing if you take it at face value  I suppose that is what fiction is all about and that s what the book said to me  Life is beautiful  Choose your memories  Sequentially  we may look mundane  but in juxtaposition  we are mighty  There really is so much more to discuss and the book covers so much ground  life  death  war  peace  the absurd  in so little time  Hell  I m giving it five stars   Farewell  hello  farewell  hello   This book is very reflective of Kurt Vonnegut s style  Quirky  satirical  and imaginative  I liked how the paragraphs were short and each one told a separate  yet related event  It is about a man named Billy Pilgrim who has no free will  is a joke of a soldier during WWII  and is later an optometrist  He can jump in time to any point on his life  he believes death is just a death in that time and somewhere else at another time the person is alive  For this reason he has no free will and lets life take him where it goes  After the war he settles down into a successful life  His job as an optometrist is ironic since he must make patients see better  He himself  can either be assumed as the man with the best eyesight  he can see the past  present  and future  or with the worst eyesight  he is just a crazy insane man blinded by the horrors of the war who makes up stories about being kidnapped by aliens  Throughout the book many people die  Scores of people die  And each time someone dies  the paragraph ends with   so it goes   I think in this way it is almost comforting  as if they are alive at another time or place and death is part of life and life goes on  In another sense it is discomforting  as the story progresses that line shows up more and more until one understands the sheer amount of destruction that war takes I don t know if one will like this book  It is different  It may not make sense  It does not go in chronological order  The characters are quirky and unrealistic things happen  And yet  I loved it  The characters have stayed with me  especially Billy Pilgrim  The satire and humor  which some might find oddly placed  makes you stop and think  laugh and cringe at the same time  And Vonnegut s point has made it across the novel  the magnitude and destruction of war and the question with no answer  Poo tee weet Poo tee weet is what the bird cries out after a massacre since no words can describe the horrors of the war  It seems to sing out a question to which there is no answer  as there is no answer to explain why war happens  why it happened  and why it still will happen This book will change your outlook on things and hopefully you will love it too  At the risk of being super irritating and patronising  I m of the firm belief that those who don t like this book simply don t get it  I m not sure I get it entirely   I m still trying to work it through in my head and my final conclusion may take one or two more read throughs of the book  Perhaps we re not supposed to get it  It is  after all  about the craziness of war and the incomprehensible and atrocious things that human beings can do to each other  How can we ever  get  that  But there are some things I m pretty sure of  The primary certainty I have is that this is not science fiction  The space travel and time travel are simply coping mechanisms  created by the character Billy to help him deal with distance himself from the awful things he has lived through  The repetition of the phrase  so it goes   which some reviewers seem to see as a flaw or a mistake    is part of this   an almost OCD response to death that Billy has developed over time   reassuring himself that mortality is nothing to be afraid of but simply something that has to happen  The fact that Vonnegut circles around the story s subject matter   the bombing of Dresden and the massacre of many thousands of people by the  good guys    says more about the horror he experienced than any direct descriptions ever could  No words can express what he and his fellow survivors witnessed   that s how awful it was  Instead of searching for metaphors or similes to put the event into words  Vonnegut instead gives us insight into the long lasting mental scars such experiences have on the veterans who live through them  This is done firstly through the very courageous opening chapter  where Vonnegut bears his own soul to the reader  and then secondly through Billy s retreat into insanity and his own wild imaginings  Simple genius  En Matadero cinco Kurt Vonnegut nos ofrece una historia de guerra sin heroismo  sin grandes ideales  con soldados que estan mas cerca de ser bufones que despiadados asesinos  algo que la coloca en la linea de parentesco con Las aventuras del buen soldado Svejk de Jaroslav Hasek  Billy Pilgrim  protagonista de estas tristes y divertidas aventuras  fue un prisionero de guerra cuando ocurrio el terrible bombardeo de Dresde por parte de los estadounidenses  y aunque vivio para contarlo  su mente le jugara extravagantes bromas  es capaz de viajar hacia el futuro y el pasado en su propia vida  es abducido por criaturas extraterrestres que lo tendran cautivo por anos   si bien en tiempo humano significara apenas unos instantes   en una especie de zoologico en el planeta Trafalmadore  y ademas sobrevivira a un accidente aereo  tras lo cual hablara en publico de sus extranas experiencias  Y aunque la novela tiene una marcada tendencia antibelicista  Vonnegut hace ver que las guerras seran por siempre inevitables  lo cual  por supuesto  nunca les quitara lo estupidas  The greatest anti war novel of all time  Thank God it doubles as a comedy  This absolutely floored me  The main character watching a film in reverse   American planes  full of holes and wounded men and corpses  took off backwards from an airfield in England  Over France  a few German fighter planes flew at them backwards  sucked bullets and shell fragments from some of the planes and crewmen  They did the same for wrecked American bombers on the ground  and those planes flew up backwards to join the formation  The formation flew backwards over a German city that was in flames  The bombers opened their bomb bay doors  exerted a miraculous magnetism which shrunk the fires  gathered them into cylindrical steel containers  and lifted the containers into the bellies of the planes  The Germans below had miraculous devices of their own  which were long steel tubes  They used them to suck more fragments from the crewmen and planes  But there were still a few wounded Americans  though  and some of the bombers were in bad repair  Over France  though  German fighters came up again  made everything and everybody as good as new  When the bombers got back to their base  the steel cylinders were taken from the racks and shipped back to the United States of America  where factories were operating night and day  dismantling the cylinders  separating the dangerous contents into minerals  Touchingly  it was mainly women who did this work  The minerals were then shipped to specialists in remote areas  It was their business to put them into the ground  to hide them cleverly  so they would never hurt anybody ever again  The American fliers turned in their uniforms  became high school kids  And Hitler turned into a baby  Billy Pilgrim supposed  That wasn t in the movie  Billy was extrapolating  Everybody turned into a baby  and all humanity  without exception  conspired biologically to produce two perfect people named Adam and Eve  he supposed   Listen   There are almost no characters in this story  and almost no dramatic confrontations  because most of the people in it are so sick and so much the listless playthings of enormous forces  One of the main effects of war  after all  is that people are discouraged from being characters    164 Slaughterhouse Five is probably the first postmodern novel I read  long before I knew that there was such a thing as a  postmodern novel   Back in middle school I didn t put much thought into form  I merely accepted Slaughterhouse Five as a book about the horrors of war  masquerading as a sci fi novel  and presented out of chronological order simply to play up the sci fi elements of the story  But unlike all the other sci fi I was reading at the time  Asimov  Niven  Clarke   the non sci fi elements of Slaughterhouse Five are the elements that grabbed me In other words  since even good sci fi is often bereft of well rounded characters   despite what Vonnegut wrote  above  there are some memorable characteristic moments in this book  Kilgore Trout screaming at his team of adolescent newspaper delivery boys  and one girl   Billy Pilgrim s moments of innocence in the adult bookstore  the two infantry scouts ditching Billy and Roland Weary behind enemy lines  the narrator  Kurt  literally  well  not literally  but literarily  pooping his brains out in the POW camp  the German guards reacting to the obliterated moonscape of their home  Dresden  looking like  a silent film of a barbershop quartet   poor Billy Pilgrim s reaction upon realizing what condition the two wagon drawing horses are in  near the end of the book  This is the book that introduced me to Vonnegut s work  and rightly so  as it is his best novel  I remember reading it in a single sitting the first time around  back when I had my summers off and nothing to do but read  This time it took me two days  not bad  considering I have a full time job and plenty of things to do other than read  But Slaughterhouse Five is a book worth experiencing  again and again  If I were to align myself with any one author s world view  it would probably be Vonnegut  despite his sometimes overwhelmingly bleak outlook on life  which is to say  the nearly unbearable burden of being alive   Unlike Vonnegut  I do not consider not living to be better than living  but I can understand and appreciate why he thought this way  I suppose anyone who lived through what he d lived through in Dresden would be hard pressed to feel any differently  Slaughterhouse Five is the quintessential portrayal of a personal struggle to find meaning in a chaotic and destructive world  and to deal with not actually being able to change the course of our lives  Billy Pilgrim understands his own fate through time travel and thus does not resist it  He floats from one moment to the next  having experienced and re experienced bits and pieces of his life  I really enjoyed Vonnegut s use of time travel as a unique way to demonstrate the stream of consciousness amalgam of moments in Pilgrim s life that illustrate important themes  The Trafalmadorians  idea of poetry is  ironically enough  said to be a series of moments  read  all at once   and this mirrors the style of the novel itself  It was those parts that encapsulated the book in its entirety that I enjoyed the most  I wholeheartedly recommend this book for its reflection on war  human nature  and how we cope with the thing that unites us more than anything else in the world   human suffering   A MODEST AMOUNT OF SPOILERS To start out  Slaughterhouse 5 was not an easy book to analyze and understand and if you like to read thrillers and find it laborious when an author forces you to decipher indirect writing  then this is not your book  The basis of the book is an anti war book as an analysis of a character torn savagely apart into pieces from the two most devastating wars during mankind  The book also provides undertones from the author himself and his personal thoughts and experiences on war    The story begins as Billy goes through certain moments of his life that have impacted him one way or another  He then travels back in time before the atrocious bombing of Dresden in where he bases his story about the life of himself as a soldier  The book then continues on  in a jumble of events that are both true and others  imagined  Vonnegut also uses a literary device in the shape of Billy s war induced ravings in which Billy was a supposed victim of an alien abduction  As he goes in and out of this fantasy  the reader starts to understand that the faint balance that holds our minds together can be easily disrupted by the unnatural terror of war   He believes that these aliens have no jurisdiction under time  and experience all events at once making all events inevitable and at the same time necessary  This conviently salvages his remaining mental state by convincing himself that what happened during the Bombing of Dresden was fated and that all that will happen should not be mourned and ponder over  The almost nonsensical reality of the book was what made the book so interesting  his vivd revisits of the tribulations  horrors and peculiar aspects of Billy s life that reveal Vonnegut s strange appeal and ends on the note that war is senseless as a bird s chatter  Poot tee Weet  Short  fast  to the point  equally poignant and diverting  A book that doesn t take itself too seriously  I like the guy s sincerity  He seems to me to do the opposite of the post modern  everything is ironic and we re going to write the most ironic books there are  No  Vonnegut in this one doesn t do that  He describes hard situations and you can taste his acrid feelings without going the route of irony    So it goes      Well  that s at least him taking a definite position and putting forth his feelings without occluding them unnecessarily  And if you read his book  it s an unpopular position for him to have taken during the late 60s  considering the circles he ran with  it s not pro war  it s not anti war  it s more  you re crazy to try and stop it  But  wow  I read this in one morning and part of the night before  It s relentlessly interesting  there s humor but a lot more than just humor  I enjoy the places when he inserts himself   that was me  the author of this book  i said that   If there is any irony  I d say it s here  while we can all agree the main character is crazy  he s not more crazy than any other individual in the book  Both the war premise and this one requires a certain willingness to suspend belief  But is that more cynicism or irony  And what s the difference One part particularly  when he s time traveling  and he doesn t realize that he s no longer in the war  and they ask him where to take him and he says Salughterhouse Five  It s those  type observations of the human condition that make the characters so memorable and meaningful to read  This is one that I had prejudice about for most of my life  and the title revolted me enough to not want to pick it up  even before I was a vegetarian  Now I d like to get my hands on Player Piano  THE TIME 100 reviewVonnegut is still more cult favorite than literary lion  and he probably prefers it that way   but he deserves full canonical marks for this kaleidoscopic koan of a novel about Billy Pilgrim  a man who has  become unstuck in time   Pilgrim ricochets helplessly from decade to decade  living the episodes of his life in no particular sequence  not excluding his own death  his capture by aliens called Tralfamadorians  and his traumatic service in World War II  when he lives through the firebombing of Dresden  Slaughterhouse Five is a cynical novel  but beneath the bitter  grim jawed humor is a desperate  painfully honest attempt to confront the monstrous crimes of the 20th century

told  have mercifully been provided with short memories because they are so constantly prey to the threat of being killed  They would go mad with fear and despair if they could remember the past  Men seldom realize it  Kurt Vonnegut suggests in his latest novel  but they have more in common with rabbits than they like to think  Except that men forget on purpose  and are a prey to one another The occasion for these and other reflections is an agonizing  funny  profoundly rueful attempt by Vonnegut to handle in fable form his own memories of the strategically unnecessary Allied air raid on Dresden that killed 135 000 people  The book s narrator  like Vonnegut  lived through the raid as a prisoner of war in an underground slaughterhouse  Like Vonnegut  too  he has spent more than 20 years trying to mark out the limits of its metaphoric meaning in a book Everyman Figure  The task is beyond him  Eventually he presents his publisher with the jumbled chronicle of another American prisoner who also survived the raid  as well as some of the horrors of peace and prosperity  Too archly named Billy Pilgrim  the second survivor is hardly a real character   there are almost no characters in this book   Vonnegut says   because most of the people in it are so sick and so much the listless playthings of enormous forces   But he does very well as something between a consumer age Candide and a Vonnegut Everyman figure Billy lives through the war merely because he happens not to die in it  then becomes a husband and a prosperous optometrist for equally random reasons  He acquires a Reagan stickered Cadillac and a son named Robert  who graduates from failure as a high school alcoholic to  the famous Green Berets  and becomes a fine young man  fighting in Viet Nam  The only trouble is that Billy sometimes just can t keep from bursting into tears Mountain Time  He visits the planet Tralfamadore  which Vonnegut invented several books ago  in a flying saucer  and learns from little green men there that time is not a river  as earthlings think  but an unmoving phenomenon like a mountain range  continually visible to the Tralfamadorians from one end to the other  Since he has become unstuck in time  like the flying saucer people  Billy  too  experiences many times over the events of his life  repeatedly returning to recollections of Dresden  and the great fire that followed  No one of these occurrences seems more unusual to Billy than any of the others  As the narrator says resignedly  repeatedly   So it goes  Read more  http   www time com time magazine art    This is one of the first books I ever read that turned me towards Taoism  without me even knowing what that was  especially with that quote where Billy Pilgrim  after being abducted wants to know why they chose him  Billy licked his lips  thought a while  inquired at last   Why me   That is a very Earthling question to ask  Mr  Pilgrim  Why you  Why us for that matter  Why anything  Because this moment simply is  Have you ever seen bugs trapped in amber   Yes   Billy  in fact  had a paperweight in his office which was a blob of polished amber with three ladybugs embedded in it  Well  here we are  Mr  Pilgrim  trapped in the amber of this moment  There is no why   All time is all time  It does not change  It does not lend itself to warnings or explanations  It simply is  Take it moment by moment  and you will find that we are all  as I ve said before  bugs in amber  To me that was just so powerful  What a philosophy  There is no good or bad  no dualism except in our own minds  I ve looked for explanations most of my life to why things are good or bad  but never really accepted that things just are  Here s another favourite quote   Billy is spastic in time  has no control over where he is going next  and the trips aren t necessarily fun  He is in a constant state of stage fright  he says  because he never knows what part of his life he is going to have to act in next  This book brought me to one of the first points in my life when I started to think about time in a totally different context  that perhaps it didn t exist at all This book blew me away  I highly recommend it  I have read many books in my life  Not as many as some people but a lot more than some others  There have been some of those books that I loved and some of those books were ok and some I didn t care for much at all  There has never been a book that I knew beyond a doubt that I would love after reading only the first 10 pages  Along comes Vonnegut s classic  Slaughterhouse Five I honestly don t know what it was about this book that I loved so much  I do know that I love the way Vonnegut writes in a stream of consciousness style that flows between past and present and future  I enjoyed the fact that the book made me laugh which rarely ever happens whether I am reading or not As one of the most famous novels of the 20th Century there are literally thousands of reviews out there and everyone has an opinion about what the book is trying to say  There are much better reviewers who can offer you better insight into the depths of this book The part that spoke to me the most was a scene in which Billy Pilgrim is talking to his Tralfamadorian captor and discussing what it is like to see the end of the world and all the terrible things that the Tralfamadorian s do since they view all times at the same time  His captor tells him that they ignore the awful times and focus on the good ones So it goes  Amazing   Books on war can be difficult to write  and difficult to read  After all  war is a whole array of tangled emotions  events  and responses  To portray the complexity involved in a concept as controversial as war  therefore  is a challenge  And really  what fun is it to read about diseases  death  and gratuitous violence  But Slaughterhouse Five is different  different in motive  in expression  in character  Vonnegut does not glorify  and he does not openly condemn  He includes no vivid portrayal of the warfare or the deaths  Generals and soldiers are not the focus of the story  but the lives of commoners  and their everyday feelings Vonnegut   in a deadpan manner   simply narrates  not from the assumed point of view of a soldier  but through the eyes of a weak prisoner of war who travels through time and converses with aliens  This prisoner  Billy Pilgrim  is the epitome of apathy and inertia  As one observer describes   all he does     is quit and surrender and apologize and ask to be left alone   He witnesses the deaths of thousands  among them  that of his wife   but looks at each with equal indifference  And in spite of his lack of morale and ambition  his life is good  He dozes through war  but ironically survives  He doesn t desire or work for anything  but earns a decent job and lives a comfortable life  Such is the life of our protagonist in Vonnegut s broken and disillusioned post war society Vonnegut s prose is simple and frank  But hidden behind his detached attitude is a message  in this patchwork of wry humor and discontinuous plot  he intertwines hints of quiet denouncement  Its ending begs the question  what is the point of war And perhaps he means to say  there is none  This is a type of book that people are either going to love or they re going to hate  It makes for a difficult book to write a review on as well simply for the fact of the way it s written The book follows the story of a man named Billy Pilgrim  but it doesn t go in a coherent order  Instead  you get things in the book happening before they do in the timeline of Billy s life  even his death appears sooner than you d expect  but it is not the end of the book nor the end of Billy   It s a rather important decision as this book deals heavily with existentialism  Are we defined as people based on the order and time in which we do things or the things we do  It s an interesting notion that I don t feel Vonnegut completely answers for the reader because sometimes you feel like Billy is someone you ve known for a really long time and know quite intimately while other times he seems like someone you had just randomly bumped into in a mundane situation such as the grocery store and your meeting with him is entirely inconsequential Vonnegut s style of a lot of repetition may drive some to the brink of insanity  It even sometimes got to me a little bit  but I think it was important  Not only was he showing levity towards the subject of death  especially some of the more horrific ones that were described   but he s also questioning the definition of life  Do we simply stop existing because we have died  Or do we exist on further than that because of memories or because of our simple existence in a moment  Is it possible that we never truly die  just exist in both the past  present  and future for all time  It s an interesting notion  Another point of the repetition  in my mind  is that it adds to the narration as a flow of thought existence  It shows that although we are being told about Billy Pilgrim in such a disjointed jumbled manner  often times questioning the man s sanity   we re still given an idea that this is the same thing we re talking about  There is an essence there in the repetition that is surreal and perhaps beyond our understanding on a conscious level This book offers a lot of ideas and things to think about  It has a memorable story and writing style that I particularly enjoyed  but I think it s like most existential writings  It s either something you re going to absolutely love and want to read  maybe even discuss if you re that enthusiastic about it  or you re going to want to light the book on fire until not even ashes are left after dousing it with as many flammable liquids as you can possibly conceive of  So it goes  I loved this book  It made me laugh so many times even though I felt like I shouldn t  Vonnegut describes his experience during World War II  specifically the bombarding in Dresden  But he does it through Billy Pilgrim  who s a very special little guy  You see  Billy either is really crazy or an awesome person  His traveling in time makes the novel feel yourself weird  Add the aliens from Tralfamadore and you really have something  There are so many interesting characters  such as the guy that killed Billy in revenge  and the englishmen  and the Trafalmadore beings  even Billy s wife is somehow interesting  Short sentences  and repetition  but still it traps you  I just couldn t stop reading and I like that feeling  It doesn t matter that Vonnegut would repeat the phrase  so it goes  over and over again  I found a pattern  he would just say it when someone died  or when he talked about someone s death  It said in the back it was an antiwar book  but I think is more of a  life is what it is  deal with it  book  Because everything was almost always alright with Billy Pilgrim  Poo tee weet  a FANtastic anti war novelSpeaking with The New York Times    Very tough and very funny      sad and delightful     very Vonnegut  I am bearing in mind that I am a Vonnegut newbie  but still  I have to elaborate on this book  because it really grew on me  About the  very Vonnegut       I can t claim that yet for myself  but I can t wait to get my hands on more books of this unconventional writer who developed a crazy  funny and also wise and shocking story around the devastating firebombing of Dresden in February of 1945  The author himself was present at the time and felt the need to bring it to the attention of the American people who weren t aware  and weren t made aware  of the extreme damage that had been done to this city and its people by the American military   a genocide with a death toll twice as high as that of Hiroshima  but still hardly talked about  It took Vonnegut quite some time to actually put it in writing  seeing that  Slaughterhouse Five or The Children s Crusade  was only published in 1969  but as he puts it in his book   he couldn t find the words nor the form to write about Now to the UNDERLYING IDEA of the book Things don t change  they just are the way they are  because they already happened in the fourth dimension  A very fatalistic position which comes into the book through the aliens from Tralfamadore  Cutting a little back on the fatalism  we could say  We don t Really learn from our mistakes  we don t Really change our ways   a little bit like good old Samuel Beckett put it   All of old  Nothing else ever  Ever tried  Ever failed  No matter  Try again  Fail again  Fail better   Since everything has happened already the way it has happened  we can live in any moment  future  past or present  of our lives   an ability which the main character  with the speaking name  Billy Pilgrim   learned from the Tralfamadorians and thus travels in time  back and forth  all the time throughout the book  Hence the crazy structure of the story   a kind of French skipping in time  only in this case it should rather be called American skipping There are always a few QUOTES that grow on me when I am reading a book  Here is one of them  If what Billy Pilgrim learned from the Tralfamadorians is true  that we will all live forever  no matter how dead we may sometimes seem to be  I am not overjoyed  Still   if I am going to spend eternity visiting this moment and that  I m grateful that so many of those moments are nice  And another  less deep but very funny one   context  flying with a Hungarian Airline  He  the pilot  smoked a Cuban cigar while the plane was being fuelled  When we took off  there was no talk of fastening seat belts        The folding tray in front of me would not open out  The steward went into the cockpit for a tool  came back with a beer can opener  He used it to pry out the tray  And one last one   during the flight they are reading about the world population and its doubling to 7 000 000 000 in the year 2000  And then the dry statements  I suppose they will all want dignity   I said  I suppose   said O Hare What can I say   It s a tough  funny  sad and delightful book  Read it  I m re reading this after having gone through most of the vonnegut books to see if my impression of this was correct  or if I was lured by the writing style  of which I m no longer completely astounded  Mostly  I want to relive the quirky writing style and draw the difference between this and Galapagos  as I was severely disappointed with that  Cat s Cradle will always be a favourite of mine  which goes without saying  I am not convinced with Slaughterhouse 5  however  and I wanted to have another go through  as it s been over 10 years since I last read it                   After re reading  I m convinced that it stands the test of time  I have read through a lot of other reviews that heard how good the book was  got it  and were thoroughly disappointed  I think I can understand that as well  as the book and the characters never seem to be very likable  but they represent historical situations that were dire and ironic in and of themselves  I think I can understand  in a small way  the difficulty in writing a book about such conditions  and through this story I have a bit of the feeling of the irritation callousness apathy that goes along with all of the death in the situation  through Vonnegut s irritating calloused apathetic phrase   and so it goes      The vaguely auto biographical story of Vonnegut s experiences during World War II  when  as a prisoner of war he lived through and witnessed the aftermath of the firebombing of Dresden  Germany Slaughterhouse Five is deceptive in that it doesn t seem like it would be a book to send a powerful message against the senseless destruction of human life until it actually does so  This was not a difficult book to read by any stretch of the imagination  but it is damned difficult to characterize just exactly what this book is  There s touches of auto biography here and there  as Vonnegut s introduction blends into the story at points  with the author breaking the  fourth wall  here and there to communicate directly with the reader as well being present in his now famous alter ego  the science fiction author Kilgore Trout  But there are also flying saucers and time travel and history all mixed together and it seemed like a recipe for total disaster  but it s not  This book works amazingly well  there s something sparse and simple about Vonnegut s style of writing that sucks the reader in and keeps the reader reading until the last pages and chapters describing the horror of Dresden and the aftermath almost leap out of the page at you  At that point  all the time traveling and flying saucers fall away and the story becomes all too real But  Slaughterhouse Five is the story of Billy Pilgrim  who has come unstuck in time  Relieving the moments of his life  leading from his birth  to his time in World War II  where he is captured behind the lines and witnesses the firebombing of Dresden   his marriage  a few escapes with death and eventual kidnapping by aliens  in no particular order  he flips through in a fractured journey through time that encompasses the whole book  An optometrist by trade  Billy loses his father during basic training for World War II  he eventually loses his wife to carbon monoxide poisoning and further still  he himself is killed in New York  fulfilling a promise that a fellow soldier makes to have him killed after the war  Along the way  weaving in between the moments of Billy s life  the pieces of his experience in World War II gradually emerge  how he was captured behind enemy lines sometime after the Battle of the Bulge  eventually winding up in Dresden  where he and his fellow POWs work in a slaughterhouse that really is called Slaughterhouse Five So where do the flying saucers come into the picture  Well  the back of the book says this Centering on the infamous firebombing of Dreseden  Billy Pilgrim s odyssey through time reflects the mythic journey of our own fractured lives as we search for meaning in what we fear most I m not sure I buy into that  but what I do think is that involving aliens  the Trafamaldorians  who have a non linear view of time allows Vonnegut to play with the notion of time throughout the course of his book  So to me  I came to see them more as a plot device rather than an integral or important part of the book  but I could be totally wrong on that analysis  As for Billy s journey through time  well  upon further reflection  I d say that it could be emblematic of the struggles that many veterans of all wars deal with when they come home  How do you witness the horrors of war and then try and get on with your life as best you can  Some people manage it better than others  but I would guess that the one thing you can never really escape is the memories leaping out at you at random points  not unlike Billy Pilgrim s fractured journey through time  But again  that may just be me talking out my ass Overall  a deceptively powerful book  An easy read  with Vonnegut s sparse writing style not challenging the reader overly much  but building to a powerful climax which propels Slaughterhouse Five into the category of being  as the back of the book also says   one of the world s great antiwar books    Engrossing storytelling  a very detailed  direct recollection and embroidery of events and emotions surrounding the fire bombing of dresden  The writing is good and the narration makes you feel involved I liked the scifi element  you can t tell if tralfamadore is real or not  the story is consistent either way  I freaked out for a minute near the end when Montana was mentioned after a KILLGORE TROUT book  expecting it to be another killgore trout fabrication and thus an idea implanted in pilgrim s head  but this was not the case   All of tralfamadore could be a coping mechanism  both within the book and without it  i e   for vonnegut  The  tralfamadorian  nature of the book is amazing  deaths are followed by  so it goes   and  just like a tralfamadorian novel  events are presented not chronologically  so that the novel can relate a single unified picture   well  almost  the haphazard sequence definitely focuses on the fire bombing  and indeed this is how the book ends  Vonnegut continues to weave in humor and cynicism  finally explaining the teapot incident at the very end  which was also presented at the very start    thanks to brian mcfee for getting me to read this  also this is his copy of the book     God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change  courage to change the things I can  and wisdom to always tell the difference  Vonnegut  knows that he is probably helpless to prevent future massacres  But he can tell his kids  the people around  and us his readers  that massacres  and wars  are futile  Specifically that   There is nothing intelligent to say about a massacre  Everybody is supposed to be dead  to never say anything or want anything ever again  Everything is supposed to very quite after a massacre  and it always is  except for the birds And what do the birds say   All there is to say about a massacre  things like  Poo tee weet    So it goes    recurring phrase Vonnegut uses  every time a death across in this book  is probably a reminder  re reminder   re re reminder        to us how trivial we treat the death  or the news about it  of another person  succinctly valid for a generation like mine  who grew up playing first person shooter computer games  and numbed by the stories in media about mass deaths of people in terror attacks by groups and governments  X    Y  and  Z  etc The structural mastery of this book is how Vonnegut lets two antipodal outlooks clash  the first view addresses our impulsive  short visioned and adrenalin driven primordial instincts to pick up fights  whereas the other one addresses the escapist  deterministic and rather boaring four dimensional world of Tralfamadorians  In the process  he creates some genuinely hilarious moments  but at the same time always subtle reinforcing the central thesis that there is nothing intelligent to say about a massacre  Albeit all the seeming craziness  I felt  Slaughterhouse five  is a very honest book  The author really cared about the narrative he was telling  he wanted as much people to see his point and there lies its genuity  So it goes   Fifth of December Slaughterhouse five  This novel is a strange little specimen  Stories of plunger shaped aliens and time travel had me questioning the lucidity of the author  the stableness of the novel itself  Halfway through the book I see that this novel is anything but stable  Vonnegut s strange structure causes the reader to question everything in life from time  to spirituality  to free will  The novel s thought provoking performance is aided along the way by Billy Pilgrim s quirky  undernourished character  Billy Pilgrim  Unstuck Billy is a moribund little fellow who seems to be at least partly dim  Well  this is how I saw him throughout chapter one  Now  he is a bit more complex  amazingly more likable  I m sure that this novel is a type of anti war story  for Vonnegut says so himself  I don t think it is quite the seventies block letter picket sign story I was expecting  though    Vonnegut is either employing Billy as a villain or he is the traditional epic hero  Now  let me explain  Vonnegut must be proposing that Billy is a nontraditional villain  no fangs or horridness  who actually tramps war  which is the hero  Anyway  don t Americans  for the most part see war as a hero through our starched soldiers and letters from home  This strange war hero concept seems to be no starch for our cynical author  Or  perhaps  Billy Pilgrim is the traditional epic hero  certainly not Ulysses material  but none the less a hero  If so  I can t see Billy helping Vonnegut s anti war plight  I am currently still pondering  This is my very informal opinion   This is my first time reading Vonnegut and it easily climbed upstairs to be my favorite This story is about Billy Pilgrim who came unstuck in time  In this story  we are taken to look into his whole life  past the war times  and the schizophrenic tale on the planet Tralfamadore  It taught me one thing  which I think is important for all human beings to accept life as it already is  and live without disappointments or expectations  Life is just life  And it went on without us interfering  even if we already knew what s going to happen  because it still will happen and we can t change a thing  It s like screwing a bolt where you know the position  and there s nothing you could do but to screw it again and again on the same place  because the hole won t move someplace else  Life is just that way  and so it goes I laughed a hearty laugh when I read this book  It stayed true to the issues on humanity and how ironic war is at times  So many people died in the war  but one foot soldier was given a trial and shot by a firing squad just because he stole a teapot  Reading this makes me wonder that a sense in humanity is lost  It might turned me to have pessimistic  though I prefer realistic  view of society that we live under certain circumstances which made no more sense as getting a baby s head from monkey s butt Read the book  It was as necessary as the way of living  and a peep through the looking glass on how community interacts out there  I just finished reading this tonight  and I definitely have to say it was unique  I also have to say that I found myself thoroughly engrossed  and I never wanted to put it down   though I inevitably had to put it down after reading for an hour during my lunch break  The humor was ever present  but always dark  and the sadness and horror of Billy s experiences of the war were always lurking in the background A few people have labeled this science fiction because of Billy Pilgrim s  time travel  and his experience on Tralfamadore  but I m somewhat hesitant to use that label  This novel can be read on so many levels  and I believe  science fiction  would be the one with the least depth  Through most of the book  I found myself going back and forth wondering whether Billy Pilgrim s alien abduction and time traveling were actual  real  experiences  or whether they were very needed coping mechanisms that he developed to deal with all the things that he witnessed in the war  People diagnosed with PTSD  for example  frequently experience flashbacks of various types  and I noticed a few times that certain time traveling experiences were triggered by some sort of stimuli related directly to the event he would travel to  And though the Tralfamadorian message appears fatalistic  it also offers great comfort to Billy   all the people he witnessed dying live on  even if not in this specific moment I won t be so presumptuous as to say Vonnegut s intention was to write about a war veteran who mentally created an alien race and his ability to time travel in order to help him cope with his experiences  I will never know Vonnegut s mindset on this  so I also won t rule out that Billy Pilgrim actually did get abducted and travel through time  At the very least  I believe he provides a very successful illustration of the reality of war  and an extended metaphor on the need for war veterans to cope with their experiences  Slaughterhouse 5 is sort of Kurt Vonnegut s recounting of his own POW experience in World War II  It takes a little while to understand the pacing and structure of the book    given that Vonnegut s narratives go back and forth in time at the most unexpected times  He also delves into the mind of a man that is completely out of touch with society and his mind I found this book to be nothing short of brilliant  however the satire was pretty diluted because I felt that the story s main character  protagonist  Billy Pilgrim evoked a lot of empathy  Pilgrim lived with  shell shock  aka Post Traumatic Stress Disorder  PTSD   Vonnegut s character development with Pilgrim made me feel more discouraged than anything else    which is probably what he wanted us to feel    given that it is an  anti war  bookI have to commend Vonnegut on his imagination  Aside from the actual bombing of Dresden  the side stories as Billy flashed back and forth in time were pretty imaginative  The whole alien abduction arc was sort of a look into Billy s PTSD and how he coped with the atrocities of war  I also enjoyed how Vonnegut described a fire bombing as if we were watching it in  rewind   I suggest that if you are a first time reader of this book  it would be ideal to read a summary abstract of this book to fully understand how Vonnegut presents it  I can t wait to read some Vonnegut s other stories  Vonnegut  Kurt  Slaughter House Five  1966       Read it againI know this novel fairly well having read it several times  once aloud to my students   It is about all time being always present if only we knew  or could realize it  or had a sense about time in the same way we have senses for light and sound It is also about the Allied fire bombings of Dresden which killed more people than the atomic bombing of Hiroshima   And so it goes   Kurt Vonnegut begins as though writing a memoir and advises us that  All of this happened  more or less     Of course it did not  and yet  as with all real fiction  it is psychologically true  His protagonist  Billy Pilgrim  an unlikely hero  somewhat in the manner of unlikely heroes to come like Forest Gump and the hero of Jerzy Kosinski s Being There  transcends time and space as he bumbles along  This is a comedie noire  a  black comedy   not to be confused with  film noir   a cinematic genre in which the bad guys may win or at least they are made sympathetic  In comedie noire the events are horrific but the style is light hearted  What the genres have in common is a non heroic protagonist This is also a totally original work written in a most relaxing style that fuses the elements of science fiction with realism  It is easy to read  which is one of the reasons it can be found on the high school curriculum in our public schools   It is sharply satirical  lampooning not only our moral superiority  our egocentricity  but our limited understanding of time and space  And of course it is an anti war novel in the tradition of All Quiet on the Western Front and Johnny Got His Gun Vonnegut s view of time in this novel is like the stratification of an upcropping of rock  time past and time present are there for us to see  but also there is time future  Billy Pilgrim learns from the Tralfamadorians  who kidnapped him in 1967  that we are actually timeless beings who experience what we call the past  present and future again and again  And so Billy goes back to the war and forward to his marriage  and to Tralfamadore again and again  He learns that the Tralfamadorians see the stars not as bright spots of light but as  rarefied  luminous spaghetti  and human beings as  great millepedes with babies  legs at one end and old people s legs at the other   So time is not a river  nor is it a snake with its tail in its mouth  It is omnipresent  yet some things occur before and some after  but always they occur again And so it goes What I admire most about this most admirable novel is how easily and naturally Vonnegut controls the narrative and how effortlessly seems its construction  It is almost as if Vonnegut sat down one day and let his thoughts wander  and when he was through  here is this novel In a sense  Vonnegut invented a new novelistic genre  combining fantasy with realism  touched by fictionalized memoir  penned in a comedic mode as horror is overtaken by a kind of fatalistic yet humorous view of life  Note here the appearance of Kilgore Trout  Vonnegut s alter ego  the science fiction writer who is said to have invented Tralfamadore Bottom line  read this without preconceptions and read it without regard to the usual constraints  Just let it flow and accept it for what it is  a juxtaposition of several genres  a tale of fiction that  as fiction should  transcends time and space    a review by Dennis Littrell I feel that so far  every one of Vonnegut s novels and short stories have built up to this masterpiece  It all seems like warm up exercises until now  Kilgore Trout and the  protagonist  from Mother Night appear  as well as Eliot Rosewater  and Vonnegut himself makes an appearance  if you don t count Billy Pilgrim  Kilgore Trout and Eliot Rosewater  by exclaiming that he is  excreting  his brains out A visitor from outer space tells Billy   The flaw in the Christ stories   was that Christ  who didn t look like much  was actually the Son of the Most Powerful Being in the Universe  Readers understood that  so when they came to the crucifixion  they naturally thought   Oh  boy   they sure picked the wrong guy to lynch that time  And the thought had a brother   There are right people to lynch   Who  People not well connected  So it goes   The visitor from outer space made a gift to Earth of a new Gospel  In it  Jesus really was a nobody  and a pain in the neck to a lot of people with better connections than he had  He still got to say all the lovely and puzzling things he said in the other Gospels   The readers would feel justified in crucifying him since he was such a nobody   And then  just before the nobody died  the heavens opened up  and there was thunder and lightning  The voice of God came crashing down  He told the people that he was adopting the bum as his son  giving him the full powers and privileges of The Son of the Creator of the Universe throughout all eternity  God said this   From this moment on  he will punish horribly anybody who torments a bum who has no connections   The creatures from outer space encouraged Billy to enjoy every moment he can and focus on those moments that are enjoyable  Billy comments      if I am going to spend eternitiy visiting this moment and that  I m grateful that so many of those moments are nice   That about sums it up for me I finished this fantastic  thought provoking book and watched my daughter play with a dollhouse that arrived unexpectedly in the mail that day from a childhood friend  My son was curled up on the couch next to me reading a book  That was a moment I would gratefully return to for eternity  So it goes   If this book were a drink  I would have already drunk it  I will always be drinking it If this story were an animal  it would be a crazy  time traveling insect with bulging  compounded  compacted eyes  capable of seeing into the past and future forever This is year of firsts for me  Not only did I get my first taste of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle  but I also read my first Vonnegut and encountered in Slaughterhouse Five a fragmented  post modern  yet eminently readable    tale of a man who has come unstuck in time  Or is the story of the brutal and horrifyingly transcendent experience of having survived the firebombing of Dresden during World War II  Or is the story of alien abduction and porn star sex  Of a guy who can t connect with his family  Or maybe the story of Vonnegut writing the story  Well  the answer is  yes  to all of these Despite the odd flavor and metanarrative spark that makes this book worthy of master s thesis  it s also highly readable  I found out that Kurt Vonnegut was also a journalist  so he s good at keeping his readers  in the moment   and the narrative voice is thoroughly engaging  The only thing I didn t like about it was the historically washed tone when it came to female characters  but I think that s at least partially a product of the time as I ve yet to encounter a single male author writing between 1950 1980  regardless of genre  who can refrain from passing some sort of knee jerk sexist judgment against his female characters  In Slaughterhouse Five  just like in so many other books  the female characters aren t entirely as whole people Besides these anti female overtones  the book is incredibly well crafted  smart  funny and terribly  poignantly sad  Amazing  And totally ripped off in Safran Foer s 9 11 book  without attribution    maybe that s what turned me off of it a bit   American planes  full of holes and wounded men and corpses  took off backwards from an air field in England  Over France  a few German fighters flew at them backwards  sucked bullets and shell fragments from some of the planes and crewmen    The formation flew backwards over a German city that was in flames The bombers opened their bomb bay doors  exerted a miraculous magnetism which shrunk the flames  gathered them into cylindrical steel containers  and lifted the containers into the bellies of the planes     When the bombers got back to base  the steel cylinders were taken from the racks and shipped back to the United States of America  where factories were operating day and night  dismantling the cylinders  separating the dangerous contents into minerals  Touchingly  it was mainly women who did this work  The minerals were then shipped to specialists in remote areas  It was their business to put them into the ground  to hide them cleverly  so they would never hurt anybody ever again   Ok  here is a classic that I  get  I was assigned this book in college and like most assigned reading  I used SparkNotes and learned just enough to pass  That may have been a good thing  I remember thinking how weird this book sounded with time travel and the Tralfamadorians  Reading it as an adult  and a Soldier  my perspective is completely different and I GET Vonnegut completely and thoroughly now I read this book during my second deployment to Iraq  We are in the process of handing control of the country to the Iraqi government and my unit is here simply to protect Americans  I am the farthest thing from a POW but yet I feel as close to one  as Vonnegut describes them  as possible  We are confined to small bases  We have excellent rations but we are stuck here  We don t see our families  women and children as KV mentions several times   The only thing we have to do to prevent insanity is to work out and practice good hygiene just like the British POWs in the novel  I ve never felt so connected to a novel as this  If the intangible characteristics of the war were were given a head  arms  legs  and all other human body parts  it would inevitably become Billy Pilgrim  pathetic  crazy  useless  and really really sad  I d like to think that was what Kurt Vonnegut was thinking too when he created his character I also found Valencia s death as a representation of the irony of the whole war itself  The best parts of this book were definitely the parts in Tralfamadore  I love the idea of death being  temporary  and every moment existing forever   I have visited thirty one inhabited planets in the universe and have studied reports on one hundred more  Only on earth is there talk of free will   Genius  I love the idea I don t get though  how Slaughterhouse Five became the title  At first I misinterpreted it as they were in Slaughterhouse Five during the bombing  but turns out that if they were there  they would have died  It s ironic to the whole message of the book  in my opinion Also  this book has one of the best villains ever  All hail Paul Lazzaro  If all the villains in every book were as smart as Paul Lazzaro  we d be hating all the books at how effective the antagonists are  He s patient  strong willed  and has lots of anger  Take that Voldemort  The Tralfamadorians don t count as villains  they were the best part of this book This book is definitely going in my favorites list  I will now venture to read some more childish but absolute genius Vonnegut  This is a cleverly written novel that held my attention the whole time  I was turning the pages with interest  Mostly it is a description of what happened to the character Billy Pilgrim in World War Two  The story overlaps with the experience of the author including being a prisoner of war and the fire bombing of Dresden  It s an anti war novel but written in a new way The story has an interesting structure because Billy is a time traveler  We find out all about his life in flash backs and flash forwards  He is even abducted by aliens and travels to the planet Tralfamadore where he is kept in a geodesic zoo and is mated with the movie star Montana Wildhack  The Tralfamadorians live in the fourth dimension and experience all things in time as being part of a single whole  This is how we experience the story too  we re told how it is going to end at the start  It s an outlandishly creative way to present the war time experiences which come across as being based on reality It s interesting to question whether Billy really can travel through time or if he s gone a little nutty from having too many bad experiences  Definitely a spun out  thought provoking  yet easy book to read  Slaughterhouse IV is the story of Kurt Vonnegut s novel and time in World War II  specifically during the fire bombing of Dresden in East Germany  However  as Vonnegut explains on the very first page   All of this happened  more or less   He changes all the names around  and starts his novel by explaining that Billy Pilgrim  Kurt  has become unstuck in time  Billy was born in 1922 in Illium  New York and his appearance is a weak white male  He wants to be an optometrist but is drafted into the second World War  After his time spent in the war he is involved in a plane crash in Vermont and is the only one that survives  His wife tragically dies in an accident so his only family is his two children  Unfortunately  the plane crash leaves him in a state of mental sickness  The book jumps around to certain moments in Billy s life  which makes a summary a daunting task  such as his time in the war  and his time on a planet called Tralfamadore  It is native to the Tralfamadorians who are green aliens  curious in studying humans  The Traflamadorians are beings who can see in four dimensions and mock Billy for only being able to see in three  They live on a planet that deals with war constantly but they don t believe in death  Instead  they believe that the moment in which one is living is simply that  a moment  One does not die but instead relives moments in time over and over again  This is what Billy Pilgrim adopts and what is seen throughout the book  He can close his eyes at any point  open them and find himself at another point in time  Eventually  the moments in time start to blur together and Billy starts to remember more heightened moments in his life  The Traflamadorians force him to mate with a young woman who his half his age  The fire bombing of Dresden which killed 25 000 people is another heightened event that he experiences and is how the book ends  However  throughout the entire story  there is a distinct writing style that Vonnegut uses and many themes  One cross of a writing style and a theme that Vonnegut uses is his theme of death  and the saying  So it goes   At first it catches the reader as odd  that the author would use this phrase over and over again  But then one can appreciate the use of it  If you think about it  the Traflamadorians believe that one doesn t die  and Billy adopts it as well  So saying  So it goes  after every death is really saying  Well  they may be dead in this moment  but they are more than alive in another  Death is also a large theme  and the book closely follows a theme that is discussed in class  War can be a very terrible thing  The fire bombing of Dresden shows how destructive bombs can be  25 000 dead  Death is such a powerful theme in the book with the use of So It Goes and whether the death is accidental and closely related to Billy  it doesn t matter  the death is still there  Another theme that was present and stuck out clearly was the theme of site  Going back to the summary  one sees that Billy was studying to be an Optometrist  The Traflamadorians can see in four dimensions and mock the humans for not being able to do so  Going back to Billy  it is unclear whether he sees the truth or is stuck in the darkness  He has a lot of darkness in his life  The bombings  the war overall  the death of his wife  his capture by Alien force  He has little light and little definite truth  One could argue that the Aliens in the book never happened and the fact that he time travels  well that s another counter completely  Whether the events in the book are true or not can only be answered by an analysis of the main characters  Billy Pilgrim  A weak Optometrist to be who should have never been in the war to start  When he was in the war  he never even carried a gun  only a knife  Billy is a man who suffered many great tragedies in his life  He met a large but very nice woman and had 2 children with her only for her to die in an accident where she was trying to reach him in the hospital  Billy was basically a vegetable after he was in the plane crash in Vermont and this really affected him  He was given electro shock therapy which is why many people don t believe his story about the Traflamadorians  And how about those Aliens  They are green beings shaped like toilet plungers  he describes  Instead of a single life cycle  a linear path which human kind believes in  they believe that life is a collage  an assembling of moments where one spends their lives reliving  They capture Billy Pilgrim one night and put him on display in a zoo like cage where they can observe and talk to him  They often have trouble with his answers though because they see in four dimensions and can t really understand the human way of life  There are the O Hares as well  Bernard and Mary  Bernard is a war buddy of Vonnegut  and is talked about in the first chapter before the moments of Billy Pilgrim are delved into  Mary  who is Bernard s wife is strongly opposed to war and his novel  saying that he is trying to glorify war  Vonnegut greatly agrees with her and dedicates the novel to her  In all  Vonnegut s style of telling his moments in time is very unorthodox  However  Vonnegut is a master at his approach  His phrase of  So It Goes  does a better job of tying together his theme of the horrible travesties of war  the moments of life in which humans live  and many other in a way that is innovative and simply astounding  Readers will find themselves not being able to put down this amazing piece of literature for it is a timeless book and one that people should all read in their lifetime  It s funny at times and sad as well  The philosophy of the Traflamadorians really gets one thinking about life  What is the meaning of it  what happens after death  The book inspires so much thought about all the things we overlook in life  or all the things that we think about too much  It s a must read  thought provoking novel  The most important thing I learned on Tralfamadore was that when a person dies he only appears to die  He is still very much alive in the past  so it is very silly for people to cry at his funeral  All moments  past  present and future  always have existed  always will exist  The Tralfamadorians can look at all the different moments just that way we can look at a stretch of the Rocky Mountains  for instance  They can see how permanent all the moments are  and they can look at any moment that interests them  It is just an illusion we have here on Earth that one moment follows another one  like beads on a string  and that once a moment is gone it is gone forever When a Tralfamadorian sees a corpse  all he thinks is that the dead person is in a bad condition in that particular moment  but that the same person is just fine in plenty of other moments I loved this book from the first time I picked it up bored my first few days of sophomore year before classes started  I had to buy this for Into to Shakespeare of all classes  and once I opened it  sitting on my bed in my dorm  I was hooked  At that point I had yet to find a book that I could really call my favorite  and after years  it is still there  sharing it s title with a few others  It is a funny book you just can t laugh at  that tells the truth in such meaningful ways  It is still relevant even now  Everyone must read this at some point in their life  A certain video game plucked me up from the ground and replanted me in the middle of its war zone  I won t specify which one  but I definitely was reminded of it while reading this book  Must be the heavy dose of sci fi  I ve been scavenging for war novels and poetry ever since As always  Vonnegut s wit and philosophy are too much for my unworthy mind  But it all boils down to this  the questioning of war  Humans are encouraged to help one another and yet turn into bloodthirsty animals to eliminate competition  There are too many that don t question law and  even worse  ones that develop their morals straight from another s mouth  Despite posing this question  Vonnegut does not try to provide any answers  That d defeat the purpose of challenging the status quo  I m thinking more of that particular video game than the book at this point I gravitated towards Billy s character  His traumatic experience has warped his sense of reality into a form that helps him cope  He s so indifferent to his own mortality  It really makes you think about the magnitude of war and its horrors  War is this glorified  patriotic thing from the outside but it does nothing aside from perpetuate and justify senseless slaughter  And no one is a hero  We re all just pawns controlled by other pawns  This book is the best anti war book I ve read  although Vonnegut says writing an anti war book is like writing and anti glacier book    both being futile endeavors   It s also a fun light science fiction as well  He asks us to think about fate and free will and the way we view our lives  Vonnegut brings us into the shattered mind of a soldier  Billy Pilgrim  who has become unstuck in time in order to deal with the tragedy of war and continues with his coping mechanism throughout his life  The brain can do some crazy things in order to deal with trauma  It s a beautiful thing really  It makes me sad to think of the terrible things we are capable of but it also makes me happy to think that we can create a different space in our heads to deal with tragedy  Billy finds himself jumping through time and learning that we cannot choose what happens in our lives but we can choose to focus on any one part of it   be it positive or negative  Death is not scary because our loved ones will always be a memory  they will always be outside of time  unbound by time and free   Although I ve only read to the fourth chapter so far  Slaughterhouse Five is quickly becoming one of my favorite books  Vonnegut  likewise  is becoming one of my favorite authors  This novel is overflowing with both huge  noticable  intriguing devices  the most obvious of which is Tralfamadore  but it is also filled with little bits of diction and randomness that make you think  For example  at the end of chapter three Vonnegut calls those on the train  waiting for days to leave   human beings   instead of refering to them as the prisoners or in Billy Pilgrim s view point  which would make them  we   This makes me wonder how much they were viewed by the German s as how we would view cattle sent to the slaughterhouse  Similarly Billy Pilgrim s character is extremely interesting in an odd sort of way  By the time the German s capture him he seems to no longer care about anything  He  in fact  has already begun his odd habit of getting unstuck in time  In reading this novel  I can see why it took Vonnegut so long to write it  I love it 12 11 08I ve finally finished the book and still find it amazing  Although  to be honest  I wish there wouldn t have been as much crudeness  Even so  it s masterful how Vonnegut uses every single part in the book to emphasize his point  For instance  he mentions the demise of Edgar Derby at least twenty times  or some number around there   but doesn t even go into detail when it actually happens  Infact  you learn more about Derby s end in Billy s refering to it than you do when it happens  This makes sense to Billy  as he s already seen it and told us how it happens  Even the way the novel is set up refers back to Tralfamadore and the idea that everything has already happened and will happen in one way that is already predetermined  The Tralfamadorian s books show this by not having a specific plot or outline or anything normal in books  Thus Vonnegut uses that in SlaughterHouse Five  It doesn t build up to one climax or follow events logically  but shows just bits and pieces that happen in a scattered mix  The Tralfamadorians do this to see everything working together at a specific time to get an image of one moment that is beautiful  Vonnegut uses this technique  but even the moments Billy considers beautiful  like warming in the sun on a destroyed  burnt Dresden  are  in reality  awful  I m not sure why Vonnegut does this  perhaps he has a truly doomed view of the world and existence  but I think he s more using Billy s life to push people away from this view  Billy Pilgrim always knew what was going to happen to him and was uterly depressed and hopeless throughout his life  It s a odd  imensely interesting book that I don t quite understand and don t think I will even to the day I die  So it goes  This is an awesome book  Wacky but serious  tragic and beautiful  Sort of strange as it is a book about  at least somewhat  WWII   but written in the sixties  I listened to the audiobook version  read by Ethan Hawke  yesssssss  He has this sexy  quiet voice and I loved it  I wish he d narrate all my books heheBut seriously  this book gives the reader so much to think about  The structure of the story and its shifts in time work so well  The characters are compelling  and the situations are enduring and full of meaning  My favorite part of Slaughterhouse Five is when Billy becomes slightly un stuck in time and watches the war movie backwards  the German guns suck bullets from the American planes and the planes extract bombs and destruction from the ground  the whole planes and men make it back to America where the men become high school students and women work to dismantle the weapons of war and people in far flung regions hide the dangerous materials deep in the earth where no one can hurt anyone else with them  Billy imagines then that Hitler is a baby  and that we are all moving towards the creation of two perfect human beings named Adam and Eve  I m basically ruining it  but it is one of the most beautiful things I have ever read  So simple and profound   Whenever I read Vonnegut  I do so with apprehension  if only because I hear so much about how good he is  a part of me utterly refuses to believe it  Yet  time and again  I discover that his reputation for being one of America s greatest writers is well earned  Love him or hate him  the man has a way with words  and conjuring imagery in one s mind that not many other writers can match  I giggled in glee at the part where Vonnegut describes his main protagonist  Billy Pilgrim  watching a war movie in reverse  how the war planes would suck up all the flames that have engulfed the city  the bombs are sent back to the factories to be dismantled  and all of the materials for making bombs are put back into the Earth  never to harm another person again  That whole sequence is pretty damn genius  Being a fan of stories that deal with time travel  I definitely enjoyed that aspect of the books as well  although Vonnegut leaves it ambiguous as to whether or not poor Billy Pilgrim is  actually  traveling through time  or is just senile  and confusing reality with the trashy sci fi novels he reads  I lean towards that he is senile   One may think that telling the story in such a fragmented fashion would be confusing  or annoying  but it really works  and in the end  somehow paints a more complete portrait of Billy s character than a linear story would have  Another neat surprise is the cameo from the main character of Mother Night  Howard J  Campbell Jr  Anyway  the book is short and sweet  so there really is no excuse for even a casual reader to not give it a try  So it goes  Since summer is here  a lot of people are probably looking for good books to read and I thought I d recommend one of my favorites  Slaughterhouse Five by Kurt Vonnegut  It s a satire on the absurdities of war and is one of the funniest books I have ever read  Along with being hilarious  Slaughterhouse five is also considered a landmark in American literature and addresses important issues that will make the reader think long after they have finished the book  Slaughterhouse Five tells the story of Billy Pilgrim  a fatalistic American soldier in World War II with little training  strength  or even a proper uniform  Billy has become  unstuck in time  as a result of his abduction by aliens and does not experience life chronologically  Instead  he jumps back and forth in time and space and  as a result  you read about different parts of his life in the order that Vonnegut chooses  rather than the order that they occur  This may sound confusing  but it actually adds to the story because you experience Billy s life as he does and gain a better understanding of the character  The main plotline of the book centers on Billy s time as a prisoner of war leading up to his experience at the bombing of Dresden  Through flashbacks to Billy s time before the war and flash forwards to his life after the war  Vonnegut tells Billy s somber story  from his stay in a mental ward to his survival of a disastrous plane crash  The fact that Billy knows everything that will happen to him makes the hardships he suffers all the more tragic  but Vonnegut s wit makes even the harshest calamity seem amusing  As opposed to many other authors of literary significance  Vonnegut writes with a simple  no frills  style in short chapters that make the book easy to read and each chapter is like a joke  with a punch line at the end  The book  though morbid at times  is generally hilarious and meaningful  addressing important issues with wit and humor that make you glad you read it  I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys satire  science fiction  or dark comedy  or to anyone who just wants to read an entertaining book that their English teacher will approve of  Reading Vonnegut s work in order of publication has some interesting side effects  Not only do you see the reoccurring characters appear and concepts expand  you also see the story teller grow Slaughterhouse Five is a master work for Vonnegut  While I still have more to read in his bibliography  I believe it will be tough to topple  It is at one time funny and the next  frightening  It is often dreadfully honest  brutally real and then sometimes a science fiction fantasy  The politics are no longer subtle or suggestive  Even the story backbone defies any standard structure or even a conflict  This is the book that made Vonnegut    Vonnegut Smarter people then me   or is it I    have dissected this book that gingerly uncovers Vonnegut s own war experience  They have discussed how it changes their own perspective on war and life  I get it I cannot anticipate how much someone would enjoy this book if they hadn t read any of his other works  Is Slaughterhouse Five an excellent book  or an excellent Vonnegut book  While it is unreasonable to expect anyone to read his other books as a primer to this book  many of the subtleties that make it so enjoyable are certainly enhanced There is one place where there is no argument  Vonnegut has written the best Tralfamadorian novel of all time  If I say this is an anti war book  I will be lying  If I say  it s a science fiction genre classic  I might be untrue again  Is it an allegory  Not in reality  What if it s an intense blend of all three of those  That s right  we get a masterpiece  A part of the novel is set in the period of second world war  Slaughterhouse Five is a place in the city of Dresden  Germany where the American POWs  Prisoners of war  were held  Slaughterhouse stands for a metaphor for this beautiful and  open  city of Dresden  as the author takes us to its own shattering experiences as an American infantryman  through the infamous bombings and subsequent destruction of Dresden resulting in the  slaughtering  of 135 000 people  Vonnegut promises that this book is a failure as it is written about a massacre and anything that is written on a massacre has to be a failure because there is nothing intelligent to write about it as eventually everyone dies  Slaughterhouse Five is an anti war book  Yes   There are almost no characters in this story  and almost no dramatic confrontations  because most of the people in it are so sick  and so much the listless playthings of enormous forces  One of the main effects of war  after all  is that people are discouraged from being characters   And so it goes Slaughterhouse Five recounts the incidents of an emaciated  Coca Cola bottle shaped  weak Billy Pilgrim who always comes unstuck in time  He journeys to the fictional planet of Tralfamadore within a time warp that Tralfamadorians create for him  What appears to be a micro second to the Earthlings  are actually tens of years on this alien planet  On Tralfamadore  Billy learns an important lesson that I feel every Earthling should learn  Wars are everywhere  There isn t anything one can do about them  But if one tries  one can actually ignore the awful times and concentrate on the good ones  One can spend an eternity looking at the pleasant moments  On Earth  Billy is a replacement soldier in the war and is captured by the Germans  finally brought to Dresden in the slaughterhouse as POW  The novel weaves through various phases of Billy s life which are gripping and vividly intriguing  It is a complete Vonnegutusque novel  which consists of the factual introductory prologue  an abrupt epilogue and a completely fictional  yet mesmerizing Crichton style central story  The author doesn t really describe much the bombings of Dresden  in fact  he barely just touches the subject  Rest is left on the readers  discretion  There are parts where you are literally into fits  points of LOL hilarity  If you are a Catch 22 fan  this book certainly fits to be your next pick   Teton County Library Call No  F VONNEGUTMarisa s Rating  5 StarsFinally read this  classic    a great satirical piece  indeed  Vonnegut has a very specific writing style   stating the obvious in but in a way that is both comical and disarming  saying something really disturbing and sad  and then following it with the phrase  so it goes    The book  which details the life of Billy Pilgrim  a WWII veteran and apparently  time traveler  I like that Vonnegut expects a lot from his readers    we are expected to follow Billy as he moves back and forth through at least 5 scenes   from life in a mental hospital after the war  to the planet of Tralfamadore  to the fire bombing of Dresden  The book seems to essentially be about post traumatic distress disorder    or the horrors of war on the human psyche  Billy moves through space and time but the reader is left wondering if that s just in his imagination  I really liked Vonnegut s cleverness  plays on words and especially his creativity   this was accessible and thought provoking   Nov  23  2008    What started out as a wacky book including a veteran s trip to a foreign planet    it is called Tralfamadore    has turned into a thought provoking novel pondering such  Earthling  ideas as the notion of free will  the fourth dimension of time  and the cyclical nature of being  Vonnegut does all this through an ex POW named Billy Pilgrim  an intriguing character who becomes  unstuck in time   Billy s travels and experiences allow the reader to examine his own feelings about war  to consider how dramatically war affects veterans  as in post traumatic stress syndrome   and to contemplate the idea of free will  If one would have asked me how I liked the book after chapter 2  I would have said that I hated it  As of the end of chapter 4  where I am now  I cannot wait to read more           Dec  5  2008    I m now past the fifth chapter  and I can truly say that I love the book  His subtle humor  His conversational style  His hop  skip  and jump around motif  It is all great    and just a little above my head  which makes it that much better  The book has even come up in conversation outside of school  and it has started some pretty deep debates  Take last night for example  On the way back from Newport  Preston asked how I liked the book and what I thought about this and that  And then I brought up the topic of free will  In the novel  the Tralfamadorian tells Billy that only on Earth is there any talk of free will  They are all  bugs trapped in amber    Time travel to a different scene   Again in the delousing station  an  unseen hand  turns the water on and off  alluding to a lack of free will  Is there free will  is there not free will  That was the question  We all agreed    there is free will in the universe  But how could we reconcile that fact with our beliefs in an omniscient God  How could an omniscient being    one who knows the outcome of every situation    still allow humans to have free will  Are those terms not contradictory  For instance  if I had the choice to go to Little Rock or not  and God already knows my choice  do I truly have free will  I could go on and on  probably on my own search for answers  Because the fact is  I have trouble comprehending the two  free will and omniscience  It might take a Tralfamadorian to explain it to me Before I end  I also want to note a few interesting tidbits from the fifth chapter   1  The extraterrestrial book that Billy attempts to read on the space ship  the one with clumps of symbols separated by stars  directly relates to the Tralfamadorian view of the Universe  When you view an instance separately  it makes no sense  Only when you view every instance at the same time do they combine to produce a marvelous moment   2  When Billy s father shows his glowing watch in the totally dark cave  Vonnegut again plays to the motif of time   3  The German s reply   Vy you  Vy anybody    mimics a quote by a Tralfamadorian earlier in the novel  The Tralfamadorian says   Why you  Why us for that matter   Perhaps there is an IS but no BECAUSE   4  The topic of the Children s Crusades comes up again on page 135   5  Valencia eats a Three Musketeers Candy Bar   oh the irony  Or not   6  A romantic view of war shows itself when Rosewater exclaims   That s the attractive thing about war  Absolutely everybody gets a little something    7  Vonnegut appears again in the text  He says  It would make a good epitaph for Billy Pilgrim  and for me  too   And again a few pages over   That was I  That was me  That was the author of this book  That s it for this time     JMP          Dec  14  2008    I ve been reading this book since late November  and I have finally finished it  That is usually an exciting thing  to finish a book  but not this time  I am left with more questions than answers  which is good  I suppose  and I m left with a jaw dropped open that I could enjoy a book like this  one with no cohesive plot and one about war  It is sporadic  and nonlinear  and weird  how else would you describe Tralfamadorians   and thought provoking  and  quite simply  a masterpiece of twentieth century fiction Before I leave  though  I want to connect an idea within this book to a modern day debate   TEXT TO WORLD  Remember back to Billy s stay in the hospital following the horrible plane accident  and specifically remember Billy s roommate  Professor Rumfoord  While Billy lay in his bed  allowing his  listlessness  to conceal  a mind which was fizzing and flashing thrillingly   Mr  Rumfoord took it upon himself to determine that Billy was no longer a human being  Mr  Rumfoord exclaimed   Why don t they let him die   Almost forty years later  we are still debating Mr  Rumfoord s question to some extent  if a person s chances of recovering from a coma are slim to none  if a person will always lie in a vegetative state  should that person s family have the right to decide to take him off life support  Such was the case for Terri Schiavo in 2005 when her husband petitioned a court to remove her feeding tube  saying that she would not want to live in an unconscious state forever  Terri s parents argued otherwise  hoping to keep their daughter alive  Her husband eventually won the case  and doctors finally removed Terri s feeding tube  The case drew nation attention  and the debate over one s  right to die  rages on  The Muzzle of a GunDespite the glorification of war on the silver screen  the principle of war is not only brutish and disheartening but also perhaps the most disgusting trait of humanity  Although other animals fight and kill each other on occasion  the speed  efficiency  and scope by which humans kill each other is unparalleled For some  war is a necessary evil  To them  when dialogue fails to rehabilitate a group  nothing forces correct behavior like the muzzle of a gun For others  no amount of conflict necessitates the taking of another s life Even a war universally justified like World War II has its detractors  Of course  the atrocities of Hitler required a response and no pacifist condones Hitler s actions  But some people don t bleed red  white  and blue DresdenIn the bombing of Dresden  Allied forces fire bombed an entire city indiscriminately  In addition to the many military personnel who perished in the burning city  25 000 civilians died  Vonnegut  a prisoner of war in Dresden at the time  experienced the calamity first hand and found its destruction futile in the grand scheme of things  In Palm Sunday  he wrote of his book  Slaughterhouse Five  The Dresden atrocity  tremendously expensive and meticulously planned  was so meaningless  finally  that only one person on the entire planet got any benefit from it  I am that person  I wrote this book  which earned a lot of money for me and made my reputation  such as it is  One way or another  I got two or three dollars for every person killed  Some business I m in   302  With Slaughterhouse Five   perhaps his most famous work   Vonnegut retells the story of the Dresden fire bombing through a nonlinear narrative  an exploration of fate vs  free will  and a darkly satirical voice Nonlinear NarrativeThe novel follows the life of Billy Pilgrim  a Chaplain s Assistant in the war and an optometrist in his later years  as he time travels between his experience on the front  his life post war  and his time spent on Tralfamadore  the home world of the alien race who abducted him Time  An Exploration of Fate vs  Free WillThese aliens view time much differently from humans  While humanity understands time in one direction  the Tralfamadorians view all moments in time simultaneously Influenced by his abductors  Billy Pilgrim jumps between eras in his life inadvertently  His perception of circumstances is exceptionally fatalistic  When it comes to death  Pilgrim glibly exclaims   So it goes   He knows that death is only one moment among many simultaneously occurring circumstances Vonnegut s dark view of human nature expands when he pens   If I hadn t spent so much time studying Earthlings   said the Tralfamadorian   I wouldn t have any idea what was meant by  free will   I ve visited thirty one inhabited planets in the universe  and I have studied reports on one hundred more  Only on Earth is there any talk of free will    86  A Satirical Voice  DarklyOn top of these philosophical notions  Vonnegut writes beautifully  His inventive prose is entertaining  evocative  and creative  Discussing a moment when Billy perceives time in reverse  Vonnegut writes  American planes  full of holes and wounded men and corpses took off backwards from an airfield in England  Over France  a few German fighter planes flew at them backwards  sucked bullets and shell fragments from some of the planes and crewman  They did the same for wrecked American bombers on the ground  and those planes flew up backwards to join the formation The formation flew backwards over a German city and that was in flames  The bombers opened their bomb bay doors  exerted a miraculous magnetism which shrunk the fires  gathered them into cylindrical steel containers  and lifted the containers into the bellies of the planes  The containers were stored neatly in racks The Germans below had miraculous devices of their own  which were long steel tubes  They used them to suck more fragments from the crewmen and planes  But there were still a few wounded Americans  though  and some of the bombers were in bad repair  Over France  though  German fighters came up again  made everything and everybody as good as new When the bombers got back to their base  the steel cylinders were taken from the racks and shipped back to the United States of America  where factories were operating night and day  dismantling the cylinders  separating the dangerous contents into minerals  Touchingly  it was mainly women who did this work  The minerals were then shipped to specialists in remote areas  It was their business to put them into the ground  to hide them cleverly  so they would never hurt anybody ever again The American fliers turned in their uniforms  became high school kids  And Hitler turned into a baby  Billy Pilgrim supposed   75  The Futility of WarDespite the prose jumping from decade to decade and from earth to a distant planet in the universe  Vonnegut ultimately centers the story on the fateful bombing of Dresden  Instead of glorifying war and creating charismatic heroes  Vonnegut considers these deeds futile  Concerning one of Billy Pilgrim s fellow soldiers  Vonnegut asserts  There are almost no characters in this story  and almost no dramatic confrontations  because most of the people in it are so sick and so much the listless playthings of enormous forces  One of the main effects of war  after all  is that people are discouraged from being characters  164  Whether or not a just war is possible  the actual performance on the frontlines of battle is a heartbreaking part of the human condition  Is it possible for humanity to stop war amongst its constituents  Are we capable of change  Will time even present a conclusion  Vonnegut believes that a dance with death is necessary for great art  He danced in the fires of Dresden and Slaughterhouse Five was the result  Just as many find hope in an excellent war story  others flourish with a well told anti war novel  Slaughterhouse Five is a brilliantly written book  If you have yet to read it  please do so Originally published at http   wherepenmeetspaper blogspot com I m glad I waited until the onset of total disillusionment and jadedness to read this book  After days and days of driving around in circles at the Austin Bergstrom airport  contemplating life   I come back to the truth that there isn t enough money to go around  It s only kept valuable by a few hands controlling the supply and increasing the demand  I come to the conclusion that war is inevitable  The wars that are fought are ultimately out of our hands  though some may argue differently  Human relations at the time of World War II were extraordinarily homicidal and maniacal  The order of the world was at stake  I suppose the 60s were a glimmer of hope  specks of rebellion here and there since  but now in the surveillance era  I m more paranoid and hopeless than ever  concerning the totality of authority  I come to the conclusion that death is integral to life  So it goes  If I sit on my ass and drive circles at the airport until I m old and unemployable  it s the nature of things that I should die off earlier than someone who played the game of survival and financially prepared  I guess I could always burden some bleeding heart  How is a bomb death better or worse than death by AIDS or getting mauled by a bear  Death is death  Birth is birth  It s all peculiar and horrifying  Ultimately   why should I CARE about other human beings  or the world  even  I have operational empathy  but from a logical point of view  what difference does it make whether we live or die  Why do we invest so much energy into preserving life   when everything dies  Thanks to overpopulation and financial collapse  we actually need more people dead than we ever have before in history  Vonnegut explains how the Dresden bombing killed more people than Hiroshima  but Hiroshima got the glory because it was unconventional  Dresden gets buried in the history books  So it goes  This book also makes me realize that   as much as I have opposed them in the past for illegitimate acts against weak countries as a tactic for future national security   I still am at the mercy of my government and army  and in some offhand way  they do protect me   should something like the Nazi state arise again  With our luck it s going to be on our own soil  But due to the violence of humans  I m gonna have to depend on one team or the other   or just go on dodging bullets with a protest sign  while dumpster diving forever Viva la crapolution Shit I m tired    I don t know if any of that made sense  This was the first Vonnegut I read  It was also part of another first  My AP English teacher  hardcore gal that Mrs Feasley was  had us do one  book brief  each month all senior year  A book brief was a hand written book report usually ranging between 10 15 pages that we were expected to write during the school day  Before school  after school  during lunch  during any study halls  during her class and  though not officially sanctioned  any other class that wasn t important enough to skip  You would have to go over plot summary  significance of the title  symbols  literary techniques  character analysis of 3 5 main characters  and all kinds of other whatnot  And Slaughterhouse Five was the first book I read for one of those jobies  And thank GOURD  If it had been like  James Joyce or something Russian I never would have survived  This book was so great  like a super cool new boyfriend and you just can shut up about it  I had never read any meritorious literature  SORRY NATHANIEL HAWTHORN  like this and I just loved it  And I got to just write about it for hours and pages and pens worth  KV basically was my super cool new literary boyfriend  Years later  my real life non literary boyfriend  who is now my non literary husband  read the copy I had read for the book brief and he was like   What did you do  Highlight every single  and so it goes    and I was like   Well    yes  I wanted an exact figure   True story  Also  is about misery  Not just of war  but of being a white American male in the 50s  So it s a pretty great intro to KV  And also there are aliens  And sex  With a movie star  You ll love it  Time travel  There s that too  AND PICTURES  Everybody wins  This book was disturbing in a different way than I m used to  Reading it felt like being slapped every so often It made war look unpleasant not by focusing on emotional events and drama within the war  but to show it in very sad and pathetic light  Very little of the book consisted of the war scenes  anyway  A man has a perverted picture  Someone has scrawny  hairy ankles  Someone can t hold their pee  The main character is nothing short of pitiable  The alien scenes added a whole new layer of oddness There was one scene I liked in particular  Billy saw the war in reverse  and only positive things were said about it   The planes flew backwards  sucking up the bullets and fires  the soldiers went home  women spent hours in factories taking apart the weapons  the minerals were buried where they d never be found  and finally  everyone become babies  and all humanity conspired to make two perfect people  Adam and Eve   This  more than any gore Vonnegut could have described  is what brings about a sense of shame and humility To me  the simple  almost humorous unpleasantness was genius  though it s not a book for everyone My only real problem was how little time it spent on the Dresden bombing itself Rating RSexual scenes  violence and gore  strong language  some squicky and depressing moments  Deslumbrante  solamente necesitar un punado de palabras  encontrando la frase correcta  cerrando el parrafo perfecto  y asi llevar toda una experiencia  y una vida  a un relato corto  Eso es lo primero que salio de mi boca  apenas termine la ultima pagina del libro  Con esta premisa  es posible experimentar los multiples relatos presentados  de transformar los lugares  los tiempos  los personajes hacia un fin mas alto  Nuestra percepcion del mundo  la instancia de un cambio de pagina  que nos torna de la risa descarada  a una culpabilidad inconsolable  la satira en su ambiente natural La ciencia ficcion siempre ha intentado ser el relato de los eventos presentes  pero en este caso  es el relato de la cruda realidad del pasado  donde los trafalmadorianos de cuatro dimensiones son el punto de apoyo  razon y logica  en un mundo que se ha decidido deshacerse de todo ello  Un relato donde la distincion entre heroes y villanos es irrelevante  donde solo encontramos personas presas de sus miedos y omisiones  mientras todo vive y muere  todo al mismo tiempo Infinitamente agradecido con Jeronimo y Liliana  por una historia sin igual y una tecnica literaria desconocida para mi  a lo cual debo simplemente anadir  ame este libro  Asi fue  In terms of war criticism via literature  I do not suppose a more well crafted novel could have been written  No matter how often I read this book  I still get the shivers  the smiles  and the hopeless faith in people  despite how much we seem to like blowing each other up I went to Dresden this summer  that s why I reread the book  And Vonnegut s sort of emotion enriched apathy  pathetic lamentations and snide witicism does as much justice to the city as can be done Is it sci fi  Can be considered as such  Though I think those considering it such are missing the point What I like most about this book  is that  unlike any other Vonnegut fiction  we see him here at his most honest  exposed  and vulnerable  To be a present witness of one of America s most greatest war crime atrocities  to survive it  must deflate one s desire to represent mankind totally  rather  for Vonnegut  we are shown how a man can still consider himself a member of mankind  despite how wildly he shakes his head at its misdeeds  Much more poignant  comical and sad than I remembered  I read it the first time in high school and really didn t get the deeper messages and points  and I remember being confused by the jumbled up narrative  I noticed Billy Pilgrim didn t really talk much about Dresden  I wonder whether we should take Billy Pilgrim s being unstuck in time at face value  There are really two  linear  narratives through the story  the Dresden and Trafalmadore bits  What do we make of this cohesiveness amid all the time traveling Everything was beautiful and nothing hurt Even if that isn t totally true  I would like to leave life feeling that way  As I grow older I like to think that the beautiful and significant moments of my life are stuck in time and I can physically revisit them over and over again  I found SH5 comforting  not depressing I don t believe that the proper response to life is  so it goes   and I think KV throws God out with the bathwater at times  but there s no doubt that Vonnegut was one of the most imaginative writers of the 20th century as well as a tremendous moral force  I cannot recommend SH5 highly enough  especially in light of the highly divisive public discourse in our country at the moment  Kurt Vonnegut is my favorite author    this book was really good  Vonnegut has this way of writing like you re watching the story like a movie    you ll find that with alot of his books you become really attatched to the story  I know I never want them to end    I d hope you enjoy them too  The beggining of the story is telling you a little bit about the life of the main character  Billy Pilgrim  He was an optometrist scholar when he was drafted into WW2  Shortly after being tossed into battle he is taken prisoner by the Germans  However  right before this happens he had his first experience on  shifting   For some reason Billy finds himself travelling through time   seeing parts of his life  The very first time he saw his whole life  beginning to end  I found this to be an interesting concept  i d hate to see my own death  Eventually he gets out of the war   continues to see these visions  In the middle of the story something crazy happens  But i dont wanna tell you   If you re interested  you ll have to find out for yourself  After that happens  he speaks nothing really of it  Eventually  he feels it is a good time to finally tell the world of his experience  He then makes a recording of his own death  which he predicts based upon the visions he has had  All in all it s a very interesting book  one thing that was annoying was that he kept bouncing back   forth in time because the  shifting  isnt exactly cronological  I hope you like it if you ever decide to read it  it really was good  Kurt Vonnegut s most famous novel is one of several American novels dealing in a more or less experimental way with the Second World War which came out in the sixties and early seventies   Joseph Heller s Catch 22 and Thomas Pynchon s Gravity s Rainbow are other notable examples   The impetus behind this was presumably   consciously or unconsciously   the Korean and Vietnam Wars  the three novels mentioned are all anti war  all have an anti heroic element  all detail horrific actions against the innocent carried out by soldiers scarcely less innocent  It may be that it was only the climate brought about by the news coverage of Vietnam   which also contained these elements   that they felt it was possible to express what they thought of war   The three books also share an autobiographical atmosphere  in among the exaggeration and tragic comedy  though this may be to do with the prose style  I don t know enough about the authors  own lives to say how much might have been based on their own war experiences   Even so  both Heller and Pynchon used a stream of consciousness influenced style  and Vonnegut placed his stories in a series of cliches from pulp science fiction  none of them are straightforward narratives After an introductory section  apparently about how the novel came to be written  the reader is plunged a deeper level into the narrative  The lengthy subtitle of the novel takes images from both of these levels  the Children s Crusade  aliens from Trafalmadore  to make the book seem almost inexplicable   the opposite of the normal function of a subtitle  The main narrative is the story of Billy Pilgrim  an optometrist from New England  But it does not tell us his life story  or even concentrate on the war or the bombing of Dresden The non linear temporal structure is simplified through the use of a science fiction cliche  Pilgrim has come loose from normal time  One minute he is experiencing becoming a prisoner of war in Germany in 1945  then he is at his daughter s wedding in the mid sixties  The identification between Vietnam and the unheroic side of World War II is increased by Pilgrim s son s involvement in the later war A second science fiction cliche  the abduction of Pilgrim by the Tralfamadorans  is used to allow Vonnegut to comment on the absurdity of human culture  combined with the time travel  this is not confined to the period chronologically after the abduction The centre of Slaughterhouse 5  though  is the horrific effects of the bombing of Dresden by the Allies  Pilgrim was a POW confined in a former slaughterhouse in the city  hence the novel s title  Because the POWs happened to be underground at the time of the raid  they were among the few survivors  The biggest raid of the war  the bombing of Dresden and the firestorm that followed caused destruction and loss of life on a scale at least comparable to Hiroshima and Nagasaki  Since it was entirely conventional bombs which were dropped  the survivors were spared the horrors of radiation poisoning  but it still amounts to one of the most serious military crimes of history  Dresden was not a target of any importance in the German war effort  Vonnegut s novel has come out of his reaction to this event  and it is a memorial which conveys at least some sense of the horror of what happened  That is why it is an important novel  Finally read this  classic    a great satirical piece  indeed  Vonnegut has a very specific writing style   stating the obvious in but in a way that is both comical and disarming  saying something really disturbing and sad  and then following it with the phrase  so it goes    The book  which details the life of Billy Pilgrim  a WWII veteran and apparently  time traveler  I like that Vonnegut expects a lot from his readers    we are expected to follow Billy as he moves back and forth through at least 5 scenes   from life in a mental hospital after the war  to the planet of Tralfamadore  to the fire bombing of Dresden  The book seems to essentially be about post traumatic distress disorder    or the horrors of war on the human psyche  Billy moves through space and time but the reader is left wondering if that s just in his imagination  I really liked Vonnegut s cleverness  plays on words and especially his creativity   this was accessible and thought provoking  Teton County Library Call No  F VONNEGUT My all time favorite book  if one can acknowledge that a book that changes your world view forever  to a darker vision  could be a  favorite   It blew me away  It s  one of a kind   so s Vonnegut   quirky and strangely moving for a book so permeated with irony and  black humor   Here s a capsule  Billy looked at the clock on the gas stove  He had an hour to kill before the saucer came  He went into the living room  swinging the bottle like a dinner bell  turned on the television  He came slightly unstuck in time  saw the late movie backwards  then forwards again  It was a movie about American bombers in the Second World War and the gallant men who flew them  Seen backwards by Billy  the story went like this  American planes  full of holes and wounded men and corpses took off backwards from an airfield in England  Over France  a few German fighter planes flew at them backwards  sucked bullets and shell fragments from some of the planes and crewmen  They did the same for wrecked American bombers on the ground  and those planes flew up backwards to join the formation The formation flew backwards over a German city that was in flames  The bombers opened their bomb bay doors  exerted a miraculous magnetism which shrunk the fires  gathered them into cylindrical steel containers  and lifted the containers into the bellies of the planes  The containers were stored neatly in racks  The Germans below had miraculous devices of their own  which were long steel tubes  They used them to suck more fragments from the crewmen and planes  But there were still a few wounded Americans  though  and some of the bombers were in bad repair  Over France  though  German fighters came up again  made everything and everybody as good as new When the bombers got back to their base  the steel cylinders were taken from the racks and shipped back to the United States of America  where factories were operating night and day  dismantling the cylinders  separating the dangerous contents into minerals  Touchingly  it was mainly women who did this work  The minerals were then shipped to specialists in remote areas  It was their business to put them into the ground  to hide them cleverly  so they would never hurt anybody ever again  Quintessential Vonnegut    let us hope those  minerals  are well hidden   if the accident will      Vonnegut  like fellow World War II vet turned writer Joseph Heller  showcases the absurdity of the  business of war   just like Catch 22  except while Heller s book at most bends the rules of reality to showcase the absurd  Vonnegut s book completely obliterates the rules Billy Pilgrim  a World War II veteran  though not Vonnegut himself  apparently  as becomes semi clear throughout the narrative   is one day abducted by an enlightened race of aliens called Tralfamadorians  These creatures teach Billy how to become  unstuck in time   meaning he can jump from one point in his life to another point at any time  So  we see glimpses of Billy s life  from his boring but at least peaceful life after the war to his brutal experience as a POW in Dresden  where he and his fellow POWs are forced to take shelter from the essentially absurd and ultimately pointless U S  bombing of the civilian German city in a slaughterhouse  slaughterhouse five  to be exact Vonnegut uses humor to get his points across  so there are many places in the novel where you will stop reading and enjoy a laugh  But once you finish reading  still chuckling over some of the novel s most clever punch lines  you put the book down  look up with a startled expression and say   Oh  Highly recommended  Slaughterhouse Five by Kurt Vonnegut is an anti war novel that tells the story of the Dresden fire bombing through the life of Billy Pilgrim  an optometrist that finds himself lost in Germany at the end of World War Two  eventually becoming a prisoner of war  At the same time as this  Billy Pilgrim is also getting abducted by aliens  in bed with his wife  on a radio show in New York speaking of his abduction and about another million places  all at once  Billy Pilgrim becomes unstuck in time and travels to different moments of his life throughout the book   I read Slaughterhouse five about four years ago  I didn t know what I was reading or who I was reading  I just needed something to read  In the end  I had no idea what the book was about and I was convinced that Vonnegut was a nut and was merely rambling and that all the critics that loved him where merely pretentious idiots  Perhaps the critics are pretentious idiots  but after revisiting Slaughterhouse five after familiarizing myself more with Vonnegut its safe to say Slaughterhouse five is not merely a random ramble of time travel and nonsense  It s actually  at times  wildy funny  it s intricate and philosophical  it s gruesome and in its own unique way it s great  Slaughterhouse Five has easily become one of my favorite books and I highly recommend it  I regard Vonnegut as a literary deity  Breakfast of Champions was the first book I ever read  Slaughterhouse Five was my second  It singlehandedly catalyzed my love of books  Vonnegut himself has always been my favorite   no competition  Orwell is a distant second  I mean  my Mount Rushmore of authors would only be one face  Vonnegut is one of a kind and although many others try  none can quite match his terse and satirical pen SH5 s Billy Pilgrim is a phenomenal character  He is also a representational Vonnegut character  shaded with a goofy naivete  but also with a contrasting higher knowledge untranslatable to normal situations  Interlocked within stories of alien abduction and time travel  is the firebombing of Dresden during WWII   something Vonnegut was around to witness  He wanted to tell the story  but it was a devastating event  unprecedented in that new adjectives had to be invented  so he took a roundabout way of doing it  a non linear way of getting there  so that he ended there  but only kind of  As he tells us via the Tralfamadorians  all moments forever float around  never starting or stopping  so Dresden was firebombed at one time  but wasn t  It sounds confusing  but it s not  He ll explain it to you in the book   I read a few of Vonnegut s other novels before I finally got to Slaughterhouse Five  This one is written in a series of scenes and situations from various points in time  There is no beginning  no end  no suspense  no moral  no cause  no effect  There isn t any particular relationship between the scenes either  except that Vonnegut had strung them together in an attempt to produce an image of life that he hopes is   beautiful and surprising and deep   I later found out that the novel is written from the perspective of Edward Crone  an American soldier who was captured  along with Vonnegut  and sent to Dresden as a prisoner of war   In the novel  Vonnegut  speaking as the author  tells the reader that the main character was someone he actually knew in the war  He sees himself a few times through the main character s eyes  and tells the reader that that s him   the author of the book   Apparently the real life Crone went crazy in Dresden and died from neglect at the hands of his captors  Vonnegut later said that Crone should never have been in the war in the first place  and that   he  Crone  didn t understand what was going on  Of course  there was nothing to understand  He was right  It was utter nonsense  In Slaughterhouse Five  Vonnegut recounts the total destruction of Dresden by an Allied air raid  which was more devastating than the nuclear strike on Hiroshima  and killed tens of thousands of German civilians and war refugees  There were no militarily significant targets in Dresden   But don t get Vonnegut wrong  this is neither a pro  nor an anti war book  A book denouncing war would be written for presidents  generals  politicians and those in power  This book is written for ordinary people  War is just something that happens to those living in the wrong place  They deal with it  Vonnegut dealt with it by writing this book   Among the dead bodies of German children and the rubble of collapsed buildings  a German officer  who by now surely understands that the war is lost  takes the time to stage an impromptu execution of a single  American prisoner who had been seen pulling a teapot out of the rubble   Stealing from the German people was punishable by death   This book is about the absurdity of war  and life in general  It s easily the best novel I ve read to date  I was excited to read Slaughterhouse again in the wake of  And So It Goes   a recent biography on Vonnegut  because I felt it would give me a new perspective on the work that put this  science fiction writer  on an even plane with the rest of the literary world  While I can t say the biography changed the way I thought about the book  it did provide a great deal of information about the psychological effects of the bombing of Dresden on Vonnegut and his epic struggle to find the words to accurately report his story  Ultimately  Vonnegut achieves this goal and conveys the point that there really isn t anything intelligent to say about a massacre  The thing that makes Vonnegut s work pure genius  however  is that he creates something beautiful out of the ashes  The one piece of advice I can give to potential readers is that this book is deceptively long  If you really want to take something away from it  you will spend more time pausing at each break to ponder the implications than you will actually reading the text itself  That being said  there are few works I would rank of this quality   Billy Pilgrim is not your average protagonist  but then again Slaughterhouse Five is not remotely your average novel  I loved this book  and i have some points of interest regarding the narrative at the bottom of this page but these of course will spoil the novel if you haven t yet read it  Which i recommend you do  obviously This is one of the best books i ve read in a long time  though it is essentially an anti war story  it is in no way limited by this  and Vonnegut weaves through the narrative with such wit  satire and intelligence  that the reader is left in rapture  I could not stop reading  the amount of times i nearly missed my station was ridiculous  I suppose the book covers themes like free will  or lack of  human nature  in all its glory    and patriotism  or misguided It begins quite strangely as an unknown author  although we kind of assume that it is Vonnegut himself  introduces the reasons for writing Slaughterhouse Five  Vonnegut does interject his own autobiographical voice in there at points too  so get ready for it  ahem It is a beautifully crafted narrative that follows the story of Billy Pilgrim  a Chaplins assistant during the second world war  When i say  followed   i mean as best as it can  You see Billy has become unstuck in time  he slips forwards and backwards in time to points in his life with ease  From Billy s stagnant life as an optomitrist in 1960 s america  to his time as an American POW in Dresden up to and including the firebombing  to his abduction by the Tralfamadorians  who take him to their home planet where he is put on display in a zoo  On Tralfamadore they teach Billy the real meaning of time  that every moment in time simply exsists  and cannot be changed  but everymoment can be re visited again and again  When Billy asks how the Tralfamadorians achieved world piece  they reply that they havent  that they have had wars greater than any human war  but they simply choose to re live peaceful points in time  and forget the bad parts Billy is subjected to the misplaced aggressive patriotism of his fellow POW s  and is ridiculed by them for his nonchalant attitude  and lack of will to live  This is because Billy has seen everypoint in his life  he has re lived his death many times and as the Tralfamadores taught him is completely happy with how his life went  as he is constantly slips about time during this bad part  Interesting points of  well interest  Martin Amis got the idea for his novel Time s Arrow from the T V scene from Slaughterhouse Five  in which Billy is watching a documentary on the firebombing of Dresden but for him  it is happening in reverse  planes sucking bombs inside their hulls  taking them to factories where they are dismantled into minerals  the minerals are sent to contractors in distant countries to hide cleverly in the ground etc    Amis s narrative is told completely in reverse Well  thats basically a pretty big insight into what to expect from this book  After reading it  you may want to think more about the overall ideas in this book  i e whats real  whats not  why etc  So read on if you have read it        SPOILERS Basically it would seem fairly obvious that Billy Pilgrim was affected mentally by the horrors he saw in Dresden  these terribly things are alluded to in the book  the Barber shop quartet  how he threw up again and again at the  corpse mines  etc  We can probably safely assume that he began loosing his marbles before his time with the  three musketeers  by the description of his hallucinations he begins having  Adam and Eve in the gold boots  St  Elmo s fire on the heads of those around him  This is also the point in which he becomes unstuck in time  we would have to assume that Billy thinks he had always been unstuck in time  from some point in the future  hence he looks back and see s himself slipping to and fro The Tralfamadores would also seem to be a constrution of his mind  as Vonnegut leaves clues throughout the novel as to where he picked up bit and pieces of information  For instance  Most of the plot of his  abduction  seem to be taken from Kilgore Trouts  science fiction novels  which Billy becomes obsessed with in his post war mental institution  Montana Wildhack  whom Billy is mated with in the zoo  happens to be the same girl he saw in an adult bookstore Probably the most poignant givaway for me was the time Billy had sex with a woman at an optomistrists party  this was pointed out as the only time Billy cheated on his wife  This would mean his happy love affair with Montana would seem to be fictional Well thanks for reading  please leave any comments you may have to make about this great book  and what i have  less greatly  said about it  Being unstuck in time  I had heard this thought long before reading this novel  UW Oshkosh  Intro to Philosophy class  where the thought experiment was cast that we are waking up each day complete with a corresponding memory set  I had always thought how cool is that  The arbitrary nature of how life plays out reduced to a series of one act  one day plays where the main character is ourselves and where we are both observer and participant  Who am I today  Slaughterhouse Five takes a national trauma for a weakened German society near the end of World War II and demonstrates the author s first hand experience in a manner that shows a degree of detachment  Because how does one describe a bombing of a city and the loss of 100 000 lives in one night  The horrors  the horrors  Or  maybe the absurdity of continuing to live on afterwards is what Vonnegut is really describing  This is a re read for me  I have always enjoyed the elliptical nature of the Vonnegut novels  Each is marked by what I would call mini homilies  Social commentary  And they re in the middle  He doesn t necessarily save the best for last  And such is life  Our insights sneak up on us on    just another Wednesday evening on the drive home from work  Or the day we stared at our hand while in the kitchen and marveled at the wonder of the five fingered capability and how each human has this wonderful mechanism   free of charge  no shipping and handling  Moments of wonder  My favorite scene that I remember best is where the protagonist  the War survivor Billy Pilgrim watched a World War II movie backwards  Instead of bombing and destruction  the aircraft in this movie have a marvelous capability of   Healing  Houses are instantly transformed from ashed skeletons to solid frameworks  Piles of bodies become classrooms of children looking hopefully at a teacher  The bombs are neatly sucked back into the bomb bays and the doors closed  Eventually even the bombs themselves are disassembled by highly trained technicians  And the contents of the bombs  Why they are removed  taken by scientists in laboratories to desensitize them and then safely bury the chemicals back in the ground before they can harm anyone again  Eventually  all adults are babies and eventually all humans become Adam and Eve  the final  peaceful destiny  Wow  Life in reverse has so much greater sensibility than Man plunging forward  hungry for power  control and a new world order The other memorable perspective of Billy Pilgrim being unstuck in time is the recognition of predestination  but this time as explained by the Tralfamadorian alien culture in the novel  A person who is dead is not tragic  The dead are just in bad state right now  But the reality of now is no more valid than the reality of 10 years ago  when the same dead were walking together hand in hand through a park  Senseless violence  like every other human action  was always going to be  There is no benefit to fighting against human nature any more than fighting against a windy day or cursing a bird who poops on the window of your car  This is what happens One catch of a phrase where Vonnegut describes a billboard streaming news headlines  This may as well be of a news blog  news website or the experience one gets from watching any broadcast news   the news of the day was being written in a ribbon of lights on a building to Billy s back  The window reflected the news  It was about power and sports and anger and death  So it goes   As a reader  this book provides many such sigh worthy moments  Silly human race  Does this book point towards a better way of living  as much as it acknowledges that you won t find your truths in our society  Look somewhere else  Vonnegut seems to say  Let s go on and live in the moment  because the wider view is almost too harsh to deal with So  this is a highly recommended book  Of course it is thought provoking and disturbing  but also has a sense of warmth towards the quiet minority   anyone who looks out at the world with a sense of detachment  a sense that it s gone wrong in so many ways that you re not sure where to start   It is a war novel and one that even Vonnegut feels chagrin over  In a 1976 introduction  he says   The Dresden atrocity  tremendously expensive and meticulously planned  was so meaningless  finally  that only one person on the entire planet got any benefit from it  I am that person  I wrote this book  which earned a lot of money for me and made my reputation  such as it is  One way or another  I got two or three dollars for every person killed  Some business I m in   The book Slaughterhouse Five  by Kurt Vonnegut is a science fiction novel about Vonnegut s own experience in a Dresden Prisoner of War camp during the bombing  The book takes place in Dresden and the surrounding war zone during World War Two  Strangely  about as much time is spent in Dresden as in a myriad of other places and times including the nineteen fifties and sixties in suburban America  and a fictional planet called Trafalmadore  The story is told in the third person point of view  and the main character is Billy Pilgrim Billy Pilgrim is a soldier who is captured on the front lines during the midst of the Battle of the Bulge  He is also a captive on Trafalmadore and an optometrist who is somewhat senile  One of the oddities surrounding Billy Pilgrim is that he comes unstuck in time  He will walk through one door in his home in America and arrive in Dresden in 1945  Also Billy Pilgrim leads a strange and abnormal life  He survives the war when many stronger  braver and more able men are killed  He appears to be slightly autistic  and he is kidnapped by aliens  the Trafalmadorians The book is supposedly about Vonnegut s experience in the Dresden bombings  but turns out to be more of a science fiction novel than a war story  It does talk at length about World War Two and Prisoner of War camps  Vonnegut is actually a minor character in the story  Mainly though  the book focuses on Billy Pilgrim  who moves haphazardly through time and space  Pilgrim shows us the Dresden bombings through emotionless eyes  and at times  Pilgrim knows less about what is happening than the reader  He often gives us an unclear picture of the events  told in an incorrect order  Slaughterhouse Five is a sad commentary on American s  It portrays us as weak ignoble fools I enjoyed the book immensely  It was well written  although esoteric  and both enlightened and witty  At times while reading it  I would laugh out loud  At other times there would be gut wrenching  foul descriptions that gave insight into human nature  I enjoyed the mental challenge of following the book  It moves around between different times and places  sometimes every other paragraph  I also enjoyed the comedy of the book  although it was funny in a tragic way  The comedy came from others  misfortunes  Slaughterhouse Five was an excellent book  After reading about Tralfaglamore again in Sirens of Titan  I decided to read the first couple of chapters of Slaughterhouse to remember it a bit  and a few hours later I was done with the whole thing  those train rides to DC are good for something   I remember enjoying this book in high school  the themes and prose were enough to keep my attention  but the non linear plot and playing with time did not sit well with me  Of course  I read it in 11th grade when my teacher   Mrs  Johnson   was making a vendetta on reading  Instead of discussing the themes of the book and how his view on time supports his message  Mrs  Johnson went backward and focused soley on literary techniques without any regard for the book  Teaching for the test  ugh  I ve since reread 3  classic  modern literary books from junior year of high school and each time I am amazed how much this horrible teacher killed reading and understanding in her stupid attempt to prepare us to write one stupid essay on a stupid regents that was easy anyway  Stupid  Back to Vonnegut  This time around I didn t mind the time disparities  or the time traveling  or any of the messages about time at all  In fact  I found a fascinating method to talk about the fatalistic viewpoint developed from experiencing something so tragic and frightening  things happen  there is no why   And make no mistake  despite all the weird tangents the book makes   many funny  some sad   the bombing of Dresden is at the heart of the book the whole time  The book has many funny moments  a few other poignant ones  but is so well written with intensity that I couldn t put it down until I finished it  and I didn t want to   Random book I turned to for escape   a story both hilarious and horrifying  Interesting timing and peculiar that the timeline is staggered  as the character ponders the nature of time as seen by an ET race  as all moments happening always  You are always born  always dead and everyting between  Dark   funny    it feels like the author s way of coping with the horrors of WWII  most specifically the firebombing of Dresden  And by coping  finding humor  Philosophical and moral implications without judgement  An inquiry into the nature of time  space  in fact what is possible  while sitting quietly with the absurdity of random events  the empty resignation of the unloved life of an equally lucky   misfortunate good natured fool  Quick easy read  creative language  simple   irreverent  as enjoyable as it is gut wrenching   and most convincing in an argument against warfare  And I can see someone over here influenced Tom Robbins   impressively free and honest in its wording and ideas  considering the year it was published  Bravo  I finally got to Vonnegut and glad I did  Loved  Clear and simple  I can t point out particularly why I enjoyed this book so much  but I will try  Being almost perplexed at the main plot and writing style in a book is not often  a good thing  BUT that really didn t factor with Slaughterhouse Five  I was too busy memorising at Vonnegut s absurd  yet brilliant  humour  I felt overwhelming pity for Billy  and still  I laughed   such is the beauty of the gallows humour Vonnegut creates  Having a laughable  in a good way  character didn t distract from the deeper  and meaner  underlying issues touched upon  I m sure I didn t even register them all  but a few hit home  In fact the strong cynicism just added weight to the horrible facts  A lot of horrible things happen  and they just seem to pass by so easily  just like Billy  Or  maybe I m taking this all too seriously  and just about war time travel  and aliens  Who knows  it doesn t matter   I enjoyed it all  anyway  My words here don t do my feelings about this book justice  simply because I can t explain them  And that s good  that s great in fact   I m just happy I read it  even if I can t explain quite  why I enjoyed the ride  This was my first Vonnegut I ve read as an adult  and it was my first time reading Slaughterhouse Five  I found it remarkable that Vonnegut wrote what is distinctly science fiction  yet made it completely accessible and respectable as literature  I wish more sci fi authors could do this  because there is a lot of potential to the genre  but most of it is  frankly  not especially well written  It is a genre of fascinating ideas that are too often framed around mediocre writing and plotlines  Hunter s Run  for example   Vonnegut transcends the genre  however  He writes with purpose and beauty  and the structure of the novel is brilliant  Having Billy Pilgrim s experience of life jump back and forth chronologically allows us to be more sympathetic to him and care about him despite how pathetic he is for the most part  It also gives the reader  and writer  a break from the horror of war  and gives a great view of the sci fi concept of being unstuck in time  Also  I loved the tone and use of irony   So it goes   repeated at each mention of death  from the thousands killed in the fire bombing of Dresden to the discovery that champagne is flat  or dead  equalizes death and becomes a strange sort of prayer  the literary equivalent of crossing oneself  It was  at different times  delightful and funny or sobering  I can easily see why this book is held in such high regard by so many  and wholeheartedly recommend it   Do you think war is bad  If you do you will definitely be able to relate to the marvelous tale  In this artfully crafted tale by Kurt Vonnegut he expresses his dislike for war because he experienced the wars worst first hand  The story follows Billy Pilgrim as he travels thought time and Nazi Germany  And he witnesses the infamous fire bombing of Dresden  Vonnegut s artfully crafted characters shine a light on our perspective of World War 2  Vonnegut s real life experiences transition into this literary work of art very nicely and add very realistic characters and setting that flow with his plot line  The story begins with Billy Pilgrim and three other soldiers behind enemy lines when two of the other soldiers get shot Billy and his friend must go on without them but end up getting captured and get put into a P O W camp  prisoner of war  hen his friend dies on to the way to the camp he becomes alone  After a wile at the camp the get moved off to Dresden  which has not seen the war  Wile in Dresden Billy and the other P O W s work in a factory  Later wile leaving Dresden Billy witnesses one of the most infamous bombings of WWII  If you like action packed page turners and don t mind adult sbooks this is a must read   Slaughterhouse Five  my first time reading Vonnegut  was a revelation  I went into this novel with the comprehension that it had strong Anti War themes  What I wasn t ready for was the structure of the narrative  At first I was distracted by the constant shifts in time throughout each Chapter  when I got my grasp on it though  it opened up on another level  This novel is a good example of how symbolism and themes can play the biggest part of a story  they are unconcealed and repeated throughout  This lack of subtlety doesn t impede the Novel however  it amplifies it  I was left with the lasting impression that Billy Pilgrim  as a whole  was a lesson  for the reader  in Humanity  Throughout the Story he is passive and accepting of everyone and every event  Like Society as a whole  we tend to accept the horrendous things going on around us and move on with our lives with not so much as an after thought  The warning comes through Billy s inability to succumb fully to the notions of the Tralfamadorians concepts of time  While he is aware that every moment is repeated in an endless loop  making death seem insignificant  he still finds himself weeping uncontrollably after the War  While being passive and accepting are healthy constructs for society  if we don t look back  Lot s wife looking back on Sodom and Gomorrah and acknowledge  we can t learn from our mistakes  We lose what makes us human  Compassion  I half wish I hadn t read that  It played havoc with my adult mind in ways that it would never have with my teenage mind  Now I know that s not a very Tralfamadorian thing to say  at least not in the context of this book   but then I m not two feet high  green  or shaped like a plumber s friend   I m not actually sure what one of those is but I ve never been friends with a plumber nor have I ever noticed a plumber carrying around a me shaped object in a friendly manner so I feel safe enough assuming   and neither had I been forced to contemplate the horror of the RAF s total destruction of Dresden in 1945  Both the mortality and the morality are addressed without really commenting and one or two little scenes in the carnage amongst the usual absurdist comedy  and the unusual imaginary time travel and encounters with equally imaginary and similarly temporally emancipated aliens  are all it took to allow the reader to practically share Billy Pilgrim s journey  Ah  the name gives it away right   towards his grief when it suddenly hits home in a strangely unexpected way  Thinking about it though  it seems odd that I say that given the structure and scope of the plot  but I did and that s final No  really  It is  Review When I have just started it  Really Funny  Peculiar sense of humor can t feel like it s written over world war 2  seems no war book just like catch 22 Review When I have finished it So it goes     Very nicely written  Humor is nicely combined with Extraterrestrial  war and philosophy of Billy Worth the reputation it has in literature  He has so nicely woven the situation explained it in such a humorous way  Billy was such a great guy  I really wish to meet such a guy once  Even war can be such funny  The book is in my list most humorous book ever read along with Catch 22 and Three men in a boat Some of it s lineAbout  Free Will I have visited 31 inhabited planet and have studied report on one hundred only on earth is there talk of free willThis one I liked most God grant me the serenity to accept the things i cannot change  courage to change the things i can   and wisdom always to tell the difference Among the things Billy could not change were the past present and future  Because everything is there like rocky mountain always there Billy all dressed up He put on little overcoat too  It splits up the back  and at the shoulders  the sleeves came entirely free  So the coat become a fur collared vest  It was meant to flare at it s owner waist  but the flaring took place at Billy s armpits  The Germans found him to one of the most screamingly funny thing the had seen in the all world war 2  They laughed and laughed So it goes  I bought this book back in December at the suggestion of a friend in inner city Northeastern USA  I put it with the rest of my books and decided to read it later   like I always do  I finally sat down to read it about a month ago as a book to read for English class  The first chapter confused me a lot  but once I got passed that  it all started to make a bit more sense  I should probably read that first chapter again  maybe even the whole book  so that I may fully understand the novel  as it is leaving me quite solemn as it is I didn t realize I had finished it  Right before starting this review  I went over to my bookshelf to finish it  but I found that I had  I find this quite    odd  I ve never read a book and end up not remembering finishing it  This is not a mark against it  if anything  it is a plus  The book does not make any attempt at being outright dramatic  which is actually said near the end by the narrator  whom is first person  but it reads as third person for most of the text   I find this lovely and a breath of fresh air  Contemporary literature is all about action of some sort  They just can t describe the situation with solemnity  To be honest  I had never heard of Tralfamadorians or the bombing of Dresden before I read this book  which I am quite ashamed of   especially the latter  Vonnegut really does a fantastic job with the surrealism of Billy Pilgrim s alien visits and time traveling capabilities  weaving them to make the story all the more real  seems quite paradoxical  eh   and tragic  There s a symmetry that is supposed to be drawn between the two  the bombing of Dresden and Pilgrim s alien and time traveling adventures  They are both supposed to be seen as events that could never really happen to someone  events that nobody would believe in their right mind  Some may lose this  Some may think   Is Vonnegut trying to make a mockery out of the bombing  or maybe try to detract from just hwo real it is   or maybe not even get that there is a connection at all  which would be even worse   I must admit  I laughed quite heartedly over the course of this book  I just good not help it  When it is said the Billy Pilgrim has an  enormous wang  and that s how it goes  I was hysterical for a few minutes  The straight to the point  so it goes  that accompanies every tragedy is enough to make one laugh everytime and  if they  think about it long enough  cry  That s what makes this book so great  It is only upon careful consideration that one truly feels teh enormity of this  You read and all the events seem so distant  and he makes them so humourous  that you kind of forget that people are dying  People are living  People are being hanged  People are trying to make a living for their families by being a Nazi  In the first chapter  it is said mentioned that there is no evil character in this book and  strictly speaking  there isn t  However  if I may make a correction  there is an evil character  the one of man to man  This may not take an incarnate form in the book  but it s presence is felt and told from this book  This book is so good that I ve had to add a shelf of awesome to highlight how good it is  You should buy  read or borrow this tomorrow and then take the rest of the day off work  If you have tickets to the Avengers  give them away and READ THIS BOOK  Right  into the review  I stumbled on Kurt Vonnegut when I was poor  books were not available on the Kindle and I had to buy Penguin Classics  I read Cat s Cradle and connected with the absurdity of the situation  its beautiful satire and the ease of reading  It was a novel that caught you on line one and never let you go  Not until the wonderful end  Slaughterhouse Five is even better  It starts with the author speaking to us about his experiences before and after World War II  his promises to editors during that period and his general disdain for war in general  Then he tells us the beginning and the end of the novel  It has to be the oddest introduction in the world and the most lyrical  Kurt Vonnegut can go from deep thoughts in one line to a dirty limerick in the next and it does not feel forced  He puts every other satirical author to shame  The story is about Billie  a survivor of the Dresden Firebombings  and he s not all there because he s in time  somewhere  Not now  not then  not in the past but all three at once  That s about as much as I can tell you because the rest is where the fun starts  Who he meets  what he does and why he s in that predicament is fantasy  I think  But by the end of the book  I m honestly not sure  Kurt Vonnegut s writing is consumer friendly  He writes for you and not to show off his skills  It appears  to me at least  that his books are designed to be read  not analysed  He wants you to have a painless experience and that comes across on every page  Once I started Slaughterhouse Five  I did not stop until I had finished It was also headache free  I didn t have to put the book down  I didn t look at the time  I just read  It was an incredible sensation and one I haven t had for a while  A few words of warning  If you like war or glorify it in any way then this book is not for you  It s satire and it s about the stupidity of humans trying to kill each other for no real reason  For everyone else  it s a must read   I finished reading this book on Sept 11 2011  the 10 year anniversary of when a group of 19 religious fanatics killed over 3 000 of their fellow human beings  So it goes  It is also the anniversary of the Chilean coup that resulted in the deaths of about 60 people  So it goes  After that many thousands more were arrested and murdered in that country for years to come  So it goes The more recent Sept 11th in the US then inspired NATO to start a war that has killed many thousands every year  So it goes  That war is on going  So it goes  The fear from 9 11 then allowed the Bush administration to push America to invade Iraq  which has caused over a million deaths  So it goes 9 11 is hardly a unique day or event in human history  Vonnegut s observations on the human condition are no less relevant today than they were when he first wrote them  I suppose he is right  it is better to focus on the more pleasant moments in life  since there is little chance that we can change our darker nature  Finding a renowned author for the first time like this is what makes reading such a pleasure for me  This was a treatise on the male condition in the order of Hemingway  on the modern condition in the order of Thompson  and on the human condition in the order of Hesse  Finding tropes woven throughout was incredible  and I found myself literally stopping reading to consider the magnitude of the insights in every chapter  But the intersection of philosophy and science fiction is the book s true legacy as a master work  Vonnegut s ideas hint at the despair of the anathema of our modern condition where spirituality is separated from intellectual pursuit  He subtly hints at an answer throughout  and as a result the book maintains a cohesive Tralfamadorian philosophy  So it goes  Had I read this book at another time in my life  I might have seen this as a call to stoicism or nihilism  But all I can hear is the Daoist underpinnings and the echoes of modern cosmology  I can t say enough about a book that unites kindred philosophies separated by thousands of years in a time of human crisis Finding Vonnegut and Slaughterhouse Five when I did seemed serendipitous  but more in the spirit of the book  and probably more accurately in reality   I found it exactly when I needed to  This book is full of marvelous phrases  You could quote it forever  But the thing that stands out most of this quite short book  is the voice of the narrator  Vonnegut shrewdly stands aside from the main narrative  even though ostensibly this is based on his experience of being a POW and the bombing of Dresden  But he just appears at the beginning and the end  kind of framing the narrative in which he uses an absurd character as his protagonist  only implying here and there that he  too  was standing next to him and living much of the same experiences The amazing thing is how he manages to make such an anti war manifesto from a narrative that is so humane and touching  without feeling sorry for himself or pontifying  He uses the absurd to remark on the absurdity of it all  and focuses on both awful and beautiful moments to make it all the more poignant Another high point is his use of flashbacks and flashforwards as an actual plot point  making his character go back and forth in time  illuminating different aspects of his story so as not to focus solely on  the bad parts  It s a solid  solid little book  one which leaves you thinking and feeling different while establishing a voice that makes it a very personal affair  This was the first Vonnegut I read  It was also part of another first  My AP English teacher  hardcore gal that Mrs Feasley was  had us do one  book brief  each month all senior year  A book brief was a hand written book report usually ranging between 10 15 pages that we were expected to write during the school day  Before school  after school  during lunch  during any study halls  during her class and  though not officially sanctioned  any other class that wasn t important enough to skip  You would have to go over plot summary  significance of the title  symbols  literary techniques  character analysis of 3 5 main characters  and all kinds of other whatnot  And Slaughterhouse Five was the first book I read for one of those jobies  And thank GOURD  If it had been like  James Joyce or something Russian I never would have survived  This book was so great  like a super cool new boyfriend and you just can shut up about it  I had never read any meritorious literature  SORRY NATHANIEL HAWTHORN  like this and I just loved it  And I got to just write about it for hours and pages and pens worth  KV basically was my super cool new literary boyfriend  Years later  my real life non literary boyfriend  who is now my non literary husband  read the copy I had read for the book brief and he was like   What did you do  Highlight every single  and so it goes    and I was like   Well    yes  I wanted an exact figure   True story  Also  is about misery  Not just of war  but of being a white American male in the 50s  So it s a pretty great intro to KV  And also there are aliens  And sex  With a movie star  You ll love it  Time travel  There s that too  AND PICTURES  Everybody wins  This book was disturbing in a different way than I m used to  Reading it felt like being slapped every so often It made war look unpleasant not by focusing on emotional events and drama within the war  but to show it in very sad and pathetic light  Very little of the book consisted of the war scenes  anyway  A man has a perverted picture  Someone has scrawny  hairy ankles  Someone can t hold their pee  The main character is nothing short of pitiable  The alien scenes added a whole new layer of oddness There was one scene I liked in particular  Billy saw the war in reverse  and only positive things were said about it   The planes flew backwards  sucking up the bullets and fires  the soldiers went home  women spent hours in factories taking apart the weapons  the minerals were buried where they d never be found  and finally  everyone become babies  and all humanity conspired to make two perfect people  Adam and Eve   This  more than any gore Vonnegut could have described  is what brings about a sense of shame and humility To me  the simple  almost humorous unpleasantness was genius  though it s not a book for everyone My only real problem was how little time it spent on the Dresden bombing itself Rating RSexual scenes  violence and gore  strong language  some squicky and depressing moments  Deslumbrante  solamente necesitar un punado de palabras  encontrando la frase correcta  cerrando el parrafo perfecto  y asi llevar toda una experiencia  y una vida  a un relato corto  Eso es lo primero que salio de mi boca  apenas termine la ultima pagina del libro  Con esta premisa  es posible experimentar los multiples relatos presentados  de transformar los lugares  los tiempos  los personajes hacia un fin mas alto  Nuestra percepcion del mundo  la instancia de un cambio de pagina  que nos torna de la risa descarada  a una culpabilidad inconsolable  la satira en su ambiente natural La ciencia ficcion siempre ha intentado ser el relato de los eventos presentes  pero en este caso  es el relato de la cruda realidad del pasado  donde los trafalmadorianos de cuatro dimensiones son el punto de apoyo  razon y logica  en un mundo que se ha decidido deshacerse de todo ello  Un relato donde la distincion entre heroes y villanos es irrelevante  donde solo encontramos personas presas de sus miedos y omisiones  mientras todo vive y muere  todo al mismo tiempo Infinitamente agradecido con Jeronimo y Liliana  por una historia sin igual y una tecnica literaria desconocida para mi  a lo cual debo simplemente anadir  ame este libro  Asi fue  In terms of war criticism via literature  I do not suppose a more well crafted novel could have been written  No matter how often I read this book  I still get the shivers  the smiles  and the hopeless faith in people  despite how much we seem to like blowing each other up I went to Dresden this summer  that s why I reread the book  And Vonnegut s sort of emotion enriched apathy  pathetic lamentations and snide witicism does as much justice to the city as can be done Is it sci fi  Can be considered as such  Though I think those considering it such are missing the point What I like most about this book  is that  unlike any other Vonnegut fiction  we see him here at his most honest  exposed  and vulnerable  To be a present witness of one of America s most greatest war crime atrocities  to survive it  must deflate one s desire to represent mankind totally  rather  for Vonnegut  we are shown how a man can still consider himself a member of mankind  despite how wildly he shakes his head at its misdeeds  Much more poignant  comical and sad than I remembered  I read it the first time in high school and really didn t get the deeper messages and points  and I remember being confused by the jumbled up narrative  I noticed Billy Pilgrim didn t really talk much about Dresden  I wonder whether we should take Billy Pilgrim s being unstuck in time at face value  There are really two  linear  narratives through the story  the Dresden and Trafalmadore bits  What do we make of this cohesiveness amid all the time traveling Everything was beautiful and nothing hurt Even if that isn t totally true  I would like to leave life feeling that way  As I grow older I like to think that the beautiful and significant moments of my life are stuck in time and I can physically revisit them over and over again  I found SH5 comforting  not depressing I don t believe that the proper response to life is  so it goes   and I think KV throws God out with the bathwater at times  but there s no doubt that Vonnegut was one of the most imaginative writers of the 20th century as well as a tremendous moral force  I cannot recommend SH5 highly enough  especially in light of the highly divisive public discourse in our country at the moment  Kurt Vonnegut is my favorite author    this book was really good  Vonnegut has this way of writing like you re watching the story like a movie    you ll find that with alot of his books you become really attatched to the story  I know I never want them to end    I d hope you enjoy them too  The beggining of the story is telling you a little bit about the life of the main character  Billy Pilgrim  He was an optometrist scholar when he was drafted into WW2  Shortly after being tossed into battle he is taken prisoner by the Germans  However  right before this happens he had his first experience on  shifting   For some reason Billy finds himself travelling through time   seeing parts of his life  The very first time he saw his whole life  beginning to end  I found this to be an interesting concept  i d hate to see my own death  Eventually he gets out of the war   continues to see these visions  In the middle of the story something crazy happens  But i dont wanna tell you   If you re interested  you ll have to find out for yourself  After that happens  he speaks nothing really of it  Eventually  he feels it is a good time to finally tell the world of his experience  He then makes a recording of his own death  which he predicts based upon the visions he has had  All in all it s a very interesting book  one thing that was annoying was that he kept bouncing back   forth in time because the  shifting  isnt exactly cronological  I hope you like it if you ever decide to read it  it really was good  Kurt Vonnegut s most famous novel is one of several American novels dealing in a more or less experimental way with the Second World War which came out in the sixties and early seventies   Joseph Heller s Catch 22 and Thomas Pynchon s Gravity s Rainbow are other notable examples   The impetus behind this was presumably   consciously or unconsciously   the Korean and Vietnam Wars  the three novels mentioned are all anti war  all have an anti heroic element  all detail horrific actions against the innocent carried out by soldiers scarcely less innocent  It may be that it was only the climate brought about by the news coverage of Vietnam   which also contained these elements   that they felt it was possible to express what they thought of war   The three books also share an autobiographical atmosphere  in among the exaggeration and tragic comedy  though this may be to do with the prose style  I don t know enough about the authors  own lives to say how much might have been based on their own war experiences   Even so  both Heller and Pynchon used a stream of consciousness influenced style  and Vonnegut placed his stories in a series of cliches from pulp science fiction  none of them are straightforward narratives After an introductory section  apparently about how the novel came to be written  the reader is plunged a deeper level into the narrative  The lengthy subtitle of the novel takes images from both of these levels  the Children s Crusade  aliens from Trafalmadore  to make the book seem almost inexplicable   the opposite of the normal function of a subtitle  The main narrative is the story of Billy Pilgrim  an optometrist from New England  But it does not tell us his life story  or even concentrate on the war or the bombing of Dresden The non linear temporal structure is simplified through the use of a science fiction cliche  Pilgrim has come loose from normal time  One minute he is experiencing becoming a prisoner of war in Germany in 1945  then he is at his daughter s wedding in the mid sixties  The identification between Vietnam and the unheroic side of World War II is increased by Pilgrim s son s involvement in the later war A second science fiction cliche  the abduction of Pilgrim by the Tralfamadorans  is used to allow Vonnegut to comment on the absurdity of human culture  combined with the time travel  this is not confined to the period chronologically after the abduction The centre of Slaughterhouse 5  though  is the horrific effects of the bombing of Dresden by the Allies  Pilgrim was a POW confined in a former slaughterhouse in the city  hence the novel s title  Because the POWs happened to be underground at the time of the raid  they were among the few survivors  The biggest raid of the war  the bombing of Dresden and the firestorm that followed caused destruction and loss of life on a scale at least comparable to Hiroshima and Nagasaki  Since it was entirely conventional bombs which were dropped  the survivors were spared the horrors of radiation poisoning  but it still amounts to one of the most serious military crimes of history  Dresden was not a target of any importance in the German war effort  Vonnegut s novel has come out of his reaction to this event  and it is a memorial which conveys at least some sense of the horror of what happened  That is why it is an important novel  Finally read this  classic    a great satirical piece  indeed  Vonnegut has a very specific writing style   stating the obvious in but in a way that is both comical and disarming  saying something really disturbing and sad  and then following it with the phrase  so it goes    The book  which details the life of Billy Pilgrim  a WWII veteran and apparently  time traveler  I like that Vonnegut expects a lot from his readers    we are expected to follow Billy as he moves back and forth through at least 5 scenes   from life in a mental hospital after the war  to the planet of Tralfamadore  to the fire bombing of Dresden  The book seems to essentially be about post traumatic distress disorder    or the horrors of war on the human psyche  Billy moves through space and time but the reader is left wondering if that s just in his imagination  I really liked Vonnegut s cleverness  plays on words and especially his creativity   this was accessible and thought provoking  Teton County Library Call No  F VONNEGUT My all time favorite book  if one can acknowledge that a book that changes your world view forever  to a darker vision  could be a  favorite   It blew me away  It s  one of a kind   so s Vonnegut   quirky and strangely moving for a book so permeated with irony and  black humor   Here s a capsule  Billy looked at the clock on the gas stove  He had an hour to kill before the saucer came  He went into the living room  swinging the bottle like a dinner bell  turned on the television  He came slightly unstuck in time  saw the late movie backwards  then forwards again  It was a movie about American bombers in the Second World War and the gallant men who flew them  Seen backwards by Billy  the story went like this  American planes  full of holes and wounded men and corpses took off backwards from an airfield in England  Over France  a few German fighter planes flew at them backwards  sucked bullets and shell fragments from some of the planes and crewmen  They did the same for wrecked American bombers on the ground  and those planes flew up backwards to join the formation The formation flew backwards over a German city that was in flames  The bombers opened their bomb bay doors  exerted a miraculous magnetism which shrunk the fires  gathered them into cylindrical steel containers  and lifted the containers into the bellies of the planes  The containers were stored neatly in racks  The Germans below had miraculous devices of their own  which were long steel tubes  They used them to suck more fragments from the crewmen and planes  But there were still a few wounded Americans  though  and some of the bombers were in bad repair  Over France  though  German fighters came up again  made everything and everybody as good as new When the bombers got back to their base  the steel cylinders were taken from the racks and shipped back to the United States of America  where factories were operating night and day  dismantling the cylinders  separating the dangerous contents into minerals  Touchingly  it was mainly women who did this work  The minerals were then shipped to specialists in remote areas  It was their business to put them into the ground  to hide them cleverly  so they would never hurt anybody ever again  Quintessential Vonnegut    let us hope those  minerals  are well hidden   if the accident will      Vonnegut  like fellow World War II vet turned writer Joseph Heller  showcases the absurdity of the  business of war   just like Catch 22  except while Heller s book at most bends the rules of reality to showcase the absurd  Vonnegut s book completely obliterates the rules Billy Pilgrim  a World War II veteran  though not Vonnegut himself  apparently  as becomes semi clear throughout the narrative   is one day abducted by an enlightened race of aliens called Tralfamadorians  These creatures teach Billy how to become  unstuck in time   meaning he can jump from one point in his life to another point at any time  So  we see glimpses of Billy s life  from his boring but at least peaceful life after the war to his brutal experience as a POW in Dresden  where he and his fellow POWs are forced to take shelter from the essentially absurd and ultimately pointless U S  bombing of the civilian German city in a slaughterhouse  slaughterhouse five  to be exact Vonnegut uses humor to get his points across  so there are many places in the novel where you will stop reading and enjoy a laugh  But once you finish reading  still chuckling over some of the novel s most clever punch lines  you put the book down  look up with a startled expression and say   Oh  Highly recommended  Slaughterhouse Five by Kurt Vonnegut is an anti war novel that tells the story of the Dresden fire bombing through the life of Billy Pilgrim  an optometrist that finds himself lost in Germany at the end of World War Two  eventually becoming a prisoner of war  At the same time as this  Billy Pilgrim is also getting abducted by aliens  in bed with his wife  on a radio show in New York speaking of his abduction and about another million places  all at once  Billy Pilgrim becomes unstuck in time and travels to different moments of his life throughout the book   I read Slaughterhouse five about four years ago  I didn t know what I was reading or who I was reading  I just needed something to read  In the end  I had no idea what the book was about and I was convinced that Vonnegut was a nut and was merely rambling and that all the critics that loved him where merely pretentious idiots  Perhaps the critics are pretentious idiots  but after revisiting Slaughterhouse five after familiarizing myself more with Vonnegut its safe to say Slaughterhouse five is not merely a random ramble of time travel and nonsense  It s actually  at times  wildy funny  it s intricate and philosophical  it s gruesome and in its own unique way it s great  Slaughterhouse Five has easily become one of my favorite books and I highly recommend it  I regard Vonnegut as a literary deity  Breakfast of Champions was the first book I ever read  Slaughterhouse Five was my second  It singlehandedly catalyzed my love of books  Vonnegut himself has always been my favorite   no competition  Orwell is a distant second  I mean  my Mount Rushmore of authors would only be one face  Vonnegut is one of a kind and although many others try  none can quite match his terse and satirical pen SH5 s Billy Pilgrim is a phenomenal character  He is also a representational Vonnegut character  shaded with a goofy naivete  but also with a contrasting higher knowledge untranslatable to normal situations  Interlocked within stories of alien abduction and time travel  is the firebombing of Dresden during WWII   something Vonnegut was around to witness  He wanted to tell the story  but it was a devastating event  unprecedented in that new adjectives had to be invented  so he took a roundabout way of doing it  a non linear way of getting there  so that he ended there  but only kind of  As he tells us via the Tralfamadorians  all moments forever float around  never starting or stopping  so Dresden was firebombed at one time  but wasn t  It sounds confusing  but it s not  He ll explain it to you in the book   I read a few of Vonnegut s other novels before I finally got to Slaughterhouse Five  This one is written in a series of scenes and situations from various points in time  There is no beginning  no end  no suspense  no moral  no cause  no effect  There isn t any particular relationship between the scenes either  except that Vonnegut had strung them together in an attempt to produce an image of life that he hopes is   beautiful and surprising and deep   I later found out that the novel is written from the perspective of Edward Crone  an American soldier who was captured  along with Vonnegut  and sent to Dresden as a prisoner of war   In the novel  Vonnegut  speaking as the author  tells the reader that the main character was someone he actually knew in the war  He sees himself a few times through the main character s eyes  and tells the reader that that s him   the author of the book   Apparently the real life Crone went crazy in Dresden and died from neglect at the hands of his captors  Vonnegut later said that Crone should never have been in the war in the first place  and that   he  Crone  didn t understand what was going on  Of course  there was nothing to understand  He was right  It was utter nonsense  In Slaughterhouse Five  Vonnegut recounts the total destruction of Dresden by an Allied air raid  which was more devastating than the nuclear strike on Hiroshima  and killed tens of thousands of German civilians and war refugees  There were no militarily significant targets in Dresden   But don t get Vonnegut wrong  this is neither a pro  nor an anti war book  A book denouncing war would be written for presidents  generals  politicians and those in power  This book is written for ordinary people  War is just something that happens to those living in the wrong place  They deal with it  Vonnegut dealt with it by writing this book   Among the dead bodies of German children and the rubble of collapsed buildings  a German officer  who by now surely understands that the war is lost  takes the time to stage an impromptu execution of a single  American prisoner who had been seen pulling a teapot out of the rubble   Stealing from the German people was punishable by death   This book is about the absurdity of war  and life in general  It s easily the best novel I ve read to date  I was excited to read Slaughterhouse again in the wake of  And So It Goes   a recent biography on Vonnegut  because I felt it would give me a new perspective on the work that put this  science fiction writer  on an even plane with the rest of the literary world  While I can t say the biography changed the way I thought about the book  it did provide a great deal of information about the psychological effects of the bombing of Dresden on Vonnegut and his epic struggle to find the words to accurately report his story  Ultimately  Vonnegut achieves this goal and conveys the point that there really isn t anything intelligent to say about a massacre  The thing that makes Vonnegut s work pure genius  however  is that he creates something beautiful out of the ashes  The one piece of advice I can give to potential readers is that this book is deceptively long  If you really want to take something away from it  you will spend more time pausing at each break to ponder the implications than you will actually reading the text itself  That being said  there are few works I would rank of this quality   Billy Pilgrim is not your average protagonist  but then again Slaughterhouse Five is not remotely your average novel  I loved this book  and i have some points of interest regarding the narrative at the bottom of this page but these of course will spoil the novel if you haven t yet read it  Which i recommend you do  obviously This is one of the best books i ve read in a long time  though it is essentially an anti war story  it is in no way limited by this  and Vonnegut weaves through the narrative with such wit  satire and intelligence  that the reader is left in rapture  I could not stop reading  the amount of times i nearly missed my station was ridiculous  I suppose the book covers themes like free will  or lack of  human nature  in all its glory    and patriotism  or misguided It begins quite strangely as an unknown author  although we kind of assume that it is Vonnegut himself  introduces the reasons for writing Slaughterhouse Five  Vonnegut does interject his own autobiographical voice in there at points too  so get ready for it  ahem It is a beautifully crafted narrative that follows the story of Billy Pilgrim  a Chaplins assistant during the second world war  When i say  followed   i mean as best as it can  You see Billy has become unstuck in time  he slips forwards and backwards in time to points in his life with ease  From Billy s stagnant life as an optomitrist in 1960 s america  to his time as an American POW in Dresden up to and including the firebombing  to his abduction by the Tralfamadorians  who take him to their home planet where he is put on display in a zoo  On Tralfamadore they teach Billy the real meaning of time  that every moment in time simply exsists  and cannot be changed  but everymoment can be re visited again and again  When Billy asks how the Tralfamadorians achieved world piece  they reply that they havent  that they have had wars greater than any human war  but they simply choose to re live peaceful points in time  and forget the bad parts Billy is subjected to the misplaced aggressive patriotism of his fellow POW s  and is ridiculed by them for his nonchalant attitude  and lack of will to live  This is because Billy has seen everypoint in his life  he has re lived his death many times and as the Tralfamadores taught him is completely happy with how his life went  as he is constantly slips about time during this bad part  Interesting points of  well interest  Martin Amis got the idea for his novel Time s Arrow from the T V scene from Slaughterhouse Five  in which Billy is watching a documentary on the firebombing of Dresden but for him  it is happening in reverse  planes sucking bombs inside their hulls  taking them to factories where they are dismantled into minerals  the minerals are sent to contractors in distant countries to hide cleverly in the ground etc    Amis s narrative is told completely in reverse Well  thats basically a pretty big insight into what to expect from this book  After reading it  you may want to think more about the overall ideas in this book  i e whats real  whats not  why etc  So read on if you have read it        SPOILERS Basically it would seem fairly obvious that Billy Pilgrim was affected mentally by the horrors he saw in Dresden  these terribly things are alluded to in the book  the Barber shop quartet  how he threw up again and again at the  corpse mines  etc  We can probably safely assume that he began loosing his marbles before his time with the  three musketeers  by the description of his hallucinations he begins having  Adam and Eve in the gold boots  St  Elmo s fire on the heads of those around him  This is also the point in which he becomes unstuck in time  we would have to assume that Billy thinks he had always been unstuck in time  from some point in the future  hence he looks back and see s himself slipping to and fro The Tralfamadores would also seem to be a constrution of his mind  as Vonnegut leaves clues throughout the novel as to where he picked up bit and pieces of information  For instance  Most of the plot of his  abduction  seem to be taken from Kilgore Trouts  science fiction novels  which Billy becomes obsessed with in his post war mental institution  Montana Wildhack  whom Billy is mated with in the zoo  happens to be the same girl he saw in an adult bookstore Probably the most poignant givaway for me was the time Billy had sex with a woman at an optomistrists party  this was pointed out as the only time Billy cheated on his wife  This would mean his happy love affair with Montana would seem to be fictional Well thanks for reading  please leave any comments you may have to make about this great book  and what i have  less greatly  said about it  Being unstuck in time  I had heard this thought long before reading this novel  UW Oshkosh  Intro to Philosophy class  where the thought experiment was cast that we are waking up each day complete with a corresponding memory set  I had always thought how cool is that  The arbitrary nature of how life plays out reduced to a series of one act  one day plays where the main character is ourselves and where we are both observer and participant  Who am I today  Slaughterhouse Five takes a national trauma for a weakened German society near the end of World War II and demonstrates the author s first hand experience in a manner that shows a degree of detachment  Because how does one describe a bombing of a city and the loss of 100 000 lives in one night  The horrors  the horrors  Or  maybe the absurdity of continuing to live on afterwards is what Vonnegut is really describing  This is a re read for me  I have always enjoyed the elliptical nature of the Vonnegut novels  Each is marked by what I would call mini homilies  Social commentary  And they re in the middle  He doesn t necessarily save the best for last  And such is life  Our insights sneak up on us on    just another Wednesday evening on the drive home from work  Or the day we stared at our hand while in the kitchen and marveled at the wonder of the five fingered capability and how each human has this wonderful mechanism   free of charge  no shipping and handling  Moments of wonder  My favorite scene that I remember best is where the protagonist  the War survivor Billy Pilgrim watched a World War II movie backwards  Instead of bombing and destruction  the aircraft in this movie have a marvelous capability of   Healing  Houses are instantly transformed from ashed skeletons to solid frameworks  Piles of bodies become classrooms of children looking hopefully at a teacher  The bombs are neatly sucked back into the bomb bays and the doors closed  Eventually even the bombs themselves are disassembled by highly trained technicians  And the contents of the bombs  Why they are removed  taken by scientists in laboratories to desensitize them and then safely bury the chemicals back in the ground before they can harm anyone again  Eventually  all adults are babies and eventually all humans become Adam and Eve  the final  peaceful destiny  Wow  Life in reverse has so much greater sensibility than Man plunging forward  hungry for power  control and a new world order The other memorable perspective of Billy Pilgrim being unstuck in time is the recognition of predestination  but this time as explained by the Tralfamadorian alien culture in the novel  A person who is dead is not tragic  The dead are just in bad state right now  But the reality of now is no more valid than the reality of 10 years ago  when the same dead were walking together hand in hand through a park  Senseless violence  like every other human action  was always going to be  There is no benefit to fighting against human nature any more than fighting against a windy day or cursing a bird who poops on the window of your car  This is what happens One catch of a phrase where Vonnegut describes a billboard streaming news headlines  This may as well be of a news blog  news website or the experience one gets from watching any broadcast news   the news of the day was being written in a ribbon of lights on a building to Billy s back  The window reflected the news  It was about power and sports and anger and death  So it goes   As a reader  this book provides many such sigh worthy moments  Silly human race  Does this book point towards a better way of living  as much as it acknowledges that you won t find your truths in our society  Look somewhere else  Vonnegut seems to say  Let s go on and live in the moment  because the wider view is almost too harsh to deal with So  this is a highly recommended book  Of course it is thought provoking and disturbing  but also has a sense of warmth towards the quiet minority   anyone who looks out at the world with a sense of detachment  a sense that it s gone wrong in so many ways that you re not sure where to start   It is a war novel and one that even Vonnegut feels chagrin over  In a 1976 introduction  he says   The Dresden atrocity  tremendously expensive and meticulously planned  was so meaningless  finally  that only one person on the entire planet got any benefit from it  I am that person  I wrote this book  which earned a lot of money for me and made my reputation  such as it is  One way or another  I got two or three dollars for every person killed  Some business I m in   The book Slaughterhouse Five  by Kurt Vonnegut is a science fiction novel about Vonnegut s own experience in a Dresden Prisoner of War camp during the bombing  The book takes place in Dresden and the surrounding war zone during World War Two  Strangely  about as much time is spent in Dresden as in a myriad of other places and times including the nineteen fifties and sixties in suburban America  and a fictional planet called Trafalmadore  The story is told in the third person point of view  and the main character is Billy Pilgrim Billy Pilgrim is a soldier who is captured on the front lines during the midst of the Battle of the Bulge  He is also a captive on Trafalmadore and an optometrist who is somewhat senile  One of the oddities surrounding Billy Pilgrim is that he comes unstuck in time  He will walk through one door in his home in America and arrive in Dresden in 1945  Also Billy Pilgrim leads a strange and abnormal life  He survives the war when many stronger  braver and more able men are killed  He appears to be slightly autistic  and he is kidnapped by aliens  the Trafalmadorians The book is supposedly about Vonnegut s experience in the Dresden bombings  but turns out to be more of a science fiction novel than a war story  It does talk at length about World War Two and Prisoner of War camps  Vonnegut is actually a minor character in the story  Mainly though  the book focuses on Billy Pilgrim  who moves haphazardly through time and space  Pilgrim shows us the Dresden bombings through emotionless eyes  and at times  Pilgrim knows less about what is happening than the reader  He often gives us an unclear picture of the events  told in an incorrect order  Slaughterhouse Five is a sad commentary on American s  It portrays us as weak ignoble fools I enjoyed the book immensely  It was well written  although esoteric  and both enlightened and witty  At times while reading it  I would laugh out loud  At other times there would be gut wrenching  foul descriptions that gave insight into human nature  I enjoyed the mental challenge of following the book  It moves around between different times and places  sometimes every other paragraph  I also enjoyed the comedy of the book  although it was funny in a tragic way  The comedy came from others  misfortunes  Slaughterhouse Five was an excellent book  After reading about Tralfaglamore again in Sirens of Titan  I decided to read the first couple of chapters of Slaughterhouse to remember it a bit  and a few hours later I was done with the whole thing  those train rides to DC are good for something   I remember enjoying this book in high school  the themes and prose were enough to keep my attention  but the non linear plot and playing with time did not sit well with me  Of course  I read it in 11th grade when my teacher   Mrs  Johnson   was making a vendetta on reading  Instead of discussing the themes of the book and how his view on time supports his message  Mrs  Johnson went backward and focused soley on literary techniques without any regard for the book  Teaching for the test  ugh  I ve since reread 3  classic  modern literary books from junior year of high school and each time I am amazed how much this horrible teacher killed reading and understanding in her stupid attempt to prepare us to write one stupid essay on a stupid regents that was easy anyway  Stupid  Back to Vonnegut  This time around I didn t mind the time disparities  or the time traveling  or any of the messages about time at all  In fact  I found a fascinating method to talk about the fatalistic viewpoint developed from experiencing something so tragic and frightening  things happen  there is no why   And make no mistake  despite all the weird tangents the book makes   many funny  some sad   the bombing of Dresden is at the heart of the book the whole time  The book has many funny moments  a few other poignant ones  but is so well written with intensity that I couldn t put it down until I finished it  and I didn t want to   Random book I turned to for escape   a story both hilarious and horrifying  Interesting timing and peculiar that the timeline is staggered  as the character ponders the nature of time as seen by an ET race  as all moments happening always  You are always born  always dead and everyting between  Dark   funny    it feels like the author s way of coping with the horrors of WWII  most specifically the firebombing of Dresden  And by coping  finding humor  Philosophical and moral implications without judgement  An inquiry into the nature of time  space  in fact what is possible  while sitting quietly with the absurdity of random events  the empty resignation of the unloved life of an equally lucky   misfortunate good natured fool  Quick easy read  creative language  simple   irreverent  as enjoyable as it is gut wrenching   and most convincing in an argument against warfare  And I can see someone over here influenced Tom Robbins   impressively free and honest in its wording and ideas  considering the year it was published  Bravo  I finally got to Vonnegut and glad I did  Loved  Clear and simple  I can t point out particularly why I enjoyed this book so much  but I will try  Being almost perplexed at the main plot and writing style in a book is not often  a good thing  BUT that really didn t factor with Slaughterhouse Five  I was too busy memorising at Vonnegut s absurd  yet brilliant  humour  I felt overwhelming pity for Billy  and still  I laughed   such is the beauty of the gallows humour Vonnegut creates  Having a laughable  in a good way  character didn t distract from the deeper  and meaner  underlying issues touched upon  I m sure I didn t even register them all  but a few hit home  In fact the strong cynicism just added weight to the horrible facts  A lot of horrible things happen  and they just seem to pass by so easily  just like Billy  Or  maybe I m taking this all too seriously  and just about war time travel  and aliens  Who knows  it doesn t matter   I enjoyed it all  anyway  My words here don t do my feelings about this book justice  simply because I can t explain them  And that s good  that s great in fact   I m just happy I read it  even if I can t explain quite  why I enjoyed the ride  This was my first Vonnegut I ve read as an adult  and it was my first time reading Slaughterhouse Five  I found it remarkable that Vonnegut wrote what is distinctly science fiction  yet made it completely accessible and respectable as literature  I wish more sci fi authors could do this  because there is a lot of potential to the genre  but most of it is  frankly  not especially well written  It is a genre of fascinating ideas that are too often framed around mediocre writing and plotlines  Hunter s Run  for example   Vonnegut transcends the genre  however  He writes with purpose and beauty  and the structure of the novel is brilliant  Having Billy Pilgrim s experience of life jump back and forth chronologically allows us to be more sympathetic to him and care about him despite how pathetic he is for the most part  It also gives the reader  and writer  a break from the horror of war  and gives a great view of the sci fi concept of being unstuck in time  Also  I loved the tone and use of irony   So it goes   repeated at each mention of death  from the thousands killed in the fire bombing of Dresden to the discovery that champagne is flat  or dead  equalizes death and becomes a strange sort of prayer  the literary equivalent of crossing oneself  It was  at different times  delightful and funny or sobering  I can easily see why this book is held in such high regard by so many  and wholeheartedly recommend it   Do you think war is bad  If you do you will definitely be able to relate to the marvelous tale  In this artfully crafted tale by Kurt Vonnegut he expresses his dislike for war because he experienced the wars worst first hand  The story follows Billy Pilgrim as he travels thought time and Nazi Germany  And he witnesses the infamous fire bombing of Dresden  Vonnegut s artfully crafted characters shine a light on our perspective of World War 2  Vonnegut s real life experiences transition into this literary work of art very nicely and add very realistic characters and setting that flow with his plot line  The story begins with Billy Pilgrim and three other soldiers behind enemy lines when two of the other soldiers get shot Billy and his friend must go on without them but end up getting captured and get put into a P O W camp  prisoner of war  hen his friend dies on to the way to the camp he becomes alone  After a wile at the camp the get moved off to Dresden  which has not seen the war  Wile in Dresden Billy and the other P O W s work in a factory  Later wile leaving Dresden Billy witnesses one of the most infamous bombings of WWII  If you like action packed page turners and don t mind adult sbooks this is a must read   Slaughterhouse Five  my first time reading Vonnegut  was a revelation  I went into this novel with the comprehension that it had strong Anti War themes  What I wasn t ready for was the structure of the narrative  At first I was distracted by the constant shifts in time throughout each Chapter  when I got my grasp on it though  it opened up on another level  This novel is a good example of how symbolism and themes can play the biggest part of a story  they are unconcealed and repeated throughout  This lack of subtlety doesn t impede the Novel however  it amplifies it  I was left with the lasting impression that Billy Pilgrim  as a whole  was a lesson  for the reader  in Humanity  Throughout the Story he is passive and accepting of everyone and every event  Like Society as a whole  we tend to accept the horrendous things going on around us and move on with our lives with not so much as an after thought  The warning comes through Billy s inability to succumb fully to the notions of the Tralfamadorians concepts of time  While he is aware that every moment is repeated in an endless loop  making death seem insignificant  he still finds himself weeping uncontrollably after the War  While being passive and accepting are healthy constructs for society  if we don t look back  Lot s wife looking back on Sodom and Gomorrah and acknowledge  we can t learn from our mistakes  We lose what makes us human  Compassion  I half wish I hadn t read that  It played havoc with my adult mind in ways that it would never have with my teenage mind  Now I know that s not a very Tralfamadorian thing to say  at least not in the context of this book   but then I m not two feet high  green  or shaped like a plumber s friend   I m not actually sure what one of those is but I ve never been friends with a plumber nor have I ever noticed a plumber carrying around a me shaped object in a friendly manner so I feel safe enough assuming   and neither had I been forced to contemplate the horror of the RAF s total destruction of Dresden in 1945  Both the mortality and the morality are addressed without really commenting and one or two little scenes in the carnage amongst the usual absurdist comedy  and the unusual imaginary time travel and encounters with equally imaginary and similarly temporally emancipated aliens  are all it took to allow the reader to practically share Billy Pilgrim s journey  Ah  the name gives it away right   towards his grief when it suddenly hits home in a strangely unexpected way  Thinking about it though  it seems odd that I say that given the structure and scope of the plot  but I did and that s final No  really  It is  Review When I have just started it  Really Funny  Peculiar sense of humor can t feel like it s written over world war 2  seems no war book just like catch 22 Review When I have finished it So it goes     Very nicely written  Humor is nicely combined with Extraterrestrial  war and philosophy of Billy Worth the reputation it has in literature  He has so nicely woven the situation explained it in such a humorous way  Billy was such a great guy  I really wish to meet such a guy once  Even war can be such funny  The book is in my list most humorous book ever read along with Catch 22 and Three men in a boat Some of it s lineAbout  Free Will I have visited 31 inhabited planet and have studied report on one hundred only on earth is there talk of free willThis one I liked most God grant me the serenity to accept the things i cannot change  courage to change the things i can   and wisdom always to tell the difference Among the things Billy could not change were the past present and future  Because everything is there like rocky mountain always there Billy all dressed up He put on little overcoat too  It splits up the back  and at the shoulders  the sleeves came entirely free  So the coat become a fur collared vest  It was meant to flare at it s owner waist  but the flaring took place at Billy s armpits  The Germans found him to one of the most screamingly funny thing the had seen in the all world war 2  They laughed and laughed So it goes  I bought this book back in December at the suggestion of a friend in inner city Northeastern USA  I put it with the rest of my books and decided to read it later   like I always do  I finally sat down to read it about a month ago as a book to read for English class  The first chapter confused me a lot  but once I got passed that  it all started to make a bit more sense  I should probably read that first chapter again  maybe even the whole book  so that I may fully understand the novel  as it is leaving me quite solemn as it is I didn t realize I had finished it  Right before starting this review  I went over to my bookshelf to finish it  but I found that I had  I find this quite    odd  I ve never read a book and end up not remembering finishing it  This is not a mark against it  if anything  it is a plus  The book does not make any attempt at being outright dramatic  which is actually said near the end by the narrator  whom is first person  but it reads as third person for most of the text   I find this lovely and a breath of fresh air  Contemporary literature is all about action of some sort  They just can t describe the situation with solemnity  To be honest  I had never heard of Tralfamadorians or the bombing of Dresden before I read this book  which I am quite ashamed of   especially the latter  Vonnegut really does a fantastic job with the surrealism of Billy Pilgrim s alien visits and time traveling capabilities  weaving them to make the story all the more real  seems quite paradoxical  eh   and tragic  There s a symmetry that is supposed to be drawn between the two  the bombing of Dresden and Pilgrim s alien and time traveling adventures  They are both supposed to be seen as events that could never really happen to someone  events that nobody would believe in their right mind  Some may lose this  Some may think   Is Vonnegut trying to make a mockery out of the bombing  or maybe try to detract from just hwo real it is   or maybe not even get that there is a connection at all  which would be even worse   I must admit  I laughed quite heartedly over the course of this book  I just good not help it  When it is said the Billy Pilgrim has an  enormous wang  and that s how it goes  I was hysterical for a few minutes  The straight to the point  so it goes  that accompanies every tragedy is enough to make one laugh everytime and  if they  think about it long enough  cry  That s what makes this book so great  It is only upon careful consideration that one truly feels teh enormity of this  You read and all the events seem so distant  and he makes them so humourous  that you kind of forget that people are dying  People are living  People are being hanged  People are trying to make a living for their families by being a Nazi  In the first chapter  it is said mentioned that there is no evil character in this book and  strictly speaking  there isn t  However  if I may make a correction  there is an evil character  the one of man to man  This may not take an incarnate form in the book  but it s presence is felt and told from this book  This book is so good that I ve had to add a shelf of awesome to highlight how good it is  You should buy  read or borrow this tomorrow and then take the rest of the day off work  If you have tickets to the Avengers  give them away and READ THIS BOOK  Right  into the review  I stumbled on Kurt Vonnegut when I was poor  books were not available on the Kindle and I had to buy Penguin Classics  I read Cat s Cradle and connected with the absurdity of the situation  its beautiful satire and the ease of reading  It was a novel that caught you on line one and never let you go  Not until the wonderful end  Slaughterhouse Five is even better  It starts with the author speaking to us about his experiences before and after World War II  his promises to editors during that period and his general disdain for war in general  Then he tells us the beginning and the end of the novel  It has to be the oddest introduction in the world and the most lyrical  Kurt Vonnegut can go from deep thoughts in one line to a dirty limerick in the next and it does not feel forced  He puts every other satirical author to shame  The story is about Billie  a survivor of the Dresden Firebombings  and he s not all there because he s in time  somewhere  Not now  not then  not in the past but all three at once  That s about as much as I can tell you because the rest is where the fun starts  Who he meets  what he does and why he s in that predicament is fantasy  I think  But by the end of the book  I m honestly not sure  Kurt Vonnegut s writing is consumer friendly  He writes for you and not to show off his skills  It appears  to me at least  that his books are designed to be read  not analysed  He wants you to have a painless experience and that comes across on every page  Once I started Slaughterhouse Five  I did not stop until I had finished It was also headache free  I didn t have to put the book down  I didn t look at the time  I just read  It was an incredible sensation and one I haven t had for a while  A few words of warning  If you like war or glorify it in any way then this book is not for you  It s satire and it s about the stupidity of humans trying to kill each other for no real reason  For everyone else  it s a must read   I finished reading this book on Sept 11 2011  the 10 year anniversary of when a group of 19 religious fanatics killed over 3 000 of their fellow human beings  So it goes  It is also the anniversary of the Chilean coup that resulted in the deaths of about 60 people  So it goes  After that many thousands more were arrested and murdered in that country for years to come  So it goes The more recent Sept 11th in the US then inspired NATO to start a war that has killed many thousands every year  So it goes  That war is on going  So it goes  The fear from 9 11 then allowed the Bush administration to push America to invade Iraq  which has caused over a million deaths  So it goes 9 11 is hardly a unique day or event in human history  Vonnegut s observations on the human condition are no less relevant today than they were when he first wrote them  I suppose he is right  it is better to focus on the more pleasant moments in life  since there is little chance that we can change our darker nature  Finding a renowned author for the first time like this is what makes reading such a pleasure for me  This was a treatise on the male condition in the order of Hemingway  on the modern condition in the order of Thompson  and on the human condition in the order of Hesse  Finding tropes woven throughout was incredible  and I found myself literally stopping reading to consider the magnitude of the insights in every chapter  But the intersection of philosophy and science fiction is the book s true legacy as a master work  Vonnegut s ideas hint at the despair of the anathema of our modern condition where spirituality is separated from intellectual pursuit  He subtly hints at an answer throughout  and as a result the book maintains a cohesive Tralfamadorian philosophy  So it goes  Had I read this book at another time in my life  I might have seen this as a call to stoicism or nihilism  But all I can hear is the Daoist underpinnings and the echoes of modern cosmology  I can t say enough about a book that unites kindred philosophies separated by thousands of years in a time of human crisis Finding Vonnegut and Slaughterhouse Five when I did seemed serendipitous  but more in the spirit of the book  and probably more accurately in reality   I found it exactly when I needed to  This book is full of marvelous phrases  You could quote it forever  But the thing that stands out most of this quite short book  is the voice of the narrator  Vonnegut shrewdly stands aside from the main narrative  even though ostensibly this is based on his experience of being a POW and the bombing of Dresden  But he just appears at the beginning and the end  kind of framing the narrative in which he uses an absurd character as his protagonist  only implying here and there that he  too  was standing next to him and living much of the same experiences The amazing thing is how he manages to make such an anti war manifesto from a narrative that is so humane and touching  without feeling sorry for himself or pontifying  He uses the absurd to remark on the absurdity of it all  and focuses on both awful and beautiful moments to make it all the more poignant Another high point is his use of flashbacks and flashforwards as an actual plot point  making his character go back and forth in time  illuminating different aspects of his story so as not to focus solely on  the bad parts  It s a solid  solid little book  one which leaves you thinking and feeling different while establishing a voice that makes it a very personal affair  Well  something about Vonnegut  picked up a copy in MSP airport finished it arriving in MSN seven days later   I really couldn t put it down  I had almost a dozen other books   journals to choose from on this trip   first read first edition  1969  while teaching 6h grade   living in nearby Sun Prairie  1971 72  I mention this because the book brings back the very room in which I read  not easy to explain this  we are all  it seems  Billy Pilgrim   unstuck in time   and then we die   so it goes   I ve read much other Vonnegut including his most recent work   this is his masterpiece  The full title perhaps tells it all  SLAUGHTER HOUSE FIVE OR THE CHILDREN S CRUSADE   A DUTY DANCE WITH DEATH   KURT VONNEGUT WHO AS AN AMERICAN INFANTRY SCOUT  HORS DE COMBAT   AS PRISONER OF WAS  WITNESSED THE FIRE BOMBING OF DRESDEN GERMANY   THE FLORENCE OF THE ELBE   A LONG TIME AGO  AND SURVIVED TO TELL THE TALE  THIS IS A NOVEL SOMEWHAT IN THE TELEGRAPHIC SCHIZOPHRENIC MANNER OF TALES OF THE PLANET TRALFAMADORE  WHERE FLYING SAUCERS COME FROM  PEACE   Slaughterhouse Five  refers to the shelter in Dresden that protected American POW Billy Pilgrim from the firestorm that incinerated the city on February 13 15  1945  the title being an ironic observation about the slaughter taking place on innocent civilians outside the slaughterhouse But that s not what this story is about  This story is about the life of Billy Pilgrim  an apathetic  though successful optometrist from Ilium  NY that becomes an American POW in final weeks of WWII  The story focuses on Billy s being  unstuck in time   meaning that he experiences life in random episodes that hop scotch between youth  old age  and adulthood  His unique bearing in time and space was unlocked when he was abducted by an alien race known as the Tralfamadorians  who pity the human race for being stuck in a 3 dimensional world  in the same way we would pity a cartoon person for being unable to experience anything outside his portrait frame   Other people  including his daughter Barbara  think him crazy for these ideas  but Billy doesn t mind  Fate ordains that she has  is  and will always think him crazy  regardless of his coordinates in time I love Vonnegut s wit  His stories are cynical and ironic  but they cut right to the quick  They are simple and concise  but rife with detail  He develops his characters through rapidly told side stories  For example  following the quip   You think money grows on trees   by Kilgore Trout  an obscure science fiction writer that Billy Pilgrim admired  Vonnegut observes   Trout  incidentally  had written a book about a money tree  It had  20 bills for leaves  Its flowers were government bonds  Its fruits were diamonds  It attracted human beings who killed each other around the roots and made very good fertilizer  So it goes   I also liked his metaphor of post bombing Dresden being the surface of the moon with corpse mines There are two recurring statements in Slaughterhouse Five that you should be aware of   So it goes  occurs on just about every page of this book  He also includes the serenity prayer If you liked Catch 22  Hitchikers Guide to the Universe  or Catcher in the Rye you will probably enjoy this book  So it goes  I read this one summer while I was in college  I ve now read several other Vonnegut novels  and I thought it was time to revisit it  I enjoyed it again A couple of things come to mind upon this re read  First  there are some connections between this book and The Sirens of Titan that I could not have caught the first time  The Tralfamadorans  the Rumfoord family  and our long time friend  Mr  Rosewater  and Kilgore Trout are all here  There s no direct connection in the two plots  but it s clear that if this is not happening in the same world  it s a very close parallel world The second thing that I was struck by was Billy Pilgrim s almost complete detachment from his own life  It s as if becoming  unstuck  in time has turned him into a witness even to his own life  He seems completely detached even from his own decisions  In a strange way  though  this makes him a great point of view character  His detachment from even his own life leaves us with a clear view of both his foibles  and those of others around him  His lack of judgment puts no filter there to distract us Anyway  this book is fun  and a quick read  If you re already a Vonnegut fan  you should go for it  One of America s most prolific 20th century authors  Kurt Vonnegut was also a WWII POW  He and about a hundred other American soldiers were being used as forced labor in a German meat processing plant when the city they were in was bombed by the allies  For some reason  the shelter they were in under the hog confinement was spared  They were the only people to survive the Bombing of Dresden in 1945  135 000 people were killed as a result of this air attack using conventional weapons  The atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima  Japan only killed 71 379 Slaughterhouse 5 was published in 1969 at the height of American involvement in Vietnam and is often considered a powerful antiwar book  along the likes of Josef Heller s  Catch 22  and Richard Hooker s  M A S H  Slaughterhouse 5 follows a character Vonnegut invented  who was one of the hundred Americans who survived Dresden along with him   Billy Pilgrim  is a Forrest Gump sort of character  Billy is an under trained  unarmed chaplain s assistant sent over during the Battle of the Bulge  caught behind German lines  first sent to a concentration camp in a prisoner train  then to the meat processing plant in Dresden  That would be enough to give anyone Post Traumatic Stress Disorder  PTSD   but twenty years later he is the only person to survive a plane crash on his way to an optometry convention  Billy sustains a major head injury in the crash  Somewhere between WWII and the sixties suburbs Billy believes he is abducted by aliens and  un stuck  from time As a result  the book follows Billy Pilgrim as he jumps from memory to memory in the war  the prison camp  and various other misadventures back home  You can imagine homeless Vietnam vets suffering from PTSD and having LSD flashbacks  but Billy is a clean cut  conventional  soft spoken  upstanding member of the Rotary club If you re a science fiction fan  you ll probably love this  If you re opposed to the war  you ll probably find plenty of reason to like it  If you re just interested in a classic and influential work of American literature  Vonnegut makes you care about Billy and the people around him to stick with the abrupt changes in settings and time  He also makes you relate to the other characters around Billy  even the Germans  even the alien abductors  so you can relate to everything that s going on even when it s either tragic or surreal  We ve all met people like Billy s wife  the soldier who saves his life  the English officers  and General  Wild  Bob TV Journalist Linda Elerbee has had a tag line that she uses at the end of her reports for at least the last thirty years  turns out she may have copied it from Vonnegut  I never know what it meant until I read this book  it s actually a pretty sad and somber sentiment   and so it goes  This is a fast  funny  easy read that really makes you think  It is black humor  but it is a lot lighter than say  Night  by Elie Wiesel  but it certainly makes you think and even if it doesn t turn you into a pacifist  it will probably make you at least a little more empathetic to people around you  I hope And if you re ever in Cody Wyoming  just ask for Wild Bob   In this novel Vonnegut explores the basis of human fear  This book is definately anti war    as Billy Pilgrim learned  Time does not change  all moments are trapped like bugs in amber  The way that Billy is so accepting of war and death is almost unnerving but he understands life more than anyone as he see s the Tralfamadorian way  This concept is hard to understand but if you have actually followed the story the concept of living moment to moment and seeing death as a doorway into Life that does not follow  beads on a string Although complex his prose is skilled  The strange order of events makes us adapt to this new style  Vonnegut is much like Kilgore Trout whose prose is  frighful  but contains good ideas Also the constant use of the phrase  so it goes     Is dark and comedic  It is almost the idea  Life goes on  and this reminds us of the main Tralfamadorian message  Time simply is  and there are things we cannot change but the idea that life and these people go on is beautifully conveyed through a simple  so it goes   Also the idea of the birds  Po tee weet    is almost another reminder of freedom and the idea of life going on  It is always posed as a question as though challanging the reader to see life in a new light  This book blew my mind and i am now a proclaimed and devote Vonnegut fan    he is astute and forward  his ideas are revolutionary and breath taking  I recommend him to all    But please realize that his prose is difficult and different to most books  Therefore do not insult his works as to be honest they are genius and simply wonderful   We all live forever  no matter how dead we may seem   For some inane reason I have been boycotting this book most of my life  Despite LOVING other Vonnegut texts  I got it stuck in my head when I was a teenager that this was an anti war treatise akin to The Red Badge of Courage  and  since I loathed The Red Badge of Courage  there was no way in hell that I would ever read it  Flash forward to 2009  Pop culture has succeeded where years of English classes from junior high to graduate school have failed  Slaughterhouse Five s appearance in the best TV show of all time  Lost  finally made hell freeze over and pigs fly  And  predictably  I now think I was a complete idiot for not picking this book up sooner  This is much more Catch 22 with a solid helping of Valis than The Red Badge of Courage  Yes  this is an anti war novel  but it is also so much more  Social satire  science fiction  another genre I have never been too crazy about   and autobiography  Vonnegut actually did survive the bombing of Dresden and has said that the only way he could ever write about this particular part of his life was in fragments   combined with a sprinkling of the theater of the absurd This is the story of Billy Pilgrim  a chaplain s assistant in World War II who is involved in what many call one of the most heinous events of WWII  the bombing of Dresden  Billy deals with the horrors he witnessed during his time at war through  telegraphic schizophrenic  shifts from one period of his life to another  He continually jumps forward and backward in time and these sort of time traveling experiences are the only way we glimpse Billy s life pre  and post war There was actually so much moving about in time that I became  unstuck  myself  unsure of when Billy actually was  This free floating  though  is not annoying or bothersome  it s actually quite satisfying because Vonnegut does to us what he and the Tralfamadorians do to Billy  cause us to view time in a non linear manner  Billy s confused journey is parallel to our confused understanding of his story One of the more amazing experiences we see during his time travels is Billy being captured by the Tralfamadorians  an alien race  and brought back to their planet to be exhibited in their zoo  Billy goes public about his experience and  predictably  is laughed at and thought crazy  Whether the Tralfamadorians exist only in Billy s head isn t really relevant to the story as a whole because it is Billy s journey and what he learns from them that is most important to me Billy actually learns a lot from the Tralfamadorians on the non linear nature of time  Regarding the nature of time  the Tralfamadorians use a particular metaphor to describe their view of time  They are capable of seeing all of any surrounding environment while a  poor Earthling  had  his head       encased in a steel sphere which he could never take off  There was only one eyehole through which he could look  and welded to that eyehole were six feet of pipe   146   Obviously this is an allusion to Plato s  Allegory of the Cave   but it s also an interesting take on the relationship between perception and evaluation  The advice given to Billy   ignore the awful times and concentrate on the good ones   150  and  stare only at pretty things as eternity failed to go by   249   is simply another version of Plato s cave as well  The only difference is that the ignorance in this latter case is purposeful  and to choose darkness instead of light seems far worse than being unable to see  There is an epitaph on a tombstone that seems to sum up the mindset of the Tralfamadorians   Everything was beautiful and nothing hurt   156   perhaps they don t have as much to teach us as Billy thinks they do Billy s journey illustrates another key theme  the idea that everything is  structured   Much like Shakespeare uses a play within the play to illustrate on a smaller scale the plot of Hamlet  this novel is a reflection on the individual s lack of power in the face of unseen forces  There are references to the story being  light opera   191   costuming  most notably when Billy clothes himself in silver boots and a blue toga  and the British soldiers staging a play  Cinderella  a play that itself explores the nature of performing  for the Americans in one of the prison camps  Even while on Tralfamadore  Billy is constantly on display in a zoo exhibit Billy is merely a puppet incapable even of simply living his life from beginning to end  This idea is solidified when Vonnegut writes   There are almost no characters in this story  and almost no dramatic confrontations  because most of the people in it are so sick and so much the listless playthings of enormous forces  One of the main effects of war  after all  is that people are discouraged from being characters   208 209   Indeed  Billy himself is rarely more than an observer of his own life because of the non linear structure of the book  The idea that his life is guided by destiny points up the fact that the debate on fate vs  free will actually serves as a major theme throughout the novel  Once he is able to travel to different times of his life  Billy seems accepting of fate  he even says  about the bombing of Dresden   everything is all right and everybody has to do exactly what he does   254   The argument here seems to be that life is easier to live if he accepts that what will happen has already happened  or  in LOST speak   whatever happened  happened   and that his destiny is not his to control  This is a pretty easy way to live because he then doesn t have to take any responsibility for his actions  which opens up a whole range of religious and philosophical ruminations On the opposite side of the fence is free will  an idea raised by Billy and laughed at by the Tralfamadorians  It would seem that the phrase repeated after every mention of death   So it goes   would be indicative of the concept of fatalism  but actually the most important function of this phrase is to reinforce the cyclical nature of both the narrative and life itself  which offers the possibility of renewal  which  in turn  is illustrative of free will  Billy is not a conventionally dynamic character in that we don t see him at the beginning of the novel as a solidified identity who undergoes changes throughout his life  rather  the non linear lens we view him through shows us all his different personalities and characterizations at different times  It s really a thing of beautiful artistry how Vonnegut achieves this  and I highly recommend this novel  Time in the world of Slaughterhouse Five is fluid  Which implies that man never dies  but instead takes the form of another moment  Or at least that s what the aliens seem to think  By assuming the voice of Tralfamadorians  Vonnegut describes how utterly senseless we are as human beings  how completely okay with things we should not be okay with   War for instance  We also hear about the unsuccessful science fiction author Kilgore Trout  who makes appearances in several Vonnegut books   who is probably  in some way  Vonnegut himself  He explains how religions have contributed towards our blood lust  and how when we see an American fighting with another American we think it s horrendous and ridiculous but don t see the irony in one  Earthling  fighting with another  The world  in essence is just another Slaughterhouse five  humans trapped inside and the rich and the powerful always taking their power for granted  the poor being poor and miserable  For someone who feels things  who sees things from a different perspective  one other than money and war  the world can be a nightmare they can never get a grasp of  Very easy read and beautifully crafted  One of the author s best works   Francis Bacon said   Some books are to be tasted  others to be swallowed  and some few to be chewed and digested   Yet he said nothing about books that can chew  swallow and digest the reader themselves   You know  at the university in Russia  at the age of 18  with so many things going on around  so many occupations except studies to take up  it s difficult to imagine a reason which can make you read literature  and especially if  to say the least  you are not an avid reader    On the one hand I always realize this shameful characteristic of mine  on the other each time reading a book can be compared with climbing a mounting of  no time    no mood  and many other stupid excuses This time it was totally different  I felt something  not me  climbing the mountain of my resistance  It was like a persecution  a chase  The book seemed to go after me  First its title was pronounced with aspiration by the main character of a movie  Beautiful creatures   Richard LaGravenese  USA  2013   Having recognized the author immediately I felt that this is something significant  something I should once make myself read  Then  in a week or two I was watching the  The Dyatlov Pass Incident   Renny Harlin  2013  Russia  USA   a rather strange movie with gripping plot and unpredictable ending  One of the characters quoted from the book   Everything is all right  and everybody has to do exactly what he does     The following day I was wondering somewhere far away from home and couldn t help meditating  recalling scenes from the film and that phrase    Finally I began thinking of the book each day  repeating his name and its title  feeling head creeps of synchronicity  Kurt Vonnegut  Slaughterhouse Five Nothing touches you as deeply as sincerity of a person who doesn t need anything from you personally and who can t physically ask you    There s no better way to let the reader trust you and rely upon you than to open all the cards before the game has started  And I accepted the invitation to Kurt s Vonnegut world immediately  We became friends  because the book won my soul having broken my resistance  Of course  I mean friendship between the reader and the author   not between me and Mr  Vonnegut personally  I delude myself sometimes  but not this time  So  as I gave my consent and it began chewing me The book gave me a priceless opportunity to look from another prospective at the questions my head was filled with for almost two years  It showed the back door to understanding the essence of time  mind  relations and being  Along with bright metaphoric descriptions of real events  the narration is full of unexpected retreats into the fantastic world with more real details  However  everything is done with a meticulous accuracy of an experienced master  So  I was completely swallowed The composition is unexpected   it breaks the common rules of chronotope building and doesn t allocate any of periods  showing the life as a series of flashes  which all have equal significance in the whole thing  It s like a movie of life  which was made up of cut and mixed frames  tied together by death  each time underlined by the phrase  And so it goes     It reminded me of the experiments Ken Kesey carried out with his friends in the sixties  So  time and space don t really matter  remember   Everything is all right  and everybody has to do exactly what he does    After I have finished the book I felt that I ve come through digesting rather easily  Or  better to say  I didn t notice it  The author seems to have not used any strong methods to influence feelings and thinking  There were some places where I expected a lesson  a sign of a core of the book  No  The narration is like a yogurt or a jelly with a taste of life of a crazy man  And everything would have been alright  just a book about stupidity and senselessness of war  if   You know  there is a method  mostly used in horror films  sometimes in thrillers  when someone is preparing for an event  which he is afraid of  Then he passes it and can t believe that everything was so easy and good and even feels disappointment  And then suddenly  when he turns around to go away  everything crashes behind his back and a real trouble comes  That s why I m writing this now    Just let the book flow through you and in some time you will realize that there are small splinters in that jelly  They are too sharp to notice them penetrating into you  but two poisonous to get rid of them and not to wake up  to reborn once in the real life  in the real world    Billy pilgrim is an American soldier who witnesses the destruction of Dresden as a prisoner of war in a building that used to be called slaughterhouse five  He used to be an optometrist back in the us where he was married to an  slightly overweight and overbearing  but very loving  heiress to an optometrist firm  They had two children and together the float through life as it goes along  The war has left Billy with terrible mental scars  the massacres and the people he saw killed never leaves his mind  However  Billy has another life on the planet tralfamadore another life with the sexy Montana Wildhack  together they have a child as the Trafalmadorians encourage them to have sex in front of them  Life is good there The planet is becoming increasingly real as time goes by and the effects of the war and the bombing of Dresden takes hold of his mind  As I was reading the book it all seemed totally plausible  why should there not be a parallel universe  After all it is only a matter or sorting out the details of time and space  And so it goes  I thought that a lot after I read it the first time  And so it goes  I still think about it a lot  A great book that might not leave you after you have allowed it in  It hasn t left me Start now  oh wow I finished this ages ago but haven t updated my profile in ages either yes  need you hear it from one more person  Slaughterhouse V is amazing  but Vonnegut is amazing too  I prefer his other masterpiece Cat s Cradle  simply because that one is so much more zany  but this one is near perfect as well  just coming at a different story  a different set of characters and rules his humor abounds  and you wonder if you re reading a book written by someone in the 21st century  not the mid 20th  Vonnegut was so far ahead of his time  but then  weren t many in the 50s  60s  and 70s  since what they were leaping out of culturally was the waste heap of parochial American puritanism and conservatism not that anyone really acted that way in real life  but all the popular books and movies of the early 20th reflected a certain naivete and whitewashing of human emotion so that by the 60s when Vonnegut hit his stride  with others  they must have seemed just like the rockets shooting us off to the moon  I came to this book and the author after reading  The Universe versus Alex Woods   which if you ve read it you will know  talks about Vonnegut s work A LOT  I d never read any Vonnegut before and wasn t sure what to expect   if it would be too surreal for me  which is what I d heard about it  I read Slaughterhouse Five in a single sitting  unable to put it down  even when my dinner was burning in the oven  It s a long  long time since I ve encountered a book which is so full of individualism  so full of soul  so full of laughter and so full of tragedy and pathos and yet so readable  Yes  there are odd moments   I couldn t work out whether the Tralfamadorians were manufactured by Billy Pilgrim or if it could be supposed by the reader that he really had time travelled to another planet  I suspect that readers who consider this a work of science fiction would argue that it underminds the work if a reader were to say that this book is merely a history and Billy s belief that he has time travelled to another planet to live in a zoo with a Hollywood actress  is just his way of his traumatic experiences during war time and after  including encountering Rosewater in the hospital for the mentally ill  of working themselves out  I ve got to say however  I did veer to the side of it being just such a history  delightful though the episodes on Tralfamador were   Particularly during Rosewater s and Billy s stint in the hospital when they are reading a lot of Kilgore Trout s dubious works    They had both found life meaningless  partly because of what they had seen in war  Rosewater  for instance  had shot a fourteen year old fireman  mistaking him for a German soldier  So it goes  And Billy had seen the greatest massacre in European history  which was the fire bombing of Dresden  So it goes  So they were trying to re invent themselves and their universe  Science fiction was a big help   It can be no accident  surely  that one of Trout s books deals exclusively with a couple who are taken by flying saucer to a strange planet and placed in a zoo  Still  the simple answer is  I don t know how to read it really and don t know enough about what I suspect is rather a large area of study to answer my own question  What I do know is that I LOVED my introduction to Vonnegut  I loved the effortless way it was written  I loved Billy as a character  In fact I loved all the characters  and non characters   Billy s Green Beret son for example   I loved the way the author couldn t resist interfering in his own work and adding little asides in here and there  Brilliant  Just Brilliant  Simply fantastic Literary purists will be horrified to find that I actually didn t know much about this book when I picked it up  other than the fact that it is a classic and apparently had something to do with time travel  I only knew this much because it kept coming up in recommendation threads or  what is your favourite book  threads on forums  I actually prefer to know less about a book when I dive into it  so that my opinions are coloured by the book alone  and not by what I am supposed to think about it  This is especially true of classics  particularly if they are the kind that is analyzed to shreds in English courses The first chapter of this book was somewhat odd  given that  There is no  thesis   so to speak  in that chapter  It is all unfocused and rambling and it left me wondering what the hell I had gotten myself into  Then chapter 2 came along and the story of Billy and his  time travel  started  and I don t think it took me much more than a few hours to finish it after that  I couldn t put it down There were several parts that I am absolutely certain I have read before  But at the same time I m pretty certain I have not read it before  and there were many parts I most certainly had not read  I suspect I got a truncated version or excerpt collection from it to read in a high school class at some point If you re skeptical about the time travel  or perhaps really looking forward to it    you should know it s not really about time travel at all  It s a collection of memories from the life of Billy Pilgrim  with a large featuring presence from World War II  It is far less about time travel than it is about Psychology  so  naturally  I enjoyed it very much  And it s certainly a unique approach to things  too  I m pretty sure I have more Vonnegut loaded up in my Kindle  I might dive straight into another one  It was awesome  My sister is reading it for summer assignment for the 8th grade  It has cursing  pg 13 sexual mentions and very black humor  While it may not be a book for young teens  who lets face it probably see worse at a Justin Bieber concert  it is a staple of American literature in my opinion  Vonnegut has his own voice  his own style  and doesn t supplement substance for sophistication  And because of that the sophistication comes naturally  I also liked how he interweaves what is probably one of the first non linear stories ever told and probably has a lot to do with current film makers of the same style  Awesome antiwar book talking about a war and a time where American pride and warfare were synonymous   Uncle Sam Wants you  doesn t mean much to Vonnegut s character  he s apathetic and unenthusistic about war  he time travels  gets abducted by Aliens  and cheats on his wife only once  Billy Pilgrim is a WWII vet  after al the real soldiers were dead the likes of Billy Pilgrim took their spot  Slaughterhouse Five sets out to protest war without glorifying it  and it succeeds in accomplishing that task  Vonnegut can find no answer for mankind s decisions to commit gross violence against its own kind  except in the meaningless song of a bird   Poo tee weet   He purposely does not develop his characters with any depth  a decision that works because it signifies the toll that war takes on the individual  The novel s hero  Billy Pilgrim  wanders through life with little concern or feeling for anything  It doesn t seem to bother him that he slips through time  to the past  the present  and the future  Then again  I wonder if it s possible to read the time travel element on a less literal level  As I was reading it  I couldn t help but wonder whether the alien species called the Tralfamadorians were a part of Billy s damaged postwar mind  a symptom of post traumatic stress disorder At some point of his life  Billy Pilgrim became  unstuck  from time  This means he can travel to any moment in his life at any time  Not that he does this willingly  He seems to travel from one moment to another at random  and he has no choice but to revisit that part of his life  In fact  all moments of his life exist at all times  which means he is both dead and not dead at all times  For narrative purposes  these moments aren t just puked up into one blob on a page  but there is a semi logic to the order that we see them  There is also a semi chronological order to them  For the most part  we learn about Billy s service in World War II chronologically  The rest of his life progresses in a less chronological manner  and we also know things that are going to happen  such as the death of Edgar Derby  long before they do happen  But that s the Tralfamadorian way What does happen to Billy Pilgrim is much less important than how Vonnegut presents what happens to him  Billy is a pathetic person who seems to react to the events in his life with a resigned hopelessness  Billy doesn t protest the unfairness of his life  and in some ways even seems blissfully unaware of how unfair his life is  as when he walks around as a prisoner of war in ridiculous clothing for his own warmth  to the amusement of spectators  I ve heard critiques of the novel as  quietist   suggesting that Vonnegut is trying to say people should resign themselves quietly to their fates as Billy does  However  I believe Vonnegut is commenting on reality rather than offering suggestions to help cope with life s atrocities  This is especially relevant today  when you read that veterans have dramatically higher suicide rates than the rest of the population  They ve simply lost the will to go on Vonnegut makes lots of use of irony  satire  and humor  and in surprising ways  The famous line from the novel  one he uses in relation to death   So it goes   seems to comment on society s desensitized attitudes towards death  The phrase calmly and easily tosses the impact of death aside  yet sometimes the reader can t help but feel its effects immensely  particularly in the way the phrase actually draws more attention to death  Vonnegut has a gift for drawing the reader s attention to the sadness of human fate by making us laugh  One of the funniest scenes of the book takes place at a POW camp  where English POWs welcome the exhausted Americans by putting on a play of Cinderella  At one point Billy laughs and can t stop laughing until his laughter turns into shrieks and he has to be carried into the hospital  I don t think I laughed harder in the novel than at this point  but I felt guilty for laughing  Billy s uncontrollable laughter was a product of the horrible things he experienced in the war up to that point I also whether we re not supposed to find irony in the idea that Billy has come  unstuck  from time  In fact  I believe Billy has become stuck in time  and in multiple senses  He seems to wander through his adult life  in the 1960s  trapped in two other places  Dresden and Tralfamadore  While other things happen to him or around him his mind travels back to his time in the POW camp  and when he returns  sometimes details return with him  The feet of dead prisoners are referred to as being  blue and ivory   and later when Billy wakes up next to his wife and gets up to use the bathroom  his feet are blue and ivory  At other times he seems so caught up in his thoughts about Tralfamadore that he has no concept for his surroundings  as when his adult daughter scolds him for sitting in a chilly room writing down his ideas about the aliens  His time on Tralfamadore seems to be pure fantasy  as he breeds with a beautiful movie star  Montana Wildhack  for the research purposes of the Tralfamadorians  Is Tralfamadore real  or a product of his damaged psyche There seem to be lots of hints scattered about that Tralfamadore is a product of Billy s imagination  After his first encounter with Montana Wildhack  for example  he wakes up in his home in Ilium to realize he s just had a wet dream about her  That his perhaps imaginary experience on Tralfamadore serves as a coping mechanism for his experiences in the war can be found in parallel descriptions about him undressing in Dresden and on the flying saucer  Kilgore Trout  Billy s favorite author  is probably the biggest piece of evidence to show that Billy has only imagined his encounter with the Tralfamadorians  For one  many of the ideas we learn from Trout s books are very similar to details we learn about the Tralfamadorians  such as the fact they can perceive sexes in the fourth dimension  But Trout is also a big clue about the reliability of the narrator We can assume the narrator is the author himself  since Vonnegut makes many mentions of himself in the first person  Some of what he says is factual  Dresden was bombed  and Vonnegut was there when it was bombed  However  Kilgore Trout is a fictional person  though he s not treated as such  This mixture of fact and fiction  both told as though they were one and the same  clues the reader in that we can t necessarily take the narrator at his word  Thus  though he describes Tralfamadore as though it were real  that doesn t mean it is  It could very easily be a product of Billy s post traumatic stress disorder  a coping mechanism  The idea that Billy can see all times of his life is never fully established either  We don t really know when the present time is  so it s difficult to gauge whether we truly do see into Billy s future  There is a scene where Billy describes how he dies  but this scene is tricky  It s not written as something that has or is happening  as the rest of the scenes are  and the narrator states it not as fact  but as something Billy has said  The question is  can we take Billy at his word  I don t think so Kurt Vonnegut has sympathy for the small guy  the sort of people who tend to be the victims of such things as war  That s why his story has no heroes in it  The only heroic thing anybody does is when Edgar Derby stands up and delivers a short diatribe against Nazism to a senior Nazi official  but the speech really doesn t mean much in the long run  Vonnegut s sympathy is strongest in his  or Trout s  criticism of the story of Jesus Christ  The problem is that when Christ was crucified  he was a somebody  the son of God  and so it was a huge mistake for the Romans to crucify a man who had such powerful connections  Vonnegut  or Trout  believes the story would be improved if Christ was crucified as a nobody and then God decided to name him man s savior  As it stands  it s okay to do whatever you like with somebody as long as they don t have connections  Somebody like Billy Pilgrim or Edgar Derby  For a powerful man like Jesus  revenge will be had  but for the rest of us  only the birds will speak up   Poo tee weet    Slaughterhouse Five is one of Vonnegut s two masterpieces  The other masterpiece being Breakfast of Champions  Whereas Breakfast of Champions is an artistic masterpiece  the book where Vonnegut took poster modernism to a new and unique level  Slaughterhouse Five is a humanist masterpiece  Slaughterhouse Five is unique among Vonnegut s books  Everything feels subdued and real  Even the moments on Tralfmadore seem calm and sedate  Everything is so matter of fact which is why he keeps repeating over and over again   So it goes   Vonnegut creates a fascinating philosophy in this book  Billy Pilgrim  the main character  becomes unstuck in time  He constantly is jumping around in the time line of his life  One moment he ll be in World War II  and suddenly he s flash forwarded thirty years to his wife s death  or an optometry conference  The alien creatures from the planet Tralfmadore explain the idea that all moments past  present and future are happening simultaneously  We re all being born  we re all going about our lives and we re all dying all at the same time  What an incredible notion  Suddenly  everything that happens has the same weight  while also saying that nothing has any weight to it  Everything matters equally and nothing matters at all  Vonnegut went through an unique experience in the war  He was a POW who was at the bombing of Dresden which killed an entire city of people  The way that he made sense of it was to make that event equally as important as every other event in his life and thus making it not important at all   dstn drbrhy yh srbz amrykhyy bh sm byly pylgrymh byly twy jng jhny dwWm bh jng  zm myshh w b d

a significant number of Vonnegut s writings  but I somehow managed to miss  Slaughterhouse Five  despite its great fame  I suspect my omission relates to the book s typical summary  which tends to describe the book as a story about  Billy Pilgrim  a man who becomes unstuck in time after he is abducted by aliens from the planet Tralfamadore   While the previous statement is factually accurate  it is a depiction that fails to express that Billy Pilgrim is a vessel to introduce the brutality of war  its effects on individuals  and perspectives on suffering and death   Slaughterhouse  has great profundity woven into an unconventional story about a man who experiences the bombing of Dresden in World War II  and who travels through time and space to Tralfamadore  Billy Pilgrim is an absurd character who begins traveling through time during the Battle of the Bulge  Readers are left to question whether Billy really experiences the travels or whether they are merely the  travels  of a madman  Because of Billy s travels  readers are able to see all the highlights of Billy s life  the good and the bad  The time travel creates a  jumbled and jangled  styling  according to the narrator  but it also ensures incredible movement in the story Billy responds to his experiences in such an even keeled manner  that one cannot help but appreciate his capacity to maintain a healthy perspective  Billy effectively illustrates that many of the events in life that tend to prompt extreme emotions are better handled with composure  Admittedly  Billy s calm demeanor stems from a fatalistic philosophy  what will be  will be  and perhaps insanity  but Vonnegut effectively presents his own world view through an interesting character with an interesting story I found  Slaughterhouse  to be a wonderful read  though I disagree with many of the author s philosophical conclusions on humanism and fatalism  Nevertheless  Vonnegut s book is well worth the time because it provokes consideration of self and worldview  It also demonstrates mastery of the English language with rich  descriptive writing  I recommend  Slaughterhouse Five  with the warning that its atemporal and fanciful nature may be off putting to some readers  My favourite novel I ve read all year  Vonnegut s gorgeous writing style is what draws you in  the crazy time travelling  alien abduction story set over scattered periods Billy Pilgrim s life is what keeps you reading  and the questions and thoughts about the point of war stay with you long after finishing it  I have a bit of troubles understanding how it fits under the satire genre  obviously I don t know as much as I thought about the genre  However  my absolute favourite part of the novel is a scene when Billy is the human exhibit in an alien zoo on board their spaceship  The tralfamadorians are a speies which can see in four dimensions and view time much like the wibbly wobbly timey wimey way  When someone is dead  they have not died  They have always been dead  they are dead  and they always will be dead  They have always been alive  they are alive  and they always will be alive  The tralfamadorians are a peaceful race  but end up exploding the entire universe trying to find a new source of energy  So it goes  Billy asks the aliens how they avoid war and they try to explain how they see everything and say  We can see all the happy and sad moments of our lives at once  but we choose not focus on the bad moments  Why don t humans just do that   And Billy can t answer them  I love it  I can t answer their question either  We always just give attention to all the crap things happening around us just because it s in our nature to  It s no wonder we re so depressed Even though this is the only book I ve read of Vonnegut s and my overall knowledge of novels is still developing  I m not afraid to say he s one of the best authors I ve come across  More of his books are definitely on my reading list  This classic II World War satire has everything I have learned to expect from Vonnegut s best writings  The absurdity mixed with humor is his trademark and I would agree with some of the other reviewers who pointed out the similar feel of this book to Heller s  Catch 22   Perhaps because it is much shorter than  Catch 22   but the story did not affect me as greatly as the former  The time jumps sometimes made it hard to get a good overview of the life the main character had after the war  but the idea of non linear time was an important aspect in the whole story  so I understand the necessity of narrating the past  present and the future of Billy Pilgrim simultaneously  The present time was of course the II World War  reflecting the experiences of Vonnegut himself as a prisoner of war behind the German front  This novel is considered as a powerful anti war book and with good right   the descriptions of the prisoners being transported in wagons and the bombing of the city of Dresden in particular were quite painful to read because you knew that all these things really happened  While I agree that this is a powerful novel   Catch 22  still remains for me the best of the two   Later on in life  the Tralfamadorians would advise Billy to concentrate on the happy moments of his life  and to ignore the unhappy ones to stare only at pretty things as eternity failed to go by  There is one thing that makes me really angry  In one of the Chinese translated version of this book  the translator wrote this as a note   Readers cannot distinguish which parts in the book are real  and which are just imaginations of the character   I haven t had a chance to read it by my own eyes though   And the word of this translator makes me think it this way  he does not want this fiction to be a science fiction  just to maintain its  literariness  But the thought of time travelling is in fact a very good point  So is the  imortality  of every single life in the universe  Because the concept of  death  just simply doesn t exist  Only Earthlings  die   not because they do  but because they think they do  But not the rest of the Universe  And Vonnegut s understanding of time  in this fiction  is similar to Ted Chiang Oh  and I saw people complaining about the  simple sentences  in this book too  which I actually really enjoy  It has been a really good  and awful   time reading Slaughterhouse 5    Kurt Vonnegut wrote the book Slaughterhouse Five to bring to light the atrocities of war  and the enlighten readers on different ideas on philosophy  The point of view for the book is told by Billy Pilgrim  a simple man who is not all that bright  He is thrust into World War Two  captured  and eventually released after the bombing of Dresden  Germany  He goes insane  and claims to have become  unstuck in time   as he says on page 23  The audience for the book is anyone who is looking for enlightenment on the horrors of war  and a look at the inside of an insane man s mind  Vonnegut wrote more to inform than to entertain  for he gives many details about certain events  such as how many people died in the firebombing of Dresden  The theme of the book is not directly stated  and readers must look in between the lines to find the central message  Vonnegut never directly says   War is bad   Rather  he lets readers assume that Billy is driven mad by all of the wrongs he experiences while fighting for America in WWII  Billy cannot handle the army life  and he does not even have a stressful position  he is a chaplain s assistant  and he does not partake in any fighting whatsoever  However  he is treated brutally by his allies as they trudge along the backcountry  and he is roughly treated by the Germans when he is captured  Vonnegut emphasizes that neither side is  good  in war by showing the Americans as war crazy  and by depicting the Germans as heartless and cruel  Billy is required to help dig out bodies buried by an American bombing raid  and that experience probably traumatized him more than anything  The author uses Billy s experiences to highlight the evils of war and emphasize that nothing good comes out of fighting  The book is written in a choppy  disjointed style that makes it hard for the reader to follow  It follows Billy s  phases in time   and Billy jumps from event to event with no regard to chronology  It is effective in emphasizing the insanity that Billy experiences  and shows the mind frame that he is in  and it tells us how he became to be so disjointed  Normally  the book would be a narration  but since it follows no logical or chronological order  it seems to have its own style  For example  the book begins by telling readers that Billy can experience any time frame that he wants  describes his childhood briefly  and then thrusts readers into the middle of his adult life  From there  readers see Billy crash in a plane  and then he is suddenly in the middle of Germany during WWII  The causes for the time lapses are explained later in the novel  but even then readers must assume that Billy is irrevocably insane due to his experiences in the war   I found the book interesting for its ideas  but ultimately hard to follow and seemingly unclear in places  I disliked the choppy style  for it confused me on where the story was headed and what point the author was trying to make  Vonnegut has interesting philosophical ideas concerning dimensions and alternate realities  but they are sometimes hidden in context or spread unconnected throughout the novel  It is similar to a book I tried to read  Clockwork Orange  only in that it was extremely difficult to follow   I truly enjoyed this book  yet I understand why some people despise it  Vonnegut s writing style is one that constantly reminds you that he s there  His personality is extremely prominent whereas the personality of his characters is generally not  That s why this book is often loved or hated   because it depends on whether you enjoy Vonnegut himself  One thing to keep in mind is that Vonnegut uses constant repetition to make his points  Don t be annoyed or discouraged by this  I believe that the often repeated phrase of  so it goes  sums up the majority of meaning behind this novel  Don t become annoyed with its constant use  it s repeated because of its importance to demonstrate that necessity and inevitability does not justify immoral action Vonnegut uses poignant tragedy to present his humor  and simple humor to present philosophy  I ve heard many a person claim that everyone opposed to war doesn t understand how necessary it is  Vonnegut renders this argument absolutely useless  and moreover  he does so not just by appealing to emotion or being idealistic I wouldn t claim to be converted by Vonnegut  however this novel encouraged me to think while being extremely entertaining  Slaughterhouse Five  the modern day masterpiece by Kurt Vonnegut still remains one of the greatest monuments in american literature  Vonnegut has created two worlds for us  a world of time travel and bizzare science fiction and a world of blistering reality of war and death  Vonnegut makes us laugh at the most unfunny stuff  but we do not laugh out of comedy  we laugh out of despair  out of pity  out of sardonic humor  The novel is written for the audience  but it still remains intelligent  It lacks the pretentious narrative we normally get from authors and replaces it with simple words everyone can understand  Vonnegut makes it clear from the prologue that he is not glorifying anything and he does not  War is portrayed as the antagonist of this story and all stories for that matter  Vonnegut s character Billy Pilgrim is relatable for anyone  not just outsiders  Billy acts less as a hero and more of a medium that Vonnegut can work in in order to see into the war itself  Billy also acts as a bridge between two worlds  the world of sci fi and the world of reality  Vonnegut connects the philosophy of his science fiction and the brutality of the war through Billy s eyes  Billy is impossible not to care about and we care about him throughout the entire novel  The characters of the war are all factually put together and the people of Tralfamadorecome from Vonnegut s mind  Tralfamadore serves as Vonnegut s voice in the novel  The Tralfamadorians are a peaceful society that Vonnegut uses to exercise and ultimately further emphasize his strong opinions on war  What we get from all of these sci fi metaphors  brutal war violence  and sometimes flat out depressing fiction is an insight into a crucial part of history  and Vonnegut s history as well   a look at a fictional  but factually based  character traumatized by war  and a warning from Vonnegut about the dangers and delights of this world and all worlds for that matter  So it goes  This Kurt Vonnegut masterpiece had a profound effect on me when I read it in high school  Vonnegut s free and fluid movement through time  chopping up and reassembling chronology seemingly at random  defied everything I d been taught about conventional narrative structure  and it spoke to the rebellious writer in me  the same sliver of my brain that would fall in love with Tarantino and Scorsese  Yet as I read  I discovered something even more surprising  Vonnegut s bold experimentation served a clear narrative and thematic purpose  The disjointed narration mirrors the thought process of Billy Pilgrim  who is  unstuck in time   Billy  like the Tralfamadorians who mentored him  breaks away from the train track of time to cope with the horrors of war  specifically the traumatic Dresden firebombing  The Tralfamadorians make it even more explicit  they admit that they ve foreseen their own self destruction  but insist that this is a fixed  inevitable conclusion  rather than dwell on the impending doom  they transport themselves back to happier periods  Slaughterhouse Five  then  is an examination of man s reaction to suffering  his desire for escape  Billy responds to his suffering by adopting the Tralfamadorian philosophy  summed up by novel s most frequently repeated phrase   So it goes   Suffering is inevitable  why dwell on it when you can transport yourself to a better moment in your life  The novel s great tragedy is that this promise of escape is empty  Unlike the aliens  Pilgrim has little control over  when  he ends up  and inevitably finds himself reliving yet another painful moment  My own early experimentation with narrative structure lacked any such depth  In my efforts to  break the bonds of convention   I experimented for the sake of experimentation  Reading Slaughterhouse Five helped me realize that  while rules are made to be broken  it s best not to break them unless do so will benefit the story   Part of my response I wrote for grad class I was surprised by the ending  I wanted a concrete  yes  or  no  answer to what was going on  Was Billy Pilgrim telling the truth  Was he living in the future  1960 s  thinking about the past or was he living in the past thinking of the future  What happened to the narrator The book could be read over and over like a reel on a loop or a CD on repeat  Pilgrim s life was told in flashes of memories  out of order  The ending on page 275 was the beginning of a story that began on page 249 with the ending told on pages 248 and 249  It is like the quote on page 149   He has always pressed it  and he always will  We always let him  and we always will let him  The moment is structured that way   Past  Present  and Future are constantly happening  all at the same time  As soon as I finished the book  I wanted to turn to Page 1 and start reading again  I realized the first time there were clues that tied things together in the book  but I think a second reading  and each reading after  would reveal more and more meaning  I m not even angry the way it ended  I m mystified  I want to dissect this book  I m amazed  impressed  no one really dies  they all exist on some level  Maybe Pilgrim was telling the truth after all  I m not sure why Vonnegut wrote this book in this way  It s supposed to be anti war  but it s not a blatant anti war novel  It does not preach  it does not lecture  it just tells the story of one man  Billy Pilgrim  who was a POW in WWII  If this man is living in a delusional world  then it shows the horrible effects of war and what one man will do to avoid actually dealing with those painful memories  If so  then this book is geniusly written  Vonnegut writes so simply  yet the book as a whole is profound  thoughtful  and it stays with you after you ve put it down  Like I said  I really want to pick it up right now and start reading it again from page 1  Author s Purpose  To show the bad effects of war  What if the narrator created Billy Pilgrim to talk about himself in the 3rd person  What if Pilgrim s thoughts are all analogies to explain what the narrator experienced in the war  or after the war  and how he felt   Billy s story ended very curiously in a suburb untouched by fire and explosions   230   Is this a hint  Billy s story doesn t end here  We know about Billy up until 1968 when he starts to tell people about Tralfamadore  People think that s when he had the nervous breakdown  but it actually happened  or started to happen  in 1945  during the war  The reason the narrator knows so much about Pilgrim is because he is Pilgrim  Intended Audience  Everyone  anyone  Pilgrim comes into contact with so many different people  each with a different viewpoint of WWII  or war in general  and he seems to discuss the issue of war with each one  Vonnegut has presented an argument against war with Pilgrim as his mouthpiece   As much as I didn t want to love this book  by the time I got to the end  I did  It is truly a literary masterpiece  a one of a kind book  At times it is just bizarre  but it manages to deliver a haunting and powerful antiwar message that I have not encountered before in anything I have read   I m not sure which genre I would classify this book in  but it involves some of all of the following  sci fi  alien abductions  time travel  World War II memoirs  history  drama  and even romance  It tells the story of Billy Pilgrim s ventures through time and space as he recounts various moments of his life  most importantly his presence at the firestorming of Dresden in WWII  in which 120 000 people died  The plot is somewhat scattered and hard to follow  but that is part of what makes this book great  Halfway through  I was highly skeptical  but the second half of the book is so compelling  and it really ties the story together  Overall  I can see why this is ranked by many among the best books of all time  I began reading this novel on Friday  December 27th of 2013  I finished it today  on January 5th at 2 36am  I read fifty pages the first day I opened the novel  and then postponed it until a few days ago and read the entire novel on three sittings  And I postponed it because I was loving the plot of the novel  and knowing it was so short saddened me  I did not want it to end so quickly To be honest  I never expected Slaughterhouse Five to be so adorably comic  I thought it was a serious novel about a serious war and a serious capture from aliens  And even though it was chiefly about that  it was unfolded and narrated with such a comic prose  I would constantly grin from ear to ear for pages because of how comically Mr  Vonnegut recited almost every situation in Billy Pilgrim s life  Even though some situations  probably  weren t meant to be hilarious  or some might not find it as funny  to me every detail in this book was funny in such a delightful and adorable way  Billy Pilgrim  the protagonist of this novel  is such a daft  silly and lethargic man  He s so deepened and overwhelmingly dredged with his experience in Trafalmadore  that people would have to constantly snap at him because of how silly and slow he was  For instance  Roland Weary would have to constantly push him away from the middle of the road  yell at him to come back to reality and shout at him things like   Get out of the road  you dumb motherfucker   Roland Weary is another character besides Billy I  personally  found hilarious and absolutely loved  Chubby  young and a wannabe authoritarian  he constantly had to use cruelty on Billy because he wouldn t do a thing to save his life  Billy was so dumb and slow  he just wished everyone would leave him alone   You just go on without me  guys   was a constant phrase he d repeat to the  Three Musketeers  over and over again  Every aspect in this book made me smile  and there s just something about Billy as a main character that delights me so much  His silliness simply charms me  he is so funny  so adorable and I just find him to be so interesting  His ability to time travel  his thoughts about the Tralfamadorians  the way he behaves around people  His  I don t care  attitude about everything because  in the end  he knows that no matter how dead you are  you ll always be alive  This novel is difficult to review  because the plot is so interesting  so good yet so short  I was just left by Mr  Vonnegut with wanting to read more  The only  complaint  I have about the novel is that I would have adored to know more  learn more or just read more about the Tralfamadorians and Billy s experiences in Trafalmadore  But  Mr  Vonnegut knew what he was doing  If he had written more about them  the novel would maybe not had been as good  It is perfect the way it is  Even though it might seem repetitive or confusing to some people  I think that s the beauty of the novel itself  The characters are amazing  I love each and every single one of them  From Eliot Rosewater to Poor Edgar Derby  from Valencia Merble to even Kilgore Trout  The only one I blatantly disliked because of his arrogant and derogatory attitude was professor Bertram Copeland Rumfoord  But  even though I disliked him  the Part Nine would have not been the same without him  He was necessary In overall  I have to say I really enjoyed this novel  it made me smile  grin hugely and giggle  I loved the characters  SPECIALLY Billy Pilgrim  I just found him so delightfully cute  I loved him  I give this book a deserved 5 stars out of 5 stars  because even though I would have loved to know more about the Tralfamadorians and Billy s experiences with them and in the zoo  it s not worth it to give it four stars just because of that  Great novel   I never know what to say after finishing this book  but here are a few things  this time around  I appreciated KV s autobiographical commentary much more  Two things in particular stood out  In the first chapter  he writes about whether the book is anti war  and concludes   And even if wars didn t keep coming like glaciers  there would still be plain old death   Later  he writes   I have told my sons that they are not under any circumstances to take part in massacres  and that the news of massacres of enemies is not to fill them with satisfaction or glee   This is a book about Dresden  but more than that  it s a book about the atrocities that occur when mass amounts of people do not take the time to acknowledge the humanness of other mass amounts of people  It is not heavy handed because there is nothing to be heavy handed about  in war  and out of war   the vast majority of us are mostly powerless  Being good to one another is one of the only things we can do The WWII movie in reverse scene is still beautiful  but this time around  I found new favorite passages  Billy Pilgrim giving the spoon of malt syrup to Edgar Derby  who bursts into tears  the re imagining of Christ as God s adopted son  This book will always be very important to me  as i read this book  i was reminded constantly of how much acclaim it has received   and now that i ve finished it  i totally understand  somehow vonnegut has fused several vastly opposing story lines of terrorish nightmare  slapstick comedy  and harsh reality  billy pilgram s time traveling is definitely a familiar experience for me  i think in general  we all time travel in our minds  from situation to situation   it s as if a type of organized stream of consciousness drove vonnegut to create this whirlwind of converging stories  his writing style is so carefree and accepting  but still manages to present some extremely important issues  war and destruction  death  depression  alternative lives  big brother  happiness   it s amazing to me that he s able to do this without completely abandoning the reader s comprehension ability like so many other writers do    is this his attempt at communication  or is this really his writing style the imagery in this book is astonishing     kilgore trout laughed uproariously  a salmon egg flew out of his mouth and landed in maggie s cleavage   suddenly all the art and film i ve seen that accomplishes this same mode of imagery all makes sense  michel gondry  tom tykwer  spike jonze   in the end i think we are looking for people like the tralfamadorians   ignore the awful times  and concentrate on the good ones     this is very true and perhaps therapeutic  but aren t we then setting aside hope for better days  the awful times are required for good ones    till the next vonnegut read  3  Extended version available at  Infinite Tasks of Philosophy  Slaughterhouse Five and the Philosophy of War  There is so much to admire in this book that Vonnegut calls  in his first chapter  a  failure   since it is precisely in its failures that its greatness consists  It has no narrative arc  and the planned climax   the execution of Edgar Derby   is a mere sentence  disjoined like everything else from the circumstances or from any possible logic that could tie it to a greater meaning  Vonnegut refuses to tell a story that can make meaning out of war  or out of death  It is pure chance  chaos  and randomness  and even the Trafalmadorians  able to see all moments in time  do not attempt to sum up the moral or political significance of anything  Everything is  precisely as it is  in its surfaces  I will be teaching this book in Spring 2011  in a very large course  70 students   co taught with a Politics Professor and called  The Philosophy   Politics of Peace and War   It isn t entirely clear to me what made me feel so strongly about including it on the syllabus  which also includes works by Barbara Ehrenreich  Carolyn Nordstrom  Jurgen Habermas   Jacques Derrida  Mike Davis  and others   except that it affected me profoundly when I first read it  at a college age  perhaps 20   The jarring transitions that Billy Pilgrim undergoes  the fact that not all of the circumstances he faces are ones of misery  that moments of happiness and peace co exist inscrutably with the most horrible human made disasters all at the same time  there is no time    these all seem to me just about right on target in conveying the absurdity of human reality  It is  explicitly  an anti war book  But it is not the usual sort  or the kind of political or humanitarian analysis that one finds in periodicals or books or radio shows of the  usual suspects   All that Vonnegut can really put forward is this  I have told my sons that they are not under any circumstances to take part in massacres  and that the news of massacres of enemies is not to fill them with satisfaction or glee  I have also told them not to work for companies which make massacre machinery  and to express contempt for people who think we need machinery like that  After all my own investigations these many years  into politics  philosophy  history  religion  I doubt that I have much more to contribute than that  When the course begins  I will be thinking more about the relationship between War and Time in Slaughterhouse Five  and perhaps the more interesting bits of this will show up on my blog   I love this part    I looked through the Gideon Bible in my motel room for tales of great destruction  The sun was risen upon the Earth when Lot entered into Zo ar  I read  Then the Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from Lord out of Heaven  and He overthrew those cities  and all the plain  and all the inhabitants of the cities  and that which greaw upon the ground  So it goes  Those were vile people in both those cities  as is well known  The world was better off without them  And Lot s wife  of course  was told not to look back where all those people and their homes had been  But she did look back  and I love her for that  because it was so human  So she was turned to a pillar of salt  So it goes   Vonnegut 1969 p 21 22  I saw the raw humanness throughout  In germans  americans  polish  french  all crushed by the inhumanities of war  If you like Vonnegut  you know what you re in for  in fact you ve probably already read it  and if you don t this is as fine of a place to start as any  Here s my favorite bit  He came slightly unstuck in time  saw the late movie backwards  then forwards again  It was a movie about American bombers in the Second World War and the gallant men who flew them  Seen backwards by Billy  the story went like this  American planes  full of holes and wounded men and corpses took off backwards from an airfield in England  Over France  a few German fighter planes flew at them backwards  sucked bullets and shell fragments from some of the planes and crewmen  They did the same for wrecked American bombers on the ground  and those planes flew up backwards to join the formation  The formation flew backwards over a German city that was in flames  The bombers opened their bomb bay doors  exerted a miraculous magnetism which shrunk the fires  gathered them into cylindrical steel containers  and lifted the containers into the bellies of the planes  The containers were stored neatly in racks  The Germans below had miraculous devices of their own  which were long steel tubes  They used them to suck more fragments from the crewmen and planes  But there were still a few wounded Americans  though  and some of the bombers were in bad repair  Over France  though  German fighters came up again  made everything and everybody as good as new       When the bombers got back to their base  the steel cylinders were taken from the racks and shipped back to the United States of America  where factories were operating night and day  dismantling the cylinders  separating the dangerous contents into minerals  Touchingly  it was mainly women who did this work  The minerals were then shipped to specialists in remote areas  It was their business to put them into the ground  to hide them cleverly  so they would never hurt anybody ever again  The American fliers turned in their uniforms  became high school kids  And Hitler turned into a baby  Billy Pilgrim supposed  That wasn t in the movie  Billy was extrapolating  Everybody turned into a baby  and all humanity  without exception  conspired biologically to produce two perfect people named Adam and Eve  he supposed   re read jan 2016    i loved it even more the second time  it s definitly a 5 star and the more times I read Vonnegut the more I enjoy his humour  When I first starting reading Slaughterhouse 5 I couldn t help but think  what is the point of this  but I kept reading  And before I knew it  I d finished it  What I particularly enjoyed was Vonnegut s matter of fact narrative  He really does say it how it is  Despite it being about time travel it was surprisingly easy to follow and understand  The story of Billy Pilgrim s life before  during and after World War 2 really was interesting  A strangely likeable character who you really sympathise with  The personal and in depth descriptions of Dresden were compelling  as a history buff  and I could imagine everything Vonnegut described perfectly  despite the absence of vast detailed description  In short  a good read which really is as good as I was told it was  Though at first I couldn t see where it was going or why it was happening  its a compelling and enjoyable read  This book is so fascinating to me for a lot of different reasons  At first glance the book is a sci fi tale about Billy  a man who is unstuck in time and cannot control his consciousness which jumps from one point in his life to the next  In so doing he has learned exactly who he s going to marry  how many kids they ll have and how he is going to die  This plot allows Vonnegut to tell the story free from the structures of chronology  jumping forward and backward in time as the reader follows Billy simultaneously through all the phases of his life  It s not until the end of the book that we are able to completely piece together the totality of Billy s life  Vonnegut has a unique writing style  It is simple and fluid yet very unconventional  as it is in all his books   Although largely written in the third person Vonnegut will enter the novel as a commentator and start speaking directly to the reader in the first person  It s clever and personalizing and makes a direct impact on the tone of the novel Wrapped in the middle of this sci fi novel is a powerful anti war story  Mirroring the author s real world tragic experiences  Billy is captured by the Nazi s in WWII  held in a POW camp in Dresden and experiences firsthand the Allied firebombing of the city which killed over 130 000 civilians  Through Billy  Vonnegut describes the carnage and the cleanup and as the main character struggles to deal with this experience throughout his life  it becomes clear that the author rejects the use of violence of any sort  particularly that perpetrated by war I found the idea intriguing to be able to continuously re experience one s own life   to no longer fear one s own death  because it s already been experienced  and never forget even one experience  because it s always being revisited   At the same time  it must be a terrible curse for someone like Billy who not only gets to relive the birth of his children but also has to relive the horrors of Dresden To me  Billy appeared to be a bit of a tragic character   he seemed to be passively succumbing to his own fate without complaint or criticism  Would I try and do anything different  If I know the exact moment of my death would I not try and escape it The nonlinear characterization of Billy emphasizes the fact that Billy  as with us all  is not simply a singular identity who undergoes a series of changes throughout his life  Instead he  and we  is the totality of the different people he is at different times in his life  son  father  soldier  coward and hero  I ve long heard people mention Kurt Vonnegut as a great American author and Slaughterhouse Five as one of America s great novels  but I never really knew much about either of them  I think someone had once told me this was a book set during World War II  but I guess I d forgotten that  I wasn t sure what to expect as I opened the novel   maybe something about working in slaughterhouses  I certainly wasn t expecting what I found   a strange little work of fiction that bounces around time nonlinearly and even into science fiction while exploring the ideas of fate  mortality and free will The book opens with an introductory preface explaining how the narrator  potentially Vonnegut s voice  but since it s a fictionalized introduction  he s distanced himself from it  is qualified to tell a story set in World War II and why he is writing the book  After this kind of odd introduction  we are thrown into the story of a man named Billy Pilgrim  The plot meanders through time and presents Billy s life in a very non linear fashion  We jump back and forth between Billy s early life  his early experiences in the war  his time as a POW  and his post war life  The events are often intermingled or juxtaposed in ways that make the plot line slightly disorienting The narrator allows for this nonlinear jumping around through an odd element that really caught me off guard  This is also a science fiction novel  About midway through his life  Billy is abducted by aliens   Tralfamadorians  He is taken to their planet and placed in a zoo within a  cage  built to resemble a human home  The Tralfamadorians have a different concept of time    they see in four dimensions  They see and experience all moments of time in a single instant  Past  Present and Future exist all at once to them  As Billy spends time in their zoo  he becomes  unstuck in time  and also experiences life in four dimensions with everything very nonlinear The narrative is an examination of Billy s life in a way that lets us see how events lead to consequences  But the causality shown is presented in a very matter of fact way  Everything happens  It just happens  Even if you know the future ahead of time  as the Tralfamadorians do   and as Billy later does   there isn t any desire to stop things from happening or alter the future in any way  In fact  they suggest that fate cannot be changed Billy is a soldier  really a chaplain s aid  and not very well trained as a soldier  captured by the Germans in World War II and taken to Dresden in time to be present for the bombing that destroyed the city and many most of its inhabitants  After the war he returns home to become an optometrist and marries the daughter of a prominent optometrist in his town  Around this time he is taken by the aliens and spends time in their zoo and becomes unstuck in time  After he returns to Earth  he begins telling the world about his experience  Finally he announces that he knows how  where and when he will be killed   and then it happens  So it goes The narrator apologizes for the length and jumbled nature of the book and excuses it by pointing out that there is  nothing intelligent to say about a massacre   Even though he points out that this book is about the War and the bombing of Dresden  much of the book takes place outside of the War but in a way that comments on war and mortality The style of writing is very straightforward and direct  The sentences and overall structure is short and to the point  The plot itself is fairly simplistic either as a war novel or as a science fiction novel  And yet  the whole package is very thick and nuanced with all sorts of strange ideas and themes  I suspect that it is this depth within simplicity that has made this novel stand out  Through the circular timeline as well as textual repetition  the author makes subtle points again and again  Probably the most commonly repeated phrase in the book is the sentence  So it goes  which the author writes every time someone or something dies  It s a very matter of fact commentary on the nature of death  This short refrain is almost humorous when juxtaposed against some of the more tragic or horrific deaths within the book  On the one sense it seems to speak to the desensitizing nature of war that the narrator and Billy can both look at death in such a nonchalant manner  In another sense it emphasizes the authors Tralfamadorian notion that death is just part of life and there s nothing especially noteworthy about it  This concept  coupled with the idea of fate and lack of any personal will  creates a sort of passive view of life and existence  To me this is a pretty depressing viewpoint  Essentially it negates any personal choices I might make  suggesting that  it   the universe   already knows what choices I m going to make and my entire path is plotted  This sort of thinking is a little paradoxical in my mind  If we take out agency and tell somebody that no matter what they do  they re going to have this outcome  then a person could become apathetic  lazy and despondent and not do anything   and as a result  fate must necessarily change to accommodate the change in behavior  Or had fate already accounted for the lackadaisical change in attitude and integrated it into your path  All in all  fate and predestination are strange concepts that I just can t get behind  I guess I m not Tralfamadorian enough yet    Overall I m not entirely sure yet what to make of this book  Generally speaking  I enjoyed it  Emotionally I found myself bouncing around  Sometimes I would laugh at the absurdity of things or at the attitudes of the characters  Other times I was horrified at the senseless tragedy of war and the destruction and death that comes with it  I do acknowledge that it should be read by a more mature audience if only for some of the language and some of the descriptions of war scenes  They aren t overly graphic  but certainly not intended for kids  There are a lot of themes and concepts ripe to be unpacked and considered  From merely a plot standpoint  this is a strange little book that can be entertaining  From a deeper sense  this is a book worth exploring  I definitely see why it is held up as among the  great literature  of modern times  4 5 out of 5 stars         Originally Written in 2011   Perhaps this is not the best thing to admit  but Kurt Vonnegut writes like I think   or should I say I think like he writes  I always feel at home when I m reading something of his Vonnegut avoids the one thing that I really can t abide in a novel   fluff  His writing is straight forward and clear  even if his plot methods tend to be a little disconnected and convoluted  Never do you get the impression that Vonnegut is trying to impress  Slaughterhouse Five is  at it s core  a novel about fatalism  His repetition of the phrase  So it goes  whenever there is a mention of tragedy or death seems to put forth the idea that yes  there are a lot of bad things in the world  but what are you gonna do about it Billed as a science fiction book because if the time traveling of the main character  Billy Pilgrim   after reading it you can t be clear if Pilgrim was an honest to goodness time traveler or a full gone nut job  In the end  that question  while nagging  is sort of irrelevant  Pilgrim is one of the few survivors of the Dresden Fire Bombing that came close to the end of World War II  Once you get a hold of the details of that event  it s hard to imagine someone there holding onto their sanity Slaughterhouse Five is on the American Library Association s list of the 100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 1990 1999  Coincidentally  the first time I heard of the book was the refernce to it in the movie Footloose and commented on by its lead character  Renn McCormack  as a classic  They burn books later in that movie  This Vonnegut book  as with other of his  touches on many touchy topics and is  at time  rather unabashed in it s straightforwardness  It s easy to see why it might be argued about and I would have reservations about recommending it to anyone until perhaps college  or later  depending on the individual  The novel does do an interesting job of pointing out the insanity of war  Perhaps in no passage better than when he refers to a bombing in the reverse American planes  full of holes and wounded men and corpses took off backwards from an airfield in England  Over France a few German fighter planes flew at them backwards  sucked bullets and shell fragments from some of the planes and crewmen  They did the same for wrecked American

had somehow managed to read every Vonnegut thing I could get my paws on when I was in school  but neglected this one  I think I didn t read this for around the same reason that I chose to go to Germany instead of France this summer  France seemed too obvious as a honeymoon destination  So it is fitting that I picked this up at a used bookstore in Prague before I went to Germany  on the off chance that we might end up in Dresden somewhere along the way  If we ended up in Dresden and I hadn t yet read Slaughterhouse Five  I would be sorry  So I read it  and really  A review  The only Vonnegut book I ve ever not fallen madly in love with was Timequake  And I m willing to try again on that one  I don t think I d mind living in a dome on the Tralfamadore that Vonnegut describes in Slaughterhouse Five  I ve heard different things about it from him in other books  but it sounded pretty nice being unstuck in time and being a zoo exhibit  all expenses paid   Slaughterhouse Five is a book that defies a clear and coherent summary  it is hard to pin it on any one thing  On one level it is a book about the fire bombing of Dresden during the climax of the second world war   which the author witnessed first hand during his military service   but on a much larger level it is a twisted science fiction psychological cross breed about time travel  aliens  philosophy  war  perspective  life and of course death  So it goes  The book easily scores a 5 out of 5 for it s unique writing style  story and approach  it is very readable  and though it s short  it leaves a long lasting impression  I would also say it s a book you could read twice   which is always a good thing   as there is a lot of depth scattered throughout its pages for the readers who like to highlight  take notes and dwell on the book s themes and messages Kurt Vonnegut employs a very economical writing style  and relies heavily on symbolism  colours and motifs  but delivers them with short and direct sentences  The author has popularised the saying  So it goes  through Slaughterhouse Five s layers upon layers of  well executed  repetition  these three words hold a certain power in the context of the story  and will no doubt conjure in the reader s mind a fascinating philosophy that underlines the whole book The story centers around a time traveling man called Billy Pilgrim who served in the Second World War  witnessed the fire bombing at Dresden  and was abducted by aliens who helped him to understand his time traveling experiences  He also ends up at some point in the novel as a POW in a slaughterhouse   numbered 5  obviously  These are all minor details that I will not expand upon  as you will have to read it for yourself  but rest easy in the comforting knowledge that I am not spoiling the book for you  The story is not written in chronological order and allows you to glimpse at all these occurrences and more very early on in the book  The author  even tells the reader how the book will end at the very beginning And so on All in all I thoroughly enjoyed reading Slaughterhouse Five  I strongly recommend it to anyone who has not read it before and I will always hold a special place for it in my bookshelf      Slaughterhouse Five what can I say   It was a gripping novel of fiction and nonfiction that had me wanting more  I loved the classic world war 2 novel story with the twist of aliens and time travel that s what really intrigued me  What had me wanting more and made me read further and further into the book was how he survived the bombing of Dresden  the most horrific bombing in the history of the world Billy pilgrim who is the main character  is a very mellow man who never gets mad  He is down to earth and is a person who does not like life but will always be alive  Roland Weary  another main character  is a sick twisted solider in Billy s squad in WWII  He will kill anyone who piss s him off and will do it with a grin as if he does it for fun  Valencia  who is billy s wife is a fat women who loves him so dearly that she might love him more then he loves her  There are plenty of other main characters through out the novel but Billy is the only one who reminds me of myself because he never really gets mad and does not believe or see reason in violence  If i were to give Slaughterhouse Five a theme it would have to be  carpe diem   It is the theme for Slaughterhouse Five because Billy goes through horrible events in life and shows readers how parts of life can really suck but other parts are so amazing it makes life so precious  Billy enjoys the joyful parts of his life as all people should and lives in those moments because carpe diem is used to urge someone to make the most of the present time and give little thought to the future I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a good book in general  5 Stars       First off  I m glad I read this edition of the book  I like the old fashioned cover  and the feel of the paperback and that certain font used in the time period  For some ridiculous reason  I think I might have enjoyed Cat s Cradle more if I had the older edition I ve read excellent books  Thing is  they re mostly thrillers  Amazing the first time around  but not much to re read  Even Still Life With Crows  my favorite Preston Child book  sits on the shelf untouched by its owner  apart from the time it was pushed into the hands of another But Slaughterhouse Five  man  I don t know how anyone could touch this book and decide to just look at the highlights on sparknotes  I ve never admired black humor until Kurt Vonnegut  probably because he s the only one who wields it so well  The story was hilarious  yet sad  I d chuckle  then frown because of the real implications  Interesting how I ve heard more praise for Cat s Cradle  when Slaughterhouse Five was definitely the best   Not saying I didn t enjoy the former  If I hadn t been reading a library copy  I would have been underlining and bracketing constantly  Know that this will definitely be a book to re read EDIT  Reread nearly a year later in spring 2014 for English 10 class  after doing that dreadful research paper January and February  and March as well    The reread was VERY thorough  making notes in the margins  connecting any and all symbols  analyzing the story in class and through two projects  This was a very good book in my opinion  Vonnegut has a very odd way of writing  it s extremely different than any author I ve ever read from before  but in a good way  It almost seamed as though he didn t try very hard to write this book  he just kind of thought about it and wrote it down without trying too hard to make it official  However it is he wrote it was great and I had no trouble flying through this book There wasn t much I didn t like about this book  one thing I would have liked is if he didn t put   As it goes  every single time something or someone died  It was a great book and that which I just said is probably the only complaint I have about the book besides how slow the beginning was  other than that a great book  I would recommend this book to everybody no matter what kind of books they liked  Also throughout all of the different crazy science fictitious talk  Vonnegut really put a lot of time into research and I learned about many different factual things  The whole war of Dresden was very well explained and I ve never heard of this before in my life  I actually went to look it up to see if he hadn t just made this up  It was just as real as the words he put on the page  Slaughter House 5 was a great book  and though it s crazy to believe and think of the terms of these crazy 4th dimension seeing aliens  he made them seem very believable and I actually understood these strange creatures  These aliens also gave me a whole new outlook of death  though it s impossible for humans to comprehend such weird things  all of it really makes since   One of the main characteristics that sets Kurt Vonnegut apart from other writers is his distinctive authorial voice  When asked about how to write with style  Vonnegut encouraged other writers to sound like themselves   he described his own style of writing as a product of his Midwestern upbringing   where common speech sounds like a band saw cutting galvanized tin  and employs a vocabulary as unornamental as a monkey wrench   Though Vonnegut was uncharitable towards his writing style  his work conveys an enormous amount of emotional resonance  compassion and humor in the briefest of words  In the novel Slaughterhouse Five  his voice lends a consoling presence in a book that often delves into some pretty dark and strange territory Much of the novel centers around the Allied fire bombing of Dresden  which Vonnegut witnessed as a POW in World War II  Rather than a straight retelling of his own experience  the Dresden firebombing occurs from the perspective of another infantry scout captured by the Germans   Billy Pilgrim  an impossibly passive  unwitting clown with little to no control over his life  From this alternate perspective  science fiction elements come into play   Pilgrim gets kidnapped by aliens from the planet Tralfamadore and experiences time as random  fragmented moments which form the structure of the novel The unconventional structure takes us out of the chronological way of thinking   an illusion   the Tralfamadorians inform Pilgrim  based on the limited human perception of time  To the aliens  all past  present  and future moments are permanent and exist simultaneously  which gives great comfort to Billy  It means that his departed loved ones are still with him and will always be with him  Moreover  the past is not irretrievable  leaving him bereft with only artifacts and memories as consolation  Unfortunately  it also means free will is merely an illusion  An acceptance of the inevitable permeates the book  summed up in the phrase   So it goes   which sign off every death  no matter how trivial Passive compliance also characterizes the attitude toward war in the novel  That a single individual can somehow contend with the enormous forces at play in war is a notion upended time and again throughout this book  Vonnegut makes it clear that people involved in a war are at the mercy of greater  inscrutable forces  Invisible hands guide the characters to predetermined locations and disembodied voices order the soldiers to surrender  The lack of control in one s own fate extends its reach far beyond the theater of war into ordinary life  Nowhere is this more evident than with Pilgrim  who blunders through the war  somehow manages to survive it  while more able soldiers perish   and bounces from one stage of life to another without aim The notion that free will is a shared delusion  and that we are simply the playthings of unseen forces would be more disturbing if it wasn t for the humor and pathos provided by Vonnegut s engaging voice  Critics say that his style amounts to hack work  and that his ideas overshadow his writing  yet the stunning turn of phrase and the ease in which he evokes powerful emotions in passages of Slaughterhouse Five easily trump that notion   Billy Pilgrim has come unstuck in time  I m still not sure what Vonnegut means by this but it seems to trigger some wild leaps in consciousness  or maybe transcendence to a higher level of thinking  Like the Tralfamadorian literature  this novel dipicts Billy Pilgrim s life in a successions of explosions  popping from his experience in the war  to his life as an aging man  to his life in the distant planet Tralfamadore  All these are jumbled in a cacophony of a man s waking experience as he finds himself in different point in his life  There are several ways to read this novel  He could be senile  lost in his own fabricating mind  He could actually be a sort of time traveler  visiting different points in his life where they stand  These are just two examples  but both leave the message that life is void of meaning  The Tralfamadorian dictum  so it goes  is applied to all things that die   the literal  metaphorical and even the play on words to show that in life and death  there is no distinction between one moment of tragedy from another  One man s death is similar to the next  and so it goes  Death and war are therefore ever present entities and this is a call to the attention of this cycle of jarring violence  Vonnegut writes this about the second world war but it is for the audience of the Vietnam war and he parallels the senselessness and morbidity in both  This novel s secondary name is  The Children s Crusade   and as explained in the frame of this story  those who participated in the war were just kids  This statement strongly echoes the politics and protests of Vietnam and Vonnegut s ability to apply one mode of chaos to another deserves high acclaim  Slaughterhouse Five by Kurt Vonnegut is the story of a deathly pale  small  incompetent  and all around awkward man  Billy Pilgrim  Although the book itself is not in chronological order  I will list its main event in such  Billy grows up in Ilium  New York  He attends optometry school in his earlier years until he is drafted into WWII  Barely passing boot camp  he is shipped to war where  just as his characteristics would suggest  he is incapable of being a soldier  Soon into his campaigned he is captured by the Germans and sent to Dresden as a POW  There he finds his niche working in the factories to support the German war machine  a calm and uneventful living  That is until  as history recognizes  Dresden is brutally fire bombed by allied forces  leaving Billy and only a select few of other POW s survivors  After the war Billy is released and returns to America and returns to his monotonous life in optometry  That is  until he is  allegedly  abducted by the Tralfamadorians  a civilized alien race  and relocated to their home planet as a zoo exhibit  Billy is then returned to earth unharmed and in the same moment of time as when he left  Chronologically  the story ends with Billy writing a memoir of his life in his basement and claims he knows the moment of his death  he shall be assassinated in 1979 by a laser gun      Is this journey to Tralfamadore real or simply an illusion to Billy to fulfill his mentally scarring impotency at life  Does Billy possess the ability to predict his death  Those are the questions Vonnegut wants us as readers to ask  Uncertainty is the theme to Slaughterhouse Five  That sense of disillusionment and fear humans universally share  as well as the common grandeur of our egos self promoting our own greatness and legend  Billy did this by psychologically fulfilling his ego with great and important adventures to Tralfamadore  When  in reality he was nothing more than a common man managing to live a basic  boring  and brutally accomplished life filled with disappointment and dispassion  The bleak hopelessness Billy has in the novel ultimately reaches Vonnegut s audience and is what popularized the novel in the 1960s and 70s  In my opinion it was a hilarious  intriguing  thought provoking  and insightful book on the human psyche  The enjoyment of the book just needs the right mindset  I highly recommend it to any reader wishing to put a little weird into his her bookshelf an spice up reality with uncertainty and confusion  I always recommend Slaughterhouse to friends and they almost never enjoy it  So it goes  My defense of this book is pretty well rehearsed at this point but I m not going to repeat it here  Plenty of other reviewers here have done a far better job than I am capable of in extolling the virtues of this novel  so instead  here are some meandering thoughts you should probably just disregard Why do people not like this book  You can find plenty of people on this site who are happy to illuminate this for you  But after reading their reviews I would suggest you view their favorite books  Continue this process long enough and occasionally you re going to find an aberration  someone whose stars align with your own in all regards but this one  How does this happen I think part of the problem is that Slaughterhouse s reputation always precedes it   never a good thing for a novel   so new readers are unable to discover it for themselves  Well  in case you have not heard  Slaughterhouse is one of the greatest English language novels ever written  It s up on the pedestal  And sitting way up there on high invites your detractors to take some potshots  There is no honor in beating on a weakling but taking down a front runner is humanity s most cherished sport Now  at the risk of sounding like an asshole  I will venture that many readers  certainly not the readers of this review  judge great literature based upon an approximation of what it is supposed to look like   it should be long and dense  Slaughterhouse is neither of these  The dense novel is a bit tougher to take on because if you just plain don t understand it then you re not sure how to complain  Slaughterhouse is short and easily digestible so even the most unimaginative can usually come up with some angle of attack  Beyond minor stylistic quibbles  so it goes  this is typically some sort of riff on  the point  I think one of the worst things people learn about reading books is that authors have a point and it is the job of the reader to figure this out  This just gets exacerbated by all the symbol heavy tomes that teachers love to make you slog through  Reading great novels becomes an exercise and I think many readers get used to coming up a bit short in the comprehension department  My point is that people start to think that literature is supposed to be a little unapproachable  It should be complex and it must be deciphered with great effort  So it is the accessibility of the prose in Slaughterhouse that works against it  The words on the page are unambiguous so readers become a little skeptical that the text has anything to say  They didn t have to work for it  However the structure is not so familiar  Most have never encountered a form like this and it is here they find the challenge  It this combination of ease and difficulty seems to pose some very serious problems for some people Returning to my disappointed friends  after they finish the read their most common response is   Why did he write it that way  The time travel I mean  What is the point of that   But with this mystery unlocked  would the novel take on new levels of enjoyment  After lengthy attempts to explain the  why   I have yet to move the needle on the appreciation scale    So let s just leave it with this  Slaughterhouse is going to touch a nerve  and whether that is a sensation of pleasure or pain says far more about the composition of the reader than that of the novel   Kogato zapochnakh

flew at them backwards  sucked bullets and shell fragments from some of the planes and crewmen  They did the same for wrecked American bombers on the ground  and those planes flew up backwards to join the formation The formation flew backwards over a German city that was in flames  The bombers opened their bomb bay doors  exerted a miraculous magnetism which shrunk the fires  gathered them into cylindrical steel containers  and lifted the containers into the bellies of the planes  The Germans below had miraculous devices of their own  which were long steel tubes  They used them to suck more fragments from the crewmen and planes  But there were still a few wounded Americans  though  and some of the bombers were in bad repair  Over France  though  German fighters came up again  made everything and everybody as good as new When the bombers got back to their base  the steel cylinders were taken from the racks and shipped back to the United States of America  where factories were operating night and day  dismantling the cylinders  separating the dangerous contents into minerals  Touchingly  it was mainly women who did this work  The minerals were then shipped to specialists in remote areas  It was their business to put them into the ground  to hide them cleverly  so they would never hurt anybody ever again The American fliers turned in their uniforms  became high school

biologically to produce two perfect people named Adam and Eve  he supposed And that  ladies and gentlemen  is the greatest anti war passage I have ever read  One of many utterly brilliant sections in this book by one of the greatest and most cynical minds of the 20th century  I urge and implore you to read this book  Go  Do it  NAO   This begins with a bit of autobiography  then Billy Pilgrim is introduced  This is a story about Billy Pilgrim  It revolves around his experiences during World War II  but digresses to what happened to him afterward  Poor Billy becomes crazy later in life  The story says he is not crazy  but to anyone not in his head  he is  In a storytelling  linear fashion  he joins the Army  goes to France  gets lost and is captured  As a POW  he is sent to a British camp  then on to do some work in Dresden  He and others who were with him lived through the senseless bombing of Dresden by burying themselves in the bunker under Slaughter House 5  All they saw when they came out was others who were not so deep and so were burned to death  After the war  he becomes an optometrist and marries the daughter of the school s founder  so he becomes settled and wealthy  has a daughter  etc   etc  Mr  Vonnegut wants to write of the Dresden bombing  but does not know how to go about it  He mentions that he has written some five or six thousand pages and thrown them all away  He goes to visit an old army buddy  The friend s wife is stand offish  It turns out she is some kind of peacenik and opposes all wars  She sees this visit as glorifying the war experience these guys had  When Mr  Vonnegut explains his intentions  and that he will name the book for the Children s Crusade  she thaws considerably  Obviously  the name for this book comes from the place that saved their lives during the bombing and the failed Crusade those children tried to make  The obvious futility  senselessness and hidden purposes of both begets his animosity towards wars and reason for writing the story  I read this story in high school  of course  early 1970 s  and remembered how he was in the British POW camp with all the largess the British shared with them  but not with the Russians across the fence  I remembered that the British gave some explanation of why they did not share across the fence  but now I did not see it  If someone knows what I am talking about  please share it with me  I thought the explanation could be used by the Catholic Church and ultra wealthy as an explanation for their avariciousness  I would like to ridicule it  but I did not find it here     Slaughterhouse Five by Kurt Vonnegut is funny  interesting  and imaginative  This novel tells the tale of Billy Pilgrim  a veteran of the war and more notably the firebombing of Dresden as he is able to journey through his own timeline  Kurt Vonnegut explores the horrors of war in a comical way which makes this book not only amusing but very unique as well  It all starts when Billy Pilgrim is abducted by aliens from Tralfamadore who have mastered the fourth dimension  meaning that they can see time  Billy is interested in their culture and soon he is in a zoo on the planet  but now he is unstuck in time and going back to moments in his own history  This is how Vonnegut teaches us about the bombing of Dresden  in a zany comical way Wow  this book was a wild ride to read but it still is one of my personal favorites  The black humor and the anti war message come together to form a great book so I would definitely recommend it to anyone that likes fiction  Out of the zany plot there are several themes in Slaughterhouse Five like anti war  the horror of war  and the illusion of free will  overall this book was great to read and fun to review and I encourage you to read it  I ve read  Slaughterhouse Five  countless times over the past 10 years  but this is my first time teaching it in a college classroom  In the future I will likely spend less time on introductory context and dive right in  Questions about the genre  why fiction  what type of fiction is this  does this change the way you classify fiction  etc   and authorial intrusions framed a lot of good thematic discussion  While some students were disoriented by the chronology  and the aliens  which is to be expected   they latched on to Vonnegut s moments of extreme clarity  such as the explanation for the  children s crusade  subtitle  and other passages that epitomize the novel s most central statements   there is nothing intelligent to say about a massacre  Everybody is supposed to be dead  to never say anything or want anything ever again  Everything is supposed to be very quiet after a massacre  and it always is  except for the birds     And what do the birds say  All there is to say about a massacre  things like  Poo tee weet  I would sooner teach  Slaughterhouse Five  than  Cat s Cradle  again  When students are put off by Tralfamadore  they at least understand the war narrative  When students don t get Bokononism  they HATE the whole novel  In my current course  I m excited to be pairing Vonnegut with Sherman Alexie s novel  Flight   which opens with the epigraph   Poo tee weet   Love the imagery of it  So it goes  recommended by http   artofmanliness com 2008 05 14    Favorite Quote  America is the wealthiest nation on Earth  but its people are mainly poor  and poor Americans are urged to hate themselves  To quote the American humorist Kin Hubbard   It ain t no disgrace to be poor  but it might as well be   It is in fact a crime for an American to be poor  even though America is a nation of poor  Every other nation has folk traditions of men who were poor but extremely wise and virtuous  and therefore more estimable than anyone with power and gold  No such tales are told by the American poor  They mock themselves and glorify their betters  The meanest eating or drinking establishment  owned by a man who is himself poor  is very likely to have a sign on its wall asking this cruel question   if you re so smart  why ain t you rich   There will also be an American flag no larger than a child s hand   glued to a lollipop stick and flying from the cash register  Americans  like human beings everywhere  believe many things that are obviously untrue  Their most destructive untruth is that it is very easy for any American to make money  They will not acknowledge how in fact hard money is to come by  and  therefore  those who have no money blame and blame and blame themselves  This inward blame has been a treasure for the rich and powerful  who have had to do less for their poor  publicly and privately  than any other ruling class since  say Napoleonic times  Many novelties have come from America  The most startling of these  a thing without precedent  is a mass of undignified poor  They do not love one another because they do not love themselves  I d been thinking a lot of time travel before I picked up this book  which is kind of ironic  The kind of time travel I was thinking of differed to that in the book  however  I found myself thinking about what I d do if I were given the chance to go back and watch something  however painful  from my past  At first I imagined that I would scream and attempt  however violently need be  to stop myself from doing whatever the painful memory consisted of  Then I would think of how different my current life would be had that moment not been the same  Eventually I concluded that the entire thing would just be a very bad idea Although this is my connection  it isn t really what the novel is about  Billy Pilgrim time travels at random times after being abducted by aliens from the planet Tralfamadore  he walks through a door or falls asleep in one year  and walks out another or wakes up in an entirely different time period in his life   He has seen his own death many times   So it goes   He is accepting and welcoming towards death  because in the book death is merely a moment  and everyone remains alive in the elapsed time period of their lives  The novel follows Billy s experiences of being a prisoner of war and surviving the bombing of Dresden  becoming an optometrist  being kept on a Tralfamadorian zoo with a young pornography actress  as well as several other significant events in his life I absolutely could not put this book down  When I actually managed to  it was only because I had forced myself  What made this book most interesting to me wasn t necessarily the time traveling aspect as much as it was the manner in which it was written  Although the story is completely fragmented and goes back and forth between time periods  it is incredibly simple to follow  Vonnegut writes in a style that makes the story unforgettable  He manages to talk about the horrors of war in a comedic way that makes you snort and then wonder whether or not you re a complete ass  but you re still smiling over it  so it doesn t really matter  Upon finishing this novel I had incredible difficulty deciding between giving it a four or five star rating  I decided upon five stars because I enjoyed it so much  I whole heartedly recommend this book to anyone and everyone  I have a friend who reads lots of books about WWII  That s not my favorite genre  so after I finished the acknowledged classic Slaughterhouse Five  I was excited to finally have a book we could discuss together  Imagine my surprise when I found out she hadn t read it  Turns out she thought it was science fiction  so didn t feel compelled to read it  What a mistake  Why are we  myself included  so afraid to step outside of our boundaries and read something different  No wonder many authors  Vonnegut included  chafe so at being classified as this or that genre  So limiting  Even my scifi book club  for which I read Slaughterhouse Five  was mixed over whether this book was scifi or not  But we agreed it didn t matter  It is simply a Great Book  And Great Books are Great no matter what their subject  genre  or era  The genre thing comes down to this  I do not want to spend my precious time reading mediocre works about WWII  and the same goes for my friend vis a vis scifi  But brilliant works like Slaughterhouse Five or The Left Hand of Darkness  which won the 1970 Hugo Award over Slaughterhouse Five  really should be read by everyone  Yes  that means YOU  This excerpt encapsulates the book for me American planes  full of holes and wounded men and corpses took off backwards from an airfield in England  Over France  a few German fighter planes flew at them backwards  sucked bullets and shell fragments from some of the planes and crewmen  They did the same for wrecked American bombers on the ground  and those planes few up backwards to join the formation The formation

 And Hitler turned into a baby  Billy Pilgrim supposed  That wasn t in the movie  Billy was extrapolating  Everybody turned into a baby  and all humanity  without exception  conspired biologically to produce two perfect people named Adam and Eve  he supposed  Surviving any dire situation must leave a person with some sense of survivor s guilt  So  surviving one of the worst atrocities of World War II  the fire bombing of Dresden  like Kurt Vonnegut did must take an even deeper toll on a person  This is what one must keep in mind to begin understanding Billy Pilgrim s attempt  to re invent  himself  and  his  universe  and Kurt Vonnegut s plight of eliciting meaning from that reinvented world  Once the beliefs of the old world have been torn down  new beliefs must be put in their place lest the believer find life meaningless The novel begins with a fictional version of Vonnegut trying to figure out how to write about his war experiences  especially  the fire bombing  He is given advice that writing an anti war book is useless and also told that any war story will only further perpetuate the myths that serve to glorify war  When he decides how to write his book  he focuses on the ever passive Billy Pilgrim  Billy is horribly unequipped for war and wants out of almost every situation he is in  which  in part  leads him to become  unstuck in time   This means he frequently moves backwards and forwards in time from his war years to his mundane life as an optometrist to his death over twenty years later  never knowing at which point he will emerge  Over the course of his life  he encounters many unique individuals  Roland Weary  an eighteen year old antitank gunner and bully  Paul Lazarro  a nasty revenge seeking American  Edgar Derby  a virtuous high school teacher who is the only  character  in the book  Kilgore Trout  a terrible writer with good ideas  and the Tralfamadorians  aliens who teach Billy to believe in fatalism Billy s being  unstuck in time  means the structure of the novel is an atypical one  Vonnegut does everything he can to break up the story and constantly remind readers that what they are reading is just as messy  chaotic  and incomprehensible as war itself  He opens the second chapter with the closing line of the novel  he occasionally inserts himself into Billy s story  and he uses no heroes  villains  climaxes  or resolutions Vonnegut s main reason for doing this is his anti war message  His structural methods tear down the conventional war story  He makes Billy far from a hero  as he is too young and inexperienced to be an effective soldier  Even though certain people perform brutal actions in the novel  none of them are true villains  They are just regular people put in bad situations  often using faulty justifications  The one noble character is executed for the most ridiculous reason  And  of course  since all moments of people s lives are eternally present  the war is continuously going on without end  which means no one really wins or loses The other way Vonnegut demonstrates his opposition to war is with the novel s most famous line   so it goes   Every time something dies  even a bottle of champagne or a colony of lice  this line is repeated  as if war and death are the only possible outcomes of every situation  The line eventually begs readers to challenge this notion  as there is a chance people can change things for the better and not simply accept their fate Vonnegut delivers all of this with his trademark satirical wit and crude sense of humor  Despite how much his crude references are criticized  they do seem necessary  Slaughterhouse Five is a surprisingly brutal and bloody book  and the dirty limericks and salacious songs serve to lighten the mood just a little bit Aside from the violence  scatology  and time travel  though  Vonnegut never loses his focus on humanity  Readers are often reminded that there are real humans that compose the statistics  and the book is filled with tiny acts of human kindness and compassion that run counter to the endless array of death and depravity  And  it is the fact that these moments of benevolence are able to occur amidst a sea of war and hardship that allows for a glimmer of hope that humans are capable of mitigating unnecessary atrocities  I loved this book  It s an anti war book at the base  but there is much more to it as you read  BIlly Pilgrim s journey to Tralfamador and through time with the Tralfamadorians allowed him to accept the death and destruction he witnessed in World War II without breaking down  He simply accepted that a dead person is  just fine in plenty of other moments   The human suffering presented in this book as a result of the war causes the reader to question why anyone would ever want to do these things to people  Billy accepts that  everybody has to do exactly what he does  and therefore it is impossible to avoid these wars  but as a reader I still question whether there is a way to break the cycle and avoid these atrocities  Kurt Vonnegut presents his anti war sentiments without explicitly stating them  but rather shocking people with the truth of war and causing readers to realize this theme on their own  He truly created a classic with this book and I advise that everyone read it at some point in their life  There s a lot to be said about Kurt Vonnegut  a man with an extraordinary ability to write dark comedy about one of the deadliest conflicts in human history without actually coming off as too insensitive  I don t know if it s because I m so interested in postmodernism or what  but I just thought that it was brilliant writing  I can see why some people complain about the repetitive use of the phrase  So it goes   whenever death is mentioned  although it actually provided for some pretty clever humor at some parts  For instance  a drink is once described as being  flat   or  dead   and the aforementioned phrase is used there Also  Slaughterhouse Five is one of those books that could be described as unconventional and accessible at the same time  Unconventional in that it disregards the chronological passing of time  described in the novel as being  unstuck in time    but also accessible in the sense that it s an easy read  It made me laugh  but also think of the utter futility of war  I m a fan of KV  The more books I read from him  the better I like them all  some characters appear at least in mention in a few different ones  and people taking secondary roles in a book may be the main characters of others  Nevertheless  each of the books I ve read form him stands tall on its own  There is something about Vonnegut s sense of humour I appreciate very much  Maybe it is that for him nothing is sacred  or that he will surprise you with an odd side story  or very ironic outcome There are very well defined biographical and fictional components in the book  Vonnegut himself was in Germany as during WW2  and witnessed several of the events in the book  such as the bombing of Dresden and being locked up in a pig slaughterhouse  room V  as a POW  The book is not about him though  it deals with Billy Pilgrim  an odd individual that also gets deployed to the same area  Billy Pilgrim isn t strong  isn t smart  and isn t heroic  And neither is much of what happens in the book  Vonnegut warns you about this in the prologue  On the fictional and fantastic components are Billy Pilgrims wanderings through time  While I found the idea of travelling a bit lame  it does give rise to interesting secondary stories Another component of this fantastic side of the story are the Tralfamadorians and their philosophy  I don t think I found it very understandable  What I felt I understood and could piece together was their main premise  that Tralfamadorians can see past and future as vividly as the present  Hence  for them the concept of present is not meaningful  They don t see a snapshot of space every instant  but rather they perceive a static  4 D space with time being just like another dimension of space  Any act in time in the past or in the future is within perception  A consequence of this is that a person is not dead or alive  in the sense that in some point in time the person is dead  and in another a person is alive  There is no sense in assigning a time dependent state to a person  The way this ties into the story is weak  imo  because the narrations about the two aspects feel a bit disjoint  a segment of the real world is interrupted by a segment of life in Tralfamadore  and so on   The only connection I saw was maybe Pilgrim s use of this way of thinking as a way of keeping calm during tragedy  This is one of those books that you had to read to graduate from high school or college and somehow I never did  I liked this book and thought it was enjoyable  As a history person I enjoyed reading about WWII Europe and the Dresden bombings and Vonnegut shows the impact war has on young soldiers through the flashbacks and character s behavior throughout the book  The writing style was interesting and I liked the way it jumped around to different time periods  It was funny at times  but overall just hard to follow and the visits to Tralfamadore were beyong me  I didn t realize Kurt Vonnegut survived the firebombings in Dresden and I m wondering how he would explain this book  Again  I wish I could give half stars  This would be a 2 1 2    Okay  10 3 11 and I totally change my mind about this book to 5 stars  It has certainly grown on me and I find myself thinking about it and talking about this book all the time  It is genious      7 16 12  I really did not like this as an audio book  Ethan Hawke s voice is fantastic but I just didn t get into it like I wanted to  I m sure I ll be reading it again next year    I thought this book was really unique and interesting  The beginning of this book was already unique  The book starts by explaining about the story  It is like the introduction and the author takes time telling his experience in Dredson and plans about the story in the first Chapter  The main story begins from the Second Chapter  The main character of the story is Billy Pilgrim who is a soldier and a survivor of the firebombing of Dredson  The novel is mainly about his life and the experience from the bombing of Dredson  As he talks about his life in the war  he travels through time but without any control  He doesn t know when he ll go to what period of his life  He also gets captured by aliens called the Tralfamadorians and is brought to a zoo in a planet called Tralfamadore where he makes love with a young actress  Montana Wildhack  He is thought as a mentally disordered man because of this time traveling and what he talks about the aliens  The novel jumps around to a different period of Billy s lifetime  He jumps back to the memorable times in the past and he also jumps to the future where he sees himself assassinated by Paul Lazzaro  Billy Pilgrim keeps on traveling through time in the story  Each paragraph talks about different lifetime and events he experienced  This confused me when I first started reading  I didn t get what period of time he was in and many events come one after another  which confused me a lot  But after few chapters I got the flow of his writing style  When I was used to it  it made me want to turn to the next page to know what it will happen next  At first  my reading pace was really slow but I finished the book really quickly after I was used to it and I enjoyed it very much This book is different from other books about wars  It doesn t really explain about the dredson bombing in details but the author mixes with fiction and tells the cruelty and the bad things about war and the bombing  It is written really casually which makes it easy to read  This book is not heavy like the other novels about war  In fact  it is somewhat humorous The author begins explaining about the story so that you know the general idea about the story and it ends as if he asks you how it was I give this book a rating of five stars  I really liked this book  It was unique and it made me want to read more and more  The time traveling journey of his life was interesting  I liked the way author mixed the facts and the reality and the fictions  By mixing fictions  it was easier for me to accept and understand about the bombing and the war  It entertained me and taught me at the same time unlike the other war novels where it is all sad and depressing  I would recommend this book to everyone  I think many people will enjoy reading it  Vonnegut is my new favorite author  He s funny  kind  innovative  wise  humble  He doesn t play with our emotions  you know  He lets us know right from the get go that a certain character is going to get executed   so we don t become all attached and then grieve when he s suddenly killed   we know exactly what s going to happen to him in  68 days   And I found myself laughing out loud when he brings Kilgore Trout into the book   Kilgore s such a fun character  I like how Vonnegut describes the idea of time on the planet Tralfmadore   time has no beginning or end or in between   it s not a series of moments stretched out in a line   every moment is right now  When Billy Pilgrim sees his first Tralfmadorian book  he sees a pattern in the symbols  and asks the Tralfamadorians about what he s seeing  One of the Tralfmadorians says      you re right  each clump of symbols is a brief  urgent message   describing a situation  a scene  We Tralfamadorians read them all at once  not one after the other  There isn t any particular relationship between all the messages  except that the author has chosen them carefully  so that  when seen all at once  they produce an image of life that is beautiful and surprising and deep  There is no beginning  no middle  no end  no suspense  no moral  no causes  no effects  What we love in our books are the depths of many marvelous moments seen all at one time Vonnegut  who himself was a prisoner of war in Dresden when it was bombed in WWII  describes very eloquently through his character Billy Pilgrim what Dresden looks like after the bombing  He makes the war and the bombing real for his readers  And I think that s exactly what he needed to do   If ever walking around a diary of quotes becomes fancy  just get your hands on Slaughterhouse five  Every sentence in the book is quote worthy  A tragicomic story based on Dresden Bombings  Slaughterhouse Five questions war propaganda  The form and content of the book outweigh each other  Vonnegut through his simpleton character Billy Pilgrim destroys the institution of war  Vonnegut truly has wielded power through his penmanship  Vonnegut puts it down straight   when men fight in wars  they don t understand they are fighting someone else s silly cause  It s a  Children s Crusade   A man s mind reduces to an ignorant child s on the battlefield  The consequences of the war is of little concern compared to the thrill that being in the battleground  killing the innocent many  brings to that silly child in him  It took me multiple readings to understand why Vonnegut uses this Christmas carol as the epigraph of the book  The cattle are lowingThe Baby awakes But the Little Lord JesusNo crying he makes In spite of the horrifying things going on around Billy Pilgrim  like little Lord Jesus  a clear reference to the child in us  makes no cry about it  An enlisted man has little escape from war  The only way he can escape from war is to let Darwinism rein and go on his indiscriminate massacre  It s heart wrenching to think of it  Really  a soldier is the most pitiable soul on Earth  Vonnegut is right when he describes a hapless soldier as a filthy flamingo  A beautiful flamingo has nowhere else to fish but in a cess pool filled with megalomaniacs  The most trance moment of the book to me  was where Vonnegut writes about Billy watching a Second World War movie  That s just the plain truth of it all  I love this book for the utter hopelessness it has expressed in war  Vonnegut sums it up aptly in these lines  Everything is supposed to be very quiet after a massacre  and it always is  except for the birds  And what do the birds say  All there is to say about a massacre  things like  Poo tee tweet  So it goes   One of my personal favorites  Slaughterhouse 5 is probably one of the great English novels of the last century  and definitely one of the great anti war novels of recent memory  Quirky  darkly humorous  and wittily written  the novel is incredibly entertaining  yet there is an undercurrent of profound sadness to the whole piece that s unparalleled in anything I ve read  Too bad the average person probably assumes it s a horror novel based on the title   It s incredible that a story that ostensibly deals with time travel and life in an alien zoo can feel like such a frank  intensely personal window into the author s soul  It s clear that his experiences in the war  particularly Dresden  profoundly affected Vonnegut  and knowing that the protagonist is basically a thinly veiled stand in for the author  the whole novel reads like a friend trying to laugh at his own misery to keep from crying   So it goes    this simple refrain from the novel sums up so much of the brilliance of Vonnegut s writing  capturing in three simple words the depressing  comical  inevitability of human existence  Life is sometimes horrible  often absurd  and occasionally beautiful  but it always is what it is   so it goes   Kurt Vonnegut s 1969 novel remains one of the most important in the second half of 20th Century American Literature  It is the story of Billy Pilgrim  a WWII veteran  optometrist  and unbeknownst to all but him  a time traveler who travels throughout different moments of his life and to the alien world of Tralfamadore  where he is displayed in a zoo with former porn star Montana Wildhack  The way the novel presents Billy Pilgrim s life is relatively non linear  with lots of flashbacks and flash forwards as Billy Pilgrim travels through his life  Vonnegut keeps the war parts of the novel linear as an emphasis to its importance to the book s plot  This interesting narrative is what makes Vonnegut s book so interesting in structure  we are able to pick up fragments of Pilgrim s life as we go through  as if we were reading at random pages from his biography  We feel as if we are unstuck in Billy s life as he is  Though Vonnegut puts his bizzare imagination wonderfully to work in many of the book s science fiction sections  it is his depictions of the hopelessness and depression of war  both during and afterwards  that makes this such a compelling novel  We get the feeling that Billy is part of a much larger piece  a piece of an entire generation confused and disillusioned by the horrors witnessed in the Second World War  Pilgrim serves almost as an ambassador of this generation  a model of the destruction of warfare on the psyche  Billy Pilgrim himself does develop more as not just a representation  his character is not left to dull abstractions but develops fully as an original and compelling force  We feel sympathy and love for Billy  an idealistic hero but an unusual one nevertheless  It is obvious after reading this novel that Vonnegut based it off his own experiences  he like Billy was captured in The Battle of The Bulge and survived the apocalyptic Bombing of Dresden  These experiences are completely original and add to the originality and gritty realism of the novel In conclusion  Slaughterhouse Five combines elements of realism and science fiction perfectly  making them work dualistically  They both work well to indicate the anti war sentiments of the writer and both work to represent the disillusioned veterans of World War II  written in a timely fashion as The Vietnam War was in full swing  Billy Pilgrim is no doubt an icon of American literature and no doubt one of the key fictional opponents of warmongers and destruction as a whole  This was my introduction to Vonnegut  and I m hella fucking pleased to meet him  I ve heard lots of good things about his work inside and outside of class  I ve seen the guy interviewed on Jon Stewart  and now I can gladly say that I ve finally read what s widely considered one of his best  and most beloved  books   and I will be reading another one very soon  This edition is awesome  by the way  The red and yellow cover is bold  jumpy and exciting  the layout is fresh  and font and illustrations are just the right size  and perfect for the pace Vonnegut is clearly a Master Storyteller   smart  witty  humorous  humanistic  and yet larger than life  To me  he s kind of like that favorite old uncle   the one that everyone wants to sit and listen to for hours after a family dinner  or that brash old timey professor   going on an eloquent rant about the war days and brilliant nonsense over cheap drinks at a dive bar near campus  His style is ingeniously simple   easy to read  but impossible to forget The first chapter was kind of like a handshake with the author  and his old glove narration   the strong presence of which are felt  welcomingly  throughout the story  Vonnegut has FANTASTIC characters throughout this book  I love them  Not just Billy  but Paul Lazzaro  Roland Weary  Edgar Derby  the dying Colonel  Wild Bob  from Wyoming  and the English Officers   Pilgrim s wife Valencia Merble Pilgrim and his daughter Barbara  Mary and Bernard V  O Hare  and of course  Montana Wildhack  Kilgore Trout  and the Tralfamadorians  There s so much going on here  and he makes it all work together Vonnegut bounces you around in time and space  frequently  with the main character  Billy Pilgrim  more on that inside the book   But the timing is always perfect  and not exactly what you d expect  He swirls lighthearted humor right into the gore of war  and he uses sci fi to illustrate the human condition  This book just kicks ass  alright   I m obviously not going to talk too much about the plot here  I m sure there s plenty of that out there   and the book is fraught with little literary gems  so here are some totally random things that I happened to like  The word I should have known but didn t   Fibbertigibbet   http   www merriam webster com dictio     pg  36  Billy Pilgrim was quite the dresser during the war  he rocked silver boots and a Toga  later in Dresden   but I laughed out loud when Vonnegut said       he was going bald  Wind and cold and violent exercise had turned his face crimson  He didn t look like a soldier at all  He looked like a filthy flamingo    pg 42   Hahaha  I ve totally seen this guy drinking forties and smoking rollies along the train tracks in Redwood City  Trying to decide on a religion  Billy Pilgrim s mom brought home an  extremely gruesome crucifix       like so many other Americans  she was trying to construct a life that made sense from things she found in gift shops  And the crucifix went up on wall      pg 49   His father had taken out a pocket watch  The watch had a radium dial   pg  114     there were more starving Russians with faces like radium dials  pg  115  The monograph of Howard W  Campbell  concerning how America treats its poor  and how they treat themselves  I LOVED IT      Every other nation has folk traditions of men who were poor but extremely wise and virtuous  and therefore more estimable than anyone with power and gold  No such tales are told by the American poor  They mock themselves and glorify their better    They do not love one another because they do not love themselves  Once this is understood  the disagreeable behavior of American enlisted men in German prisons ceases to be a mystery   When Valencia crashed the Cadillac   The gaping trunk looked like the mouth a village idiot who was explaining the he didn t know anything about anything   At the Royalton Hotel in NYC   Billy now leaned over that parapet  looked down at all the people moving hither and yon  They were jerky little scissors  They were a lot of fun    It s already ten o  clock at night  and it s Sunday  I have squandered my weekends playing and sleeping  There is a pile of homework  which I am supposed to finish by the next morning  and there are tests coming up  So far  nothing accomplished  After a few desperate hours of meaningless struggle  I scream   I want to go back in time   That s exactly what Billy Pilgrim is capable of in Slaughter House Five  The book begins   Listen  Billy Pilgrim has become unstuck in time  and the story  itself becomes unstuck in time  jumping over the present to the past  and back to the future following Billy s adventure  Once Billy is a soldier in Dresden  and seconds later  he is a wealthy optometrist  In the next page  however  he is a zoo animal who is displayed to a throng of aliens  I have read a few Second World War books and heard of several time traveling stories  but so far  Slaughter House Five is the best book I have ever encountered in both genres and the most shocking  This was my first Vonnegut story and considering that I have never heard of him before  I fell in love with the book drastically  I started the book without thinking much  I was forced to read it as school literature homework  To be honest  the only reason I chose the book was because it was one of the shortest stories in the piles of other recommended novels  However  as I flipped over pages  I realized Vonnegut is a great storyteller  His sentences are easy  yet stunning and the ideas were very fresh  The organization seemed a bit chaotic at first  and the transition was hard to follow in some places  but those things became charming while I was reading the book  Vonnegut definitely has a power to carry on a story  One of the things that makes this story lively  is ironically  its frail character  Billy Pilgrim  I have never seen anyone who is more out of place than Billy Pilgrim is in the war  In the first place  he is the most unremarkable and unwilling protagonist I have ever read about  He is a burlesque clown of the war and  the clown of the book  Yet  his clumsiness and blankness makes him an attractive and adorable character  Billy is a very unique figure  as he never resists or struggles against anything that s happening to him  and thus Billy fighting the war becomes the biggest paradox  Via Billy s daily life during the war  Vonnegut reflects on his personal experience as a prisoner of the war and successfully illustrates the war s devastating and chaotic consequences I found myself attached to Billy Pilgrim more and more throughout his adventure  He is a powerless creature and can t do anything while the world is moving and the time  passing  There I could feel affinity since I myself can t do anything against the overwhelming flow of time passing  Billy s ability is not to go back to the time and fix the things as he ventures  He was assigned to be conscious of all the time span of his life and patiently observe and accept anything he experiences along the different time period  The time traveling might even be a disadvantage to him  since he has to know everything and endure  yet can t do anything about it  Thus  his attitude of trying to ignore the bad parts of life become convincing  Actually many people try to live on while forgetting the bad or embarrassing experiences  Billy s philosophy is one very realistic and common idea  He is a friendlier character than the super heroes in a sense  When I was reading other time traveling stories  the protagonists always struggle to save the world or change the fate out of good will and responsibility  Billy doesn t have one  He doesn t ever struggle because he knows he can t do anything  It s a sad reality yet appealing  People can find proxy satisfaction out of the super heroes  But  from Billy  we can face a harsh yet wonderful reality of life  That s what made the book so very intense and attractive despite the series of betrayal of anticipation  It s nothing like I have expected out of cliche science fiction involving time traveling and war  I can only say this about the book  It s a Must Read  Scattered  that s the word that comes to mind when you first reads Kurt Vonnegut s widely regarded magnum opus  Slaughterhouse Five  If you ve read a summary of this book without reading about Vonnegut first  you d think he was insane  it is the story of a former soldier turned optometrist who travels through time and is abducted by aliens later in his life  hardly a marketable plot line  This was however  the late 60s when it was published  the point where American drug counterculture had reached a head  to the indulger  the various peculiarities of the writing would make all the sense in the world  The book focuses around Billy Pilgrim  a chaplain s assistant in the European Theater of WWII  During this period  he becomes what he calls  unstuck in time   and begins to travel through time unexpectedly and to random points in his lifetime  including his own assassination at the hands of a fellow soldier in 1976  Vonnegut s description of the character allows the reader to find him a simultaneously likable and pitiful figure  something I usually don t get from books  His almost childish wonder and naivete towards almost everything during his time spent in the war and his unrelenting kindness towards others  even if they are cruel to him  He is a weakling and fatalist however  and is less soldier material and more cannon fodder  providing a yin to the yang of the my fondness for Billy  I usually have a singular feeling for characters in books  but Vonnegut manages to mold the words enough so that a multitude of thoughts got stuck to Billy instead  What impressed me most about the book was the way he used language in the book  something a lot of writers fail to do right  Black humor is a mainstay of the story  especially during the sections when Billy re visits the war  The book is also a work of metafiction  a style of writing that points out the devices to expose the illusion of fiction  The most glaring example of this would be the first chapter of the book  where the author illustrates why he wrote the book in the first place  Another would be Billy s reading of The Valley of the Dolls while imprisoned on Trafalmadore and repeatedly alludes to both fictional  those written by Kilgore Trout  and real life novels  Most notable of Vonnegut s literary devices however  is the three word refrain  So it goes   repeated a fat one hundred and sixteen times in the novel  whenever life and death are discussed  the phrase puts in an appearance to underscore the fatalism the novel is built on  The nonchalant use of the phrase enhances the black humor of the book  giving a deliberately casual response to something that typically elicits a more frenzied response That however  is part of the novel that disturbed me  the fatalistic tone of it  Considering that this is a study of the individual s struggle past a world he doesn t belong in  fatalism is hardly a fitting component of the formula  With the main character s belief that every action a person takes is preordained  leaving no room for changes to be made  it essentially negates the entire concept of conflict within the story  While it doesn t detract much from the novel  it lingers unpleasantly in the mind like a wad of chewing gum that s been spit out on the street  Classic  that is the word most associated with this novel  Kurt Vonnegut reached his literary peak with the completion of this work  combining everything that he had done before in his earlier works and giving it a fresh coat of paint  His frank  evocative descriptions of the characters and their various nuances  as well as his disjointed approach to feeding the reader the plot all serve to make the book a highly enjoyable read  While not immediately accessible due to its deliberately convoluted plot  it is a highly recommended novel for those with tastes in the more eclectic styles of literature  This book has been marketed a classic  and upon cracking it open I confess I didn t see how it could be one  It was my first Vonnegut  Bizarre and often surreal as it was  however  Billy Pilgrim s story gradually grew on me and I ended up really liking the book  Slaughterhouse Five is a thinly veiled criticism of war   it is loosely based on Vonnegut s own experiences in the Dresden bombings   but takes it beyond the confines of space and time as it flashes back and forth between narrators  history  characters  memories  imagined situations  and locations  It s absurd  eccentric  clever  and sardonic  Here Vonnegut clearly shows that he deserves a genre of his own   the narrative style is unlike anything I ve ever read before  with its short  repetitive  matter of fact sentences and lack of general setting   but this just enriches the reading experience and serves to drive Vonnegut s points home  Slaughterhouse Five made me want to read more of Vonnegut s work and I have done so since  some characters from his other novels  such as Kilgore Trout  make cameo appearances in this novel   Hopefully del Toro s film version does it justice So it goes  Slaughterhouse Five by Kurt Vonnegut is often considered one of the greatest books written in the English language  There is no doubt in my mind that this is a excellent book  The main thing that makes this novel so grand is something that we are lacking nowadays  originality  Imagination  freshness  creativity  all of these things are very rare to find in modern entertainment  Slaughterhouse Five is a story that stands out  It focuses on a character named Billy Pilgrim who is  unstuck  in time  That is to say  he unwillingly travels to different points in time of his life in no chronological order  sort of  hopping haphazardly through time   Each point of his life defines a certain period and story  Now  time travel is a very difficult subject because it is very easy to make a mistake  You must establish rules to the time travel for the reader to understand  However  each point in time to which Billy travels is individual and doesn t exactly link up to the others  with a few minor exceptions   Because of this  the author made it clear that each point in time is on its own and is its own story  Each  story  comes with its own fitting tone  pacing  symbolism  and dialogue  Upon reading this  I could tell that Kurt Vonnegut took a lot of time to craft the dialogue for his characters because it is as close to perfection as it can be  Each character is believable  has their own morals  and has their own personalities  This is also an example of one of the most interesting devices of character development in literature  Billy Pilgrim s character is slightly different within each  story  and it is up to the reader to put the pieces together to see the full puzzle  Nothing seems slap dash or careless in this novel  Also  the repetitive use of  So it goes  is a simple and effective means of transitioning between topics  There is dark humor a plenty and interesting characters throughout  including some very intriguing aliens   This is another love it or hate it novel  Personally  I thoroughly enjoyed it  A book that I highly recommend and one that is well worth reading  Slaughterhouse Five is an anti war novel focused on the bombing of Dresden during World War II  It follows a solider  Billy Pilgrim  who can travel through times in his life and is abducted by Tralfamadorians  aliens from the planet Tralfamadore Personally  I am not a huge fan of science fiction or aliens in general  so I was more than a little hesitant to pick this one up  However  my friend promised me that it was good and that I would love it  so I tried it out  I m glad that I did  because it has opened up my views on science fiction novels  It was beautifully written and was hard to put down  You could travel through all aspects of his life and fall in love with every time period  wanting to read more and more about it  Even the parts with aliens were good and almost believable    he didn t make things seem entirely crazy  something that is hard to do when writing about aliens  If anything  it was filled with beautiful quotes and ways to look at life that I d certainly never thought of before Over all  this book was very enjoyable and I look forward to reading more of Vonnegut s works  A book that will grip you  excite you  make you feel guilty  A book that wil make you want to cry  but you can t   make you want to laugh  but you won t   A book you will be glad you read though you ll walk around in a fog for a good while after  if you believe in time  that is   So it goes Not recommended for beach reading  which for some reason was my initial intent  Slaughterhouse Five tells the story of Billy Pilgrim who is unstuck in time  We get to experience the highs and lows  the dulls and the disasters  of an American life through the lens of World War II and the bombing of Dresden Vonegut is a master of scene making  You will neither be confused nor off put but the constant jumping around  at least not once you realize it s constant   You will feel every scene  yet remember few of them distinctly  which is a rather unique experience that comes from this type of writing of using so many scenes to weave a tapestry As an anti war book  Slaughterhouse Five is a masterpiece  And depending on your prejudice  it is either a fun    sci fi trip  or a startling comment on the ability of the human mind to invent and rationalize and justify away the horrible memories that haunt us  Like a bird tweeting over a barren field after the fires have stopped And as an added bonus  you ll get snippets of cool stories by fictional author Kilgore Trout that I absolutely would read if they were only real For what it s worth  Read this book  and be ready for it when you do  A masterpiece of literary fiction and historical commentary  An undisputed must read for those enthralled by the power and pageantry of war  I really enjoyed Slaughterhouse Five  It is one of the more interesting books I have read in the last few months  It is similar to Tim O Brien s The Things They Carried simply because it straddles the line between fiction and memoir  There are times in the novel when the narrator mentions his presence in the aforementioned scene  saying something like  That was me   or  I was that man   I automatically assumed that the narrator was  in fact  Kurt Vonnegut because his literary voice is so richly developed in this novel that I could not imagine it being one of a fictionalized character  Please be aware that Vonnegut s style is unconventional as his main character time travels and visits another planet where he is put on display like a caged zoo animal  However  I never once felt disengaged or unimpressed by Vonnegut s description or the novel s turn of events  I would recommend Slaughterhouse Five to any open minded individual looking for an interesting literary journey   Beginning Slaughterhouse Five was an interesting experience  For the first at least thirty pages  I was just trying to figure out exactly what I was reading  It was hard to discover where I was in Billy Pilgrim s life  whether or not I was actually supposed to consider Billy Pilgrim or the narrator the main character  etc  But as the book continued  I began to understand the writing style more and more As soon as the Tralfamadorians were introduced and explained  I began to understand how I was supposed to  read  and perceive the entire text  The Tralfamadorians live on a fourth dimensional planet  which means that they don t see time as linear  They see every moment that ever happened all at once  They see the beginning and the end of the world  and every moment in between  They just choose to experience the moments they like the best After I understood this  I understood a lot about this book  The entire book was written in the same way that the Tralfamadorians see time  the book leaps from moment to moment in Billy s life and slowly  you begin to unravel the story of his life I thought this book was moving  in a very subtle way  The language was beautiful  but concise  A lot was said with very few words  I think that Kurt Vonnegut crafted his language incredibly  Vonnegut is very  very good in his use of motifs  there were a lot of recurring themes  Some occurred quite frequently   So it goes    and others  not so much One of my least  and most favorite things about this book was simply how bluntly it was written  In ways  I hated it because I wanted to feel it more or experience it more  But then  I realized that that was exactly the point  There was no other way it could have possibly been written  If the language was any more elaborate  it would have been overdone  or too dramatic  If it had a more subtle use of language  there would be too much left to be desired This book was written perfectly  I love Vonnegut s books and writing style  but if you ve never read anything by him  this is probably not the place to start  This book is very disconnected  which is usual for him  but this amps the non linearity to a different level than a typical Vonnegut book  I understand his style  in many ways it reflects my own thought patterns  the random jumps between thoughts  It especially makes sense for this story of Billy Pilgrim Billy is unstuck in time  so the reader follows him through adulthood  His entire adulthood revolves around his time in Germany during World War II  especially his experiences in Dresden  Throughout this all  you know that Billy s experiences reflect Vonnegut s own  as he tells you before you ever begin reading Billy s story  Mixed in his war story  are the parts of the rest of his life   his marriage  his work  his recovery  before and after the war  his abduction and display by aliens  and his return to Earth  Billy always seems to get  unstuck  in time during traumatic events  At first it seems absurd and slightly unhinged  but as you go along  there are real connections between each storyline that play out and make sense in light of Vonnegut s first  introductory chapter Overall  this book is what you make of it  It is science fiction  memoir  or satire  absurd  dramatic  or traumatizing  your pick   Billy Pilgrim goes through a war  gets put through abuisive acts by the nazi soilders of world war 2  sees the dehumanizing effects of the bombing of Dredsen  abucted by aliens and is taken back to the aliens home planet  tralfamadore  and in the end is assasinated  Kurt Vonnegut jr s  slaughterhouse five  follows the character Billy Pilgrim who is unstuck in time meaning he jumps through random events in his life leading up to the fire bombing of Dredsen  Billy has quite an adventorus yet haunting life  Billy is constantlly abused and tooken advantedge of by many characters in the book and wrongly accused of a soilders death leading the sadistic Paul Lazzaro to set up pilgrim s assasination  I personally believe  Slaughterhouse five  is about revenge  If you look at all the images that slightly resemble it you can see it too  Paul Lazzaro kills the dog that bit him and kills Billy Pilgrim for wronging him  Weary punishes Billy for almost getting them killed  The Germans bully Weary for being on the wrong side of war  And shoot Edgar Derby for the same  The real villians of  Slaughterhouse five  is the officers who ordered the bombing of Dredsen  Vonnegut geniously uses the phrase  so it goes  after every mention of death in the novel whice futher adds on deaths inevitibility  I still don t fully understand  slaughterhouse five  but i dont believe that many people actually do  But in the end  I think Vonnegut s  slaughterhouse five  is a beautifully written book and is very unique  Slachthof Funf was engaging  drawing me into a realm of fantasy historical fiction that was both philosophy and comedy  There s much that I would like to say on the topic of KV s philosophy  but I know it would ruin it for some of you  so I ll be cryptic   When you too get unstuck and see our celestial home as a crystal  unmoving yet full of life  you ve seen something that you can t unsee  It s like gazing into lifeful paintings at a museum  appreciating that vivacity of the canvases  inhabitants  Logically  you may tell yourself many of the paintees are no longer living  yet their life has been captured in cyrillic and oil and paper  and they seem meaningful in that they lived  Only now  you re at a museum where the subject is you  and your family  and everyone you know and everyone you don t  When you get unstuck  the beauty and meaning of your own existence washes over you like a newfound sense of purpose and appreciation  So go read the book  get unstuck  and most importantly  appreciate  More than any of the other classic Vonnegut books that I ve been taking the time to re read  I was the most curious   anxious to get to Slaughterhouse Five  It is one of the most important novels to me personally that I ve ever read  I first read it 13 years ago  in the midst of the mind expanding years of college  and it had a profound effect on me in a lot of ways  And now  well into mind numbing years of adulthood  I wasn t sure what my reaction would be  I m pleased to say that this book hasn t lost a bit of its magic  and is still as imaginative and wonderful to me as ever  It remains a potent statement on the absurdity of war  and a satiric exposition of the fragility of human character  One aspect I m really able to appreciate now  one that I really didn t before  is how brave Kurt Vonnegut is here  He brings us all along with him as he faces his demons  demons so horrifying  and demons that fortunately  few people will ever have to meet  He bares his soul  but not in a way that asks for pity  but rather challenges us to become better  I didn t think that I could respect Vonnegut any more than I already did  but the passing of time brings new perspectives  and thankfully  new surprises  Kurt Vonnegut writes a harrowing fictionalized tale of his experience in WWII  It is quintessential Vonnegut in that simplistic prose is used as the vehicle to deliver crushing blows to our troubled social consciousness  The protagonist  Billy Pilgrim  is abducted by aliens who are incomparably more advanced than the human they abduct  He is treated more or less like a curious child would a queer bug  could they communicate  of course  They teach Billy to perceive his lifespan through the fourth dimension which can be viewed along a continuous spectrum like one can view the depth of a dresser drawer seeing both the front and the back  or beginning and end  simultaneously  One of the lessons to be drawn from this  Billy discovers  is that free will is entirely a fabrication of earthlings and cannot be a true feature of the natural world  because if he was able to alter any designed action in realtime it would impossibly alter his past  present  and future  It would warp the shape of the dresser drawer rendering it useless and arbitrary  A book by the notorious fictional science fiction author  Kilgore Trout  emphasizes this fact in a book of his on time travel  In it a man travels back in time to find Jesus as a 12 year old working in his father s carpentry shop   Vonnegut conveniently illustrates his genius here by introducing a parable of Jesus albeit invented into this spiritual desert of a book   One day  Two Roman soldiers came into the shop with a mechanical drawing on papyrus of a device they wanted built by sunrise the next morning  It was a cross to be used in the execution of a rabble rouser  Jesus and his father built it  They were glad to have the work  And the rabble rouser was executed on it   So  Billy explains  in the end everything is all right  and everybody has to do what he does  One of the commentaries Vonnegut puts forward is the complex relationship between war veterans and society  Is Billy s pilgrimage into human society through the message he tries to deliver a twisted mental construction designed to make sense of the atrocities of war or are the limitations of human consciousness too profound to ever be able to stop the onslaught that is cruelty and warfare   Slaughterhouse Five is a classic  fictional American novel by Kurt Vonnegut  It was once banned  and I do not recommend it to sensitive readers Slaughterhouse Five is partially a memoir  The author really was survivor of the firebombing of Dresden  Germany while he was a prisoner of war in World War II  The main character in his novel is an alter ego of the author who is named Billy Pilgrim  He was traumatized by World War II  and he split his head in a plane crash in the 1960s  Billy Pilgrim becomes unstuck in time  and travels to moments and memories from both the past  present  and the future  Billy claims to have traveled in time to a zoo on a planet called Tralfamadore  where he learns that death does not exist  and things are always living in another time  or another universe  But is he really seeing Tralfamadore  or is he just insane I really enjoyed Kurt Vonnegut s writing style  He does not go into a long  dramatic explanation of things  but instead his writing style flows  and he explains the basic idea of what s going on very casually I would not recommend this book to a high school  or sensitive readers  I was surprised at the content in the book  There is profanity in multiple spots throughout the book  and a little bit of sexual content  but disregarding this  it was a very enjoyable book  and I d recommend it to anyone who wants to enjoy a book that is very humorous  has well developed characters  and that doesn t take very long to finish  Vonnegut is probably my favorite contemporary author  I think it s a combination of his world view  which I generally happen to share  and his writing style  conversational   easy to read  Essentially  good ideas expressed economically  Rereading Slaughterhouse Five  maybe for the first time in twenty five years  I kept highlighting passages that struck me as beautifully written  keenly observed or otherwise noteworthy  A few that struck me   They had both found life meaningless  partly because of what they had seen in war   So they were trying to re invent themselves and their universe  Science fiction was a big help   Another time Billy heard Rosewater say to a psychiatrist   I think you guys are going to have to come up with a lot of wonderful new lies  or people just aren t going to want to go on living   That s one thing Earthlings might learn to do  if they tried hard enough  Ignore the awful times  and concentrate on the good ones   America is the wealthiest nation on Earth  but its people are mainly poor  and poor Americans are urged to hate themselves   Every other nation has folk traditions of men who were poor but extremely wise and virtuous  and therefore more estimable than anyone with power and gold  No such tales are told by the American poor  They mock themselves and glorify their betters   There are almost no characters in this story  and almost no dramatic confrontations  because most of the people in it are so sick and so much the listless playthings of enormous forces  One of the main effects of war  after all  is that people are discouraged from being characters   The window reflected the news  It was about power and sports and anger and death  So it goes  Excerpts From  Vonnegut  Kurt   Slaughterhouse Five   Dial Press  2009  iBooks  This material may be protected by copyright Check out this book on the iBooks Store  https   itunes apple com WebObjects M     What s that book about   he asked  World War II and aliens   my English teacher replied If that is not an accurate summary  I don t know what is  As my first  but definitely not last  exposure to Vonnegut  I had no idea what I was in for  Before reading this  I thought   war isn t funny   but that was challenged quite a bit throughout the text of this novel  Of course  war isn t any less tragic or vile  but it has its amusing moments as well Billy Pilgrim is insane  or so his daughter thinks  In fact  he is merely  unstuck in time   a state that few other than himself can understand  The novel flashes between periods in Billy s life  chronicling not only his time serving in WWII and the bombing of Dresden  but also his marriage  his children  his trip to a mental hospital  and even his abduction by aliens  The life of Billy Pilgrim is winding and muddled  rarely possessing logical order  but within it  a new perspective on life is held  I haven t changed my perception of time in the name of science  but it may be swayed by a little fiction  So it goes   What makes a novel  great   I don t have the slightest idea  really  To give one definition is unfair  There comes a time when you go through a certain hardback book  or a paperback  or a kindle version  and suddenly it occurs to you  this is different  It s a little surprising at first  for many books have come before  and none have bothered you quite like this  It s almost like being in love  You can t put your finger on it  but you just know   this one may be a keeper   Often times this feeling dissipates  and by the end you re no longer impressed  and just want to move on  Then there comes that book that doesn t weaken in spirit  It remains with you  and despite the arguable imperfections  you don t want to change a single thing about this experience  this source of pleasure and inspiration  That description only scrapes the surface of my feelings  or rather my reverence  regarding  Slaughterhouse Five   I remember reading it  and having such feelings  during August of 2010  It only took my three days to read it  Twice  I ve read it maybe two or three more times since then  It s incredibly easy reading  and very compelling   So it goes  has long been a part of my vernacular I haven t even talked about the novel itself yet  but why spoil it  People call it a war story  but it s so much more than that  It s about control  or rather a lack of  It s about survival and the irony evoked from doing so  Ultimately  it is about the necessity of connecting to a greater power  People often think that they have control  that they can be masters of their destinies  but what happens when even that assurance is gone  What happens when you already know the end right from the beginning  and you constantly fluctuate without any sense of guidance  Vonnegut fearlessly attempts to explore this question  The time traveling is a literal sense of timelessness that can overcome us  and it s his science fiction way to convey the confusion that comes when we are lost  and the road is unknown and outright scary  That s life  whether people like it or not  Yet the novel still manages cohesion within its lack of  No scenes are by accident  no details wasted  It s as funny as it is poignant  and I admit to tearing up a little during the end of the penultimate chapter It ends quietly  but I cannot blame Vonnegut for making it so  His attempt has long been accomplished  and I feel satisfied every time with the whole of the tumultuous  titillating voyage  I haven t met many who have shared the same sentiments as me  but I m not worried  When you feel confident with your choice of  favorite novel   you shouldn t be afraid to embrace it  Are there better books out there  To others  it s likely  and maybe I ll agree with them from time to time  Yet I have a good feeling  driven by faith of all things  that no matter how many books I plough through during the next couple years or even decades  I just might end up coming back to  Slaughterhouse Five  from time to time  That s how you know you ve found true love I guess as time causes all other things in life to twist  distort  and deteriorate  it alone survives  Full review at http   www atgreviews net 2015 12 von   Slaughterhouse Five is an autobiographical science fiction novel by Kurt Vonnegut  The meshing of these two genres along with Vonnegut s trademark dark humor makes this novel one of the author s most powerful stories Slaughterhouse Five has spawned a number of classic phrases and expressions such as  poo tee weet   an expression said by birds in the novel that has come to represent the lack of intelligent dialogue that could ever be said about war   So it goes   is another Vonnegut phrase that is associated with this book  as that expression is used after every single death  whether it be physical or metaphorical  in the novel Besides its cultural impact  Slaughterhouse Five contains profound wisdom and haunting real life experiences that give readers insight to the horrors of war  The book also combines two genres that seemingly have nothing to do with one another  science fiction and autobiography  in a way that has a profound emotional impact on readers  Slaughterhouse Five is not just a great science fiction book  it is one of the greatest

 merak ettiklerinizi arastirmayacaksaniz ki merak edecek onlarca yeni sey veriyor hic okumayan  Merak edilecek seyleri anlayamayacaksiniz  tum bunlari bos verin  Poo tee weet  This book should replace the Bible Kurt Vonnegut has an extraordinarily abstract mind  and it takes a similar person to follow this story  If your one that likes a traditional storyline with a start  middle  and an end  then this is not the book for you  Instead this book jumps all over the place from past to present  to future  to alien worlds  to World War II   In a sense  Vonnegut invented a new novelistic genre  combining fantasy with realism  touched by fictionalized memoir  penned in a comedic mode as horror is overtaken by a kind of fatalistic yet humorous view of life  Only Vonnegut could make such a strange premise believable and emotional  The book shifts time and place from paragraph to paragraph without warning  It all works so perfectly  however and is so profound to those who read carefully  Billy Pilgrim is one of the great characters in all of literature This masterpiece which satarizes just about every element of human life truly magnifies Vonnegut s power  However bleak and disparing the messages are  this book should be read by every creature earth and beyond Bottom line  read this without preconceptions and read it without regard to the usual constraints  Just let it flow and accept it for what it is  a juxtaposition of several genres  a tale of fiction  that   as fiction should    transcends time and space Don t be scared off by aliens and the weird premise  It works better than 99  of so called  normal  books  Absolutely ESSENTIALWell it may not change your life but do yourself a favor and put this on your bucket reading list      so it goes  This is Vonnegut s book on the massacre at Dresden during the second world war   a book that took him twenty years to write This is a book about memory  identify  madness  death and the individual s response to war  It s wonderfully written and the characters are very well drawn The story focuses on a man called Billy Pilgrim an optometrist who is captured on his first day fighting  Unsuited to the hardships he faces   the forced marches  the transport around the country in cramped train cars  the cold and the hard work his brain refuses to accept the situation and instead concocts a lavish reality that involves time travelling aliens When Billy discusses books with the aliens  they respond that for them   There is no beginning  no middle  no end  no suspense  no moral  no causes  no effects  What we love in our books are the depths of many marvellous moments seen all at one time  The aliens see events as if they were insects trapped in amber   hardened  unchanging  forever preserved and frozen in time an idea that Billy clings to as he travels backwards and forwards through his memory trying to make sense of the war and the events in it  It is a weird  wonderful  horrifying  amazing  terrifying and brilliant book  It is perhaps the best thing I have ever read The first chapter  told from the writer s perspective  explains how he has tried for ages to write about his experiences in the fire bombing of the German city of Dresden  during the closing months of the Second World War  He has explained how he has failed to do this  and promises that his next book will be better  more fun  He then proceeds to tell the story of a man called Billy Pilgrim  who came unstuck in time  Billy Pilgrim  an American soldier  becomes a German prisoner of war and is sent to Dresden  All the while through the narrative he keeps finding himself at different times in his life  experiencing events both before and after the war  He sees his childhood  his later life as an optician optometrist  his marriage and family  his abduction by aliens called Tralfamadorians  his injury in a plane crash  his infatuation with the books of a science fiction writer named Kilgore Trout  and his eventual attempts to tell the world about his abduction by the alien Tralfamadorians Vonnegut s writing style is completely accessible   broad  clear sentences  simple enough for anyone to understand  possibly even children  He tells you what happens  no deception  no complex words  no nuanced sentences  He tells you how the characters feel  and why they feel that way  and he does this in as few words as possible   and whereas normally this would not work in a piece of fiction  somehow his broadness  his honesty  or something else  makes it work perfectly  It is therefore a nice short book  and you can read it very quickly  It took me under forty eight hours to finish it  very few books can keep me riveted for so much of my time  In total I put it down three times since I first opened it The subject matter of course is dark  In fact  it s one of the darkest books I have ever read  dealing not just with the actual horrors of total war  but with varying attitudes to said war when it s finally over  and when decades have passed  Vonnegut likens it to the Children s Crusade  which he outlines in chapter one  But there is a definite sense of humour in the telling  as though in the narrative he has an occasional grim  almost ironic chuckle every now and then  There are moments when I wasn t sure whether I should laugh or cry  or maybe both  and this weird juxtaposition kept me a little off balance as the bite sized prose drew me ever onwards  The only other of Vonnegut s works that I have read  Breakfast of Champions  which deals with consumerism and American society  also used this method  but more often than not with Breakfast of Champions I felt happier about laughing   I felt terrible about it  but it was still kind of funny  It was horribly funny  whereas Slaughterhouse 5 is funnily horrible  Maybe it s just that the topics in modern American society are inherently less dark than large scale massacres and war  and so the same methods have yielded very different results One of the main comedic elements is the insertion of the sci fi pulp fiction elements  with the abduction by the Tralfamadorians and brief plot synopsise of Kilgore Trout s books  and the reader s constant jerking around through time  Vonnegut mentioned at the beginning how hard it was for him to write about his experiences in Dresden  and this must be the weird method he used to get around that So this is it  then  Read this book  Get your hands on a copy of it somewhere  There is no excuse  I m recommending it  you can read it in a day  it s easy to read and understand  Read it  Just get those words and read them  I can also recommend Breakfast of Champions  if you want a follow up or something that isn t quite as bleak as hell  If it sounds like something you don t think you d like  then read it anyway  You might be surprised  People have tried to ban it  which is the mark of any good book  Just read it  from start to finish  and I can guarantee that you will be a better person for it   I first read this book back in the early 1990s  just after college  I remember now why I tore through the entire Vonnegut corpus in just a few months  The writing is brilliant  unique  and effortless  On nearly every page  something demands your attention  even as it comes across as a throwaway line   so it goes  In this novel  Vonnegut tells the  story  of Billy Pilgrim  who witnessed the Allied bombing of Dresden in WWII  and then returns home to be kidnapped by aliens and travel through time   or maybe returns simply to go insane  This is maybe the best anti war book ever written  in that there isn t a hint of preachiness  only the unmistakable message that the only sane response to an insane world is to go insane  In a world that shrugs off death and destruction with barely a notice  the only appropriate thing to do  it would seem  is to check out entirely  I have learned that it took Vonnegut more than 20 years to complete this book  a fact that he hints at early in the novel   and that fact itself speaks to the absurdity of it all   what can one really say about a massacre  The meaningless last word of the book   poo too weet   says it all  Much more here than I can convey briefly   even his offbeat commentary about religion require thought and more reflection than I am able to do right now  I picked up the book again because I wanted to observe closely the unorthodox narrative structure of the novel  but I leave with more questions than answers  This is one I will come back to again and again   Few authors can claim to have changed my life  but even fewer can make that claim on separate instances with different works  Kurt Vonnegut is one of the few  first with Breakfast of Champions   which flipped the whole notion on how you can tell a story on its head   then  again  with Slaughterhouse Five  I absolutely loved the novel and have so much to say about it  but I will limit that in lieu of those who may want to go into it  the story unspoiled Knowing this was based off of Vonnegut s real life experience made the jump into science fiction territory so surprising to me  Skimming the surface of the story gives you something akin to The Time Traveler s Wife  with the protagonist jumping through time all  willy nilly   That being said  however  I m still deciding how much of the story was truly science fiction  Were there actually aliens abducting the protagonist  or was this his way of coping with the horrible experiences he lived through  Was he really time travelling  or was Vonnegut saying that these moments stay with you  and you relive them all throughout your life Slaughterhouse Five is an absolutely unique piece of literature  I want to go out and recommend it to everyone I know  but I fear not everyone has the same capacity to appreciate a healthy dose of strangeness as I do  Why not start off my reviews with a classic  huh  In Kurt Vonnegut s  Slaughterhousse five  He tells the story of Billy Pilgrim and why He has become unstuck in time  The majority of the novel is based in WWII where Billy served as a soldier and was captured during the Battle of the Bulge  He then is taken prisoner to Dresden  However the story expands to Billy s entire life and the many events He has been through because  remember  He has come unstuck in time The book is written masterfully  Vonnegut is able to use black humor in a way that has you laughing at things all the while feeling guilty for laughing  This ability shines in Slaughterhouse five  It exposes the darkness associated with war making it comical in a way that isn t funny  It is far from being an inspirational novel about war  instead it s similar to a Bob Dylan song in that it accuses war to not only killing soldiers but killing their spirit  It s a chilling look at war with intense imagery and deep emotional struggles The other segments are written brilliantly as well  It ranges from Billy marrying a women because no one else would  to Billy being abducted by aliens and learning the true nature of time  It all adds up to bring home the point that Billy truly doesn t care about anything in his life  He shrugs off death and pushes away any family or friends  Billy gives an interesting and fresh view on time  and yet it leads him to closing himself off from those around him  It gives an insightful look into the psyche of the human after trauma All in all this book needs to be read  It will give you perspective on how traumatic war can be and ultimately how we should charish the relationships we have  Vonnegut is able to use this dark war novel to encourage us to be open with the ones we love  And it will keep you glued to the pages until the very end  You will not be let down by this one  As I sat down to pen this review  I found that I couldn t approach Kurt Vonnegut s Slaughterhouse Five without simultaneously considering Joseph Heller s earlier novel  Catch 22  both of which I read for the first time during the past few months  These novels have so much more in common than a hyphen followed by a number in the title  yet they remain worlds apart In Slaughterhouse Five  Vonnegut s flippant anti hero  Billy Pilgrim  flits about through time  revisiting the people and places that populated his tour of duty in WWII  leaving readers with a bitter taste their mouths for the relentless stupidity of war In truth  this could be the summary for either book  but Vonnegut s 1969 anti war novel is far more successful than Heller s attempt from eight years prior  Where Catch often feels forced and overwrought  Slaughterhouse is simply effortless  Each introduce us to flawed villains and heroes  but Vonnegut remembers to make them likeable  While Vonnegut employs humor as a spoonful of sugar  Heller uses a shovel  endlessly elbowing the reader in the gut  saying   Get it  Get it   This is to say nothing of Vonnegut s gift for brevity in Slaughterhouse  which leaves the reader wanting just a little more time with Billy Pilgrim rather than hoping against hope that Yosarian doesn t make it through the next dogfight alive  so it goes  All this  plus a healthy dose of theology and science fiction  I  for one  welcome our new Tralfamadorian overlords  thrown in for good measure So  forget Yosarian  Billy Pilgrim lives  Only one thing needs to be said about this book  for me  It s where I first learned about the Dresden firebombings and the horror of the concept of justified collateral damage Back in the 1960s and 1970s we weren t taught any of this stuff as part of modern history or philosophical thought at school  The concept that the  good guys  sometimes did unspeakably bad things  things a truly civilised society would never allow  in the name of stopping the greater evil was probably deemed too complex for impressionable minds  Ever since reading it  I think I actually saw the film first  but the book s what creates the lasting impression  I ve wondered exactly why was Kurt Vonnegut regarded as so dangerous by the American conservative establishment  Because he had the temerity to address big issues with humour  a sense of the absurd and in a distinctly two sided way  God forbid that anybody should ask if what s done in our name is actually right  Were the thousand bomber raids war crimes  Whether they were or not  and whether Bomber Harris should stand condemned  it s important that people ask themselves that question  This book made me ask myself  I wanted to read this book simply because it was one of the classics I d always heard about but somehow missed reading in school   Catch 22 and To Kill a Mockingbird are on that list too   Once I started reading it  I had a hard time putting it down  It s an easy read  and a difficult one all at once  well written but confusing  The time traveling that Billy Pilgrim does is however not at all confusing  and I can t express how impressive that is  his story is all over the place but always makes sense  And knowing that the author really experienced parts of this story makes it even more powerful  It gets confusing though when some characters seem both real and caricatured at the same time  or when Pilgrim s belief in alien abduction and time travel start melding with sci fi books he s read  or events that have happened to him  and it s never clear if he s truly experiencing time travel or if it s all some kind of post traumatic stress after his experiences in World War II  I have a feeling that  for the point Vonnegut was trying to make  it doesn t really matter I have to agree with those who say this isn t just an anti war novel  It is anti war  but it doesn t brow beat  and it seems to me to be more about the absurdity and cruelty of people in general  not just during wartime  To take the Tralfamadorians as an extension of humanity  they refuse to observe anything that upsets them  they only pay attention to times that are beautiful and happy  And in doing so  they refuse to stop the destruction of the universe  which is caused by one of their own  They know it will happen  and how  but they don t want to think about it  This idea can certainly be applied to war  and especially to World War II in more ways than one  but it can also be easily applied to anyone in everyday life I wish I d read this book in high school  but I m glad I read it now  There are some cases of swearing and sexuality  so I wouldn t recommend it to a younger audience  But otherwise  I recommend it   Este libro definitivamente llego a mi en un momento de mi vida en el que tengo la capacidad parcial de entender el objetivo del autor  A pesar de que se anuncia a si mismo como un libro anti guerra  no lo es tanto asi  Fundamentalmente trata acerca de la vida y la muerte  El personaje principal Billy es un hombre sin interes por vivir  sin embargo aprende a ser eterno  Interesante concepto  Creo que este es el primer libro que leo en el cual el personaje viaja a traves del tiempo de manera aleatoria  No explica como  y hasta cierto punto no se requiere de una explicacion  pero siembra en ti la duda de si estos pseudo viajes no son alucinaciones de una persona con un sindrome de stress post traumatico inmenso  Interesante concepto  La prosa es ligera y agradable  El autor tiene un sentido del humor oscuro  pero nunca pesado  Rei en momentos  y si hubiera sido mas descriptivo en otros  hubiera llorado  No es para todos  Y posiblemente cuando sea viejo y este mas vivido  vuelva a leerlo y lo entienda aun mas  De mis favoritos   Whenever I am inquired as to what my favorite book is  there is only one thing that arrives alone and gloriously to my mind  This novel  the sublime  Slaughterhouse Five  This isn t so much of a review as it is a retrospective reaction I read this work about 2 years ago for school and I can safely say it has changed the course of my life  How much  I don t know  Maybe it hasn t changed the path of my future by more than a few degrees  but it has definitely changed the lens of which I will experience it The style of Vonnegut alone inspires new critical thought and uncovered thinking  Through  Slaughterhouse Five  I was introduced to a truly unique thinker  and I became obsessed very fast  Honestly  I agree with only a few of the concrete arguments he makes upon the world  including religion and the human condition  It is impossible  however  not to assimilate with understanding the viewpoints he shares  I have so far continued on to read two more of his novels and I plan to finish most of his work by the end of college  I know that this book will continue to affect me for the rest of my life because it is what I define in my own terms as perfection  The novel does not concern merely the tale of Billy Pilgrim and some thematic topic  but the concepts of life  space  and time I can t guarantee that everyone would share the same impact that I received from this powerful piece  but I can guarantee that it will impact you  should you read it with understanding  So it goes Although I am trapped in the amber of this moment  this will forever be my favorite  If I had to describe this book in one sentence  I would say it is a kind of a book that makes one appreciate the magnificent power of the written word  It has all the elements that make Vonnegut novels great   it is smart  irreverent  bare bone minimalistic  and incredibly funny  Yet  at the same time  it culminates in an unexpectedly profound and powerful anti war statement  I am pretty sure the book is a semi autobiographical account of Vonnegut s witnessing of the firebombing of Dresden during WW II  where 25 000 civilians were killed in a matter of several hours  What makes this book a masterpiece is the skill with which Vonnegut portrays the banality of evil and the comical nature of the human paradox  Here is the full title of the book  which is just about the perfect synopsis of the story   Slaughterhouse Five  or  The Children s Crusade  A Duty Dance with Death  by Kurt Vonnegut  Jr   a Fourth Generation German American Now Living in Easy Circumstances on Cape Cod  and Smoking Too Much  Who  as an American Infantry Scout Hors de Combat  as a Prisoner of War  Witnessed the Fire Bombing of Dresden  Germany  the Florence of the Elbe  a Long Time Ago  and Survived to Tell the Tale  This Is a Novel Somewhat in the Telegraphic Schizophrenic Manner of Tales of the Planet Tralfamadore  Where The Flying Saucers Come From  Peace   Book Review    English I 4 Austin ElwellA Slaughterhouse Five  By  Kurt VonnegutThis is a story about Billy Pilgrim  who gets unstuck in time  This means he hops from time to time in his life  Because of this  the setting is complicated  It takes place in the 1900 s  and it is in Ilium  New York  and in Europe  during WWII Billy Pilgrim is a soldier  Optometrist  husband  and father  He was born in 1922 to a barber  He grew up studying Optometry and then joined the war  He has been taken prisoner by the Germans  and moved to Dresden  a town in Germany  and into building number 5 of a slaughterhouse  thus the title of the book  Slaughterhouse Five The reason Billy can time travel is because he got abducted by the Tralfamadorians  aliens with a different view  They think that every moment will be  has been  and is the way it is  They can look at any moment and stay in it  Basically  they do not live with every moment following the one before it Billy is married to a woman named Valencia  has a son Robert  and a daughter Barbara  He meets characters such as Edgar Derby  Poland Weary  Montana Wildhack  Kilgore Trout  Eliot Rosewater  and many more This book has so much more than I said  It is one of my favorite books  I recommend it to anyone that likes science fiction  crazy stories  or entertaining plots  This is not the edition that I read  I read the 25th anniversary edition  ASIN B0087X6WUO  which is oddly missing from the Goodreads search engine This edition has an introduction by Vonnegut  delectable for dubbing George Will an  owlish nitwit  for smearing his book as a trivialization of the Holocaust I returned to it because it was on my personal  bet your life not high school  reading list in my teens  and never got around to it I m sure Vonnegut was trying to be experimental in hopping around in the story line and in telling from various perspectives  but this I accepted  much the way one accepts a friend s nervous tic  More insightful than these techniques were the devices that exposed the way people elaborately construct fictions of themselves  then spend a lifetime enlisting others to believe those fictions    a pathetic lifelong political campaign The relentlessly bloodthirsty firebombing of Dresden in four aerial assaults over February 13 15  1945  killing at least 25 000    mostly women  children  and old men    is told matter of factly  without shrillness  Vonnegut was a German prisoner of war there  miraculously spared by being held in the basement of a slaughterhouse  number 5   After such wholesale slaughter  what do you say in the face of death  Vonnegut  after every death cited in the novel    sometimes even the  death  of inanimate objects     says   So it goes   Interestingly  there is one exception  The death of one New York publisher does not get this treatment Read the book if you want some insight on how the world became numb to death after the murder of 262 million people  vide R J  Rummel  by governments in the last century  I loved this book  Sometimes in life  the right book comes along at the right time during the right circumstances and gives the right prescription for the right ailment This is my experience with Slaughterhouse Five What a relief it was to find Billy Pilgrim  another person who watches his life from the outside in  Watching Pilgrim watch his own life play out before him is not unlike my own experience  or the experiences of many human beings  I was riveted to this book from start to finish  and I regret having completed reading it  So it goes But I suppose that in the future  I will read and reread Slaughterhouse Five and glean wisdom from it every time   not unlike Billy Pilgrim s constant reliving of his own life  To call this a book about war is too narrow  although it may have very well began as such  This is a book about the human condition and ability that we all have to conduct our lives like Oz  pulling levers behind the curtain of our flesh  Fantastic book   The most amazing aspect of the book is  in my opinion  the general conflict  The protagonist  in order to be a true patriot  must have the world revile him as a traitor  I am reminded of the dilemma of Judas  The whole Christian grace through Christ thing hinged on Jesus being crucified  and that part needed Judas to betray him  So Judas was put into the position of being able to Save the world  but in order to do so he had to commit an act that would cause his name to be practically synonymous with evil and betrayal   I d like to claim credit for this idea  but I got it from Jesus Christ  Superstar  So our poor hero had to do the work of being a hero  without getting any of the rewards that heros get  And that was damned frustrating to read  let me tell you  But it was thought provoking at the same time  The other thing about Slaughterhouse Five that was exceptional was the letter at the end  It was amazing what you go through in those last few pages  From thinking that the ending would be unhappy  to suddenly  beyond all expectation  finding out that the ending would be joyous  and then being disappointed  And it didn t come off contrived  I used to be a very judgmental person  Kurt Vonnegut was one of the authors whose work made me less so  Slaughterhouse Five was particularly influential in that regard  Yesterday  13 Feb 2013  was the 60th anniversary of the bombing of Dresden during WW2  so I thought it was an appropriate time to add a book I read in the past  Slaughterhouse 5 by Kurt Vonnegut Slaughterhouse 5 was the second book by Kurt Vonnegut I read  the first being Cat s Cradle  After this  I went on to read pretty much everything Kurt Vonnegut ever wrote  He has a unique voice and style  which I really enjoy  Slaughterhouse 5 is regarded by many as Vonnegut s major achievement and I wouldn t really disagree with this although my personal favourite is Sirens of Titan There is nothing quite like Slaughterhouse 5  It s an anti war book  but I feel it s for all of us  whether we have experienced war or not  It s about searching for meaning in our lives  Billy Pilgrim is us  It is warm and funny and horrifying all at the same time I was amused to see that Slaughterhouse 5 was banned by some US schools for being  shocking   An anti war book that s shocking  my oh my  How narrow minded  I hope the children at those schools all immediately sought out illicit copies to see what they were missing  Apparently  it was banned because of profanity  No words are inherently profane  it is people who have decided which words are acceptable and which are not  so it s only a matter of opinion  War  on the other hand  is inherently profane I have read Slaughterhouse 5 at least twice  maybe more  I have only guessed when I might first have read it  It s a kind of landmark in my own reading because it led me to read much more by Vonnegut and to decide he is one of my favourite writers  I think I learned a lot from him about writing  about storytelling  and about life  A very good read  You have to know it s Vonneguts processing of WW2 experiences Sometimes very wise sections  Sometimes very painful The abstract elements like time traveling are components you think about  About the deeper meaning  But everyone might come to different conclusions I thought  it was never sure he travelled in time    Of course it wasn t The last pages hurt much  As a German reader I knew a lot about the bombing of Dresden already  A relative of mine experienced DD  too  but from the distance  She was a refugee from the east  but was lucky her train stopped outside of Dresden  She said the whole sky was burning that night  She remembers every detail of that night Great anti war book  Alone this section  maybe unrecognized  but so meaningful against weapons war  Robert Kennedy  whose summer home is eight miles from the home I live in all year round  was shot two nights ago  He died last night  So it goes Martin Luther King was shot a month ago  He died  too  So it goes And every day my Government gives me a count of corpses created by military science in Vietnam  So it goes My father died many years ago now   of natural causes  So it goes  He was a sweet man  He was a gun nut  too  He left me his guns  They rust   Where the narration begins in this book quickly becomes irrelevant  as the novel twists and turns on a incredible journey through time  The narrator himself is but a minor character  but follows the experiences of Billy Pilgrim  who witnessed the bombing of Dresden and was taken away to another planet by fourth dimensional creatures from Tralfamadore  His life is portrayed almost as a line  in which he becomes  unstuck  and hops between various portions of this timeline  His existence is described by the Tralfamadorians as infinite  while seemingly finite to his third dimensional understanding  Billy s experiences continue to exist  even after the event of his own death  So it goes This book was a strange mixture of science fiction  biography  and satirical comedy  that somehow still maintained constant interest and comedic value  The major themes presented in the novel were interesting to contemplate  and very much expressed in the fragmented structure of the storyline  The comedy cannot be understated  and while not comprising the majority of the book  it is present in just the right dull or uneventful moments that it insures interest  To anyone who would not feel offended by occasional obscene sections  I would highly recommend this book   When a person dies  he only appears to die  He is still very much alive in the past  Slaughterhouse Five is the story of an American prisoner of war from World War II who was present for the bombing of Dresden  a catastrophic attack that killed nearly twice as many people as the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima  Billy Pilgrim serves as an Everyman  and tale reverses the classic allegory of Pilgrim s Progress  Rather than ascending into Heaven  however  Pilgrim is descending into Hell  As with Bunyan s Christian traveler  Pilgrim finds peace of a sort in his acceptance of the inevitability of death To handle the trauma of war  Billy retreats into a world of his own making  For Billy and his bedmate in an institution  science fiction helps them while  they were trying to re invent themselves and their universe   Specifically  the science fiction of Kilgore Trout  whose novels Billy internalizes  allowing him to travel in both space and time  In doing so  he  meets  an alien species known as the Traflamadorians that present him with a new way to accept death At first  the alien world  universe   view seems easy to swallow  and brings some comfort  at least to me  I found the idea of a person still being alive in the past interesting  and could see it bringing comfort  much like the idea of them continuing to live on in Heaven   Similarly  I appreciated the way the aliens composed their books  as a variety of unrelated scenes that   when seen all at once  they produce an image of a life that is beautiful and surprising and deep  And yet  further exposure to this line of thought reveals a fatalistic acceptance that is ultimately paralyzing  When asked why they would not prevent the destruction of the universe  which they foresee  the Traflamadorians answer   He has always pressed it  and he always will  We always let him  and we always will let him  The moment is structured that way   Billy then takes that idea and applies it to himself     I suppose the idea of preventing war on Earth is stupid  too  Instead of trying to change things  the alien line of thought is to simply accept it  Vonnegut points out that this is much in line with the first line of the well known Serenity prayer   grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change  Is this the attitude of the author or the character  Such things can often be difficult to decipher  but one only has to look at the fate of Billy to determine it is his worldview alone  Billy s perspective  that death is inevitable and should not be struggled against  that one should instead turn only to the pleasant moments and ignore the awful ones  leaves him broken  despondent  and often striving to escape the life he is living  Perhaps it is because his happy moments are rather few in between   his honeymoon with a wife he does not love but married for money  sitting in a coffin shaped wagon pulled by a dying horse in a destroyed city  When residing in the alien zoo  Billy is asked if he is happy  he responds with  About as happy as I was on Earth   Fed  sheltered  and safe  he trades his freedom and calls himself content  though his existence really isn t much different from his status as a prisoner of war  his journey out even starts with a  delousing  much like his entry to the PoW camp   Ultimately  Billy fatalistically accepts his death  doing nothing to try to prevent it The novel was an intriguing read  and one that made me think  It s a reminder that the most appealing thoughts   the unflinching  fatalistic acceptance of death  the desire to focus on only good things and ignore the bad   are not always the best  I hate to say it  but I think I read this as an undergraduate and totally forgot it  As I m rereading now  the indelible image of Billy Pilgrim s naked back as Roland Weary is about to kick  the pitiful buttons of Billy s spine  came back to me in a painful rush  Maybe I was just too young to absorb this book back then Vonnegut is not so much a prose stylist as an idea man  His metaphor of Billy Pilgrim s time travel as a stand in for memory as well as for the novelist s imagination is very cool  The occasional self conscious references scattered throughout the novel  after the journalistic first chapter  fix him in the Barth Barthelme Coover milieu of the sixties  And yet Vonnegut  perhaps more so than his contemporaries  stands the test of time  certainly better than Mailer  for instance  His recounting of the bombing of Dresden must have inspired Jonathan Safran Foer in Extremely Close and Incredibly Loud  And Vonnegut s later blog columns  collected in A Man Without a Country  show how the crazy liberal uncle of American letters kept his principles until the end  This is a great read  Vonnegut begins his story with a promise that his book will not glorify war  He keeps his word  Another hint in this direction is the second title  The Children s Crusade  This is a fitting title as the childishness of the soldiers is emphasized throughout the book  Often  very often   Vonnegut will punctuate a story with the words   So it goes   This has attracted some criticism from some who say Vonnegut takes a flippant attitude toward tragedy  It is quite the opposite  Vonnegut shows his readers a flippant attitude to further disgust them  It s quite effective  The story follows childish soldiers who experience horror  Rather than tell us to get angry about it  the author makes us angry about it with a casual   So it goes  Not only is Vonnegut very flippant throughout the book  but he is also very irreverent  This is a mature novel and contains harsh language and mature themes such as scenes including sex and masturbation  It s exactly what it needs to be as an effective anti war novel  but it isn t for youth  My copy of Slaughterhouse Five once belonged to Caitlin Caldwell  It says so in neat rounded printing on the first endpaper of the book  Also appearing on the same page   I  ENGLISH Not  I assumed that Caitlin had to be of my generation and had written those words back when Wayne s World was current  But  no  this copy of the book was printed in 2005  I guess some lingo never dies On the very next page

tell her  that s Billy s son So what did I think of the book  It s quite good  And if you ever get the chance to share the journey through a book with Ms  Caitlin Caldwell  do not hesitate to do it Oh  and Vonnegut shouldn t have quoted David Irving as an authority on anything  Billy Pilgrim is a man who does quite a lot of time traveling  He gets to see his hospital stays  near death experiences  death  his time of being a prisoner of war  and such  He was once kidnapped by an alien species called Tralfamadorians from Tralfamadore and put in a zoo  So it goes  This is a deep novel  At first it seems very simplistic and comical  with humour being used often  It is the good kind too  one that made me actually laugh out loud in a room full of people that immediately wanted to know what the hell I was reading  Some moments are just splendid  Such as the hospital scene where Billy lies with Rumfoord  and the older man tells him to pity the men who had to bomb Dresden  It appeared meaningful and logical  A look at the other side  I suppose  Vonnegut s writing style was very original  and I really enjoyed it  I have seen complaints of  so it goes  being constantly repeated  but quite frankly  it did not bother me at all  I actually think it made the story flow better and seem more complete  I don t know  I also enjoyed the time traveling  and it was actually easy to keep up with Billy as he went from his nice home to planet Tralfamadore to World War II again  Also something very original  yet also made me ponder on whether or not Billy was actually sane  This has been an amazing read  I am glad I picked up this book     Book Hermit    Wow  I was supposed to read this in a postmodern novel graduate class  I did  supposedly  I even had notes in the margins  and I checked it off in my brain as a completed novel so my eyes must have scanned over the words until the last page  I don t cheat to myself  I know when I did finish something and when I didn t  But it was a book that I could remember NOTHING about  So I had not processed the book at all  Not one bit  It s unorthodox in its narrative structure  and being that I was often a distracted 24 year old taking graduate school for granted  I realize that I had not consumed the book  I had not understood it at all  Its character  Billy Pilgrim  is slightly omniscient  oxymoron anyone   because of his ability to  time travel  and therefore he is completely accepting of his fate and all other fates  because he has a different understanding of time and loss  The tralfamadorians   an alien race that briefly abducts Billy  explanation of how a human sees time goes   The  trafalmadorian  guide invited the  trafalmadorian  crowd to imagine that they were looking across a desert at a mountain range on a day that was twinkling bright and clear  They could look at a peak or a bird or a cloud  at a stone right in front of them  or even down into a canyon behind them  But among them was this poor Earthling  and his head was encased in a steel sphere which he could never take off  There was only one eyehold through which he could look  and welded to that eyehole were six feet of pipe       He was also strapped to a steel lattice that was bolted to a flatcar on rails  and there was no way he could turn his head or touch the pipe  The far end of the pipe rested on a bi pod which was also bolted to the flatcar  All  the Earthling  could see was the little dot at the end of the pipe  He didn t know he was on a flatcar  didn t even know there was anything peculiar about his situation    The flatcar sometimes crept  sometimes went extremely fast  often stopped  went uphill  downhill  around curves  along straightaways  Whatever poor  the Earthling  saw through the pipe  he had no choice but to say to himself   That s Life   The trafalmadorians saw time in four dimenstions and could focus on the pleasant instead of the unpleasant I like that  Like many others  Slaughterhouse Five was my introduction to Kurt Vonnegut  and ever since  I ve become a huge fan of Vonnegut  The only reason I picked up Slaughterhouse was because Kurt Vonnegut seemed like one of those  capital w Writers   and if I didn t read at least one of his books  I felt I could never call myself a literature aficionado  So I picked it up expecting to read about a soldier who experiences bad things and eventually makes it out of the war a changed man  your average classic anti war novel  What I did not expect were aliens  philosophy about the illusion of free will  crude drawings made by the author  and time travel  These were pleasant surprises I read Slaughterhouse Five in one day at a school show choir competition  I was around for all the socializing  dancing  and singing  only physically  because every moment I could  I was reading  transfixed by this strange  goofy  depressing  and engaging book  While Slaughterhouse has a lot of what makes other anti war novels great  like showing the horror of war  the tragedy of sending children to fight  and the pointlessness of it all  the way Vonnegut presents his material is so engaging and thoughtful that it resonates on a different level  You re not just moved by emotion of what you re reading  you re constantly thinking about the book and the themes of war and human nature  My favourite aspect of Slaughterhouse was Vonnegut s writing  His writing style  although curt  choppy  non linear  and sometimes even juvenile are overpowered by the complex themes and ideas that make Slaughterhouse Five a thoughtful work of art  Even from the copyright page  Vonnegut shows that he is truly a master and that this is his story   I highly recommend this book to anyone and any other work of Kurt Vonnegut  Special mentions go to Cat s Cradle and Player Piano  Slaughterhouse Five or The Children s Crusade Kurt Vonnegut Jr   1969   18November 24  2008 And so my infatuation with Literature began  This wasn t the first book I read on the list   in fact  I would not even know of the list until years later   but this was on of two books that I bought that fateful day in the Denver Airport   having missed a flight and having 9 hours to spare   when the thought first struck me   hey  why don t I start reading some literature   So I went to the airport bookstore and bought two paperbacks  Slaughterhouse Five and A Farewell to Arms  I ended up reading them both in that day  between waiting for the next flight and actually flying home  I quite enjoyed both of them  and more importantly  I realized literature was good and even fun to read  Years later  I got around to re reading and reviewing this book for my silly project of reading this silly list  I found the hardback copy of this book in my trusty little neighborhood used bookstore  The guy up front wondered how the book had gotten there  It was an old library book that was discarded from the Houston Library  The first checkout date  or maybe due date  stamped on the folder is my birth date  Somehow between then and now  the date has been partially ripped out  as there was a piece of scotch tape covering it and it got torn loose  Bummer  That would have made for really crafty memorabilia  Oh well  excuse me   so it goes   This book has been burned and banned and denounced  Mine is simply stamped  Discarded   After initially reading this book  I have gobbled up most everything that Mr  Vonnegut has written  Most of his books are essentially the same  I like most of them  Some of them I like a lot  Slaughterhouse Five is not my favorite of his books  I liked Timequake better   but it definitely holds a sentimental place in my heart  It s nice that the people on the board of this list had the decency to include this unconventional piece of literature in this list  for I do believe that it is literature  In fact Vonnegut s books in general move me almost to tears  then he writes something in that witty black humor of his and you literally laugh the teardrops out of your eyes  That s something  His style may not be as well balanced and nearly as beautiful as some of the writers on this list  but it is just as insightful  Take this for example   Like so many Americans  in the Great Depression   she was trying to construct a life that made sense from things she found in gift shops    Vonnegut seems to take slices of Americana and paste them all over his books  I like him because he doesn t so much write to you  or even for you  but at you 9 5A T J I absolutely loved this book  The main character is Billy Pilgrim  a survivor of the bombing of Dresden  The story is told in flashbacks and flashforwards throughout Billy s life via time travel gifted to him by the Tralfamadorians  the aliens who kidnapped him  It is never truly stated whether Billy was insane or whether he was truly kidnapped by aliens  but I m going to assume the former  Although the skips in time should be confusing and disconcerting  Vonnegut manages to make it work  One of the charms of the the time travelling transitions is that there are barely any transitions  The changes are abrupt  and I never knew when to expect them  I can t imagine that time travel would be a gradual process  and I m glad that Vonnegut managed to convey that  The first chapter surprised me in that it told us the ending sentence from the beginning  I cannot recommend this book enough  The layout of the book was like none other that I ve read  and I fully intend to read more of Vonnegut s works  It is said repeatedly that this is one of the best anti war books written  This statement takes on new meaning after reading the book  There is nothing cliche or worn about how Vonnegut relates the absolute horror of war  a key ingredient in writing an effective novel that pits itself against something so savage  and something as heavily documented and written about  as war  Most everyone agrees that war is bloody terrible  Few say it like this  Vonnegut combines the strangeness of his seemingly disconnected story of alien abduction and continual time warps with spare passages of life during the great war  all which lead up to Dresden  Through these unique and strange devices  the horror emerges clearly  He does not let us cry  Ultimately  we can not cry  It is just something we must live with  whether we are taking a walk or being abducted by curious aliens  One of the clearest facts that emerges is that these people at war are BOYS  Nothing but little boys  It is a fact  but one that Vonnegut does not allow to be passed over  like so many in our information dense modern world  Without the aliens  it would have been lost  another fact lost to the void  He does not allow us the all to brief feelings of heroism and brotherhood fed to us by Hollywood  Nothing is allowed to stand in the way of the hideously naked images of war that assail us  not useless sentiment or false patriotism    and he did it with a story that spends an unusual amount of time with a gawky boy man in an alien zoo  Pure ingenuity  Recently reread this  99 cent Kindle special   Like  God Bless You Mr  Rosewater   Vonnegut s analysis of America and money could have been written for 2011  I suspect the Occupy Wall Street movement would have captured his imagination in a big way   but it transcends any one protest against fiscal power by pointedly taking the American psyche to task for being stubbornly wrong headed  America needs therapy to set her priorities  all of her people or only her rich people   straight  Slaughterhouse Five  is truly timeless and one of my top 100 books of all time  The senselessness of war  death as but a blip in a person s timeline  the spot on characterizations of Americans  ugly or otherwise  combined with utterly horrific and sublimely ridiculous events add up to damn near perfect  So it goes  Slaughterhouse Five is probably Vonnegut s most famous book  and rightly so  It is as brilliant as it is crazy   a poignant anti war book while at the same time a mad cap Science Fiction farce  Vonnegut s writing is characteristicaly simple yet evocative  He accomplishes in a few words what it takes other writers pages to do  Readers of other Vonnegut books will appreciate the continuty between  Five  and some of his other books  recognizing characters such as Kilgore Trout from  Breakfast of Champions  and Howard Campbell Jr  from  Mother Night   I enjoyed it  anyway  And there s another familiar character who appears in this book   Vonnegut himself  AS himself  As a fellow writer  it s interesting to me how Vonnegut injects himself into many of his novels  not as the main character hidden behind a semi fictional identity  but as a peripheral observer  He gives us subtle reminders here and there throughtout the book that he s there in the crowd  but he never takes over the action  The messages of the book are as relavent today as they were when they were written  I am glad ot have discovered Vonnegut s work at my age  just as so many out there shoult   Kurt Vonnegut pulls off a fantastic disguised anti war book  The book is about an American soldier who gets lost in time and in World War II  Billy Pilgrim travels through time as well as space as he unintentionally visits a planet called Tralfamdore where he is captured and kept  Kurt Vonnegut s black humor and pure imagination mix well with the deeper meaning to the anti war book and the connection between the various characters who represent other Vonnegut books  Billy Pilgrim s journey towards the meaning of life takes the reader through all aspects of feeling and time  you cry  you laugh  you hate  you love  Just for a preview Vonnegut describes the book and Billy Pilgrim A FOURTH GENERATION GERMAN AMERICANNOW LIVING IN EASY CIRCUMSTANCES IN CAPE COD AND SMOKING TOO MUCH  WHO  AS AN AMERICAN INFANTRY SCOUTHORS DE COMBAT  AS A PRISONER OF WAR WITNESSED THE FIRE BOMBING OF DRESDEN  GERMANY  THE FLORENCE OF THE ELBE   A LONG TIME AGOAND SURVIVED TO TELL THE TALETHIS IS A NOVEL SOMEWHAT IN THE TELEGRAPHICSCHIZOPHRENIC MATTER OF TALES OF THE PLANETTRALFAMADORE  WHERE THE FLYING SAUCERSCOME FROM PEACE The book is amusing on the surface  with Vonnegut s black humor  but while reading remember there is more to the book than appears  as Vonnegut connotatively reveals the book to be an anti war book  Slaughterhouse Five and Billy Pilgrim captured the heart of America as it will you  I highly recommend this book as well as any other book by Kurt Vonnegut  one of the greatest American authors   Kurt Vonnegut  Jr  is a favorite author of mine  His style reminds me of William Burroughs with its short  concise sentences  only more subtle  Vonnegut uses a cheerful tone to highlight the tragedy and travesty of the point he s making In my quest to thin out my belongings  I ve decided to purge the Vonnegut books but couldn t help reading them again  I started with Slaughterhouse Five  This wasn t the first Vonnegut book I read  but it was one of the first  Vonnegut s  memoir  of his experiences in World War II is a powerful  moving anti war statement  His glib recounting of the horrors of war drives the information home  almost forces you to take account of it  The characters are intriguing and come across as quite real  They re people we ve all known Best of all  for me  is the incredibly dry wit Vonnegut does so well  All of his books are  laugh out loud funny   as reviewers are so fond of saying about funny books  But  the laughter is uncomfortable in that  generally  it is a dark sort of humor that Vonnegut uses to get his point across I love where  in chapter nine  Vonnegut mentions a Regan For President bumper sticker  Slaughterhouse Five was published in 1969  while Regan wouldn t assume the presidency until 1981  Spooky A great book and a great piece of literature  I m addicted to Vonnegut s detached  spaced out crazy recurring characters  self referencing and scattered narrative  This book is made up of a lot of side stories that are metaphors for each other and highlight the author s view that wars are senseless and inevitable  As individuals  we are insignificant and helpless and as a whole people are also insignificant and helpless from themselves  One line that sticks in my memory is when an American soldier asks a German guard  after the guard beats him up somewhat at random   Why me   and the German answers   Why you  Why anyone    Billy Pilgrim gets a similar answer from his alien abductors  Though there s a lot going on the book  comes out as the strongest theme  and the jumps among Pilgrim s army service  the alien abduction  and Pilgrim s family life paint a trap for Pilgrim that can only be lived in happily if he embraces it  The aliens teach him that bad things happen in life  so we should just dwell on the good parts  One thing I didn t like so much was that Vonnegut s use of aliens as a plot tool was a bit strained  but I ll probably change my mind the next time I read this book  This is the story of man named Billy Pilgrim  successful optometrist  former P O W   crash survivor  former alien abductee  and a man unstuck in time  Circling around the events of the fire bombing of Dresden in World War Two  Pilgrim shifts randomly back and forth through the various events of his life  childhood  adulthood  middle aged  aware at all times of how the events will did transpire at all points  but he is a fatalist and is seemingly unable or unwilling to alter them  So it goes Kurt Vonnegut is a genius  His writing style is almost plain  unadorned  and totally captivating  The schizophrenic journey through the life of Billy Pilgrim is engrossing and intriguing  It raises interesting questions and balances carefully between a fondness for Billy s fatalism and subtly pointed satire in opposition  or least  that s how I read it  Aside  I am presently a little upset with everyone  Why did no one tell me to read this book sooner  Why is it no one said to me   Hey  you know who s a genius  Vonnegut  You should read Slaughterhouse Five   Not having read it yourself yet is no excuse  you should have known otherwise  And if you did tell me  why weren t you more forceful  Sure  I was aware it was one of those books that frequently appears on the top 100 all time lists  but what did that mean to me  Nothing  I was counting on my friends  Please note  that while you may have dropped the ball on this one  I forgive you and we ll just move on  That s what friends are for  after all   Oh  and if not only DID you tell me  but my response was  Well  I haven t read one through four  either   I want to commend you for not spending the next three hours laughing and pointing  It showed tremendous restraint  It s an easy book to read and very compelling  The scenes during the war strip away any romanticism that could be achieved without making the anti war message painful  Even the fact that events are happening out of order is easy to accept  these are moments only seemingly connected  but clearly defined  Guided by Vonnegut s nameless narrator  you won t get lost as the protagonist moves back and forth through all the events of his life  though you might find yourself falling prey to Billy s fatalism if you aren t careful  So it goes  Vonnegut s eloquent and timeless piece about the absurdity of war becomes even more relevant as our country enters into its fifth year of war in Iraq   All this happened  more or less  writes Vonnegut of his semi biographic recantation of his time serving as a chaplain s assistant in World War II  The book has an alternate title  The Children s Crusade   which is the name Billy Pilgrim  his main character  promised he would name his book about the Battle of Dresden to his war buddy s wife  This title  the wife insists  is necessary  It is meant to illustrate that by romanticizing war  by making it seem as though brawny heroes are off fighting for the American way  we make war seem exciting and romantic  something we want to be involved in Billy Pilgrim was just a child when he went off to war  as were most of his comrades  They were lost kids  walking around  trained insufficiently  and just hoping to keep their lives  or  in some cases  hoping to lose them   Vonnegut s writing style is engaging  hilarious  and prolific  Slaughterhouse Five is a great introduction to his creative approach to presenting his passionate opinions on some of the absurdities of our society  The novel s combination of science fiction and passionate commentary makes it accessible to readers who might not typically read  heavier  social commentary  Though the book does not contain many plot points   it is mostly Billy  bouncing around his life  not even reflecting so much as revealing   it is probably my favorite book of all time  I would recommend this book as a necessary read for high school students  perhaps as a combination with a unit on World War II   I found this to be a profoundly disturbing book  It has haunted me for days  and probably always will  It belongs on anybody s list of top novels  although it is not a  novel  in the conventional accepted sense  I greatly admire Vonnegut s risk taking and genius  His Brain fried Drunk narrative style is a stroke of genius  Once you get used to it  you start appreciating the carefully composed texture of the book  His display of  not just the horrors of war  which are bad enough  but of our casual  thoughtless  intrinsic cruelty as a species I found so disturbing  Anything beautiful and kind and innocent must be nurtured and protected at all costs At first I was surprised by the characterization  or lack thereof  of Billy Pilgrim  I was expecting a young  sweet  energetic guy who ingeniously outsmarts the forces of war  Instead I got a blank slate  passive and almost devoid of personality  But of course Billy has to be this way because he is Everyman  If he were endowed with s separate personality  then he couldn t be you or me In so many interviews of veterans we have seen on the History Channel and elsewhere  you see over and over again how participation in war  especially World War II  was the highlight and centerpiece of the soldiers  lives  nothing else is as intense  For Billy  marriage and births and career  accidents and pain and death  his wife  experienced after the war seem so dull compared to war events  In that sense he is like a real man  But in his journey across life  not to mention the galaxy   he is truly the hapless pilgrim This book is still making me shudder  I ve decided I have been too stingent with my ratings lately  I wasn t giving hardly any books fives  because they were not perfect 10 s  Well this rating system is not trying to find a perfect book  it specifically says  five stars it was amazing  not perfect   That is how I feel about this book  It was amazing but not perfect  There is crude languge and sex  but I can t stop my mind from dwelling on some of the concepts in the book  It is different from almost any style I have read before  They do try to duplicate it a lot in the movies  I feel like I have so much I can learn from this book  One reading has not let me scratch the surface of the deeper parts  Chris  I am certainly recommending this book for you  I am confused though  because I thought you were the one that suggested this one to me  Anyway it is a good one anyway Quotable quotes and things I learned       I am a Tralfamadorian  seeing all time as you might see a stretch of the Rocky Mountains  All time is all time  It does not change  It does not lend itself to warnings or explanations  It simply is   The most important thing I learned on Tralfamadore was that when a person dies he only appears to die  He is still very much alive in the past  so it is very silly for people to cry at his funeral  All moments  past  present and future  always have existed  always will exist  The Tralfamadorians can look at all the different moments just that way we can look at a stretch of the Rocky Mountains  for instance  They can see how permanent all the moments are  and they can look at any moment that interests them  It is just an illusion we have here on Earth that one moment follows another one  like beads on a string  and that once a moment is gone it is gone forever  When a Tralfamadorian sees a corpse  all he thinks is that the dead person is in a bad condition in that particular moment  but that the same person is just fine in plenty of other moments  Now  when I myself hear that somebody is dead  I simply shrug and say what the Tralfamadorians say about dead people  which is  so it goes   That s one thing Earthlings might learn to do  if they tried hard enough  Ignore the awful times and concentrate on the good ones    If I am going to spend eternity visiting this moment and that  I m grateful that so many of those moments are nice   There are almost no characters in this story  and almost no dramatic confrontations  because most of the people in it are so sick and so much the listless playthings of enormous forces  One of the main effects of war  after all  is that people are discouraged from being characters   They do not love one another because they do not love themselves   We went to the New York World s Fair  saw what the past had been like  according to the Ford Motor Car Company and Walt Disney  saw what the future would be like  according to General Motors  And I asked myself about the present  how wide it was  how deep it was  how much was mine to keep   It was a movie about American bombers in World War II and the gallant men who flew them  Seen backwards by Billy  the story went like this  American planes  full of holes and wounded men and corpses took off backwards from an airfield in England  Over France  a few German fighter planes flew at them backwards  sucked bullets and shell fragments from some of the planes and crewmen  They did the same for wrecked American bombers on the ground  and those planes flew up backwards to join the formation The formation flew backwards over a German city that was in flames  The bombers opened their bomb bay doors  exerted a miraculous magnetism which shrunk the fires  gathered them into cylindrical steel containers  and lifted the containers into the bellies of the planes  The containers were stored neatly in racks  The Germans below had miraculous devices of their own  which were long steel tubes  They used them to suck more fragments from the crewmen and planes  But there were still a few wounded Americans though and some of the bombers were in bad repair  Over France though  German fighters came up again  made everything and everybody as good as new When the bombers got back to their base  the steel cylinders were taken from the racks and shipped back to the United States of America  where factories were operating night and day  dismantling the cylinders  separating the dangerous contents into minerals  Touchingly  it was mainly women who did this work  The minerals were then shipped to specialists in remote areas  It was their business to put them into the ground  to hide them cleverly  so they would never hurt anybody ever again  The American fliers turned in their uniforms  became high school kids  And Hitler turned into a baby       I especially liked the visual imaginery that last paragraph gave  Cleverly hiding it safely in the ground  great The book is a masterpiece of psychological autobiography  If you have ever worked with people who have lived through real trauma   wartime PTSD  extreme physical abuse  physical assault and on and on  you recognize eventually that they stop growing and never really leave that spot in one way or another  That s the basis of Billy becoming  unstuck in time   And it s brilliant  Funny  sad  poignant and profound  I will be reading more Vonnegut soon  I loved this book with all its weirdness    There are almost no characters in this story  and almost no dramatic confrontations  because most of the people in it are so sick and so much the listless playthings of enormous forces  One of the main effects of war  after all  is that people are discouraged from being characters   And still  with all its non characters and its scrambled timeline  its laconic catalogue of horrors and its absurd time travel and alien abduction themes  it s one of the most shattering war novels around  It s also very funny  So it goes  I was never old enough to appreciate this book  when I read it in high school  But now   now  with newfound object permanence  I understand  What always stuck out to me wasn t the famous quotes   everything was beautiful  or  so it goes    rather  the soft trill of the birds   Poo tee weet    Watching  judging  listening as humans hoist themselves in great self importance  Nature  Earth  stays permanent while humans come and go  We are visitors  and at any moment we too may leave We ll see how it goes  As a sci fi  this is one of the most coherent works I ve read  It s not up there with the classics  but that s because it s not written as a sci fi Of course  this is an anti war novel  and of course  as Vonnegut acknowledges  it won t do anything to stop war  However  it can help us learn to react humanely to the realities of war  and death  and suffering in general  The firebombing of Dresden makes it so clear how absurd it is to differentiate between the suffering of allies and enemies  Yes  those who cried for the civilians of Dresden and not the legions of soldiers who were killed in the war are missing some humanity  But those who cried   and cry   for their soldiers but accept the enemy s dead as collateral damage   they re ignorant  Vonnegut  very cleverly and clearly  changes that  Honestly  I think it s a little soon for me to try and review this book  It s the first I ve read in a LONG time that  upon finishing  I wish I was still in my high school AP Lit class  where my teacher would go on crazy rants about the hidden meanings of this book  He would have a lot to say about it  I m sure  and it would have been wonderful to listen to  especially since I have about a zillion questions  We ll just boil down what could be a long and rambling review to   I loved it    I will read it again   and  Now what  Mr  Vonnegut   Kurt Vonnegut s Slaughterhouse Five is a novel in which Billy Pilgrim s odyssey through time shows the reader different historic moments  Most of them are part of Billy s life  but they are all centered around the firebombing of Dresden  This anti war tale describes Vonnegut s experience during the bombing  He puts himself in the novel  as well as in Billy Pilgrim  This book is full of Irony  which is demonstrated by Billy Pilgrim  as well as other non important characters in the book  Slaughterhouse Five is one of those pivotal books for me  It was given to me by my 11th grade English teacher  Mrs  Dubois  as an alternative to some other assignment  and was so radically different from anything else I d ever read for school that I had to know and read more  So my judgment of the novel is somewhat colored by that experience  Still  this must be the sixth or seventh time I ve read it at least  and despite its preciousness  or what now looks like preciousness  it never fails to move me  Just a powerful  beautiful  funny  crazy anti war novel  Love it  Dissacrante  anti retorico  distruttivo Vonnegut esprime tutta la sua sfiducia nei confronti del genere umano utilizzando come perno la distruzione di una delle piu belle citta d Europa da parte della piu grande democrazia del mondo Billy Pilgrim viaggia nel tempo e nello spazio  ma non puo e non vuole far nulla per cambiare la storia  e sempre stato cosi e sempre sara cosi  anche gli abitanti di Tralfamadore  che sembrano essere meno stupidi dei terrestri  hanno come passatempo principale quello di ammirare specie aliene che vivono in grosse cupole di vetro  e hanno anche il merito di far esplodere l intero universo  tra l altro Il titolo alternativo   The Children s Crusade  A Duty Dance With Death   distrugge tutto l eroismo americano della seconda guerra mondiale  in realta il libro distrugge l eroismo di tutte le guerre  e cita  come spiegato nel primo capitolo  Celine   L arte non e possibile senza una danza con la morte  Cosi va la vita Pace  I ve put off reading this book for years  I m not a big SF fan  alternative worlds usually just depress me  and Vonnegut s stylistic quirks get on my nerves after a while  But I picked this up on sale yesterday and read chapter one on the Metro ride home   and LOVE it  I think chapter one is really about PTSD and how hard it was for Vonnegut to write or speak about his war experience  His signature bits   the repeated catch phrase  and so it goes   the jump cuts between scenes and ideas   add to the impression of a smart  decent person struggling to process trauma  Granted  I haven t gotten to the  real  novel yet  and may still find the book too SF for my taste   Though Billy Pilgrim s coming unstuck in time seems a very apt metaphor for Alzheimer s or an Alzheimer s like disease  and in that way not so different from the kind of imaginative mainstream fiction I enjoy   But so far at least Slaughterhouse Five strikes me as a really smart  moving book   I can see why it s a classic  I was something like nineteen when I read this book and it blew my mind  It is part memoir  part science fiction adventure  part war story  part chronicle of failing memory and mental illness  and  as the famous opening line implies   more or less true   I don t even know what else to say except go read or reread this book  I d like to excerpt the whole thing  Here is the full title  which is impressive by itself Slaughterhouse Five  or The Children s Crusade  A Duty Dance with Death  by Kurt Vonnegut  A Fourth Generation German American Now Living in Easy Circumstances on Cape Cod  and Smoking Too Much   Who  as an American Infantry Scout Hors de Combat  as a Prisoner of War  Witnessed the Fire Bombing of Dresden  Germany   The Florence of the Elbe   a Long Time Ago  and Survived to Tell the Tale  This is a Novel Somewhat in the Telegraphic Schizophrenic Manner of Tales of the Planet Tralfamadore  Where the Flying Saucers Come From  Peace The rest is up to you  So it goes  Like with Margaret Atwood s books  there s really nothing I can add to the torrents of praise for Kurt Vonnegut s work  including his seminal  funny  wry  unsparing  wicked  tragic  moral tale  Slaughterhouse 5    I read it a million years ago and thought I should reread it   Yo  yo   said one  nodding dreamily   Yo  yo  The narrative keeps circling towards the firebombing of Dresden  in between visits to the alien planet of Tralfamadore  the last harrowing days of World War II  and suburban living in the years following  They were catatonic with disgust  We see most of these events through the eyes of the hapless and wretched Billy Pilgrim  a man as foolish as he is utterly human  I hope that we ll meet again in a world of peace and freedom in the taxi cab if the accident will  Mr  Vonnegut s unpitying prose is often luminous  always lancing  I ll leave you with this fabulous line   Well  here we are  Mr  Pilgrim  trapped in the amber of this moment  There is no why   One of those books that you keep on your shelves to reread every couple of years  I remember being so captivated by this book and Vonnegut s writing that I wrote a term paper on it in high school and another one in college  I got a  A   both times  Until I read this novel I had never learned or heard of the  fire bombings  of Dresden  This book also lead me to read other Vonnegut books which I always found interesting in the dark humor used and found myself chuckling while reading   A Book with a number in itPicture The Bell Jar and The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy mixed into one novella and you pretty much have Slaughterhouse Five  The pacing  rhythm and style is energetic  funny  captivating and genuinely moving  Vonnegut manages to weave a tale about a WW2 prison camp into something unexpected and most certainly post modern  A real delight to read  and I find it s quite wonderfully brought together a lot of elements of my favourite reads over this year s reading challenge And most importantly  like all great books  it s made me want to write more   So it goes  It took a while to feel comfortable with the writing style  to figure out who s story it was and what the hell was going on  but once it clicked  I couldn t put it down  An exploration into life as we will never know it  where death can be something we experience over and over  just as a moment in time  Comical at times but a book to make you think  Billy is a wonderful character and I loved reading his story  A unique and clever storyteller  Definitely a book to be enjoyed time and time again   I picked this up to read at the Mesa County Public Library for Banned Book Days  I hadn t read any Vonnegut for perhaps 20 years  Once started I had to finish  and even though you can t describe Vonnegut as a  page turner  his mixture of craziness  unstuck ness  in time  and deep humanism still works  and perhaps better than ever  In a time of drones  and accidental bombings of hospitals  Doctors without Borders   we aren t shocked by tragedy after tragedy  So it goes   13Slaughterhouse five is a satirical anti war novel following a very odd Mr  Billy Pilgrim while he is a soldier in World War 2 I thoroughly enjoyed Catch 22  but I found it to be much too long  Slaughterhouse Five is like a shorter version of Catch 22  I read it over winter break with two of my friends  and found it s sarcastic undertones to be funny  Although it is a humorous book  the anti war message comes off quite clear  and forced me to think about the purpose and necessity of war   A truly delightful read  A masterpiece of Vonnegut s perception  Billy Pilgrim is not your typical protagonist  He is the opposite of what you would expect from a main character  He is weak  whimsical  and strangely  the most reliable character you would ever want to narrate the story  Billy is a time traveller  Zipping uncontrollably back and forth through time  Billy relives the events of his life multiple times  He has no need to fear his death for it has already happened  He is both dead and alive  frozen yet unfrozen in the shackle of time   Imaginative  witty  beautiful  sad  humane  The entire book is an attempt to comprehend the incomprehensible  and maybe the only way to do that is a weird story about getting  unstuck in time   The passage about watching the bombers fly backwards and careful hands  women s hands  removing the dangerous materials so that specialists can bury them deep in the earth is a piercingly beautiful reminder that the world is not as it should be  It is  morally speaking  backwards  I was apprehensive when I started this book  as I sometimes am with subjects deemed  classics  or  must reads   I was surprisingly taken back by the honesty and the style  I felt an influence on Margaret Atwood  particularly The Blind Assasin  It felt like a book of Psalms in the sense that you could open it and read any particular portion in one swallow and still glean meaning from it  I appreciated the ambiguity of genre  I feel that one could benefit from multiple readings  I intend to read it again   I m listening to the edition read by Ethan Hawke  I first read this book as a teenager and remember being wowed by Vonnegut  leading me to read many more of his books  Listening to the book brings a whole new dimension to the story  I like the way Ethan reads the book   you can almost imagine Vonnegut reading it himself I love the way Vonnegut writes  So many wonderful words  on top of crazy ideas  I especially loved this paragraph  America is the wealthiest nation on Earth  but its people are mainly poor  and poor Americans are urged to hate themselves     It is in fact a crime for an American to be poor  even though America is a nation of poor  Every other nation has folk traditions of men who were poor but extremely wise and virtuous  and therefore more estimable than anyone with power and gold  No such tales are told by American poor  They mock themselves and glorify their betters    Kurt Vonnegut  Slaughterhouse Five Interesting description  This is a very unusual book  I must admit that I was not sure what to make of it after I finished it  The story itself is not in chronological order  it keeps skipping back and forth in the life of the main character  It alternates between scenes of pain and suffering during World War II  and scenes of rather ordinary character after the war  Well  ordinary  except from the alien abduction part  It is an absurd story featuring a very broken protagonist  but somehow  in the end it all clicks together and makes perfect sense  So  I am guessing my final thought is   this a strange and confusing  but it is definitely worth your timeI recommend it to anyone who likes short books that pack a big punch  and would enjoy something different  I m quite surprised to see so many reviews claiming that this isn t an anti war book  Perhaps the meaning is lost on those that take Pilgrim at his word  While it s true that Pilgrim admits that the war and the bombing in Dresden were necessary  Vonnegut shows us through Pilgrim s mind the long term effects of war  Pilgrim  after living through one the most devastating bombings the world has ever seen  suffers from PTSD that has left him in a constant state of confusion  He not only has invented a whole other life for himself  confined safely on display in a zoo millions of miles away from Earth  he also no longer has a concept of time  One moment he s on his honeymoon  the next the s back in the war  To me  Vonnegut s subtle anti war message is merely this  in order for Pilgrim to come to the conclusion that war is a necessity  he must give up conventional thinking  give up his mind altogether and adopt the Tralfamadorian s mindset  Human emotions have no place in wartime  I obviously misread or misinterpreted the blurb on the back of the book as I was expecting a book that focused on the Dresden Bombings during WW2  Although the book was about the bombings it was also about time travel and had an obvious sci fi aspect to it  However  I loved it It was really funny in places and the fact that you couldn t really tell if time travel was part of the book or whether it was Billy s way of dealing with the bombings and being part of the war  an aspect of post traumatic stress syndrome   His family treated him as though he was crazy and didn t seem overly sympathetic to what he had been through   either during the war or subsequent accidents It was well written and not overly graphic as some war  or anti war novels  can be  quite short with some real humour thrown in  My feelings are that the time travel was a metaphor for his feelings towards his life  especially as Vonnegurt didn t describe these much in  real time  during the novel  Narrated by Ethan Hawke6 hrs and 4 minsPublisher s SummaryKurt Vonnegut s absurdist classic Slaughterhouse Five introduces us to Billy Pilgrim  a man who becomes  unstuck in time  after he is abducted by aliens from the planet Tralfamadore  In a plot scrambling display of virtuosity  we follow Pilgrim simultaneously through all phases of his life  concentrating on his  and Vonnegut s  shattering experience as an American prisoner of war who witnesses the firebombing of Dresden Slaughterhouse Five is not only Vonnegut s most powerful book  it is also as important as any written since 1945  Like Catch 22  it fashions the author s experiences in the Second World War into an eloquent and deeply funny plea against butchery in the service of authority  Slaughterhouse Five boasts the same imagination  humanity  and gleeful appreciation of the absurd found in Vonnegut s other works  but the book s basis in rock hard  tragic fact gives it unique poignancy  and humor  I don t intend this as a negative criticism  but Vonnegut s novels are less individual  memorable works of art than links in a chain  an ongoing  endlessly looping conversation  The subject rarely changes  each book blends together in the memory  the details dissolve  and what one is left with is the palpable sense of the chief character throughout   Vonnegut himself  with his wonderful narrative voice  bracingly humane  skeptical  and wryly funny   Slaughterhouse Five  is the best of the novels  Perhaps the autobiographical truth  the eyewitness factor  helps give it a greater gravitas than his other work  it has more heft  crawls deeper under the skin  A scathing anti war novel disguised as science fiction  a biting satire  and characteristically funny sad   You get the surreal feeling that nothing makes sense when you start this novel  and as you keep reading  you have trouble telling apart the layers of stories set in different times and locations  That s the beauty of this book  at the end  you re left not with a plot that goes from point A to point B but with a painted landscape giving an overview of the narrator s life  a mesh of time and space  Within it  a strong commentary about the futility yet unavoidable nature of war  and a discourse about the nature of past  present and future  Favorite quote has to be that of Billy s dying mother realizing her impending end   How did I get so old   I had no idea what to expect from this book  My friend had been reading Kurt Vonnegut and recommended him  This was the first one I saw at the library  This is the most incredible and most horrible book  It is non linear and irrational  It turns out  that IS the best way to deal with the subject of war  How can you rationally explain such an irrational reality  especially the bombing of Dresden  The only way to make sense of war  is by admitting  it doesn t make sense   This is probably the third time I ve read this  and every time I love it more  This is ostensibly Vonnegut dealing with his time as a WWII P O W  in Dresden  He lived thru the fire bombing that probably killed more people than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima  depending on where the facts come from  His alter ego in this story is Billy Pilgrim  a private during the war and an Optometrist after  He becomes unstuck in time and the narrative presents itself in a delightfully weird way  One minute you re with him in the slaughterhouse in Dresden  next you re with Billy and his wife at a party and then he wakes up in his cell at the zoo on Trafalmadore  the planet the aliens took him to when he was abducted  And then he ll jump right back again  Time travel in both directions to Pilgrim A very odd story that is right in my wheelhouse  The audio version I listened to was very good  Ethan Hawke did the narration  Recommend S  5 22 14 F  5 30 14  9 Days  Vonnegut agrees with the idea that war will always exist  but writes an anti war book anyway  Vonnegut says that all there is to say about war is poo tee weet  but writes a book length book around it anyway  Vonnegut says that irony is climactic  but this whole book is pure  perfect irony in its highest form  One bit of my Kindle  marginalia  asks   What IS the climax of this story   and how ofter does a book make you NOTE that question for further thought   Smartly written  crisp  incisive  and deftly witty  everything you d expect from a Vonnegut novel  I m not sure I d classify this as science fiction  the scifi aspects of it are pretty much completely unimportant to the plot which serves much more as a satirical treatise on freewill  the consequences of war  and the drudgery of everyday existence  Billy Pilgrim could have been dreaming or hallucinating instead of time travelling and it still wouldn t have made a substantive difference with the development of the story  In fact  it isn t entirely clear that the protagonist isn t completely insane  or just had a little too much mimosa with his Sunday reverie  instead of travelling through time as he claims  Took a little while for me to get into it as the beginning seemed a little repetitive and dry  but about halfway through  I was completely hooked  This is an important work on post world war America and still germaine to our war obsessed culture today  This book was extremely well written and personal  and it dug into both history and the best of science fiction  This book perfectly warps three different themes  world war two and the horrors of the burning of dresden  the main characters travels to the fictional alien land of Tralfamadore  and finally his drab and unoriginal life back on Earth  I am usually not into Science fiction  but Vonnegut magically weaves his extraterrestrial characters into sages for a better world  The aliens live their lives in four demensions and they see all past and all future  They accept things the way they are and never question life and its terrible ways  The main character Billy Pilgrim uses this knowledge to help him get through the hard times of his life and the horrors that he saw as a soldier in WWII  This is an excellent book that Jacob recommended to me and I would do the same to anyone who is look for an antiwar book that will change their whole perception on life  A book that tugs at the rigging of the mind to influence the feeling of rational optimism in the face of the worst possible scenarios Vonnegut expressly views war as one of the worst possible scenarios as he gives vivid details about the cursed mien of the Second World War  Using this demonic visage he follows a main character who has learned to time travel  So he is taught always to look on better days  why should war ruin our lives  We can look forward or backward to a happier time  Although Vonnegut implies the impossibility of the end of war  he does mention that if we all lived as if it wasn t there    we ignored it    we could live lives of peace and happiness  unfettered by the pains of war  Some may assume that Vonnegut may have a panglossian view on war  but his point is valid  Why would we want to base our thoughts around something so vile and demeaning  We don t  So why not base our temporal thoughts on something that won t crash us into despondency  I absolutely love this book  Still  by far my favorite book  I first read it in my english class in high school  You know I was not expecting much given it was assigned reading A science fiction story that follows WW2 veteran Billy Pilgrim who has become unstuck in time  It jumps to very dates in his life  From his time as a POW in Dresden to his time with aliens  The books goes all over and yet still feels all connected and not jumbled The writing has a good pace to it and at the time I first read it I surged ahead of the rest of the class in reading  When we were supposed to read chapters 3 5 I was probably on chapter 12 then  The philosophy of the aliens and all the imagery conjured throughout the book is interesting and makes a great read  While it is humorous at times there is also a sort of underlying current of dread and sadness fro the main character I highly recommend checking this book out if you have a desire for black comedic science fiction Anyone who knows me knows that my favorite book of all time is 1984  And I never thought I d see the day come when I would say   This is the best thing I ve read since 1984   And I remember when I first read that book almost ten years ago  Well  ten years have passed and now I can say it without hesitation This is the best thing I ve read since 1984 And honestly  that s all I can really say  To even begin to explain the sheer glory that is this novel would do it no justice  This is a story that needs to be experienced  I will admit  I wasn t a fan of the opening chapter  but with each chapter that came with it  I needed to keep reading and needed to know what happened  The vagueness and simplicity of the writing has chilled me more than pages of nit picking details  It makes you think and it keeps you second guessing yourself There s a reason why this book is a classic and the only thing I hate is the fact it took me this long in my life to finally read it  SlaughterHouse 5 is  has been  and will continue to be  my favorite novel of all time  Kurt Vonnegut is one of the most resounding  appealing  and engrossing authors I have encountered in my literary career  Always being hostile to the concept of reading for a grade in English  or not being interested by a borish read  I picked up SH5 on a tip from my AP LANG teacher  She said my humor and Vonnegut s would be a good combination  I read the book in one night  I never felt a closer connection to a novel  Life lessons  Moral Values  Fears  Dreams  Aspirations  all were present in SH5  All these feelings I felt  Vonnegut wrote  The deep philosophical presence  as well as the lack of any chronological continuity and cohesiveness made the  eaten and then regurgitated  story more appealing to myself  I was a myopic and uniterested reader prior to SH5  one who traipsed through books without a care  few making a presence deeply etched into my memory  SH5 is my book  Ame este libro  ame leerlo  No estoy segura de que fue lo que mas me gusto  me interesa la Segunda Guerra Mundial  pero no lo describiria como un libro sobre la Segunda Guerra Mundial  aunque en cierta medida lo es   No se como describirlo  La empatia que senti por Billy Pilgrim es infinita  queria abrazarlo en todo momento  me enamore de su vulnerabilidad  de su resignacion Tambien  cuando era chica  solia pensar que tal vez podria caer en un momento cualquiera de mi vida  sin previo aviso  y en determinados momentos importantes me preguntaba   Que pasaria si de repente cayera en este momento   que pensaria   como reaccionaria    Me hizo acordar a eso  a ese vertigo Los saltos en el tiempo son tan caracteristicos del modernismo  o el posmodernismo  y sin embargo Vonnegut le da una razon de ser tan ridicula como valida y ambigua y conmovedora  Una historia que te hace pensar en que es el tiempo y  si  tambien que es y que no es morir  So it goes  SH5 is a startlingly unique piece of literature  which isn t surprising for Vonnegut  It is seriously difficult to describe this book  the number one reason being that the events are not necessarily chronological    The main character is a hapless traveler in time  This is the hilarious and heart breaking story of Billy Pilgrim  a Joe Sixpack American optometrist and veteran of WWII who is abducted by Tralfamadorians  I would argue that the central event of SH5 is the bombing of Dresden  Billy was being held as a prisoner of war when the bomb was dropped  so he was a witness to the absolute devastation of what he originally describes as a beautiful city  The book is not a straightforward story  It starts and stops and rewinds and makes vertigo inducing leaps  Vonnegut s storytelling genius lends a very believable feel to the story  even though we encounter aliens and constantly travel through time  Bravo  Kurt  Do yourself a favor and read this book  Today  Sto rispolverando nella mia memoria i vecchi libri che lessi a suo tempo  e questo e uno di loro Il libro non e facile  o almeno io ricordo che feci molta fatica a leggerlo e non perche la storia era brutta  ma perche in un certo senso non era lineare perche si passa dal passato al presente al futuro  si va dalla guerra al lavoro ad un altro pianeta  Sostanzialmente pero posso dire che e un racconto sulla guerra scritto in un periodo in cui la guerra veniva vista con  occhi romantici   dove al cinema si vedevono solo soldati eroi trascurando tutto il vero orrore di quel periodo  ed e proprio questo lo scopo dell autore  perfettamente descritto nel capitolo introduttivo  descrivere la guerra per quello che e realmente Se non sbaglio per un periodo era un libro fortemente consigliato  se non obbligatorio  nelle scuole americane ed io mi sento di cosiglialo a tutti  In fin dei conti il racconto e breve ed anche se non vi piace la tortura dura poco    Scordatevi la linearita della trama  Billy Pilgrim  il protagonista di questo romanzo  viaggia nel tempo  e noi con lui  Cosi lui muore a meta romanzo  ma poi continua a vivere e ad andare avanti e indietro fra i vari momenti della sua vita  Combatte in guerra  assiste al bombardamento di Dresda  diventa ottico  incontra gli alieni e vive sul loro pianeta  tutto contemporaneamente  Non vive la vita come una successione di momenti  la vede nel suo insieme  Vonnegut e geniale  riesce a presentarci queste assurdita come se fossero assolutamente normali e ogni tanto entra pure lui nella storia Tutto questo in un libro che denuncia gli orrori della guerra  perche a combatterla sono ragazzi giovanissimi  praticamente bambini  Riesce a turbare e lasciare un senso di smarrimento senza pero moralismi ne autocommiserazione  Una scrittura asciutta  che non lascia spazio al superfluo e descrive magistralmente quanto succede E difficile spiegarlo  Leggetelo   I have read many war books before  both fictional and autobiographical  Some stories are so painfully real  like A Long Way Gone or A Thousand Splendid Suns  They re about adolescents having their childhood ripped away from them when they are forced to be child soldiers  about homes being bombed and limbs of loved ones flying by right before peoples  eyes  about the obvious kind of sad that s just cry able and heartstring pulling sad  This war book was different because it was supposed to be sad but also funny  There were absurd situations and absurd characters  The whole book was absurd and peculiar and so darn good  It made war seem so pointless  which was the point I loved this  There were so many good quotes  I love good quotes  I eat and drink them Water not soda  Stay healthy  kids Blistering satire and non linear tralfamadorian grief  Very funny  and also very harrowing  More punch in each sentence than in my entire previous reads obese 20 000 word page count   ok  I ll stop moaning about  American Gods  now   If you ever find yourself having read a book that you feel has robbed you of 20 hours of your life  read this immediately and all will be well again Anyone else reckon Kilgore Trout is a thinly veiled Philip K  Dick  Que livro  que livro  A genialidade de Vonnegut e sufocante  A forma como recorre ao absurdo para explicar o inexplicavel  como desnuda o horror    e um livro que nao e feito para entreter  e uma falha completa nesse sentido  como o proprio autor prenuncia  Mas era o unico jeito de faze lo  nao ha atalhos Nao bastasse toda a grandeza  este livro ja valeria por uma unica passagem  de duas paginas  em que Vonnegut nos convida a uma perspectiva diferente sobre a guerra  de um angulo absurdo  mas tao simples  tao sagaz  que da vontade de chorar  Leiam este livro  por favor  I started reading this book straight after I finished reading Vonnegut s  Cat s Cradle  thinking it s going to be similar  being written by the same author  or at least that it would have a similar style writing  Nope  Completely different  This is a depressing  and yet very beautiful and human novel  It is very cleverly written  While reading it it didn t make a whole lot of sense to me  but in the next few days after I have finished it I couldn t help but keep thinking back to it and analysing it constantly  This is when I really started to appreciate this novel  Pairing the nonsensical nature of Billy Pilgrim s fantasies of the alien race of Tralfamadore with the nonsensical nature of war  Vonnegut creates an excellent anti war book  There is something beautiful about the Tralfamadorians  philosophy  Even after things are destroyed  we can still see them  whole and at their best in a past moment  However  at the same time  that allows the Tralfamadorians to close their eyes to pain and suffering  to wear blinders so they may only see the pleasant moments  Vonnegut  on the other hand makes a point of all the destruction in the world  even if he does so in a humorous way  He does not allow us to ignore the unpleasant moments  even if the Tralfamadorian s have that privileged  This is an incredible book  It addresses the illogic of war  the way in which economic stratification has shaped the United States and who serves  as well as the consequences of actions  I need to read more Vonnegut  I first read Slaughterhouse Five in a high school history class and it floored me  I was so obsessed with the topic of Dresden that I drove my friends batty with my rants and discussions  This was around 1980 and at that time  there still wasn t a great deal of published material on the unconscionable fire bombings by British and American air forces at the end of WWII  The entire episode was very likely a war crime  although because of the other atrocities of WWII  it was swept under the rug I was so moved that when I went backpacking through Europe in 1995  I made a stop in Dresden on my way from Berlin to Prague  It somehow gave me closure to see a city being rebuilt  although decades after it should have because of the fall of the Soviet Union  There is some seeming silliness to the book in that the main character leaps around time and to another world  but it all just seems to come together in a way that stuck with me my entire life  Call me tardy to the party  but I recently read my first Kurt Vonnegut novel  SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE  I began with this gem on the advice of a friend and was not disappointed  The story follows Billy Pilgrim  an unenthusiastic  ill trained American soldier fighting in WWII  His despondency and disdain toward war contrasts harshly with the reality around him  bombings  death  destruction  and his lackluster character is undeniably endearing  The narrative jumps seamlessly through time  literally  there s time travel    from Pilgrim s birth to his death and everywhere in between  completely out of chronological order  To delve into the plot and summary would likely turn into an extensive essay  as this novel is a hodgepodge of science fiction and history of love and war  of life and death  But it s Billy Pilgrim s character that kept me hooked the whole time  I wasn t sure if I should love him or hate him  but ultimately  I just wanted to hug him  Teaching this book to my Experiencing Literature students at Rowan has truly given me a new perspective on its greatness  I was almost moved to tears addressing the class after we read through chapter 6  We were having a discussion on what a certain passage meant  on how the Tralfamadorian point of view was un human  how things aren t  stuck in amber  and how we CAN do something to  change the world     do you think Vonnegut thought he could  change the world  when he wrote this book   scattered nods and shaking of heads  scattered yeses and nos and idon tknows   Does it matter   No  Even if it is only a little piece of the world around us that we have a positive effect on  it s worth it  Even if our idea of  changing the world  into a more positive place to live only involves encouraging others to read and learn from books like this  It was a gross oversimplification  but something snapped  Clarity rang  They got it  I couldn t breathe   Wonderful book  It s fabulous given the point of view of a person suffering from PTSD  how the author underplays all the horrible parts of a war and focuses more on seemingly trivial events which truly define one s life  Loved the philosophy of the aliens about life and death in terms of moments  Though the book is funny in a weird sort of a way  the supposed time travel is difficult to get used to  Definitely going to read more KV books    Iak ne kruti  a viina vchit  liudei togo  iak nebezpechno i bezgluzdo buti geroyichnimi personazhami

from the Tralfamadorians is true  that we will all live forever  no matter how dead we may sometimes seem to be  I am not overjoyed  Still  if I am going to spend eternity visiting this moment and that  I m grateful that so many of those moments are nice    269  Life is cruel and time continues on relentlessly  We as humans lack the control of so much in life  What we can control is our own perception of the lives we live  we can choose what we want to notice and remember  Reality is light and dark  focus on the good things in life to remain happy   So it goes   While the book focused on the brutality of war and human coldness during it  I was more affected by the novel s views of life and death  living and remembering and being remembered  Vonneguts writing is beautiful and funny  Book was tremendously easy to read and stayed both funny and sad throughout  Want to read more Vonnegut  What an absolutely FANTASTIC book this is  I ve been fairly cynical about Vonnegut s work after reading Breakfast of Champions  but this just blows all previous books I ve read out of the water  If you haven t read this book you ABSOLUTELY must  I could not believe how what happened in Dresden has been covered up for so long  and validated with talks of  what the huns did to London   What happened in Dresden was as pointless and malicious as the murder that takes place near the end of the novel  I found myself laughing throughout and thinking  should I REALLY  be laughing at this  Although Dresden is presented in the view as  it should not have happened  as a reader I didn t feel as though that view was forced upon me  and reached the conclusion through further research that it was a horrific act of war  and by doing that Vonnegut allows the reader to view the disaster as never seen before  Superb  fantastic  Finished it in a day  This was such a fast read  I m going to have to go through it again  I tried making sense of things  but gave up on it halfway  because it s like one of those Chinese puzzles  your finger gets unstuck and you are free only if you stop struggling  Vonnegut s writing is something like that  I think it s easier to take in if you don t try and analyze it too much  even though some of the the symbolism and motifs are downright undeniable  blue and ivory feet  anyone    In depth review coming soon   There are almost no characters in this story  and almost no dramatic confrontations  because most of the people in it are sick and so much the listless playthings of enormous forces  The first time I read this book a few years ago  I didn t enjoy it all  I am convinced it was because I wasn t ready to read it at the time  Or to be more Tralfamadorian  there exists two moments now in time simultaneously happening where I am reading this book and being disappointed in it  and another where I am reading it and devouring every word  Perhaps I shall ignore the first experience and only ever look at the latter  I love how the first thing you learn about Billy is that he is unstuck in time  and as you venture with Billy   you find yourself unstuck as well  Time loses all meaning and connection as you jump from moment to moment  not quite understanding time in the fourth dimension  but coming closer to experiencing it than never before   Billy Pilgrim has come unstuck in time   This intro to one of my favorite books will always haunt me  This is perhaps Vonnegut s most famous work of science fiction and it is both accessible and groundbreaking  The novel jumps back and forth  often without much notice  between various time periods in the protagonists life  from the fire bombing of Dresden  to his life on the planet Tralfamadore  to his life at home with his wife and children  Vonnegut utilizes the technique of disrupting chronological order to reflect the elasticity of time  and it allows the reader into Billy s bizarre existence  never knowing where he ll end up next  Vonnegut s language is succinct in almost Hemingway fashion  but there is none of the machismo or glorification of war  At its core  this is a meditation on life  death  and the human condition  and this novel demonstrates how one can write about an even which seems too overwhelming for words   This book is an absolute masterpiece  I ve read it and reread it over and over again throughout the past couple years  Vonnegut s simplistic writing style and twisted  dark sense of humor perfectly combine to create a story that s intriguing  humorous  an depressing  Following the life of a WW2 soldier who s consciousness has become unstuck in time  this novel takes you through random points in his life  and creates and emotional connection to him through its almost surreal description of his tragedy of a life  Vonnegut throws in offbeat comments about things around him that add to the black comedy style of the book  I can t recite it word for word but I specifically remember one part where the main character passes a Nazi officer and Vonnegut goes off on a short tangent about how the officer was eventually going to hang himself  It s dark things like this that make the book an amazing piece of literature  Genius  obviously  Not only is it truly genius but I would also be booed off stage for saying otherwise  On that note  has anyone noticed how Kurt Vonnegut  above and beyond just about any other writer I can think of except maybe Stan Lee  engenders the purest and most worshipful man love in just about every literate male I know  I m not being sexist    I mean  I love me some Vonnegut    but there s something about his writing that speaks to the masculine condition  or anyway  mostly white male masculine condition  in a way that is both profound  touching  resonant  and real  i e   un sentimental  un saccharine   And that is one of my favorite things about him  in a time where I m watching any number of brothers and guy friends and male figures in my life deal with the shifting dynamic of the traditional heteronormative power structure  it makes me really happy to know that Vonnegut provides a touchstone for reality for them  First published in 1969  Vonnegut was writing about the evils of the destruction of Dresden and civilians during the Vietnam war Billy Pilgrim wanders through his life and through time with no control and no input  Each death   human  animal  and at one point water   is marked with the phrase  So it goes   As part of this reread  I watched John Green s Crash Course Literature on Slaughterhouse Five  I highly recommend it  Kurt Vonnegut s  Slaughterhouse Five    Slaughterhouse Five is my favorite book of all time and I d give it 5 stars any time  I really enjoyed this book because it give an interesting and new insight on the afterlife and even life as we live it now  Even during a war  it makes us think and laugh  Billy Pilgrim was my favorite character because he is so funny and awkward in every situation  This book may be mostly for man because the main character has the brain of a main and thinks the way a man does that a woman might find horrific  although it is at quite a high level  This book was just as a review by Life stated it would be  splendid art     a funny book at which you are not permitted to laugh  a sad book without tears   Such a joy to read  This book was so simply written yet it was filled with intricate prose and ideas that made you want to laugh and cry at the same time  It s so raw and ugly yet light and funny at the same time  Vonnegut truly had a gift  I hope to read more of his work soon  Cats Cradle is on the top of my list     It had to be done   Rumfoord told Billy  speaking of the destruction of Dresden  I know   said Billy  That s war   I know  I m not complaining  It must have been hell on the ground   It was   said Billy Pilgrim  Pity the men who had to do it   I do   You must have had mixed feelings  there on the ground   It was all right   said Billy   Everything is all right  and everybody has to do exactly what he does  I learned that on Tralfamadore  The best part of the book   an seemingly apathetic yet appealing prose  What can I say  It s classic Vonnegut  I love his writing  which is bleak  depressing  clever  and hilarious all at the same time  And you gotta love those Kilgore Trout story synopses he throws in  they make you wish Vonnegut had pursued some of those story ideas too  but they re so perfectly worded that you know he s already said all he needs to about them This book is extremely interesting in its portrayal of a story line which is both linear and non linear at the same time  making use of the frame story in a strange and intriguing way  A pretty cool idea  and an almost plausible time travel story of sorts  It must have been very difficult to write it in such a way that it was so effortless to read This is only the second of his books that I ve had the pleasure of reading  the first being  God Bless You  Mr  Rosewater   I wish Vonnegut were still around  because I dread the day I finish reading his work  I don t think I ve ever read a book as non linear as this  Kurt Vonnegut tells the reader from the very beginning the exact words that end the book  but those words give absolutely no clue about what happens on the way  I m not sure if the aliens were intended to be an allegory for post war mental illness  or if they were truly there  or what  I don t think the reader is meant to know  Vonnegut has no respect for the fourth wall whatsoever  and it s a fantastic literary device within the context of the story  He is a character unto himself  and he kicks in the door and enters whenever he damn well feels like it  The repetitive themes throughout the story give the reader some ground to stand on even when there s no telling what time in Billy Pilgrim s life we will end up in next  With that  we ve come to the end of this review  So it goes  When I first started the book  I thought it would be one of those heavy  boring war stories  Boy  was I wrong  Vonnegut is able to effortlessly jump from one time period to another  with the reader right on his tail  Being an anti war novel  it doesn t directly deal with any of the things that happened in the war  but rather with the experiences of those in the war  in this case  Billy Pilgrim   I look forward to reading many more Vonnegut books in the future   A funny book at which you are not permitted to laugh  a sad book without tears  a tale told in a slaughterhouse This book has been splendid  I d keep it right after  Animal farm  by George Orwell and I d add so many stanzas from this book as my favorite ones  The author tells this atrocious tale in a matter of fact  almost a stoic way which makes it more intriguing  On a warm evening back in 2003  at an anti war film festival at Muslim Hall Ctg  the day I met and talked to a real communist in person  I watched my first war movie   Full Metal Jacket   I was devastated  I kept thinking if all those spectators at the hall were going through the same agony as I did and how come it s possible that human beings rage war against one another till this date  Later  as I grew up I came to know that the greatest truth in this world is only one  that is war  death to be more precise  This book brought me back to 2003  So it goes  Slaughterhouse Five deserves to be remembered as a classic 20th Century English work   There isn t any particular relationship between all the messages  except that the author has chosen them carefully  so that  when seen all at once  they produce an image of life that is beautiful and surprising and deep  There is no beginning  no middle  no end  no suspense  no moral  no causes  no effects  What we love in our books are the depths of many marvelous moments seen all at one time   I don t know why I waited so long to read this book  I have read several others by Vonnegut  but for whatever reason this one never made it s way into my hands as I devoured novels in high school  Perhaps it is for the best  as my perspective post college makes me a very different reader  This book is excellent  It is a powerful anti war statement from the perspective of those who have been through it  and without idealistic notions of peace  It is thought provoking  touching and humorous all at once  Seriously  read it already  Should be read just for the sake of having read something as something as this book Now  that s not helpful  But I m afraid I can t really describe this book  Every line of dialogue  as strange and convoluted as it may seem  is meaningful in some way  In its bizarro structure  this book managed to do what few books  such as Great Gatsby  managed to do  It was full of meaning  If that didn t help  well  Just read the book  Vonnegut is without doubt my favourite author  Reading his best work is like sitting crouched in a small cupboard under the stairs opposite the genius himself  The light is dim  maybe from a low wattage bulb or a candle  He spends the time telling you a story  and although you can tell he doesn t take it that seriously given the absurd situation  his story is laced with the sublime  and you cannot break eye contact until he is finished  Slaughterhouse Five is the best example of this  A very interesting read  a whirlwind of humor  profundity and philosophy  the famous anti war novel tells the story of Billy Pilgrim  an American veteran of WW2 who survived the fire bombing of Dresden as a POW  The story spans practically his entire life  but is told almost entirely out of order as he  time travels   letting his mind wander wherever and whenever through time  A fantastic book  Would highly recommend  Beautiful  beautiful  beautiful  This is my first go around with classic literature  I wish I had read it much sooner  There isn t much I can say about this novel that hasn t been said already  except my own opinion  which is READ THIS  It s deep  funny  charismatic  charming  it has a life of its own  really  I m going to lend it to my brother who has not read it yet and then I ll be delving into it once again  before putting it on my shelf to be read countless times in the future   I have been meaning to read Slaughterhouse Five for years  It s been sitting on my shelf in my books that I will someday read pile for so long that I picked it up last week simply to  get it over with   I felt like I really ought to have read something by Vonnegut by now  and was ashamed that I hadn t  I wasn t particularly looking forward to it  though  For some reason I didn t think I would find it interesting Wrong  So  so wrong  After the first 40 pages or so  it was difficult to put down  I m wary of saying that a book has  changed my life  so quickly after reading it  but this is certain  not a day has gone by since I read this book  and some time has passed   a week or two   and I ve read books in between then and now  that I haven t thought about this book  The concepts of time  death  and dying presented in this book are so innovative and interesting  This book is amazing  Believe the hype  This is so incredibly good   which i guess shouldn t surprise me  since it s one of the  great American novels    but the first time i read it was in high school  HATED it then  Thought Billy was just weird and that Vonnegut must have done more than his share of 60s era hallucinogens  Re reading it now because my son  a junior in high school  left it laying around  and 30  years later   I get it  Billy s got PTSD  And the way he sees the world  having lived through the deadliest conflict in human history  totally makes sense  My sincere apologies to Mr  Vonnegut for curling my lip and saying   Eh   whenever anyone asked if i d read Slaughterhouse Five  Now need to reassess hundreds of other opinions I developed as a callow youth  but damn  don t know where to start Favorite quote so far   Like so many Americans  she was trying to construct a life that made sense from things she found in gift shops   First of all  I love anything that Kurt Vonnegut wrote in his lifetime  Secondly  with all of the rave that Slaughterhouse Five was given  I expected this to be the greatest of his works  For me  this wasn t the greatest that I have read  That honeor is bestowed upon Galapagos and Hocus Pocus  but this is still going to be one of my favorite books of all time  The basics of this book  Billy Pilgrim gets transported through time again and again by the Tralfamadorians  Alienesque creatures that abducted him once upon a time  It tells of his time in World War II  his life with his wife Valencia  how he dies  So it goes  There are bits of his time at the Tralfamadorian zoo where he is displayed for all the aliens to observe for months  maybe years  that are transcibed on earth as mere seconds  I especially loved all the mentioning of Kilgore Trout  He is one of my fave Vonnegut characters  So  read it  You will love it  I tried reading this book over the summer  when I had no knowledge of how the book was written  and what I would have to understand before reading  After reading and being confused for fifteen pages of the book  I gave up  I m glad I gave it a second chance  It is a really funny  eye opening  well written satire on war and life The main character Billy Pilgrim was in Dresden when it was bombed in WWII  He was there as an American POW to Germans  and was one of few to survive the bombing of the city  He had bad PTSD from the bombing  and after he was one of two survivors of a plane crash a couple years after the war  I think he went crazy  He claims a flying saucer kidnapped him and took him to a different planet  He time travels  through the whole book  from beginning   but has no control of where or when he goes The book is very confusing if you don t do research before reading  but I d highly recommend it  Fun fact  the death count of the firebombing of Dresden was provided by David Irving  who later was discredited after he was found to be a Holocaust denier  This is largely irrelevant  as the book is fantastic  Reading it was like putting together a puzzle  and it was immensely satisfying when it all came together  Also  if you took a shot every time Vonnegut uses the phrases   so it goes   you would be dead before you got halfway through the book  This repetition really does emphasize just how many people died during WWII  as all the deaths could be easily overlooked  were it not for Vonnegut marking all of it with   so it goes   The deterministic philosophy of the Transfalmadores was extremely interesting to read  especially when the refuse to stop one of their own from destroying the Universe in the future  despite advance knowledge of the event  It s a great book  and I would recommend it to anyone   My friend bought this for me after a discussion about our favourite books   I d never heard of it  or the author  But then I am a fiction ignoramus Anyway  I like it a lot  It was described to me as  about the bombing of Dresden    so that s what I expected  It s not what I got  but I think I like what I got more  I ve heard a lot of people compare it to Catch 22  I guess that s fair enough  but I would say that Catch 22 is about highlighting the absurdity of war as it happens  through the soldier s experience  Slaughterhouse 5 seems more to question how we can reconcile a massacre  through the eyes of a veteran  That is to say  in a way it s more about the aftermath than the event  hence the time travel  The conscious post modernist motif about the  ironic  climax   every great war novel has to have an ironic moment   brought a smile to my  historian s  face  The  so it goes   after p 5  did not   So it goes This short sentence is the crux of Slaughterhouse Five  Three words  with so much context built around them  Three words  with a thousand pictures worth of meaning  Three words  recurring  referencing the all around futility of war  set in the context of WW2   repeating so often that death seems to become a commonplace event  one not be dreaded  but accepted as just another state of being Futility  too  is a central theme of the book  Billy Pilgrim travels from place to place  from time to time  acting almost passively  as if in a preordained manner  He never attempts to cheat events when he already knows their consequences  because he knows that he cannot change what is or what was or what will be  accepting everything  including death And yet  the author assumes immortality in his words  While Vonnegut passed away in 2007  his ideas remain  forever  So it goes  Let me first defend myself when I say I recommend this for History fans  My degree is in History and I think any writer who takes any historical event as a basis for a book is doing a good thing  True  Mr  Vonnegut throws in a time jumping alien abducted man  but the heart of the novel is the firebombing of Dresden and that really did happen  Kurt really was there when it happened  Sometimes the easiest way to talk about something painful is to make up something silly to put around it  I think this novel really makes people stop and think about things that are done in war  Some things should be done differently  Areas are still bombed to this day  but the strikes are better planned and certain buildings are targeted  Back then  mass bombing and widespread destruction were a favored tactic  not only Dresden  but also what happened in Hiroshima etc   One of the best books I ve ever read hands down   A brilliantly told narrative with engaging plot  interesting characters and a powerful message  After reading the last page I felt this overwhelming feeling of  well  it is done   without knowing it the phrase and feeling behind the phrase  so it goes  had leached into my psyche  I think that is the tell of a great book  the ones that leave a lasting imprint on your way of thinking  whether you realise it or not  One of my absolute favorite novels of all time  This is the quintessential Vonnegut novel with lovely dark humor  a wonderful plot  and characters that allow you to appreciate the wide range and depth of the human condition  While this book is not for everyone  I ve heard plenty of people who hate this even as Vonnegut fans  for me it is one of those rare books that I can finish and pick right back up again   A war novel about the impossibility of writing a novel about war  Being in the wrong place at the wrong time  or the right place  if there was such a thing at the wrong time  or something like that  Time no longer having effect  if you re lucky or unlucky  A good introduction to a portion of Vonnegut s writing  but you ll see that he changed before and afterwards  and probably was okay with that sort of thing  Skipped this in high school and decided to re visit in middle age  I was not disappointed  The horrors or war are evenly balanced with humor and sensitivity and  as I have since learned on my recent Vonnegut reading binge  he is absolutely the most kind author out there   his eye is always on the reader and his her enjoyment  enlightenment and entertainment  This will be an annual or bi annual re read in my library  Still kind of shocked at how good this was  I blew through it faster than I do most books  I think what arrested me the most is that this book expresses better than anything I ve read  via the main narrative conceit  what it s like to keep revisiting traumatic memories  One does feel like a time traveler  constantly living past and present all at once  It s also violently anti war  War destroys civilization  Reduces humans to animals  I can t recommend this book enough  This is the best anti war piece of literature that I have ever read  It is like a naive picture that tells the truth ever so bluntly  Its fragmented  yet so orderly structure makes it easy to read  The atmosphere is so calm and serene that it only heightens the seriousness of the topic  The details are so neatly placed into the story that it is impossible to duck from their powerful effect  I liked it very much  This was on my to read list for years  Might sound silly  but the title put me off  The title doesn t really clue in to what the book s about  It s about a few things   read it yourself and interpret  Slaughterhouse Five is intelligent  whatever that means   serious  and written in bite sized  reader friendly chunks  Absolutely deserves its status as a classic of its kind  Don t let the title put you you off   I have no doubt  upon reading it  that Slaughterhouse Five is a great book  I m less convinced  after reading it  that Slaughterhouse five is a good book  I certainly enjoyed it  albeit not as much as Cat s Cradle  and I would recommend it as informative reading and indispensable for anyone who likes Vonnegut  but it failed to impress me as a book I would enjoy re reading or would recommend casually to a friend  I m sure no one needs me to tell them how terrific Slaughterhouse Five is  It s an American classic  However  I feel compelled to comment on it only because it was the first book I ever read  at age 16  that truly affected my way of looking at the world  Up to that time  I expected life to play out like a movie with valuable lessons learned and justice even handedly meted out  With my parents divorcing and my father spiraling down the drain of alcoholism  I was confused that life wasn t offering that happy ending or hope for the future that I expected  After vicariously living through Billy Pilgrim s life  I realized that none of us have any control over the events we must face and there s no rhyme or reason to it  The book ends with The Serenity Prayer  I had heard the prayer endlessly at my father s AA meetings  When I reached the end of Slaughterhouse Five  I understood its meaning for the first time  I had not read this in entirety ever It was fascinating science fiction with overlap of reality Vonnegut himself was a soldier in WWII  and was at the actual bombing of Dresden  He tells the story about Billy Pilgrim  a man who can travel through time  and relives the Dresden bombing and other parts of his life over and over  He also travels forward in time so he knows when and how he will die  but does not make effort to change any of this  It is apparent through his writing that Vonnegut is there with Billy along some of his travels  during the war  It is a quick read  but one that is so very interesting and compelling  Questioning war  and the destruction of so many things  including society  bringing up thoughts of why this happened and why it continues to happen in today s world  it follows the mind of a man Pilgrim  who has lived through it and in some ways is re living it over and over again   I had been wanting to read this for a while but was put off by people saying it was a confusing book about aliens  time travel and war I found it an easy read and it tells of the authors experience of the bombing of Dresden and how he survived    by hiding in the Slaughter house number 5 in the industrial sector of the city    also the time travel and aliens are mixed in but a thoroughly enjoyable read Cok zor bir konu  kolay okunabilen bir roman   Bir araya getirilmesi cok kolay olmayan bu isi Vonnegut buyuk bir ustalikla basarmis April yayincilik tarafindan yeni basimi yapilmis  basarili bir ceviriyle okurun ilgisine tekrar sunulmus olan roman  oykuleme bicimi  bilimkurgu dan ikinci dunya savasinin acimasiz gercekligine gecisi  hayat varolus olume dair soyledikleriyle mutlaka okunmayi hak ediyor  I really enjoyed this one  I listened to the audio version read by Ethan Hawke  There are so many layers to it  i loved the idea of being unstuck in time  The author sums up the book to his publisher Sam  within the book It is so short and jumbled and jangled  Sam  because there is nothing intelligent to say about a massacre  Everybody is supposed to be dead  to never say anything or want anything ever again  Everything is supposed to be very quiet after a massacre  and it always is  except for the birds And what do the birds say  All there is to say about a massacre  things like  Poo tee weet  Poo tee weet   closing lines  Simply one of the best books I ve ever read  or probably ever will  It s that good  Historical inaccuracies aside  specifically the number of casualties in Dresden   every time this book made me laugh  which was very often  the very next second I wanted to cry  I also wanted to tattoo quite a few sentences on my skin  It s that good  I even was able to disregard the blatant misogyny  It s that good   I read the majority of this book at the Consulate General Peoples Republic of China in Los Angeles  I was also listening to  Electric Feel  by MGMT repeatedly  I m really glad I decided to stuff this in my backpack last minute before my road trip  I will not pretend that I completely understand this book  I will just say that it was definitely a thought provoking read  I never really found myself questioning my perception of time before I read this  Or the existence of an infinite amount of dimensions in the universe  This novel makes me rethink my own construction of reality  I hope I come across Slaughterhouse Five again in college  because it would be interesting to discuss  Every time I read a book  I get an urge to write a ten page paper about it  but then laziness overwhelms me  That being said  I better run into this short but fantastic novel again in my life  I m sure I will   Some of my favorite parts so far Science Fiction   Satire   WW2    Awesome Children Crusade stuff  Terrible  but interesting  He watched war movies in reverse   Think about what that would look like  and you ll get how very beautiful the idea is  His execution of the idea  and the way he describes it  is even more     hmmn  I don t have a word for it  Simply tranquilly beautiful  How s the patient   Dead to the world   But not actually dead   No   How nice to feel nothing  and still get full credit for being alive  Oh yes  and the phrase  So it goes   To describe anything truly horrifically terrible Vonnegut also satirizes societal labels incredibly well   Until he was written in by the Red Cross he was MIA  most likely dead  He signed a paper and got his life back  behind him thousands more were born again in a blasted wasteland So far  soo soo good  This was my first Kurt Vonnegut book and it was incredible  surely will read more of his work   After my last experience with a virtual bookshelf I had  sworn  not to write anymore reviews due to my prior loss of numerous reviews and books when they closed down said site  but after having finished this book I had to do it  Vonnegut s writing style doesn t leave much to be desired  with his amazingly dark and humorous wit  he makes us travel in time and space over life s downs and hard facts  death and war  iotertwined with comical yet tragic comments  Slaughterhouse is one of those books that grabs the gibberish in your head  or life  shakes them  and voila  a new you  I may be exagerating  because it touched some sensible chords in me  but it does put some things in perspective  It has a well deserved spot on  modern  literature  despite its 43 year life span   So it goes  Poo tee weet  Writing a traditional book review for Slaughterhouse Five is impossible  The book is as much philosophy as it is literature  It is a rare feat of language  Using the nonlinear life story of Billy Pilgrim  Vonnegut navigates regions of human experience to treacherous to be reached by any but the most gifted authors  His imagination consumes the reader  transporting them to a place suitable for meaningful reflecting on the impacts of war  time  life and death rarely available in the course of our everyday experiences  Against a back drop of time travel  fourth dimensional space beings  World War II  and the fire bombing of Dresden Vonnegut wrestles  all holds barred  with the paramount concepts of free will and human nature  Both comedy and tragedy the novel contains moments of pure poignant brilliance  Whether or not you like his style  reading this book will enrich your life   To be read with The Things They Carried in one s war literature exploration  My favorite passage   Under morphine  Billy had a dream of giraffes in a garden  The giraffes were following gravel paths  were pausing to munch sugar pears from treetops  Billy was a giraffe  too He ate a pear  It was a hard one  It fought back against his grinding teeth  It snapped in juicy protest The giraffes accepted Billy as one of their own  as a harmless creature as preposterously specialized as themselves  Two approached him from opposite sides  leaned against him  They had long  muscular upper lips which they could shape like the bells of bugles  They kissed him with these  They were female giraffes cream and lemon yellow  They had horns like doorknobs  The knobs were covered with velvet   I received this book on lend from my brother  who d received it on lend from a friend This being the first book authored by Kurt Vonnegut to be consumed by my eyes and then brain  it s the book that started my insane obsession with Kurt Vonnegut  To this day I m still caught in the throes of adoration for him  One of the most impressive things about Kurt Vonnegut s work is the ability he has to draw emotion out of a person  He can transport himself into your brain and actually MAKE you feel what he needs you to feel for his character  The most difficult part of reading this book was reading  and experiencing all the terrible things that Billy Pilgrim experienced  I pitied Billy Pilgrim  I held him as a hero  I was enraged at the people s lack of understanding at his being unstuck in time  Most of all I was happy to have found a kindred spirit in Kurt Vonnegut to make me laugh again   This is a book I have heard people talk about for most of my life  and one I never thought about reading because I always assume the books any school tells you to read  is going to be boring  I decided to pick up a copy anyway while waiting to pick up my brother from the airport  I think having waited until I was in my late 20s and had served in the military really helped me to appreciate it in ways my friends that had to read it in high school could not I m not going to point out parts of the story I liked and did not like  but want to say this book was life changing for me  Completely altered my outlook on life  and I can t recommend it enough  No other book has ever had me crying and laughing as hard as this book  The paradigm shift has me seeing life and death in ways I don t think I d have ever considered on my own Buy this book  Read it this book  Share this book with everyone you know  Trippy book  very good  The general theme of this book is fate vs independent will  if one sees everything that will happen to them before it happens  will that mean that foresight does or doesn t change where the future will go  If Billy Pilgrim has seen his entire life flash before his eyes  does he expect everything to just happen to him  Or will his knowledge make him act in favour or against the predictions of the future  I don t know  Find out  Read the book  All my other reviews contain spoilers  so I m not letting that happen with this one  If you look at this from the temporal aspect  it all gets very wibbly wobbly timey wimey esque  Personally I believe fate isn t real and Billy Pilgrim was suffering from PTSD  How else to explain his unnoticed absences in life  mentally and physically  Also  the aliens  Then the tone of the book changes a bit from during the war to after   This is the essential read for those interested in Vonnegut  It is what made him famous  mostly  although many of his other works are quite brilliant from a dark humor perspective  With this story you certainly get a feel for his writing style and as with every Vonnegut story there is always a cynical look at some aspect of modern society    and it is not very flattering towards humanity  He is definitely one of my influences in my own writing  and I highly recommend that if you enjoy the cynical  the darkly humorous  or even the absurd  then this book is a good first glimpse at Kurt Vonnegut   This book was really excellent  I admit in the beginning it was a bit hard to accept the whole schizophrenia aspect but as I read the book  I realized how this enabled the author to escape the chronological order necessary for most books  This aspect made it unique to read  Also  I had no knowledge of Dresden during WWII and I love reading books that teach me about history  Awesome read   I really actually enjoyed this book a lot  It was kind of odd because of its unconventional narration  but it s one of those books that I can t help but reccomend to a friend  I really enjoyed the way Vonnegut mapped out Billy s life in such a strange manner  it was engaging and also mysterious at the same time  You learn so much about Billy  but there s still so much you don t understand  One of the most interesting pieces of satire I have ever read  Vonnegut is so great at muddling his point that sometimes it seems as though he critique something from every angle and you re not quite sure where he stands  but that s kind of the point  isn t it  For as difficult as it is to understand the points of many points in this novel  it s an engaging read that will keep you thinking   A well written postmodern classic  Some interpreted as anti war  for me  it was a mixup of many good genres  An autobiography  drama  comedy  philosophical piece and tragedy The book is easy to read  and it sometimes leaves you thinking  many times laughing  other times   well  saddening  I believe S5 has a high degree of rereadability also I have come to this book with high anticipation for the author s best piece  and was not disappointed  Billy pilgrim came unstuck in time  And so it goes  This satirical masterpiece of Kurt Vonnegut is a journey through the end and beginning of the life of Billy  the beloved protagonist  I ve always found that my favorite books based on humor was science fiction books  Slaughter house Five has now cemented my convictions  I really liked Billy Pilgrim  the Tralfamadorians  the time travelling and all the mumbo jumbo  I have read all of Mister Vonnegut s books and have liked them all Rich characters  political undertones  and social criticisms aplenty This is my personal favourite of his Although Cat s Cradle held that accolade for a while He s not an obvious writer  you have to think about the undertones in his writing  A master of being subtle in the face of the dramatic Richard  I really enjoyed this book  It was very simple  easy to understand material and therefore  a very easy story to get into  my only complaint is that I find the anti war themes a little too preachy  The writing style is also a little difficult to get used to  Kurt Vonnegut writes in short declarative sentences and because there are a lot of random facts  I felt it was easy to forget or or get confused about events in the protagonist s life  I don t want it to sound like these negative things are overwhelming because that s not the case at all  I felt these were very minor flaws and they re also very subjective  Overall  the story was great and it was an interesting concept  the blending of war and time travel genres  As I understand it  the story was also very much autobiographical which makes it all the more interesting  In conclusion  this was a wonderful novel  and well worth the read  I m not really sure what I expected before reading this book  Now that I m done it I feel that it has fullfilled any unkniwn expectations  it makes sense in the fourth dimension so don t worry   The story of Billy Pilgrim  a time traveling optomitrist who witnissed the bombing of Dresden  The way it is written is not really conventional  It flips back in forth in his life and it kind of reminded me of The Five People You Meet In Heaven but in a more chaotic  darker  comedic way   and I liked it  It s book that you either love or hate and I surely lived it  It has opened a gateway for me to continue reading Vonnegut books     Everybody is supposed to be dead  to never say anything ever again  Everything is supposed to be very quiet after a massacre  and it always is  except for the birds And what do the birds say  All there is to say about a massacre  things like  Poo tee weet    In Slaughterhouse 5  Kurt Vonnegut does a fabulous job of creating vivid and quirky characters who put life into his novel  Although there is some explicit content that is found throughout the book  I do not feel like it takes away from it  but rather gives the characters and the plot more of a personality  I think that Vonnegut did a fabulous job of creating one of the most creative and quirky novels that I have read so far Billy Pilgrim is a sadistic man  who through the help of aliens that he meet through an abduction learns about time and time travel  Throughout the book he goes from World War 2 and the bombing of Dresden  to his life as a depressed optometrist who wants nothing more than to get out of his job and marriage  There is some humor as well as vulgarity  but everything that was put into the book does a fabulous job of making it that much better for the reader   Like many so called  classics   Slaughterhouse Five is one of those books that provokes debate as to its quality  I read it recently simply because it is a book that I remember enjoying in school  when I generally did not enjoy reading  and I wanted to revisit it  There are people out there who cannot stand Vonnegut s constant use of  so it goes   There are people who do not like the way the narrative jumps back and forth through time  There are people who just don t like the way the book is written  I fall into none of those groups  Quite simply  if anything I like Slaughterhouse Five even more after reading it 15 years on from my first enforced reading  Personally I feel like it fits perfectly into the  classic  grouping as a book that is original  powerful  and just a joy to read  Not everyone will agree  but then again life would be very dull if everyone did agree   One of the best books I have ever read and among the few I will read again  The book doesn t fit into any genre  no defined structure yet everything seems to fall into place  It adds to the story  Telling us maybe thatno matter how you look at war  it doesn t make sense  It s crazy It conveys the frivolous nature of war   the casual apathy towards lives taken it s aimless and fruitless conclusion  the living dead that remain and spend the rest of their lives trying to forget  or make sense of what happened and why  They never do  No one wins  Nobody comes out alive  So it goes Only those who are left behind to witness the war from the safety of their bunkers behind maps in war rooms or their thrones spitting orders  can stand on their self installed pedestals and throw their rhetoric justifying the inanity of war with flags   boundaries  So it goes     A classic war and anti war novel which I read before  many years ago but this time listened to on recordings  It still kept my attention and reminds of the time quite a few year ago when I heard the author speak at a college in Idaho  It made me want to see the movie again  A nice touch was the interview with the author at the end of the book  More recorded books should do that   This is the only book I read this summer  and likely the only book I was supposed to have read  If you are looking for a story you ve lost along the way  knowing that what you re inwardly seeking is there  you ll be able to relate  If you suffer from PTSD and disassociation  you ll be able to relate  If you find humans to be comical  miserable clocks  then you ll enjoy it   Philosophically speaking and in terms of literary technique and craftsmanship  this book is incredibly well written  Despite the nature of the extraterrestrial life  it doesn t come off as far fetched  and has really evocative messages about life  death  and all its endless and immortal frames of peace and suffering in between  It s a short read  but with loads of punch  as is characteristic of Kurt Vonnegut s writing  I ve seen the book many times among Books to Read  But as i never read about a book before i start it i had no idea it is about WWII  It is a great book with time travelling elements when main character  Billy Pilgrim  criss crosses back and forth through his own life and death  I would definitely list it to anti war books with lots of irony in it  My opinion is that Slaughterhouse Five has to be read  So it goes  A classic I would deem a classic as well  He tells the story as a painter would use minumum brush strokes of black and white and then throw in bright orange or a dash of pink  Story of a man who lived through the Dresden bombing during WWII  Amasing that Vonnegut wrote this book almost 70 years ago yet it remains relevant and reads without embarassment  And so it goes      One of my favorite books  partially due to circumstance  I will admit that I did not like it very much when I first read it  but after having to analyze the hell out of it during a rough time in my life  I bonded with the novel in a way I had never done so before  This was the first novel where I felt I gained so mucn more from analyzing it than I had when reading skimming it  An otherwise deceptively easy read  Slaughterhouse Five conveys the detrimental effects of war through the rich use of imagery  symbolism  flashbacks  and metaphors  We follow Billy Pilgrim around various points of his life as he comes unstuck in time  I believe the use of reverse psychology is evident through the repeating use of  So it goes    which seems to downplay the destruction of war when it is trying to tell mankind to raise its moral standards to create a better and more sustainable future for all  Absolutely enjoyed this classic  Sirens of Titan recently blew me away  and so on Alex s suggestion I decided to read Vonnegut s best known book  Slaughterhouse 5  and it was even better  I can t believe I lived this long without reading any of his books before Slaughterhouse 5 is ostensibly about the horrific firebombing of Dresden  which Vonnegut witnessed as a US PoW   but that is like saying the bible is about a carpenter  Spanning time  and interweaving sci fi concepts  mental illness  the loss of old age and of young lives  Slaughterhouse 5 is playful  hilarious and tragic Vonnegut s narrative is as fresh today as when it was written  with a blurry distinction between author  protagonist  the story and the process of writing it  Some paragraphs contain more ideas than whole novels I have read Please read if you haven t already  it s only short   but don t expect to borrow my copy  No se dejen llevar por lo corto que es el libro  Slaughterhouse Five es una de las novelas mas ambiciosas que he leido  Vonnegut no se propone solamente contarnos una historia  sino comunicarnos toda una forma de ver el mundo  Pero el reto es mayor al que enfrenta el antropologo promedio  por dos razones  En primer lugar  la Weltanschauung en cuestion ni siquiera le pertenece a una poblacion humana  sino a los Tralfamadorianos  una civilizacion para la cual el tiempo  tal como lo percibimos nosotros  es una ilusion  En segundo lugar  el reto es grande porque se trata de ver uno de los episodios historicos mas importantes de la humanidad a la luz de la cosmovision tralfamadoriana  Pero tampoco se dejen apantallar por las metas tan ambiciosas del libro  Vonnegut es un escritor esplendido y nos entrega un libro a la vez profundo  comico y ameno  Lo recomiendo ampliamente  How does this book get a 3 91 when so many other Vonnegut novels pick up 4  average stars I guess this is a common read for many people who aren t fans of his style  Still though  this is considered one of his most important pieces for a reason  They ve already been said here  So do yourself a favor and ignore the lower reviews and pick this up  because it s simply his masterpiece I ll only address one criticism and that s of Vonnegut s repetition of the phrase  So it goes   It s clearly meant to highlight how common death is in nearly every facet of our life  Even though it s a book about war  the phrase comes up so many times in places that we d easily ignore the passing of friends  animals  acquaintances  family members  etc  I think this adds to one of the dominate themes  which is viewing fatalism without pessimism  It is certainly not pointless nor bad writing   Virkelig sjov  jeg grinte hojt MANGE gange Jeg kunne ogsa virkelig godt lide at der var sa mange personer med i bogen  jeg havde fornemmelsen af at Vonnegut kendte dem virkelig godt  jeg er sikker pa at hvis man spurgte ham om en af personerne ville han kunne fortaelle hele livshistorien pa dem  Han var ogsa virkelig god til at give dem  liv  jeg havde meget let ved at se dem for mig  hvem og hvordan de var  det kunne jeg virkelig godt lide Billy var ogsa bare sa sod SPOILERHaha  jeg griner stadig over nogle af tingene  fx  just go on without me   so it goes  billedet af Montana Wildhacks medallion  alle de boger af Trout haha  og det billede der blev taget af ham under krigen hvor han lignede mona lisa  fordi han pa samme tid cruisede i sin cadillac coupe de ville   at han ligenede en klovn med sit toj i krigen   hahaEn bog jeg helt sikkert vil laese igen  gerne snart  One of the few survivors of the Dresden bombings  Billy Pilgrim has become unstuck in time  Thanks to the Trafalmadorians who captured him and put him in a zoo with a B movie actress  he revisits various moments in his life such as his time in WWII  his post war marriage  and even knows precisely when he will die  As a result  his children have a difficult time connecting with their father  But is he crazy  or just resigned to his fate Perhaps Kurt Vonnegut s most popular story  and with good reason   Slaughterhouse Five  is more about how we choose to view the world around rather than worrying so much about how it will all end  We can either complain about the mundane ins and outs of our lives  or we can see where life takes us  The theme of fate vs  free will is present throughout  but in the end would it all matter if our entire life is happening simultaneously  Slaughterhouse Five was a book I read last year on my own  It has an extremely unorganized plot  but set up in a creative and attention grabbing manner  Billy Pilgrim is a character with very little dialogue and you never really have the chance to connect with him on a personal level  you just start to understand his views on life and his insanity  I think Vonnegut didn t intend for you to connect with Pilgrim on a personal level because it adds some of the mystery to his personality  The books plot is set up in a jumping timeline which instead of telling Billy s life story in order  it gives you it all at once  but tells a different more philosophical story in the process of jumping around the plot  This effect leaves you with a very insightful look on this story s message and gives you a good feeling  I definitely recommend this book  even though we are reading it in class   4 5  Before reading it for a class  I knew a book called Slaughterhouse Five existed but not much else beyond that  I think I subconsciously judged the book from its title and had the idea that it was basically like Lord of the Flies  which I absolutely did not like  so I had low expectations for how much I would enjoy this book  Then I found out it was about World War II  which changed things  Even more things were changed when I actually started reading   this book is original and weird and deep and sad and so complex  It s very much theme driven rather than plot  or character driven  which was new and strange for me as I normally value books by the strength of their characters above all  Fate vs  free will  PTSD  the brutality of war   there is so much in this book and I definitely recommend it as a unique  very readable  thought provoking classic   Slaughterhouse Five should be a must read for all government officials and anyone contemplating joining the armed forces  I must have read this in high school but I failed to appreciate the novel for the brilliant work that it is  The message to take away is war messes up everything  I wish there were more books that showed the horrors of violence instead of romanticizing it  WowThis book is a must read and I m sure it could leave anyone with a multitude of different feelings  but one that certainly sticks with you is a perspective of war that might make it difficult to not  at least for a good while after completing the book  beg for peace in this world  all the while knowing its likelihood has already been determined   When I first read this novel it was actually assigned to my older brother to read for school he had complained that it was hard to understand  so out of curiosity I picked it up and started reading it  I fell in love with it instantly  I read it 5 times before he finished reading it  He was pretty pissed that I didnt have a problem following the erratic timeline  He got really angry when I offered to write his book report for him  It s a great story  Slaughter House Five is a postmodernist dream or reality depending on the moment  This was most surprising novel for me because i had to read it for Literature class in college  i felt someone  perhaps Vonnegut s ghost was in my thoughts  dreams and imagination i highly recommend it  but if you get offend easily  then you might to skip Vonnegut and read John Grisham   I started reading this with the impression that I would find it chaotic and hard to enjoy  I was wrong  I love this book  The point of view of a man who has a different perspective on time and life is perfect for someone to describe one of the most horrible war scenes in history No one can describe the death of so many without distancing themselves from the reality This story is perfect  Had a lot of fun re reading this book  whole new perspective as an adult  Especially appreciated the notion that we never really die  Death is just one of the myriad moments that make up our life  and we are always alive in those other moments  The book is structured with that philosophy in mind  a series of interconnected events  defying time  Great humor  and great insight  The synopses of this book that I read were so misleading  They all sound so totally wacky  This novel is far from wacky   it is deadly serious and Billy Pilgrims trips forward and back in time  to the bombing of Dresden  and to a planet far from earth serve to illustrate the lunacy of war and how damaged a person becomes because of it  It is an amazing piece of literature  I had only ever heard of Kurt Vonnegut or Slaughterhouse Five randomly and always separately  Never known much else about it other than it was an obscure title and author out there somewhere  I just happened upon this book and was intrigued   and then    couldn t hardly put it down  The story was very interesting and some of his descriptions of events were explained in a way I ve never thought of before  I really enjoyed this book and have and will recommend this to many others   The classic must read by the master of dark humor and satire  This story follows Billy Pilgrim through his life to his capture by the Germans in WWII  and his survival of the fire bombing of Dresden  Billy has become unstuck in time after his abduction by aliens from the planet Tralfamadore  so the book s plot line is also  unstuck in time   Similar to Catch 22 in it s use of dark humor to take an anti war position  A Reader s Corner Highly Recommended read  This fantastic blend of time bending fantasy and grim war account is a true masterpiece  Kurt Vonnegut  having personally witness the burning of Dresden during WW2  an event both claiming more lives than the Hiroshima bombing and under reported  becomes the voice of a fictional Billy Pilgrim  a reluctant member of the US army  prisoner of war  optometrist  husband  father  time traveller  alien abductee  but not necessarily in that order I couldn t classify this as a pro or anti war book  In the words of the author   This Tralfamadorian faith in the total pointlessness of trying to change anything makes Billy feel like everything he has gone through  no matter how awful  could not have gone any other way   The prose is both crisp and witty  with a healthy dose of humour injected into it  Pick up this book  and go one your adventure of a lifetime   Slaughterhouse Five brings the reader on an intensely confusing ride through the life of Billy Pilgrim  In true Vonnegut style  the writing is casual and easy to read  I finished this book in one day because I could not put it down  With the base of the book focused on a true historical event  the reader can almost believe the incredible tales of Billy Pilgrim  It took me forever to finish this novel  I tried reading a little bit each night before bed  but found it too difficult  The nature of the story makes it hard to follow in small clumps  I eventually took one weekend to start from the beginning and read it through  It was well worth it  the story does more than make an argument against war  It talks about how war effect life afterwards  The disjointed memories are like Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome  and Billy Pilgrim tries to make sense of it all I had to watch the movie made in 1972 for a class about time theory  After watching it I was blown away and wanted to read the book  Now that I have  it is funny how the themes suddenly have changed  Oddly I don t have much to say about the book that hasn t already been said  I think Crash Course does a great overview of the themes presented in the novel  It my personal opinion  as always  this book was very good  The plot moved along and the writing style kept things interesting  It was certainly unique  It very well illustrates the effects of war in a very human setting through war s actual effect on people  While gore and gruesome events are never described in detail  the character s response and attitude towards them reflect war as  not an event  but rather an experience  One criticism I have heard is that the excessive page breaks distract the reader and are disruptive  I do not agree as I feel the page breaks adds a sense of disconnect and discontinuity to the book and better illustrate PTSD and perhaps the the state of the main character  I can see their point of view and deducted one star for this and only this reason Overall  an engaging read that really sheds light on the condition of war   Slaughterhouse Five is a satirical novel about World War II and the sci fi time travel trips of a soldier named Billy Pilgrim  The central event in the story is semi autobiographical and deals with Vonnegut s experiences as a POW during the firebombing of Dresden  Germany  It s replete with Vonnegut s kooky black humor and dazzling insights on human nature  Absurdist  postmodern metafiction with the non linear narrative of Billy who comes unstuck in time  This book was a messianic experience for me in that I found my bits of thoughts and philosophy set to a narrative and wonderfully articulated  Even the stereotyped sexist portrayal of women seems to fit in quite well  and didn t put me off  A book to read again   I m really glad I picked this one at the library  It it an audio version read by Ethan Hawke  I was worried that it wouldn t be as powerful in this medium  however  I thought Hawke did a great job with the text  To be honest  I knew this was about war  but that is all I knew  It was definitely not what I expected  In many ways  it was unlike any book I ve ever read  Vonnegut succeeds at so much in this book  It follows the life of Billy Pilgrim  a veteran who has witnessed the bombing of Desden  The book jumps all through his life in no particular order  one second you re in the war  one second your on another planet  yep  he gets kidnapped by aliens   but it all works so well  And his message reads loud and clear  war and death are senseless   and so it goes  I totally get why this one is a classic  It s all messed up  but in a very good way   I m happy to report that I ve finally finished Slaughterhouse Five  close to ten years after I should have read it and 7 after trying to read it because some girl I thought I liked insisted I should  I didn t really like her  but I had no muse at the time and thought I needed to chase some tail to keep me busy  I didn t like what I read of the book then either  but I fucking get it now  It was really good  and it was really funny  Henry s Vonnegut Curse is officially over  Unfortunately  it s another one of those books that feeds into my fascination with death  I think about death all the time  Not just mine  I mean death in general  It amazes me when I realize that A  I m alive  and B  everybody except Cher is going to die one day  Everyone  And it s like I m constantly trying to figure out what it all means  and the likely answer is  nothing   Slaughterhouse Five was always one of those books I thought I must read but never got round to  It turns out that I was not ready  I know that if I had read this book earlier I would not have appreciated it  The structure  the aimlessness and basic rejection of plot devises mean it is not a book for those looking for a good ol  story to send them off to sleep  Vonnegut encourages you to see the universe  society and your life in a new light  Not a negative light or a revolutionary light  just in a different way  I am so pleased to have read this book now  I keep dipping back into it to reread passages which really jumped out at me  It is a sparse book  beautifully crafted and brimming over with metaphor  A brilliant  funny  insightful book which gets into your bloodstream  Slaughterhouse Five is one of the most affecting books I have read in years  Years and years ago I read this book and it was quite different then  Or maybe I was  I always seem to see things differently even though the literary kaleidoscope is the same  time worn  but the same  I downloaded this audio edition from my local library  listened to it on my MP3 player Kurt delivers his prose in such a way that the reader has no option but to ponder beyond what is delivered  There is certainly a measure of absurdity with a character like Billy Pilgrim believing he has been put up in a Tralfamadorian zoo  and a sadness too How people cope CAN enter the world of the bizzare  War can do that  Each of our lives contain fractures and we attach meaning to these things the best we can  It is part of the human condition The narrator of this title  Ethan Hawke  does a stunning job delivering the story  actually adding to the experience  This was a book termed as an anti war book  However  the book did not seem like anti war propaganda  In fact  it was a catchy tale about a man that I feel that we can all relate to  For this to be an anti war book there is way too much drawn from daily life  On the other hand  Vonnegut may have been aiming for just that  He talks about the aliens  once touted as peaceful  as saying that they just ignore the terribly bloody wars and focus on the good stuff  I feel that ignoring the problem was really not what was being proposed here  I think if that were possible  then this book would not have been written  I could say more about the intrinsic qualities of this book but I would be accuse of glorifying war or something like Vonnegut was in the opening of the book  It is not good  just seemingly inevitable and linked to people like strands of DNA  This is truly a book to behold  I may have found my new favorite novel  I would rate Vonnegut among Salinger and Bradbury as being one of my favorite authors of all time  If you  the reader  have not had a chance to read this book  I highly recommend that you do so immediately  It was highly captivating and kept my attention throughout the entirety of the novel  I think you d probably struggle to not give this book five stars  It doesn t really have much of a complex story  yet confuses you early due to its simplicity  Throughout each chapter of the book  you are given the beginning  middle and end and the concept that time is not an A to B process exists throughout  Quite clever  really  Vonnegut made me laugh quite regularly during this  I don t think I ve read anyone before who can pull a penis joke out of no where and make it seem so mature and almost elegant   Vonnegut at his best  He did witness the horrific true holocaust of the once beautiful city of Dresden  before allied bombers totally destroyed the city and burned a substantial portion of the civilian population  The numbers are hotly disputed  but credible scholars have it as over a hundred thousand dead and of course many more permanently injured  Inspiring quotes   Welcome abour  Mr  Pilgrim   said the loud speaker   Any questions  Billy licked his lips  thought a while  inquired at last   Why me   That is a very Earthling question to ask  Mr  Pilgrim  Why you  Why us for that matter  Why anything  Because this moment simply is  Have you ever seen bugs trapped in amber   Yes   Billy  in fact  had a paperweight in his office which was a blob of polished amber with three lady bugs embedded in it  Well  here we are  Mr  Pilgrim  trapped in the amber of this moment  There is no why     If I hadn t spent so much time studying Earthlings   said the Tralfamadorian   I wouldn t have any idea what was meant by free will  I ve visited thirty one inhabited planets in the universe  and I have studied reports on one hundred more  Only on Earth is there any talk of free will     I had only vague memories of half reading this at school  and I m still kind of kicking myself for not revisiting it sooner  It s absolutely excellent  equal parts hilarious  insightful and crushing  There s not really anything I can say about this book that hasn t been said before  but I do love and appreciate Vonnegut s expert narrative use of farts  Should always be read in it s original language  otherwise you d miss the sharp and burning humour that this master of the black sattire wields  This book is still one i always go back to and everytime i still get the chills while i turn the pages  Vonnegut doesn t just write  he speaks in a solemn voice that wraps around you and doesn t let go  Ever  The classic novel in which Vonnegut relives his experience as a POW and the firebombing of Dresden in WW2 via the fictional character of Billy Pilgrim  This being a Vonnegut novel  there s also time travel and aliens  I read this over 20 years ago   and it made me an instant Vonnegut fan   but I was inspired to re read it after a recent visit to the Kurt Vonnegut Memorial Museum in Indianapolis  It s every bit as good as I remember it  The book not only showcases Vonnegut s skill at non linear storytelling that doesn t lose the reader  but also demonstrates his ability to make you laugh at the horrors of war and the sadness of life on Earth without trivializing either  Vonnegut s sense of absurdity probably isn t for everyone  but it s perfect for people like me  Simply put  for my money  it s one of the best anti war novels ever written   WHAT A MODERN CLASSIC  THIS ONE BOOK CHANGED THE WRITING OF SCI FI TO THE MORE HONEST APPROACH TO LIFE ITSELF  A MASTERPIECE  A TALE OF A SIMPLISTIC HUMAN BEING USED ABUSED IMPALED UPON THE MORALE ISSUES OF AN ERA  IT IS CANDIDE IN SPACE I LOVED IT   SINCE I WAS 14 IT WAS ALL THAT SCI FI IT TOOK ME ON BOARD THE SHIP ONLY IT WAS TO BE THE BEST VOYAGE OF THE WEEK   I MISS THAT KURT VONNEGUT TOUCH OF THE GENTLE HUMORIST   HE WRITE S IN THIS BOOK OF HIS TIME AS A PRISONER OF NOT ONLY REAL LIFE WARS HE WAS AMERICAN G I  OF GERMAN DESCENT DURING THE Fire BOMBING OF THE GERMAN CITY OF DRESDEN  i Learnt more than schoolboy history of the events of the second war i learnt the humility of suffering any one in combatant scenario goes through   i also re learnt my teenage belief s that second wind as a student reassessing the purpose of life   I hated telling people to read this book when I was a senior in high school  because I was the first of my friends to discover it and no one else knew jack shit about it  Invariably they d ask me  Well  what s it about   And I d have to tell them  World War II  and they d say  I don t like war books    Time Travel    I don t like science fiction    Aliens    I really don t like science fiction  And yet  it s not really about World War II or Aliens or Time Travel  Is it This is clearly Vonnegut working at his absolute best  and I hope this book remains forever in the public eye  even if the rest of his work slips into sci fi pulp obscurity I don t laugh out loud that much when I read  but this book did it to me on a number of occasions  and yet  I don t know if it s all that funny  20th century literature  comedies to make you cry   I ll start off by saying that I ve read all but 2 of Kurt Vonnegut s works  This was one of the first that I read and to this day it remains my favorite  As a matter of fact  it s probably one of my  all time top 3   In  Slaughterhouse Five  Vonnegut somehow manages to tell a story that is simultaneously quasi sci fi  psychological  funny  and a deep study of human morals  It s a book that will have you laughing most of the time while you read it  then somber when you think back on it as a whole  It manages to get across the anti war morals that Vonnegut feels  but NEVER gets preachy or heavy handed  I don t want to ruin any of plot  and you can see descriptions anyway  so I m not going to bother to delve into it  I ll just say that this is a once in a generation type of book and it s a quick read too  so you owe it to yourself to give it a shot Vonnegut s apotheosis  by his own accord  and probably because it s his funniest  By this I do actually mean  funny   of the gasping for breath variety  Laughing at the grotesque is a given with Vonnegut  but here it s the entire point   There isn t anything intelligent to say about a massacre   he warns  which is a secondary point he s been making it since at least Cat s Cradle  He suggests  therefore  that we should do our mental health a favor and laugh as often as we can  By this I do actually mean  laugh   This one time  in high school  I actually rolled on the ground  This other time  as I read this book  incidentally  I honest to God slapped my damned knee  which surprised the hell out of me half an hour later  So it goes  NB  This is  after all  a war book  and despite the wonderfully apt Nancy  Vonnegut s is still mostly a man s world   An absolute treasure  Very seldom one comes across the kind of dark humor  sarcasm and tragedy all at one place  There is a tragedy going on and suddenly u r taken to a time  a scene where u can t help but smile and from there to a certain dark humor line n you wonder  why the hell didn t I know that such stuff exists  Highly recommend  Beautiful book  In Vonnegut s characteristic and unapologetic style of writing lies a much bigger message for the world and for humanity  A perfect example of a post modern meta book  Slaughterhouse Five will be a book that I m sure to re read multiple times  with every read invoking a different sense of thinking and epiphany  So it goes  I didn t know what I was missing until I read Slaughterhouse Five and now Kurt Vonnegut is one of my all time favourite authors  This is one of those books you read several times throughout your life and I wanted to flip straight back to the start as soon as I had finished  Such an insightful look at war  humanity and self that I just loved   I assigned myself a stack of classic novels to read this year  and this is one of those  I love that it is structured somewhat like an experimental time travel science fiction novel  a cross between a Philip K  Dick story and The Time Traveler s Wife  with a man who is shifting through time  experiencing bits of his WW2 experiences as a POW in German occupied territory  including Dresden during the firebombing  and his life afterward as a husband and father  plus bits of his time spent as an exhibit in an alien zoo  The alien zoo setting pretty much provides the imagery for Billy s experience of time  as a human translation of nonlinear  4th dimensional storytelling  pretty cool for an anti  war novel  This would have been a fun book to read for a literature class  or for a reading group where it could be discussed more thoroughly  I read this book because Gavin Extence s novel The Universe versus Alex Woods mentions Vonnegut  I m in high school  and I think that this book should be required reading for all students because it has a lot of lessons that need to be told to my generation  I was amazed how Vonnegut wrote about Dresden and time travel  and it flowed so well  I love Vonnegut in the first place so I was sure this was going to be a wonderful read  Having read Cat s Cradle  I felt I would recognize the writing  In many ways I did  but in other ways I felt he took a slightly different approach  A non linear story with a heart that bleeds  Dark and strange but a wonderful read nonetheless  So it goes    I need to reread more of my favorites  I had only remembered bits and pieces  which weren t enough  just incredible  I had kept reading posthumous and late vonnegut publications  after having read his catalogue  and I had forgotten just what it was about him that is so unparalleled by anyone else  Great reminder  so dopeand well worth the reread if you haven t checked it in a while I have a tendency to love almost every piece of media that comes in contact with my brain  This book  however  I loved  I absolutely loved it  Maybe it s because I venerate Vonnegut so much  or maybe because of the wit  I don t know  The style of the novel was a style that I can totally get behind  I even loved the time unstuck ing 10 10 Slaughterhouse Five surprised me greatly and in a good way  I read this book in only 9 days  which is a short amount of time for me  The pages almost turn themselves  This book belongs to that wonderful group of books that one can read for hours without getting bored The story is of Billy Pilgrim  a WWII veteran who comes unstuck in time  The narrative jumps around in Billy s lifespan  and he experiences different moments in his life and jumps to others  Billy s life is an interesting one  he was in WWII at the bombing of Dresden  gets unstuck in time  and is abducted by aliens  the Tralfamadorians  and put in their zoo  Vonnegut uses all these disparate experiences  and some other  more pedestrian ones  to make profound insights and humorous commentary alternately Fascinating  funny  engaging  and never dull  I loved it  This book was amazing  No one could be so confused with time travel in his her life until they see it in this perspective  Yes it was a very intresting book but keeping up with it was the hard part  This book teaches people that past tribulations affect what someones future holds  even if it means letting it go  The main character here is not so much stuck in time  he was just being forced to grow up when he wasnt ready and now things become mind dazzeling for him  The motif of time in this novel teaches one to be aprriciative of the life they are givin because time waits for no one  Imagine yourself wondering about life when its over  whats the point of trying to avoid what is not going to dissapear  Time is the essence of everyones life and this novel just uses it as a backbone for a character to survive and accept his own life  Kurt Vonnegut s famous  Slaughterhouse Five  once again disappoints us  with his classic message that when there is indeed such thing as the power of free will  This tale of a less than heroic soldier  Billy Pilgrim  begins with an all too self aware description of how the novel came to be  then gets right into the story of Pilgrim and his misadventures  Vonnegut s writing  formula  is followed to the tee in this book  which is perhaps why it has achieved such great success  but great substance is hard to find as he focuses on plot over meaning  Those who are compelled more by intellectual stimulation will find entertainment in only the aforementioned theme of free will and the argument of this in some of the dialogue  But  even this dialogue is basic and this book should be noted for its apparent ability to captivate and nothing else   I really loved this book  I have friends who are rabid fans of Vonnegut  but the ideas and style he was said to write in just  turned me off   and I never had much interest in trying him out  But I finally did  and am pleased at that  This is a satirical novel  written in a series of looping flashbacks  of the life of Billy Pilgrim  a man traumatized by WWII and life in general  who is abducted by space aliens  and learns that we live our lives over and over  and he transports to scenes of his past at seeming random  Vonnegut s  voice  is rich  sarcastic  funny at times  and  more often  tragic  He explores many themes still relevant today  such as humanism  free will and choice  war  family  wealth  and fate  Nominated for several industry awards when written in 1970  and still powerful and fascinating today  I thoroughly enjoyed this novel  Not only was the quality of writing so fantastic  but it was easily accessible and I didn t have to keep checking up on myself to make sure I understood it  The story of Billy Pilgrim s life was so in depth and moving from even the very beginning and because of it I became so emotionally involved  His life was so interesting and I loved that even though it was somewhat fantasy I could see the correlation of the writer  Kurt Vonnegut s experience in Dresden to to Billy s  It s just as the blurb on the back says   It s a funny book you don t laugh at and a sad book you don t cry about  I would recommend this book to anyone with a strong love of reading who has the ability to comprehend heavy issues and would encourage young readers  like myself  to give it a chance  Trust me  it is SO worth it  The narrator s decision to write about his memories of the bombing of Dresden as a sci fi novel is at first bizarre  Over the course of the book the juxtaposition of what he saw as a WWII prisoner of war with his protagonist s time travelling  alien abduction and mundane life as an optometrist serves only to highlight the devastating effects of war  The device  interspersing the tragic with the absurd  somehow renders the ending simultaneously more shocking and more bearable  And perhaps  more than that  the scenes on Tralfamadore etc increase the tension  I found myself  during each out of space detour  increasingly impatient for the next installation of the real story  the Dresden story  As most war novels are  this is book about insanity on so many levels  but it tells its tale memorably and with a wild  funny abandon   This is a very good book that uses non traditional story line  The main character seems to jump through periods of his life slowly revealing his traits and those of the people around him  This is a very interesting way to write about a topic that really happened in WWII  He had alot of ways to show this   time jumps through time almost flashbacks and flashforwards  discussions with aliens  and through the simple actions in the war  He basically makes science fiction out of historical fiction  Before reading this I never even knew about the fire bombing of Dresden which is a very historically significant event  He links seemingly unrelated events into a coherent story  And there is no surprise as too what the story is about since he tells you about the fire bombing at the beginning  and he also tells you that this guy he knew gets shot  I read this in high school  and picked it up again a few days ago  I love the way Vonnegut sort of circles around the tragedies  by describing them as they will happen  not as they happen  It doesn t do what you think it would do  distance the reader   instead it makes the event feel both grand and unimportant Highly recommended  This book is amazing  After my first reading I can see why people love it  although I do prefer some of Vonnegut s other novels  This book is everything you would expect from Vonnegut  the wit  dark humor  fun but weird sci fi aspect and of course commentary on war  life and love  Read this  you will be confused and amused   A real page turner  funny and philosophical while at the same time describing the horrors of war and the Dresden firebombing in particular  Again I did not read this book  I listened to it  I never knew Ethan Hawke was a voice actor  nor did I knew his voice is so very pleasant to listen to  fitting the tone and subject of this book very well   Il mio primo approccio con Vonnegut e stato piu che positivo  con Mattatoio n  5 l autore americano mi ha portato indietro e avanti nel tempo  sulla terra e su Trafalmadore  dipingendo la storia di un individuo singolare  Billy Pilgrim  Egli si muove dalla Germania nazista dove viene fatto prigioniero a un pianeta dove viene rinchiuso in uno zoo Vonnegut ebbe un esperienza diretta con il bombardamento di Dresda che e al centro del romanzo e dalla vicenda ha creato un capolavoro  un inno contro la guerra  La sua maestria sta nel narrare una realta cosi tragica in modo paradossale  Nessun sentimentalismo  solo disincanto  Un libro di nemmeno 200 pagine con un ritmo ben scandito dai paragrafi e dal cinico refrain  cosi va la vita  Scorrevole  ben scritto  originale  dissacrante  cinque stelle  I didn t expect to finish this book in a day  but it moved so easily that I couldn t put it down  The somber atmosphere Vonnegut creates with his storytelling is mesmerizing  While you move quickly through the tragedies of war  and life itself  you never mistake the harsh reality with apathy  Instead  you feel the magnanimity of it all  for better and worse   This is one of those  glue your eyes to the page until it s done  type of books  but it has weight and substance that stays with you  view spoiler   He supposed that the intent of the Gospels is to teach people  among other things  to be merciful  even to the lowest of the low  But the Gospels actually taught this  Before you kill somebody  make absolutely sure he isn t well connected  So it goes   Montana was naked  and so was Billy  of course  He had a tremendous wang  incidentally  You never know who ll get one  doxology  n   A liturgical formula of praise to God   hide spoiler   Witty  horrifying and enlightening all within 177 pages  The picture of boobs was an asset  too  It may be too early for me to say  this being only my second book by Vonnegut after The Sirens on Titan  but I m finding this fling with Kurt becoming something more  He finds a way to tell horrible stories  a lot of which are true  with magnificent sci fi spins  in a dry  pragmatic way  His messages are clear cut and brutal  but comedic all the same  Vonnegut is a truly inspiring classic author   One of my all time favorite books   Slaughterhouse Five  is piercingly tragic and darkly comic  Vonnegut transports us through World War II and afterward  through the eyes of an innocent  His survival during the war and his disappointing and troubled life afterward are made bearable by his visits to the planet Tralfamadore  They are the only way that Billy Pilgrim can make sense of the cosmic injustice that permeates his life  If you want to have your mind pulled to the limits of reality and unreality with no explanation allowed then pick up this book  It s hard enough reading a book on a beach which is what I did with this and  of course  Vonnegut made it as difficult as possible for me to get my mind around every little detail he presents As usual  he is not writing a story  More of a critique and a heavy satire on the world surrounding us  Unlike Cat s Cradle which seems to be a much easier read  Vonnegut really pushes his skills to a level that even he knows he oversteps  It does not make this any less of an exciting  thrilling and captivating book With his repeated phrase of  So it goes  and the main character s repetition of events in his mind creates a whirlwind  a cacophony of thought that is all at once quite human and flawed  Vonnegut spent many years deliberating over how he was going to write this book  Given Vonnegut s reputation as a brilliant American writer  I would think that fact alone would be enough to sway many potential readers  Vonnegut s experiences in the Second World War clearly show through in this bizarre  fractured attempt to address the firebombing of Dresden  and the innocent people who suffered as a result  A refrain featured in the book is the tweeting of a bird   Poo too weet   This bird and his meaningless mantra conveys Vonnegut s thoughts on expressing the inexpressible  in the face of such horrifying inhumanities  what is there to say  This question is exactly what Vonnegut explored in this book  and what drove him to spend years pondering how he would write it  I hope his would be readers don t take quite so long  Flawless  The story of Billy Pilgram  of his adventures through time and space  of his stay on the planet Tralfamadore where time and space are irrelevant  of his  and Vonnegut s  experiences as a prisoner of war in Dresden during the city s fire bombings by the allied forces  of his life and of his death  is one that should be made known to everyone  if only to prove to them that stories can be  and usually are  so much more than just stories  They can be life changing out of body experiences of the type where time and space become irrelevant  Vonnegut really shines in this one  showing off his satirical finesse and his profundity in equal measure to build a whole portrait of a life at once remarkable and familiar  Because the cliche has never fit better  I ll just say this  read it  you ll laugh  you ll cry  etc  So it goes  Kurt Vonnegut        I m already missing him Here s an apt description of the book from the book  There are no telegrams on Tralfamadore  But you re right  each clump of symbols is a brief  urgent message  describing a situation  a scene  We Tralfamadorians read them all at once  not one after the other  There isn t any particular relationship between all the messages  except that the author has chosen them carefully  so that  when seen all at once  they produce an image of life that is beautiful and surprising and deep  There is no beginning  no middle  no end  no suspense  no moral  no causes  no effects  What we love in our books are the depths of many marvelous moments seen all at one time  Also  about war  Everything was alright  and everyone has to do exactly what he does  I learned that on Trafalmadore   Both this and Catch 22 are funny  although they both eventually hit you in the guts and make you cry  oh  god    usually multiple times  the multiple anti orgasm   I think this one is superior  Less relentless in its pursuit of gags   or rather  going less for gags and more for surreal humour  Billy travels backwards and forwards in time  and is most fond of his time spent as a zoo exhibit for aliens on the planet Tralfamadore  where he is forced to mate with movie star Montana Wildhack    and so the contrast to horror is less contrived when it does appear  So  probably my favourite war book  which itself doesn t talk explicitly about the war all that much until the end  A must read Vonnegut died a couple of days ago  Is that a reason to read this book now  Not really  But it gives you something else to say  K V  was my favorite author when I was in college  and although a lot of his books haven t stood up to re reads  Slaughterhouse Five has proven to be a great book  one that I ve picked up a half dozen or so times since that first amazing read when I was 18  I would definitely suggest this as a starting point for Vonnegut newbies as well as those who have read one or two of his more lackluster works and found them lacking  Much of the story is based on his experience in WWII  when as a POW held in Germany he survived the atrocious war crime that was the indiscriminate firebombing of the civilan and refugee filled city of Dresden by Allied bombers  His take on it  though sad and humane  is told with his trademark dark humor and off the wall sci fi flourishes  this one including time traveling aliens shaped like toilet plungers    This was the first Kurt Vonnegut novel I read  after stumbling upon some of his short stories in the library  And now I can t get enough  Slaugterhouse five is the mix of true  sad  insightful  and goofy that Vonnegut is known for and I believe a great way to get introduced to his work  if you re just getting started  Maybe our hero did get abducted by aliens  or maybe he just has PTSD   it doesn t really matter  the point is clear  war is always being fought by children and no one really comes out alive  Vonnegut manages to cram a sci fi story  a life story and the repercussions of all wars into a quick read   quite an achievement  if you haven t  read it now  A gripping  provocative  unforgettable account of an internal and external war and post war struggle  loss  triumph  and resignation  This is the kind of book you reread when you need to restore your faith in the power of literature to elevate your consciousness  Curiously nihilistic and profoundly witty  I ll probably read it again for enjoyment before I read it again for depth  but it s outstanding any way you look at it  I have been looking for an opportunity to read a Vonnegut book for at least a few years now understanding that he is a special writer and knowing that I would probably have to be  in the mood  for his style  I was not dissapointed  It is a little hard to follow the line of his story at first but once you see the threads that he is weaving it flows very nicely  He is an author that allows the reader to decipher meaning in subtle ways  There was no illusion as to what Slaughter House 5 was about  it was an anti war book  It s the way that Vonnegut lays the story out that makes it unique and draws the reader in  it is a story about people yet there are no heros or villians as he says  the story simply is  Very unique writing style that tells a story without a lot of clutter  Excellent book overall in my opinion  Slaughterhouse fiveSlaughterhouse fiveThis book held my attention with talks of irony and historical horrors of war seen through the eyes of Billy a world war two veteran  The story was about Billy s life after the war and how it affected him  I enjoyed the writing skills of the author  I found this book simply amazing  I couldn t help thinking about it when I wasn t reading it  It took me three days to read this book  and while doing so I was constantly engaged  the writing almost funny in it s blatant satire  that s what Vonnegut is know for I suppose    So it goes  appears dozens of times  making light of the horrible events in the characters lives  Horrible because some of the book is set during World War II  Some of it is set on an alien planet  That s the beauty of the story  the main character travels through time  not under his control  and experiences segments of his eventful life  Such an original and throughly entertaining plot device  I won t ramble on and give away more of the story  but I suggest everyone read this book  It s a quick read but definitely the best book I ve ever read   What an amazing book  It reminds me of the movie Memento  and not just because of movement in time  They re both pieces of art that are experienced  not just read watched  Slaughterhouse Five has so many levels to it  There s the chronological story of Billy s  Vonnegut s   time in WWII  there s the story of Billy s travels in time  and there s also the perspective of the Tralfamadorians to take into consideration  One thing that stuck out for me was the narrator s comment about spending eternity  apparently after having died  unstuck in time like Billy was  Was this supposed to tell the reader that Billy didn t actually become unstuck in time until after he died  I m not sure  but there are a lot of great questions like that to ponder from this book  Like how did Billy return from Tralfamadore  for instance  Slaughterhouse 5 is a wonderfully crafted piece of art Drawing upon his experiences of World War 2  Vonnegut sets to tell his story through the eyes of Billy Pilgrim  soldier  optometrist and time traveller  The quality of this novel is astounding  I found it incredible how so much could be said in so few pages  I loved that Vonnegut doesn t shy away from relating his observations in war to the human condition  There is a certain air of futility that runs throughout the novel  one which is backed up by the authors experiences of mankind s total lack of humanity and dignity  Each act of depravity is followed by his dark sense of humour  evoking strong feelings of disgust in the reader  This is a novel of meticulous observations  and is much a piece of therapy for Vonnegut as a lesson for the rest of mankind   Awesome From NY Times Sunday Magazine article dated January 6  2013 on George Saunders   Saundes on Vonnegut and Slaughterhouse Five  Saw this after I read the book and thought it was a great way of thinking about the book  I began to understand art as a kind of black box the reader enters    he enters in one state of mind and exits in another  The writer gets no points just because what s inside the box bears some linear resemblance to  real life   he can put whatever he wants in there  What s important is something undeniable and nontrivial happens to the reader between entry and exit   In fact Slaughterhouse Five seemed to be saying that our most profound experiences may require this artistic uncoupling from the actual  If the change will be greater via the use of the invented  absurd material  so be it   It is a novel about war but unlike any other Yes it speaks about death  trauma and absurdity of war as you would expect  But it also speaks about time travel and aliens And somehow it all makes sense It is as absurd as it is brilliant Side effect  going to make you want to read all of the Vonnegut s books  Fantastic book about the banality of dying and killing in war  The unreliable narrator is incredibly well done and the subtle reveal at the end of the book is impact full it demonstrates how someone who seems to lead a very successful is so completing stuck in the war and how that slowly untangles his whole self  I finally read this book  and also it s my first Vonnegut novel  It s definitely weird  Billy Pilgrim goes back and forth in time  from his World War Two days  to a distant planet where he s captive  to many hospitals  and many train rides  Humorous  vulgar  sad  amazing  Once again  I m reminded the hope and hubris of humanity   READ THIS BOOK This was my first Vonnegut book  and definitely won t be my last  This man wrote like a frigging genius  and had a great imagination too  This is a very enjoyable read  witty at times  somber at times  but genius from start to finish  I ll definitely remember this book till the day I die  SO IT GOES  Slaughterhouse Five is about a man called Billy Pilgrim who time travels frequently  It focuses on many different things making it extremely hard to sum up  It is the genius of Vonnegut that makes this book so good  With the ability to make you cry to making you laugh out loud  A BRILLIANT BOOK AND A MUST READ  Incredible book  Classics have a way of earning their distinction for a reason  The main topic is the firebombing of Dresden in World War II  The bombing itself is hardly described at all  Rather  we experience the madness of war and the effect it has on the young soldiers through the eyes of the protagonist  clearly stark raving mad  yet eerily successful in a way reserved for the baby boomer generation  The style is oh so light and care free  belying a dark experience underneath that dulls one to life s pleasures  Oneindig mooi  waarachtig zonder klefheid teergevoelig Het standpunt staat even ver of dicht tov alle argumenten die oorlog of vrede vertegenwoordigen of al dan niet rechtvaardigen  Het boek beschrijft zowel het kleine als het grote kwaad dat de mensheid ondergaat  Het kleine kwaad wordt loepzuiver beschreven zodat het abstracte grote kwaad  waarvoor niemand zich individueel verantwoordelijk voor dient te voelen  voelbaar wordt in het eigen geweten  massale bombardementen door een vloot vliegtuigen op een algemeen erkende vijand   Zodra verpersoonlijking ontstaat begint het geweten van goede mensen op te spelen  Slechte mensen zonder geweten gaan bij dit boek echter weinig voelen     I enjoyed this book immensely and I already want to start over and read it again  or maybe just flip to some random section in the middle and read that  I had somehow missed hearing about this until a friend gave me the book  so I may be saying something very obvious here  but the really clever thing about this book is the way that it s structured  Many authors try to jump back and forth between different times and spaces  but few manage to accomplish it quite so well  The achievement is a compression  or expansion  of the individual into the multitude of timespaces that a person might inhabit at any one time  through their mind  What s left is chaotic but still a coherent  just like life    Besides being clever  it is a wonderfully charming book  I really loved it and look forward to reading it again  This is my all time favorite book  Billy Pilgrim s existentialist journey through time is full of follies and misgivings  This book is unique in that  despite the fantastic  by which I mean of fantasy  not amazing  although it is both  plot  the main character is so relatable  The majority of the story is going on within the main character s mind  rather than outside of it  Black humor is plentiful and tasteful and the progression is novel  I ve read six of Vonnegut s novels and I still think Slaughterhouse Five is the best  After reading this book  I had no choice but to pick it up and read it again  There are so many questions this book raises  Do we have free will  Is it better to live an apathetic life than one filled with extreme ups and downs  The list goes on  Simply put  this book is a must read  All I can say is WOW    This is a masterpiece  I keep remembering David Brancaccio s introduction of Kurt Vonnegut before an interview on PBS a while back   a perfect description of the man and the book  This country has been through a lot in the last month and we ve been out there covering it  But I m thinking its time to pause for the big picture and when the brilliant and irascible Kurt Vonnegut said he was up for an interview  we jumped at the chance  It s rare to get to sit across the table from a giant  Do yourself a favor and read SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE again    like now  this weekend  Before it s too late  I would highly recommend getting unabridged version narrated by Ethan Hawke from Audible rather than a printed copy  The narration is a great bonus to an already superb book  This was my first Vonnegut book to read  I really did enjoy the book from cover to cover  The story of Dresden was something I wasn t at all familiar with before reading about it in this book  I was actually left wanting to know more about it when I finished the book and did more research into the topic on my own  I enjoyed Vonnegut s style in telling the reader about his experiences as a prisoner of war in Dresden  What I liked most was that even though the story is told through a fictional character  Vonnegut is able to put himself into the book  I also found his dark humor  sarcasm  and straightforward way of writing worked really well  All in all  I would recommend this book to everyone who is looking for am intriguing short read  that will keep you thinking about it for days after you finish it  I was so sad when Vonnegut died and  since I d been wanting to read more of his stuff  I honored him by going out and buying this book  I ve read it twice now and both times I ve laughed out loud from the stuff he puts in there  Poor Billy Pilgrim becomes unstuck in time  but not one believes him except for the Trafalmadorians who don t even have a comcept of time to begin with I enjoyed how it would jump from one place to another at random  it really kept you on your toes when you would have to close the book and you d open it up again and not remember where Billy was in time  or even what planet he was on Every time I hear or read about someone dying  I automatically think of the simple phrase   so it goes   because of Vonnegut  No matter how many times you read this  it ll always be great  Confusing and yet blunt  this book had more bouncing back and forth than an indecisive person choosing shoes  I adored every aspect of this book  especially the war flashbacks  This book is almost a palate cleanser  but flavorful enough for me to still want more  God  this plot is so pointless  but it was still hella entertaining   It is nearly 30 years since I last read Slaughterhouse 5  I think age and experience have increased my appreciation of the book  It is even better than I recall  The fragmented nature of the narrative is brilliantly executed  It manages  without preaching  to paint a grim picture of the horrors of war  Like a magician pulling a rabbit out of a hat  Vonnegut shows the grand truth of war through this small story of small characters  their brief interactions told in short  declarative sentences  The plot is absurd  there is no hero  and no characters to become attached to or root for  Yet  I am deeply affected by this wonder of a book  It is one of the most impressive and important novels I have had the pleasure to read   This is one of the most amazing books I have ever read  I got to read it in book club which meant I took actual notes  and basically I had a note for every single page  There are so many good lines in this book  and all the lines put together make something really really really amazing  Oh what I would do to be able to write like Kurt Vonnegut I can t say too much without ruining the whole plot  Just that the storytelling is amazing  the timeline is amazing  the characters are amazing  Kilgore Trout is REALLY amazing  etc  etc  etc  I will write an indepth review which will probably be spoiler heavy  But there s just so much to think about in this book  that I m looking forward to going back through all of my book club notes so I can comment on them all again Everyone should read this book  The horrors of war can truly shake a person to his core  Many of us are blessed not to have seen such a terrible thing firsthand  and I don t think many of us could live the kind of lives we do now if we had been exposed to war  Vonnegut is a brilliant author  and Slaughterhouse Five reflects that   I can t believe how constantly relevant this book feels  Even years after when I read it first in college  I still find it hilarious and so incredibly insightful  I never get tired of examining time  I absolutely love the description the Tralfadores give for how a human understands time  It s just the best  It is a very different read  And there is a finality in the book in every sentence  The book is about Billy Pilgrim who travels back and forth in time wrap stretching from World War Two to a different planet  Even though it is a book about a war it is non descriptive and has been written sans emotions  Thats where the finality comes from  It happened  so it was   so it will  After every death or destruction in the book  the author   the protagonist says  So it goes  So it goes  You either hate the phrase or you absolutely love   live by it  For me it has been the latter  Those three words make a lot of sense where pages   paras   feelings wont even go near to the reality  Apart from So it goes  There are some amazing quotes in the book  I know that i will be quoting them for a long long time   Just re read this in a day  First time in a couple of years  Definitely worth picking off the shelf every so often  and I m not the type to re read  If you have an afternoon off  sit down and go through it again  It grabs a hold of you  doesn t take long and puts you in a different mindset afterwards   Kurt Vonnegut and Frank McCourt remind me of each other in that they were both able to tell stories about truly dreadful  awful things in the most playful of ways  I read this as a young college student  shortly after my then boyfriend  now husband  left for military training  It was an important time for me to read this book and I loved it  I loved the storyline and the narrative pov  It is dark  and funny  and spectacular  First Vonnegut This was my first novel by Vonnegut  I downloaded and read a sample before I bought it  I remember thinking the first chapter read like a crazy  drunk old man with ADHD  That excited me  I would recommend this book to pretty much anyone unless they were dead  So it goes   Very rarely has a book been so graffitied so fast between my hands  So many theories  so much symbolism  so much to think about    And such a feeling of rightness about scribbling in it too    Its as if the book has been on my shelf for a long  long time  I enjoyed the odd narrative  Instant 5 stars  A really  very strange book to read  the overall concept that I think Vonnegut is talking about here  or at least one of them  is incredibly mind bending  The idea that time does not exist linearly  but as one whole moment really puts a great twister into this book  The situations that he has had to come up with the demonstrate this theory are really creative and entertaining  Aliens  WWII  time travel etc  The language that Vonnegut writes with is some of the most beautiful and poetic that I ve read  So many wonderful quotes  A particular favorite of mine is when he describes time moving backwards through the war and how different the war would look like to an observer   healing instead of harming   just gorgeous  A good read  for sure  but you have to be VERY open minded and enjoy the weirdness   UPDATED   Brilliant book  Converted me 180 degrees as a Vonnegut fan after my lackluster experience with Player Piano  I m sure there have been many other great commentaries on this book  so I ll keep mine down to a couple of odd personal observations  I was traveling back from visiting my 92 year old grandad and his wife  87  I couldn t help but draw a line from Pilgrim s experience of being  unstuck  in time with that of senile dementia  Also  I saw the movie of this a few years ago  so I pretty much knew the whole plot ahead of time  However in this case  it almost seemed to improve things    and mirrored the way that Pilgrim and the Tralfamadorians experience their lives  aware of all events past and future simultaneously I will definitely be checking out some more Vonnegut   First things first   I have a new favourite  DThis book is nothing short of a perfect description of what everyday meditation should be   sans romance  Kurt has actually made an effort in making sure that his writing is realistic  precise  without pretence and almost frightfully pragmatic  The story construction weirdly fits  The dark humour is unmissable with style  And he actually shattered all the conventional rules of writing fiction  The book never gets boring  And do take the  never  in a very literal sense  His attempt to play with a non linear timeline just nails the plot  And the writing is relaxed all throughout  even in the face of having one s heels blown off  Needless to say  it s a definite recommendation to everyone  Because  in the end    well it just ends   This was not an easy read  and was odd in places  but that s the point of it  right    If I m right  it s about the pointlessness of war  and of living and dying  Anti religion  anti government  anti war  basically  The act of the main character being able to move seamlessly through time gave the impression that everything had already happened  will happen again  and is yet to happen  Confused yet  I was  Well  I was until I read some passages several times  and flicked back to certain parts  Honestly  I m glad it wasn t any longer  This was hard work  and decidedly harrowing in places  I m glad I ve read it at last though  I think I must have some masochistic tendencies when it comes to reading material  and no tin the erotica sense  necessarily     I do like a book that s a challenge  MesmerizingStrange and sad and lonely  and at the same time engrossing  It is so dreamlike and dreary  with moments of idiotic levity   not laugh out loud  but smile  in the face of enormous tragedy and human suffering  because the characters are still endearing and so very human and clumsy and bright   Thetta var mognud bok  Med theim ahrifameiri sem eg hef lesid a aevinni  Samt stutt og fljotlesin   ad minnsta kosti haettir madur ekki i midju kafi  Segir fra aras bandamanna a Dresden 1945   an

alla  A book for every young person to read just to make sure they know about the horrors of war  Vonnegut masterfully Braquelike smashes up the narrative to be able to flit about between the different parts  Adding the aliens adds that extra self analysis which is playfully and adeptly exploited  a literary classic I found myself surprised to reach the end without having a feeling of completion  The book was great and kept me interested in every word  I  having just now finished  do not know how I feel overall about the work  Nevertheless  I can see why it is revered  The best book I ve read for quite some time and positively the best war book I have ever read  Not that this is only a war book   I loved the aliens  whose perspective on time had a stunning resemblance to that in Ted Chiang s fantastic short story  The story of my life   predating it by decades   Proves insanity is normal  not a reason of victim hood  or an excuse to be judgmental  Particularly at times when life and death are as meaningless as the world  the skewed ambition of humans  their inability to co exist  Yet aspirants of a society  A poignant tale of war  death  hatred and love   This book took some effort getting into  I wasn t sure about it until I got about 60  through  After that I loved it  What a wide gamut  It s little nuggets of social commentary are profound and these little nuggets bubble away in your brain coming to a boil about 60  of the way through the book  I can see why some people don t like the fractured structure of the book  But that s one of the things that makes it so clever   This was a book I had to read for school and I am so glad that I was introduced to Kurt Vonnegut  He is absolutely   one of my all time favorite authors now  This book was so good  It had a bit of a slow start but once you get past that it is sooo great  you really have to read this book  Pat ja kaut kadu nepienemamu iemeslu del nepatik Vonneguta stils ar visu haotismu  Kilgoru Trautu  laika celojumiem un tamlidzigi  8  nodala    Nu ja  8  nodala  Ta ir par karu  Par Drezdeni  Par Menesi Iesaku  apskatit ari sis  Dresden bombing pre  and after pictures   This is the first Vonnegut I have read and I must admit was a little scared of the sci fi aspect to it  What eventuated though was that this was in fact the best thing about this book  It is very easy to read once you get your head around the time travel aspect  I will definitely be reading some more of his novels  My first Vonnegut book  It recounts the firebombing of the German city of Dresden in a visceral and vivid manner which could only come from a mind that actually lived through the most vicious bombing of World War II There s good reason this is his most popular book Truly one of his best  I ve read a lot of war books and this one ranks high on my list of favorites in that genre  Vonnegut has an amazing writing style that I first found appealing in his short story collection  Bagombo Snuff Box  which I accidentally bought at a library sale  Vonnegut s ability to weave humor and irony into devastatingly awful situations during WWII is genius  I was further moved to discover the inspiration for Billy Pilgrim  Edward Crone  is buried in Mt  Hope Cemetery in Rochester NY  where I have lived for the past five years  For some reason  that discovery at the end of the audiobook really brought the novel close to home for me  Ethan Hawke did a fantastic job narrating  although I can t imagine what prompted the movie star to narrate an audiobook  Definitely a worthwhile read  After reading a number of other Vonnegut books I was a bit taken back with Slaughter House Five  It still flows with the Vonnegut I have grown to love but the personel touch of realism that he weaves can only be done so by a man that was there The  lets face it  this still IS a Vonnegut book  mostly World War II setting came on the heels of having read  Catch 22  so my literary warmongering was at a peek  I enjoyed the depth of settings that Kurt pieces together only the way that he can  Very likely that if you are a fan of his lighter stuff you may never dig this book or the others like it  I am a fan of every word he wrote or in some cases simply uttered under his breath Nothing I can say about this book hasn t already been said by the author himself And so it goes  1 pound science fiction1 2 pound historical perspective  yet subjective 1 2 cup minced absurdity2 cloves of  time travel   crushed2 cans of crushed simultaneous existence1 2 cup of water2 tablespoons of fatalism1 2 teaspoon of salt  in the wound 3 4 cup grated humanityThis is the best way that I can describe Slaughterhouse Five  You ll either love it or hate it  You ll either love Vonnegut of hate Vonnegut  I  for one  regard this novel as one of the favorite classics I have ever read  But then again  I have been blessed to stroll the streets of Dresden  Germany with 1 2 pound of historical perspective in my hands in the form of a beer in one hand and a bratwurst in the other   If the accident will     you ll also enjoy Vonnegut s thematically personal recipe  Vonnegut captures pretty well the pointlessness of war  and also the pointlessness of anti war action  The firebombing of Dresden is woven masterfully with the use of napalm against the Vietnamese  and told from the view of a soldier too normal and ridiculous to have been a hero  I rounded up   I initially gave Slaughter House 5 a 4  then decided on a five  For poetry sake  He wrote a way in which humans think jumping time to time in our own past to the present  He adds a dimension by presenting a future  and seeing the end while being in the beginning  Understatedly complex  Optimistically dismal  for coping   Consequently fun  He makes himself a hero by belittling the weight of cruel acts  I chose to focus on the brighter sides of this book  Everyone dies  Thus Slaughter House 5  So glad I finally had time to get around to reading this book  I ve read short stories by Vonnegut  but somehow never got around to Slaughterhouse Five  It was just as excellent and thought provoking as I expected it to be  Completely deserving of its status as an American classic   Me gusta la tematica belica pero odio los saltos en el tiempo  Y encima  era una lectura obligatoria para clase que no hay nada que me ayude tanto a odiar un libro Y sin embargo me ha encantado  lo he devorado en  tecnicamente  un dia y va a mi balda de favoritos  No entiendo nada  pero quiero mas cosas asi  This is only an anti war book because it takes a scientific  cold look at what war is  There are no bouts of romanticism or heroics  There is just war  and without the narratives of bloodless bravery and perfect confidence to support it  the idea ceases to entertain and begins to numb and horrify   I adored this  Loved  loved  loved  Vonnegut is one of those authors I was never assigned in school  and therefore I hadn t read anything by him  I found this for  4 at a used book store last weekend  I m thrilled I read it  and I can t wait to read more from him  What a great book  i really loved the unique perspective of Vonnegut  there s something darkly beautiful  about the lens through which he views reality  and humanity  his frank  no b s  way of describing people and the way they think and act  is profound  inspiring  and extremely entertaining  so it goes  Vonnegut s masterpiece  this book opened my mind back in the 1970s when I first read it  What then seemed a cutting edge structure now seems to emulate the way most of us remain  unstuck in time   Now that Mr  Vonnegut has died  So it goes   this novel seems even more phenomenal     Why me   That is a very Earthling question to ask  Mr  Pilgrim  Why you  Why us for that matter  Why anything  Because this moment simply is  Have you ever seen bugs trapped in amber   Yes   Well  here we are  Mr  Pilgrim  trapped in the amber of this moment  There is no why    This book has one of my favorite opening lines   All this happened  more or less   And though an opener like that  if articulated by someone actually in my life  would have a very different effect  when put in writing by a storyteller of Vonnegut s ilk  I was immediately captivated  And he held me throughout  It s been a long time since my first read  and I m not sure I truly appreciated it in my first go round  After all  the older you get  the more blurred the lines can become   especially for the storytellers among us  My favorite book  I read it once a year  It s insight into humanity  time  war and life are irreplaceable  It s also really fucking funny  If you like dark satire  the bite of realism and a little sci fi in your honesty  you ll love this book as well as most of Vonnegut s work   I really enjoyed reading this book  I love the dripping  oozing sarcasm  It s absolutely wonderful  I did not think I would enjoy this book since it is about a man who fought in WWII but I loved the science fiction apsect of it and I loved the social commentary within it  I felt so much pity for poor Billy and his fragile life stuck in a powerful mind  I would read other books by this author  Many of my contemporaries read this in high school or college  but I didn t    my book club just read it and I am sure I liked it much more at this age than I would have as a teenager  I actually really liked it  Well  I liked the writing  And Billy Pilgrim  I liked Billy Pilgrim  The only way I can remotely describe the emotions of this book is how Life magazine said it      a funny book at which you are not permitted to laugh  a sad book without tears   Vonnegut had me flipping page after page  and if I had the time to do it  I would ve read this book in one sitting  At first  there is not much to take away from Vonnegut s writing style  it basically just tells the story  But you read further and further on  and you realize what he is getting at with his  black comedy  and his take on American society and war  This book contains such great satire that it leaves you chuckling  yet pondering heavily  Well  I m sure my euphoria of finishing this book is just making me ramble  so I will simply say it is a must read  and a must read it again  So it goes    This book is everything I like in a book  The author is witty  clever  mysterious  tragic and surprising  I laughed much and nodded in agreement often  I rented the dvd of the 1972 movie and also enjoyed it  I can remember trying to read this in the 70 s and being so confused by the story because he continuously goes back and forward in time  It must be that I have learned to understand stream of consciousness because this time it made absolute sense to me and I never lost track of where he was  I also was surprised to learn that the story is about a true event in the authors life  I knew nothing about World War 2 in my youth and now I understand why this story hit home to so many  Vonnegut stands alongside John Updike and Phillip Roth as a great observer of the 1970 s  Although I disagree that this is Vonnegut s best  Slaughterhouse 5 truly is an amazing  though very absurd novel  It s post modern stream of consciousness sequence of events is fascinating  Billy Pilgrim  our main character  becomes unstuck in time as we are told the non linear story of his life in a linear way  Despite the crazy plot sequence  which in and of itself is amazing   this book offers a number of lessons  Touted as the greatest anti war book of its  time  Vonnegut presents the psychological mindfucks of war in a bizarrely entertaining way  the first corpse mine in Dresden   So it goes  Furthermore  the Tralfamadorian concept of time is incredible and reminds us to focus on the good things in life because the negative things don t matter  Poo tee weet  I m going to shamefully admit that this is my first Vonnegut  It was a tough choice I was stuck a bit between this  cat s cradle  and galapagos  but I had read bits and pieces of Slaughterhouse in my war in literature class a few years ago so I decided to start there  I was impressed  I really was expecting it to be one of those things that doesn t quite live up to the hype  It s like people read Vonnegut so that they can sound impressive in conversation   if that makes any sense  it s all about the cultural references  I m rambling The book was excellent  I loved the witt  I loved the style  I loved the story and i LOVEEEEDDD Billy Pilgrim  I don t want to give much away but I just want to say you wont be disappointed by this book sorry i have such shoddy reviews  3 While Brave New World might be my favorite book  my favorite author is Kurt Vonnegut  The thing i like most about this book is that it in terms of verbal and grammatical complexity it is on par with Hemingway  There is no confusion about what Vonnegut is saying  ever  What he means by it is completely up to speculation  In the same vein as O Brien it delves into the realm of truth and fiction  as all major historical events in this actually happened  and Vonnegut even mentions at one point that he is seen by the protagonist  saying something like that is I  the author of this book  But as a whole the main character is a fictional person  Between Tralfamadorians  the firebombing  and the commentary on the average americans life   I can really only say one thing  So it goes      Vonnegut  porque te nos moriste  Como empezar a resenar Slaughterhouse Five    es una historia de  ciencia ficcion  que tiene tanta realidad que duele  Al principio Vonnegut logra un poco distraerte de las cosas horribles que suceden en el libro poniendo chistes  y haciendo juegos de palabras  Al final del libro ya ni eso es suficiente  El final me entristecio muchisimo  La historia va de Billy Pilgrim que estuvo en la Segunda Guerra Mundial  justo en el bormbardeo de Dresden entre el 13 y 15 de febrero del 45  Nada mas que decir  Con este libro Vonnegut se ha convertido en mi autor favorito  He leido Cat s Cradle  God Bless you  Mr  Kevorkian y ahora Slaughterhouse Five y hay dios  esta super cabron como puede jugar entre lo divertido y lo horrorosamente real   Il 10 aprile 2009 ho finito di leggere questo libro  Il 10 aprile 2007 muore Kurt Vonnegut  Strana coincidenza Mi aspettavo un libro totalmente diverso  ho scoperto un nuovo modo  originale  di rielaborare la tragedia personale  Era tutto in regola  disse Billy   E tutto in regola  e ciascuno deve fare esattamente quello che fa  L ho imparato su Tralfamadore  E questa la frase che secondo me riassume meglio lo spirito del libro  Una rassegnazione alla privazione di senso  alla mancanza di significato della vita e dell azione umana  Solo attraverso una spiegazione fantascientifica  se non fantastica  Vonnegut ha potuto dare un senso a cio che un senso non ha  Liberando cosi ogni uomo colpevole dal peso di un innocente  poiche inevitabile  colpevolezza  This is one of the most moving novels I ever read  Somehow Vonnegut manages to combine science fiction and war into a heart rending commentary on war  which   without actually saying it   tells of how confussing it is to be a man in the middle of such hainous events  How life  death  tragedy  morality and the choices we make in life can so tax the brain that we no longer no which end is up  If daily we must deal with the reality of time  then Vonnegut s protagonist becomes  un stuck  in time to illustrate the obsurdity of war and of one s emotions about it  It takes a while to get into this novels jumpy and spontaneously absurd narrative  but if you stick with it  you get lost in the dream reality Vonnegut is created and you grow to understand the absurd reality is our own   One of Vonnegut s mighty Triumvirate  Cat s Cradle and Timequake   Billy Pilgrim  Tralfamadorians  Montana Wildhack  and WWII  It can t get better than that  Add in time hopping and soul crushing turns of events and you have yourself one of the best books ever written    Loved this book  The way that time and a life span is looked at is amazing  The book is a linear story told in a completely nonlinear form  I guess you could say it involves time travel  but then you wouldn t truly understand time the way it is explained in this book  Brilliant      Why me   That is a very Earthling question to ask  Mr  Pilgrim  Why you  Why us for that matter  Why anything  Because this moment simply is  Have you ever seen bugs trapped in amber   Yes   Well  here we are  Mr  Pilgrim  trapped in the amber of this moment  There is no why      Kurt Vonnegut  Slaughterhouse Five this is a book that everybody should read if you haven t read it you should read it  You can t spoil the book because the book itself is a common on the human condition and the comment is WTF  Also John dies at the end but seriously the book is abstract it s Art it s pros it s something that you pick up if you want to put down until it s done and get inside your head it s about war and life and sex and chocolate and food and Julia Roberts and none of those things and all those things just read itWhy would I lie to you read the book you if you can t read learn to read so you can read this book and fish then teach A man to fish and while fishing encourage him to read this book  it s just a good book it s nonlinear linear story  Stop reading this and read that   Vonnegut tackles the literary challenge of weaving together a plethora of events occurring at different times in one s life in a bold  yet poignant manner  Through his chaotic and often obscene writing style  Vonnegut is able to craft a novel that resonates with the reader   I m a highly believer that most of the time we don t choose the book but that the book chooses us  and it does when it thinks it s time  That happened with this book This beautiful work of art narrates  through travels in time and comments verging on dark humor  the life of a common person that had to take part in the war as an US soldier It s one of the books that made me feel the most the description of the life during war time  as a soldier  as a somewhat prisoner  because they didn t went through half of what jewish prisoners went through   It seemed to me so real  and I guess that despite being fiction it s based on real stories and people and only someone that was there can write something like that I loved it and felt it in my bones  it s just so good  Kurt Vonnegut s anti war novel is as fresh today and it was when written  War is just as deadly  painful  and absurd now as in the Second World War  And  the effect on civilians and soldiers alike is devastating  more painful for those who survived than those who perished  My first Vonnegut experience  The book that got me out of being a fantasy sci fi only reader and into the world of  real world  fiction and satire  The parts of his work that he included himself in    that was me  I was that soldier    charmed me like no other book I ve read   Poo tee weet  The first time I read this book  I was 15  It instantly was one of my favorites  In the 20 odd years since then  I have had to buy a new copy over and over again  just because my previous copy fell apart from repeated readings  I love the concept of being unstuck in time  of seeing moments of your life out of order  I absolutely loved this book  It has been on my list of classics to read for a while  I love that even though it was written in the 60 s it still kinda applies today  Some of the topics regarding war  and society are the same things people are complaining about today  like they are brand new  I also loved the alternative view into history that I haven t come across before  I was one of those people who didn t even know what Dresden was I also found it interesting that even though I didn t even really like Billy all that much  but I was still incredibly interested in what was happening to the people and environment around him  For me that was what the story was about  I also loved the  so it goes  concept  a much better way to look at life and death in my opinion   I rounded up   I initially gave Slaughter House 5 a 4  then decided on a five  For poetry sake  He wrote a way in which humans think jumping time to time in our own past to the present  He adds a dimension by presenting a future  and seeing the end while being in the beginning  Understatedly complex  Optimistically dismal  for coping   Consequently fun  He makes himself a hero by belittling the weight of cruel acts  I chose to focus on the brighter sides of this book  Everyone dies  Thus Slaughter House 5  So glad I finally had time to get around to reading this book  I ve read short stories by Vonnegut  but somehow never got around to Slaughterhouse Five  It was just as excellent and thought provoking as I expected it to be  Completely deserving of its status as an American classic   Me gusta la tematica belica pero odio los saltos en el tiempo  Y encima  era una lectura obligatoria para clase que no hay nada que me ayude tanto a odiar un libro Y sin embargo me ha encantado  lo he devorado en  tecnicamente  un dia y va a mi balda de favoritos  No entiendo nada  pero quiero mas cosas asi  This is only an anti war book because it takes a scientific  cold look at what war is  There are no bouts of romanticism or heroics  There is just war  and without the narratives of bloodless bravery and perfect confidence to support it  the idea ceases to entertain and begins to numb and horrify   I adored this  Loved  loved  loved  Vonnegut is one of those authors I was never assigned in school  and therefore I hadn t read anything by him  I found this for  4 at a used book store last weekend  I m thrilled I read it  and I can t wait to read more from him  What a great book  i really loved the unique perspective of Vonnegut  there s something darkly beautiful  about the lens through which he views reality  and humanity  his frank  no b s  way of describing people and the way they think and act  is profound  inspiring  and extremely entertaining  so it goes  Vonnegut s masterpiece  this book opened my mind back in the 1970s when I first read it  What then seemed a cutting edge structure now seems to emulate the way most of us remain  unstuck in time   Now that Mr  Vonnegut has died  So it goes   this novel seems even more phenomenal     Why me   That is a very Earthling question to ask  Mr  Pilgrim  Why you  Why us for that matter  Why anything  Because this moment simply is  Have you ever seen bugs trapped in amber   Yes   Well  here we are  Mr  Pilgrim  trapped in the amber of this moment  There is no why    This book has one of my favorite opening lines   All this happened  more or less   And though an opener like that  if articulated by someone actually in my life  would have a very different effect  when put in writing by a storyteller of Vonnegut s ilk  I was immediately captivated  And he held me throughout  It s been a long time since my first read  and I m not sure I truly appreciated it in my first go round  After all  the older you get  the more blurred the lines can become   especially for the storytellers among us  My favorite book  I read it once a year  It s insight into humanity  time  war and life are irreplaceable  It s also really fucking funny  If you like dark satire  the bite of realism and a little sci fi in your honesty  you ll love this book as well as most of Vonnegut s work   I really enjoyed reading this book  I love the dripping  oozing sarcasm  It s absolutely wonderful  I did not think I would enjoy this book since it is about a man who fought in WWII but I loved the science fiction apsect of it and I loved the social commentary within it  I felt so much pity for poor Billy and his fragile life stuck in a powerful mind  I would read other books by this author  Many of my contemporaries read this in high school or college  but I didn t

so it goes  concept  a much better way to look at life and death in my opinion    Listen  Billy Pilgrim has come unstuck in time  Slaughterhouse Five is a anti war science fiction novel  Vonnegut draws on his experiences as a German POW in World War II to tell the story of Billy Pilgrim  a character  the author notes  was not based on himself but on another POW who died of  the thousand mile stare   Billy Pilgrim believes he was abducted by aliens and can travel in time to any point in his own life  The reader is left to make his own conclusions about the reality of that belief  This is a short but important work that uses absurdism and meta devices to make points about the randomness of not just war  but of life  who lives and who dies and why is completely arbitrary   So it goes   I was surprised at how easily and quickly I was drawn into this book  even with it not having a typical plot structure  The writing itself kept me turning the pages  Plus  a delicious tension tightened and increased with each chapter I loved that the author drove home the horrors of war  especially the random  almost Alice in Wonderland like living conditions of soldiers who no longer had a regiment and were either trying to escape getting captured or were captured  but never did the gruesome  horrific circumstances strike terror in me personally  I deeply sympathized with the characters  and I understood how and why Billy became so unstable  but I didn t internalize it the way I did with Sophie s Choice  It s a clever  sad  fascinating tale   I re read this book this week  I loved it in High School and was fortunate enough to stumble on my old  personally annotated copy  Vonnegut is such a master with prose  Punchy form and poetic repetition of phrases and ideas  This book is marvelous and fun  yet also very moving  It is odd to read about the heart rending events of WWII through the somewhat dry  almost sterile  view of Vonnegut  It makes the book all the more effective  knowing that he wrote this way to draw our attention to the atrocities of war  I also love the way realities are intertwined  One receives constant hints at what may be real and what may be imagined within the context of the novel  yet masterfully  the reader is never told which way is up  A great read  What a hysterical  ambitious  haunting  and somehow economical book  Vonnegut s language is so simple that I flew through it  But I d benefit from multiple readings to see how he pulled it off  structurally  He s somehow seamless in his crazy transitions between places and time periods  I d especially like to piece together how the implausible occurrences of Billy s life have real explanations that Vonnegut gives you piece meal throughout the book This book is about many things  but it seems to be focused on choice and memory and those things from which you can t recover  It is a unique combination of huge scope and imagination with the grisly  cynical  hysterically caustic worldview of someone who personally experienced devastation  One of the great works of modern literature  Slaughterhouse Five is that rare thing  a book with a unique voice unlike anything else you ve ever read  Crazy  funny  sad  profound  haunting  Along with Catch 22 one of the great modern anti war books  I imagine this book was highly controversial when it was first published  maybe even so today  I found the book deeply disturbing but not  absurd   The protagonist in the story is Billy Pilgrim  a survivor of World War II  who as a prisoner of war lived through the bombing of Dresden  If that wasn t enough to give someone post traumatic stress syndrome  he has other complications in his life  He invents a alien planet and spends a good amount of time there  which he does his thinking when he needs to escape  even for only moments of memories he can t cope with  I can see by the authors writing of this story his take on war in general and that it would be a book for anti war sentiment  Very well written and thought provoking   Slaughterhouse 5 is a bonkers  surreal  absurdist  angry  sci fi  war  drama that responds to war in the only way that is really fitting  with this mad  flawed  sprawling masterpiece that seems just as nonsensical and ridiculous as not only the Dresden firebombing  but also the rest of the fucking war  This book is conceptually interesting as well  it s exploration of complex scientific and philosophical concepts makes for some mind twisting reading  and the way it deals with mental illness is also completely nuts  However this book is not easy to read  at times alternatively infuriating  confusing and baggy  Slaughterhouse is worth persevering with  and it s wonderfully angry at not only this war  but the whole concept of wars in general  A masterpiece  The author did a great job in setting the sad atmosphere filling every inch of this book  The setting of time travelling and fly saucer gave the reader the impression that only in such riddiculous situation the cruelty of the war and the life could be accepted  This is not the first time I have read the saga of Billy Pilgrim and I hope it will not be the last  I do tend to get overwhelmed by all of the new books piling up on my shelves waiting to be read and the classics I should have gotten to long ago  But Vonnegut is a treat  And I really deserve treats  I do  Vonnegut always reminds me that reading is wonderful and something I love to do  instead of have to do  The subject matter is dire  of course  But the reading is joy rather than something I think I have to do I have resolved that the next time I am slogging through something tedious and deadening I will put it away without guilt and grab me some  Breakfast of Champions  without guilt  Because life is short  And so it goes  With all the attention on Breakfast of Champions  I almost didn t notice this gem by Vonnegut until I saw it in the Times top novels of the last century  Incredible storytelling that interweaves reality with time travel  aliens and much more  This book is one of my all time favorites  Vonnegut takes his own story and weaves it into Billy s life  Every time I read this book  I feel as if I am hearing the story from Vonnegut himself  I always open this book when I need a good read   After reading Kurt s  Letters  I went back and re read this   I found I really didn t remember as much as I thought  Still an awesome read  all these years later  Probably as good a place as any to start for those unfamiliar with Vonnegut  This book is awesome  The first chapter introduces characters  but they are unrelated to the main story  for the most part   so its rather boring  After this dreary little intro  its very interesting and innovative  Vonnegut introduces his idea of time  and uses it to create a truly unique novel  Billy has become  unstuck  in time so though we begin with him at the beginning of his war experience  he skips around frequently to other parts of his life  Some would think this ruins it for the reader  but it really doesn t  The most important  climax  is saved for the end  and the ending is especially interesting as it gives new insight into Billy s time travel  Definitely read this for school or for fun  It is great for either purpose   Awesome book  I started reading it years ago  gave up  then cheated and watched the movie again  Vonnegut was obviously affected by his experiences in World War II and uses this book to discuss the futility and awesome destruction of war  Billy Pilgrim s traumatic experiences in WWII cause him to become unstuck in time  The aptly titled Pilgrim travels throughout his own life  jumping from WWII  to his productive post war life  to the planet Tralfamadore  a place where all time exists at once  Because he can go back and forth through his life  death becomes less important  because it is not necessarily the end  My brother had given me God Bless You  Mr  Rosewater years ago for a birthday  so it s time to seek out more of Vonnegut s work  Slaughterhouse Five is one of those books I ve always been told I should read  not just by teachers and scholars  but by friends and other peers  I hadn t yet read it in part because of the gravity of subject  It just wasn t a book I felt motivated to curl up with and read on a weekend  Because my GoodReads group was reading it  however  I picked it up  And I read it in a day  It s been a long time since I ve read a book so intensely that wasn t made to be a page turner  Slaughterhouse Five is a war novel about about the marginal  yet defining traumas war induces  PTSD  POW violence  massacres on a universally  even today  detested enemy  Vonnegut shows why war is a children s crusade  This isn t a book that will soon leave your mind  Totally bizarre  Disorienting  Amazing  Profound I have a lot of trouble reading book about war because violence has the capacity to upset me tenfold over anything else  Vonnegut doesn t romanticize it at all though  either as heroic or tragic  The whole book feels like it is told by someone who is still in total shock and completely numb to the emotional nature of their experience  Whenever you talk to someone who fought in a war  you get that exact same feeling  Therefore  I think this is the most realistic book about war that I have ever read  But I also know nothing about war   I have to admit that my favorite parts was the introduction  when Vonnegut just wrote as himself  Does anyone know if he wrote any non fiction  A brief  semi acrostic breakdown of this novel s title  S  stands for  scathing   because Slaughterhouse Five is the most scathing of all satires  with the possible exception of Catch 22  Laughter   obviously  stands for  laughter     what happens when you read Slaughterhouse Five  or anything by Vonnegut for that matter   House  indicates an ideal setting for reading this book The hyphen represents the deep  inescapable rift that war creates in the human spirit   Five  means that  had Vonnegut not published Player Piano or  heaven forbid  any of the other novels that preceded Slaughterhouse Five  this would have been his fifth novel  I love you  Kurt Vonnegut  Rest in peace   This was the first Vonnegut I read as a fifteen year old  Having doubled in age and and experience I decided to read it again  Unsurprisingly  it was still funny and moving  This time I had more appreciation for the structure  Great   A slow start for me  but about half way through  I could not put it down  The most impressive thing about this novel is the that while it is constantly jumping around in time  I never got confused about where I was in the story or what was happening   Definitely a page turnerDefinitely a page turnerI had a hard time jumping back and forth through time and keeping the story straight  but once I got the hang of it  I thoroughly enjoyed this book  I m giving this a very rare 5 stars  It was perfect in its strangely disjointed and quietly horrific way  It effortlessly described the utter uselessness and waste of war   And how empty it must have all felt   The simple style and powerful language created a steady drum beat that became a palpable anti war message  A work of sheer genius  I will never forget this book as long as I live   All of this said  I m not sure it s all that great as a book for high schoolers  It seems the subtlety could be completely lost on people with such little life experience   I read this book many years ago  but remembered little of it  so I decided to read it again  I m pleased to say that my original 5 Star rating stands unchanged  For as humorous as this book is  it s a surprisingly good  albeit idiosyncratic  take on the effects of the traumas of war on a delicate psyche  Is Pilgrim  get it   crazy or just trying to cope with his war time experiences  Or is he really traveling back and forth through time  Does it even matter  since the point of noting history s needless and unchanging repetition holds true regardless  Or is it a story of the comforts of denial  Doesn t matter  really  since the story is all of these and none of them together  and is wonderfully written to boot  Well done  Listen  This is undoubtably one of the best books ever written  I just finished reading it for my Science Fiction class  and after our discussion  I am even more convinced of this  The clear  concise language is almost poetic  and the metafictional elements as well as the literary tropes and motifs make it beautifully complex  It s a shame this book had to end  So it goes  I think it is an excellent look at humans from a nearly alien  Tralfamadorian   perspective  It points out a lot of the ridiculous and inconsistent things we do in a humorous  ironic way  so discovering humanity s flaws is funny  So many aspects of this book will stick with me forever  but none so much as  Listen  Billy Pilgrim has become unstuck in time   Kurt Vonnegut bursts with interesting ideas and perspectives  He also does well with the  bon mot   Reading this after  11 22 63  was fun because of the different concepts of time travel  Here  time is immutable  in King s book it s obdurate  Vonnegut s notion that we all live forever in the 4th dimension is somewhat silly  but it allows him to tell this story  which would otherwise be brutally depressing  in a style that makes it almost hilarious   Corpse mining   for example    How can we possibly laugh about digging up bodies  Well  I did  even though I felt guilty about it This book is an anti war story and an anti stupidity story  However  it embodies the concept that humankind will likely never escape either one  10 5 10 As I read this for the second time I have different thoughts    maybe Billy Pilgrim was kinda crazy from the war and after the plane crash he started having all these flashbacks due to reading the Kilgore Trout books   Or maybe he really did go to Tralfamadore   Wonder what I ll think the next time  I haven t read many books more than once  I think this will be on a yearly rotation as well 9 23 09 I read Cat s Cradle a while ago and it was time for another Vonnegut read  I loved this book  It kinda gave me a  LOST  feel  Time travel and the 4th dimension  Seeing your life in full at any point you were in  The anti war stuff was challenging  I suggest this book for sure and can t wait to read another  I really liked this book It was very interesting to me how Vonnegut incorporated sci fi elements to his reality based war novel  Billy as a character was quite weak and sad  but I believe this is what Vonnegut portrays a post war person  The idea of Tralfamadore was quite interesting  especially with regards to war and Billy s situation  The way the book jumped from one situation to another was quite refreshing and allowed me to follow the events much better than if it was one long story  It is clear that the war had a profound effect on people  especially the bombings at Dresden  Billy doesn t even cry for the people who died  he just accepts that the moment had happened and always will happen  Somewhere a dog barked  This has to be one of the most unique books I ve read in a long time  I found the writing to be fully immersing  and at the same time abstract  At all points  the reader can relate to the main character  despite the very odd circumstances he gets into The story is written in a way that allows you to read it in very small bursts  and I found it hard to guess what would come next  even from sentence to sentence  I can t describe this book much more  except to say that I ll definitely read it again sometime  If you re a writer  you ll probably be especially intrigued with this book   I haven t found a writing style this intriguing or unique since Bradbury  I think I ll check out some more of Vonnegut s work very soon   In becoming an educator  you learn how to judge a book for readability amongst different age groups of kids  What s fascinating about Vonnegut is that his prose is simple almost to the point of idiocy  but his stories have such philosophical and political depth that it s hard to believe that such a poor writer as Vonnegut can make you think so deeply about your life  I tested this book for so called  readability  once and found that it was written on a 5th grade reading level  Yet for me  I read this book and I felt like I was barely scratching the surface of truly comprehending the brilliance that Vonnegut had to share with us in this book about a World War II veteran turned  New Age  philosopher and motivational speaker  A masterpiece mediation on warVonnegut s  Slaughterhouse Five  is a brilliant story told in a brilliant way  If you re up for a complex narrative that ties itself together by the end   and not a second earlier   then this literary achievement is the right book for you  Oh  Billy   He goes in his mind from WWII to the present and to another planet where the humans are on display  Just so unique and original plus a rare one that they made into a movie I liked  Thank you  our dear Vonnegut  I ve not read another book like it  It has given me a kind of peace with time that I m not sure how to explain  Another masterful work by a brilliant author  I would like to write to Mr  Vonnegut  but letters do not reach the dead  So it goes  Wonderful storytelling and amidst reading  you re often torn apart on what to feel about the necessity of war and if that outweighs the consequences Vonnegut really knows how to tell you an anti war story and not make it a drag War is hell and its currency is madness  The off the wall  nonlinear style of this book gripped me from the get go  It presented all the shards of a life shattered by war at various stages through the screen of insanity  Or  you can take it as the story of a time traveler and his exploits on and off Earth during and after WWII  It s all up to you really  It s not a blow by blow account of what happened at Dresden per se  as it seems to have been an event too overwhelming for any of the survivors to really come to terms with  so it s more of an indirect look at the event and an examination of war in general  I loved reading this book  I will probably read it again sometime to see if there was anything I missed  This is legitimately my favourite book  It s quite sad  but it s so inspirational and heart warming at the same time  It s also a fantastic range of genres  because it moves from sci fi to war  but some of it is true too   Trout  incidentally  had written a book about a money tree  It had twenty dollar bills for leaves  Its flowers were government bonds  Its fruit was diamonds  It attracted human beings who killed each other around the roots and made very good fertilizer  So it goes   Suggested by a friend  an amazing read it was  It took a while to get used to  of the back and forth WW2  Dresden  Germans  Americans and Trafalmarians  but once you get it  you won t leave it  A little chubby man met a chubby girl  who rode him and they had a chubby kid  p I couldn t put it down  Brilliant writing and the story was easy to follow even though it seemed complicated at first  It felt like I was watching a really artsy cool movie  I might listen to some jazz now  Very stimulating  I rarely give 5 stars  I am economical with praise  in that sense But this is definitely worth all five shining stars  and not just because it has number five in its title One of the funniest book I ever read  Page turner  Rich in imagination  Compelling story that you want to read slow  and not to take in doses that are too big  book is short  and you don t want that journey to end too soon  One of those book that when you finish  you re just looking forward to read again The best part  Lessons that we can learn from Tralfamadorians One is  for example quite simple  There s one thing Earthlings might learn to do  if they tried hard enough  Ignore awful times  and concetrate on the good ones   Truly remarkable  A classic for a reason  Vonnegut puts Tarentino in his place when it comes to non linear story telling  This book examines the limitations of humanity  the ramifications of war and ways of looking at life   Great book  i read military books whenever i can  i read this years ago but still remember it  as good as Catch 22  funny  deprecating and most of all true to the bone  so much it hurts and makes you laugh to stop the hurt  Although I m a generation or two past the point it became cliche to like this book it blew me away regardless  Somehow I picked up Slaughterhouse after being awake for 2 days and I d read two thirds of the book before my body finally forced me to pass out  None of my praise is new to Vonnegut but I ll state it anyway  his prose is concise   hilarious  his war imagery is grisly and free of fetishizing  and his characters are pedestrian people with a complex development throughout an intricately quilted timeline  Although the action isn t sequential  the slow reveal of information and character details are pleasingly paced  Altogether a wonderful book about average humans who have to live through a terrible thing  So it goes  War is a terrible thing  And the idea of time happening all at once doesn t seem so hard to believe for me  I wasn t sure I would like this book and a few hours after starting it  I reached the last page  So it goes  I really really liked this book  It was funny while still being very serious  flippant yet incredibly immportant  repetitive but interesting and engaging  I loved this book it has a very interesting philosophy about life and death and war  I think everyone should read it  This is  quite possibly  one of my favorite books of all time  Thoughtful  well written and unbelievably darkly funny  this story manages to express so much of the horror of war and post traumatic stress while at the same time amusing an audience with some of the most well written and meaningful passages you could hope to find in literature  Kurt Vonnegut was a master of subtle humor while still conveying an incredible message  This is a story that everyone who loves books  and even those who don t   should read  This is one of the few books I actually read all the way from beginning to end in high school and it has been my favorite ever since   Yep  right up there next to Ella Enchanted  The deadpan sarcasism of the narrator is hilarious  even though every time I read this book  I m a little more depressed by the end of it than the last time  And I love a good non linear plot  This book had a big affect on me as a writer  Though I don t write literary anti war novels  it s probably the reason I can t write a story in a straight line to save my life Slaughterhouse Five  by the way has my favorite first line of a chapter  Billy Pilgram became unstuck in time  And my favorite ending to a chapter  the end of chapter one   Be prepared for a book that jumps around a lot but in the end is a fun and an easy read  I found myself rethinking my thoughts on war and time space  along with laughing at things that come out of nowhere  I often felt sorry for Billy Pilgrim because of his bland personality  He really wasn t one to have opinions on any subject  He just let things happen no matter how unusual they were  Billy s blandness was countered by the interesting characters he meets up with  I love the names that Vonnegut picks for his characters  They are like an extension of their personalities so that Vonnegut can introduce a character and we already know a lot about them  Another author that I have to add to my list to read in the future  Kurt Vonnegut s  Slaughterhouse Five  tells the multi dimensional story of the troubled war veteran  Billy Pilgrim  and since being published in the sixties  it has amassed a devoted following of critics and scholars alike  Vonnegut s trademark usage of repetition is ever present  as are his short  declarative sentences and absolutely biting sense of humor  This metafictional look at war  coupled with the antihero s troublesome antics evokes an introverted look at the tragedy of war and the imminence of death  This jumbled and often disoriented work of post modern war fiction dips in and out of reality  much like it s main character  This genius novel  arguably Vonnegut s finest  is firmly set on my favorites list    I looked through the Gideon Bible in my motel room for tales of great destruction  The sun was risen upon the Earth when Lot entered into Zo ar  I read  Then the Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the Lord out of Heaven  and He overthrew those cities  and all the plain  and all the inhabitants of the cities  and that which grew upon the ground So it goes Those were vile people in both those cities  as is well known  The world was better off without them  And Lot s wife  of course  was told not to look back where all those people and their homes had been  But she did look back  and I love her for that  because it was so human  So she was turned to a pillar of salt So it goes   It took me forever to sit down and read this book  Classic  wonderful Vonnegut  It is said to be one of the most influential anti war books of this century  The main character  Billy Pilgram  comes unstuck in time  He is a likable fellow even though he seems a little out of touch within in his own life  gee  ya think   which you would be if A  after living through the horrors of war and B  after having come unstuck in time  I also feel that perhaps many fathers of that generation may have felt like that disconnected  not a part of their own families lives  The idea of being placed in an alien zoo has been stolen and used lots  Its interesting to imagine how this book was received when it was first published   Vonnegut s masterpiece  recently re read  This novel was my first introduction to Vonnegut  like many others  I m sure  The mix of historical fact and absurd observational humor really knocked my socks off  The tragedy of Billy Pilgrim  having lost his mind in a war he never understood  here is a retelling of historical events one can really sink their teeth into  I ve always been impressed with Vonnegut s brand of casual story telling  the matter of fact tone applied to both horrific tragedy and sex with porn star in an extraterrestrial zoo  His conversational writing style has always made me want to sit with him in some quiet pub  listening to his silly  heart wrenching tales until the tap runs dry  So it goes   This is one of those books that  talk  to people  Vonnegut is simply amazing as a writer  and few  very few  can make their voice so clear through written words as to make you feel that he s sitting right next to you  telling you  you personally  this story  He not only achieves this kind of intimacy through his written word  but throws in a story about the ridicule of human nature and its cruelty and craziness  As someone else said  one character in this book is mentally ill  All the others are fucked up crazy  And maybe is the fact that Billy Pilgrim is insane that makes it impossible for him to function in a world that is completely crazy  I could quote the entire book  it has no waste  that s how brilliant it is  Even though I rated it 5 I don t put it on the same pedestal as my favourits  However  it s more than a  oh I really liked it  to me  compared to other books I rated that way  What I find amazing about this book is the simplicity of the words but the complexity of the human behaviour behind them  Honestly what I loved more about this book was the focus on the individual mind on a global situation that affects everyone   its changes  what it s affected by  the consequences of the changes  It gave me a totally different perspective of WWII  one that usually isn t presented to us on school or discused in the first place  I had some problems with his approach to Christianity  but that has only to do with my beliefs  I almost  almost put this book down because I found Billy Pilgrim  the main character  so exasperating at first but I m so glad I didn t because I ended up loving this book  One thing I really loved was that in the first few pages the narrator  Vonnegut   briefly explains what the book will be about  even what the last line will be  At which point  one turns to the last page to verify this It is a strange book  There are many science fiction elements  aliens and time travel in particular  But it is so much more than that  the bombing of Dresden  the atrocities of war  the pointlessness of war  And of course the life of Billy Pilgrim both on Earth and on the planet Tralfamadore  A great and wonderfully strange read  Loved that this book wasn t one that didn t sugar coat war  Didn t pretend that the soldiers were grown men but father boys who had to grow up and do and witness things that were awful  Love K V s writing style also   I find myself saying  so it goes  many times because of this book  I guess because of how many times vonnegut repeats it  But I think the point is that people fight against the inevitable too much   So it goes  serves as a reminder that some things are meant to be  I guess the challenge is figuring out what is and what isn t meant to be  A classic  A great commentary on war and society  Some fantastic descriptions and a bleak sense of humour  A time travelling  optometrist who witnessed the burning of Berlin  and aliens   What more do you need  I was most struck by the truth written by the Slaughterhouse 5 traitor  Howard W  Campbell   America is the wealthiest nation on Earth  but its people are mainly poor  and poor Americans are urged to hate themselves   like human beings everywhere   they  believe things that are obviously untrue   their most destructive untruth is that it is very easy for any American to make money  They will not acknowledge how in fact hard money is to come by  and  therefore  those who have no money blame and blame and blame themselves  This inward blame has been a treasure for the rich and powerful  who have had to do less for their poor  publicly and privately  than any other ruling class since  say Napoleonic times   I must have read this in the 1970s  when I read Cat s Cradle and Welcome to the Monkey House  but I d largely forgotten it  Meg had to read it for American Literature and I was happy to read it again  So it goes   Superb  First Vonnegut novel I have read and can understand why so many rave about it  Funny and awfully sad at times  Time travel  world war two and aliens  Weird but makes for a great combination  So it goes     Bellissimo  uno dei miei libri preferiti  La narrazione di Vonnegut e cosi ironica  dissacrante e distaccata da sbatterti in faccia quasi con prepotenza la realta dei fatti  senza pathos  senza patetismi  con realismo  Wonderfully entertaining  Humor juxtaposed with cringe worthy tales of brutality always makes you f el like you re an emotional rubber band  It speaks volumes of an author to be able to push and pull you in whatever direction they desire There is some pontificating  heifer for the most part he lets it simmer in your psyche  The time shifts only serve to illustrate the utter rebirth the war caused  That is to say  what happened post hac served as a delineating dividing line  To further simplify  Billy Pilgrim was forever and permanently altered after the war  He was one fleeting thought away from reliving it all over again  A poignant reminder that war is not merely temporal it is long lasting  Superb   A masterpiece  Ugly beautiful prose and exactly enough ambiguity and a look at the absurdity of life and war and sex and the why of things  I will be reading this again to make sure I absorbed it all  Vonnegut deserves every bit of praise he ever gets  When is a sci fi novel not a sci fi novel  An original and compelling novel from the mind of Vonnegut via Billy Pilgrim  Does he time travel  or has he  as his daughter suggests  lost his mind due to trauma  Brilliantly structured  and a novel that stays with me afterwards  So it goes  Sorry I ve reached the end of this book  But I m still reading it sometime  Great anti  war book that manages not to be preachy  Should have read it years ago  but I still I m  Time unstuck  a wonderful concept  Reading this book is an experience unto itself  I can t describe it  But it was so excellent  definitely offered an interesting perspective  really really made me think and try and figure out why I felt the ways I did  Magistral ejercicio de sublimacion alrededor de la muerte masiva  Fabulosa narracion sobre las necesidad y las posibilidades de la palabra y los mundos posibles de la ficcion  Una joya de la literatura universal   Wow    this book was very different than one s I usually read  It was quite depressing at times and at times it was hilarious  Brilliantly done  this book makes you think and reflect and even want to cry sometimes  Over the past several years  I have been told to read this book  I really enjoyed it  I now understand why it s not easy for somebody to explain exactly what it s about  It s just a beautifully written piece of work  Kurt Vonnegut is my all time favorite author  and this is one of his best  along with Sirens of Titan  It s been so long since I read it  I no longer have a clear picture of the plot  Guess I need to re read it  Strange and wonderful  Vonnegut managed to make a dull story seem beautiful  profound  and exciting  The writing is delectable  And he layers themes and motifs so flawlessly  Everyone should read this book at least once   Damn  I like this book  Successful non linear works have my respect and this one was particularly interesting  An anti wear book  though preachy as ever  has never kept my attention invested as well as Vonnegut has     My full review is at Suite101It s rare when you read a book and you know it wouldn t pack the same punch  not even close  if it was told in any other way  Slaughterhouse 5 is this book  The whole point is that war is disjointed madness  completely illogical   just like the timeline in this book  And just as you get toward the end  thinking  How will this possibly resolve itself   it all devolves into even more madness  Is Billy crazy  Is he a liar  War breaks you  I m not some kind of peace loving hippie  but I can say that I LOVED this book  Definitely more Vonnegut in the future  My all time favorite book  Chosen for a book report in 11th grade  At the time the prologue couldn t hold my attention  Then something magical happen the next day  I inhaled the book  I d rarely had a story affect me the way this one did  Three days later I read it again  20  yrs later I ve re read it multiple times  each occasion I walk away different from the experience carry some new insight or view on life  The summer following my junior yr I went insane on Vonnegut  Hocus Pocus  Breakdast of Champions  Cats Craddle  etc   A few months later my mom drove me 120 miles from my little hick town to Lincoln  Ne to see Kurt Vonnegut speak  The most amazing experience of my life     so it goes Wow  What an amazing book  the best one I ve read in a long time  Unpretentious writing  totally original and wacky  Thoroughly enjoyable every step of the way  This book had been described to me years ago as being about the bombing of Dresden in WWII but that totally misses the point  The novel follows the main character Billy Pilgrim backward and forward throughout his life and experiences in WWII as he becomes un stuck in time and at one point abducted by aliens and taken to another planet  I know  I couldn t help but think that JJ Abrams took some ideas from Vonnegut when developing LOST  Was Slaughterhouse one of Sawyer s beach reads  This was my first Vonnegut book and I can t wait for my next  This was a five star book to me   but I will be hard pressed to explain my rationale  This is one of those books you find on a list that states  Top 50 books you must read   which is the only reason I read it  I loved this book  it was not a grind to read it and I found that the so many different topics  threads  ideas were contained in the storyline that it never lost my rapt attention  The time travel aspect was a wonderful vehicle to enable the interweaving of so many ideas and storylines  This book is definitely not for everyone and I am sure this is a love it or hate it book  I cannot imagine that there are many people who are ambivalent about this book  It is going on my  to be read again shelf   I really liked this book  Billy Pilgrim  unstuck in time  allowed the author to skip around so you are never bored  I really like the idea of having a prolific yet unsuccessful sci fi author as a character to inject crazy concepts into the mix  Kilgore Trout reminds me of Philip K  Dick  except Dick was a good writer who worked in Sci Fi genre  Was Vonnegut a frustrated sci fi author who used Kilgore Trout to vent his numerous ideas  Vonnegut s books have sci fi elements  like the aliens who abduct him in a flying saucer to a zoo where he is forced to room with movie starlet Montana Wildhack  They aren t really sci fi books  and they are kind of social satire  or some kind of mix of comedy and tragedy   In Slaughterhouse Five  what Vonnegut doesn t say is equally important to what he does  The first chapter describes his inability to write the book you are reading  It s something like that legend on old maps   Here be dragons   He doesn t attempt to find words that would tell you about the nightmares and horrors he brought home from that place  They would be a pale reflection  inadequate and impotent  I m pretty sure I read this book when I was a teenager  and was totally confused by the Tralfamadorians  among other things  So if this book doesn t work for you  put it away on the shelf  Do something else for ten or twenty years  And maybe  try it again  It may be better than you remembered  This just feels like such an important book even though I am sure KV was on an acid trip or some such similar high given the no holds barred ride he takes you on during this story  It is both wacky and highly imaginative and manages to ease you out of your sense of normality with alacrity to a different place  and that s not just the extra terrestrial parts   The passages and storyline relating to the Second War and Dresden were very moving and intense  Have been reading lots of classics this year I haven t got to before and I am so glad I gave this some of my precious time   I wasn t disappointed  This and  Welcome to the Monkey House  have to be a couple of my favourite books of the year so far   Creo que el vivir una guerra no es facil y mucho menos escribir un libro acerca de ello Lo que me encanto de este libro fue la capacidad del autor para darle un giro a un hecho lamentable  no me refiero solo al bombardeo de Desdre sino a la Segunda Guerra Mundial en si   La satira y las reflexiones acerca de la humanidad realmente te hacen pensar si hemos cambiado en absoluto o evolucionado para bien o si aun hoy en dia seguimos a merced de repetir los mismos errores La narrativa del libro funciono para mi  asi como cada uno de los personajes  A pesar de ser un libro que cuya tematica puede ser considerada  densa  la forma en que esta escrita la novela le da una extraordinaria facilidad de lectura  One of the most incredible books ever written  Good  strong narrative and a lot of philosophical ideas  It is hard at first to pin down what it s about  is it a war novel  A novel about the struggle of the family man in the 20th Century  A sci fi novel  No  What it really is is explained in the book itself  with the words   Billy Pilgrim has come unstuck in time   This is a novel about time  and the invisible role it plays in our lives  About us taking it for granted and not understanding what it means  About our baseless fear of death It is as eccentric as it is funny  down to earth as it is fantasy  Well written and a very good read  No doubt this book will still be read a 100 years from now  So it goes I have grown stingy with my five stars  But this books was extremely well written  It is almost impossible to describe the sensation you get when you are reading this  but you really feel unstuck in time  You feel insane  It is funny and unlike anything else I had ever read  It kept me absorbed  despite the fact that there was no conflict in the traditional sense  Time flowed by  I wish I could name things like Vonnegut   Slaughterhouse five or The Children s Crusade  a Duty Dance with Death   I would have read it just from that  I want to read more by him   this book has left me deeply touched and will stick with me  I loved the story  And the writing  And the characters  So it goes   The boxcar doors were opened  and the doorways framed the loveliest city that most of the Americans had ever seen  The skyline was intricate and voluptuous and enchanted and absurd        Billy did not meet many of the eyes that found him so entertaining  He was enchanted by the architecture of the city  Merry amoretti wove garlands above windows  Roguish fauns and naked nymphs peeked down at Billy from festooned cornices  Stone monkeys frisked among scrolls and seashells and bamboo  Billy  with his memories of the future  knew that the city would be smashed to smithereens and then burned  in about thirty more days  He knew  too  that most of the people watching him would soon be dead  So it goes   I first read Slaughterhouse Five in 1975  Since then I ve re read it many more times  I always go back to it thinking that it could not possibly be as good as I remember it  Alas  Vonnegut s WWII tale is timeless  Recently  I bought it for someone going to Iraq   I don t know if he ll read it   but I could not help myself immersing in the novel again before giving it to him  What amazed me about the novel this time is the clarity of Vonnegut s message  Vonnegut s language is lean  its only concern is showing us the senselessness of war and the continuous habit humans have of making the wrong choices  Slaughterhouse Five is a manual on how to deal with catastrophe  and one of the wisest novels ever published   The only book in my life that I finished and immediately reread  Amazing book  The horrific story of the Dresden bombings told through a sci fi prism  Perhaps the only way the author could relive it  Vonnegut described PTSD before doctors were even beginning to know it existed  This book again showed me how sometimes fiction helps us understand our own experiences far more than theory or science ever will  Amazing book  Vonnegut is truly one of a kind writer  Slaughter house 5 will make you stop and think and some times pause in order to take in his breathe taking insights into life and war  Must read    I initially found it difficult to read and interpret as I am an easily distracted reader  Knowing the plot and a general sequence of events made the second reading much more meaningful and interesting  No one combines the weight of history and the mind of the individual quite like Vonnegut A roller coaster of a ride into war  the human psyche and destiny A great book by a master at the top of his game   A wacky  funny  interesting book  I was not at all prepared for how strange it was  All I knew was that it was a classic  and that I would enjoy it  I certainly did  and I read it practically in one sitting  Great book  I read it during my college years before I understood anything about Dresden or the ideas introduced in the TV show LOST  so I m planning on checking it out again sometime with a new viewpoint I don t throw around words like  masterpiece  a whole lot  Or at least very easily  This a masterpiece of fiction blending autobiographical work and musings on the nature of time and existence  Give it a read  This was a great read by a great author  My only regret is that I did not discover this author sooner  I would have liked to have met him  The book is quite thought provoking  I highly recommend this book   Amazing A blurb on an edition I saw in the bookstore said it best   a funny book in which you are not permitted to laugh  a sad book without tears   It s an incredibly fine line Vonnegut is walking here  and he does it flawlessly  If Longinus was right about the definition of  sublime  as contradiction reconciled  this is a perfect example  Well  this book came to my knowledge a midst my obsession with the tv show  LOST   It was mentioned and even paralleled a time travel story device used in the show  What fascinated me was the originality of the story   the different take on time travel that read as consciousness moving through time without the body  This was my first Vonnegut book and I like his writing style a lot  He breaks the fourth wall a lot and incorporates characters from past books into his others  I enjoyed the book especially as it was inspired by his real life in a war camp in Germany No denying that I loved the time travel part the most and how it affected him  This was and is one of my favorite science fiction books  Amazing  simply amazing  I tore through this book in two nights  and I m still feeling moved by it  The pitiful story of the protagonist  forever lost in time  forms a simple but affecting symbol of an old veteran wading through his memories  good and bad  What really makes this book transcendental is the prose  Vonnegut was obviously a master at this point in his career  as he seamlessly tells a story that should consist of nothing but seams  His prose is gorgeous and precise  his characters 3 dimensional  and his scenes starkly impressive  Nearing the end of the book  Billy s sense of being  unstuck in time  infects the reader  For a brief moment  I felt as if I was unstuck in time as well  Just reread this for the millionth time  One of my favorites  This   The Giver    A Tree Grows in Brooklyn   and  Catcher in the Rye  are all the sort of book you can read a hundred times and still find something new  or read as you get older and discover something you relate to that you never felt before  Of course  this is just me   but generally when I feel that way about a book I feel the need to make everyone I know read it as well  This is definitely one of those  I really don t think I need to debate the merits of this book with anyone here  but I suppose I can see reasons why some wouldn t find it appealing  But to me it s the kind of classic that never becomes dated or goes out of style  I love Vonnegut and this is my favorite Vonnegut book  I m sure there s nothing I can say about his work that hasn t already been said but I ll try anyway  Like previous Vonnegut books  the plot involves a pseudo sci fi premise but the novel is really about Vonnegut s observations regarding human behavior in the face of a chaotic universe over which we have no control  His protagonist encounters cruelty and hatred everywhere he goes  but also kindness and the chance for a little dignity in the most unexpected places  Nobody can describe the absurdity  and sheer horror  of the human condition with a liberal dose of black humor and manage to sneak in the slightest hint of optimism like Kurt Vonnegut  This is my favorite book ever  Admittedly  the prose took some adjustments and there are occasional cliches used  But seriously  this book is absolutely incredible  Kurt Vonnegut was a brilliant man and this book is a testament to his brilliance  The ideas in this book will make you live your life in a whole new way  You won t see the world in the same way ever again if you adopt and fully appreciate the philosophy of this book  Honestly  if you haven t read it already  then just read it  Keep your mind open and prepare to be incredibly confused at first  Do not let that throw you off though  Finish it  I have lost count of how many times I ve read this book but every time  something just smacks me upside the head and I remember why I always love it  This is what got me this time    The flaw in the Christ stories  said the visitor from outer space  was that Christ  who didn t look like much  was actually the Son of the Most Powerful Being in the Universe  Readers understood that  so  when they came to the crucifixion  they naturally thought  and Rosewater read out loud again   Oh boy   they sure picked the wrong guy to lynch that time   And that thought had a brother   There are right people to lynch   Who  People who are not well connected  So it goes   So how would it be to read Slaughterhouse Five again after at least 20 years   phew   Better than ever  though I have to admit I read it after mourning KV s death this winter  so perhaps my perception was colored a tiny tiny bit  But wow  Vonnegut does his thing so perfectly  voice  story  humor  irony  and that sad  incredible tenderness toward his characters  If you don t know the gist  it s WWII  American prisoners of war during the firebombing of Dresden   which is based on KV s actual experience   But that s just the gist  as with all things Vonnegut  there are counterpoints and side stories and hoots and tears all along the way  One of the all time great anti war novels  So it goes  My favorite author   wacky but the underlying story is   based on him being one of the only survivors of Dresden  makes it very poignant  The book was banned because it was an uncomfortable truth  I really enjoyed this  At first the time travel thing was a bit nuts  but I got used to it  I listened to this via Audible  and must say James Franco was very flat in tone  Not quite monotonous  but barely enjoyable  There are no words that exist to possibly describe how I feel about this book  It s funny  satirical  powerfully  and at times  utterly grotesque  Vonnegut continues to amaze me and I can see the praise behind this novel   So interesting  The whole read I kept imagining myself flipping though tv channels  Time travel  war  alien abduction  death  life    If that sounds like an interesting mix pick up this book  This is one of my favorite books  I read it just before college and as everything in my life was about to change it was comforting to think how chaotic and confusing time and the world really are  First Vonnegut novel I ever tackled  It was simultaneously everything and nothing I was expecting  Easily my go to recommendation for those wishing to explore the narratives Vonnegut weaves Love Vonnegut and his loose stylizing  a little distractingly meta at times  but engaging overall  Great themes and relationships and some weird stuff sure  but in a self aware way  Great read  Loved the book  This gave me a closer examination of the massacre that occurred in Dresden  in a way that I have never understood before  The scope of the tragedy there  is incomprehensible  This gives a new look into what the American mindset has turned into in regards to war  and the sickening glorification of war  which is so often displayed  naively by lovers of the fight  Vonnegut makes you question everything you thought you knew about human suffering  and the connectivity of people  no matter the continent  Nieko nepadarysi  Laikas bega  ivykiai atsitinka  kad ir kas be nutiktu  tai jau praeitis  Nieko nepadarysi  istorijos nepakeisi  ji vyksta savaime  Si knyga buvo parasyta  buvo parasyta gerai  ji man patiko ir nieko del to nepadarysi  Dar viena knyga apie karo ziaurumus  ne tiek  kad ziaurumus  kiek tai  kad zmones kvaili  baisus ir tokie  kokie yra  Blogiausia  kad nieko nepadarysi del to  Si knyga padeda isisamoninti  jei dar neisisamoninai  kad viskas  kad ir ka bedarysi  kad ir kuo betapsi  kad ir kokiu DIDELIU zmogumi busi  vistiek mirsi ir nieko del to negali padaryti  CHA  Visi gimstame  gyvename ir mirstame  O kaip nugyvename taip  Tad bukim geri  nesvaistykime savo gyvenimo  Well    it does a lot of cool things  War novel  sci fi  philosophy  I think it succeeds in many places and that is what makes it excellent and appealing  While you might be bored by the reality  the warp in reality will hook anyone  Yet  the reasons we find the Tralfamadorians or whatever is through Billy s absolutely fucked war experience  While this is definitely satire  even if you can t enjoy or appreciate the satire aspect  you can trip out about the Tralfamador stuff  They see all time everything  they are God  but they are completely cool with it  Not like Dr  Manhattan  but like him heavily sedated and perhaps stoned with a lighter  less cynical soft rounded philosophical edge   Definitely a masterpiece  It could be one of the best dystopic books ever written  if the story told were not our recent reality  Death and war as they have never been described  Even funny at times  I think this is probably a  marmite book   reviewers seem to love it or hate it  Very few feel  meh  about it  I fall into the  love it  category  I can t remember the last time I read a book and before I got to the end started hunting round for another book by the same author  This is my first Vonnegut  It is not my last Vonnegut   This was my first expedition into Vonnegut and I adored it  Funny and quirky and sarcastic and touching  Vonnegut s sense of humor is nearly infantile but his wisdom in war and hatred and human extremes is ageless  I read it all in a single sitting  on a flight home from the state capital  and I remember sitting stretched out and staring into space after finishing the passage where he describes warplanes dropping bombs in reverse  where the planes suck the flames and destruction and bombs out of the city and fly them to a factory where they re dismantled and the minerals are buried back in the earth  It s heartbreaking and beautiful and is one of the greatest things I ve ever read   Billy Pilgrim has come unstuck in time   This is a book to love not only from its first page  but its very first sentence  if you don t count the author introduction that is   The opening line of the narrative is so wildly unique and daring  Within the first chapter we meet our main protagonist who has lost his connection with linear time and now jumps about to different periods in his life  Billy is a character who has survived the bombing of Dresden and who s been abducted by aliens  From the first page you get a sense of a book that s going to be funny  tragic and profound and is going to come at you in a crazy random narrative structure that you re not used to experiencing in fiction   This was my first time ever reading this book  I really had no idea what it was about  but I had heard of it time and time again   so I checked it out from the library and read it I am glad I read this book  I enjoyed it thuroughly  Where some people criticize Vonnegut s writing style for its simplistic repetitive nature  but I think it really adds to the book  I think if he had elaborated more it would have taken away from his point There were also times while I was reading where I had to reread what I had just read  I was rather shocked more than once with the words that I had just reviewed  This book was interesting  strange  and wonderful I highly recommend it   There are no telegrams on Tralfamadore  But you re right  each clump of symbols is a brief  urgent message  describing a situation  a scene  We Tralfamadorians read them all at once  not once after the other  There isn t any particular relationship between all the messages  except that the author has chosen them carefully  so that  when seen all at once  they produce an image of life that is beautiful and surprising and deep  There is no beginning  no middle  no end  no suspense  no moral  no causes  no effects  What we love in our books are the depths of many marvelous moments seen all at one time   p  76It was a compilation of one man s life  thrown together beautifully   Slaughterhouse Five has to be on of my favorites this year  it is a sci fi with many realistic elements hidden within  it is about a man who dies  and discovers that after death you relive your life all over  so he runs through his life multiple times  drifting through the same way each time  but he discovers that his life is much different from others  he discovered that he was taken by  aliens  onto their ship  they put him on exhibit in a zoo  with a famous  female  actor  just as they get used to living in the zoo  they get kicked out of the ship and return to their lives again  The real elements in this story involve the main character living through WWII  i give this book a 5 5  Existentialism put in 4 dimensions in a way that only Vonnegut can  I believe that because Vonnegut actually did experience all that he mentioned in the war  he truly captivates the appropriate levels of stress  but still staying true to the thinker that he is  Billy Pilgrim is Kurt Vonnegut  just from the outside  Tralfamadorians  I believe  are Vonnegut s counter argument to his own philosophy  They believe that time was  is  and always will be in the state that it is in  We can do nothing to change that  From an existentialist s point of view  we are not constrained by time  but merely limited by it  We can not travel in it  but we can adjust for what we believe the future holds  Being someone who ponders such things about time and life and death quite often  i was both pleased and shocked to find such philosophies in a book that was described to me as  a satirical commentary on World War 2   After I read the first chapter I was wondering what all this stuff about trafamadorians had to do with the war whatsoever  and it wasn t until halfway through the book that I realized what Vonnegut was doing He picks apart your brain  takes it out of shape piece by piece and then rebuilds it in a perspective that blows you away  This is the only way one could truly express just how foolish writing an  anti war  book would be  No one could put this the way Vonnegut put it   my very first vonnegut  and what i consider to be one of the most perfect books of all time  the prose is typical vonnegut    unadorned  unassuming  definitely male    but it still one of the loveliest books i ve ever read  i first read this book in 8th grade or so  circa 1988 or so  and it turned out to strongly influence the way i would look at the world thereafter  one of those books  along with  the hitchhiker s guide to the galaxy    jane eyre   and  alice s adventures in wonderland   that i will never grow tired of  This book is great  The writing is on point and the story is amazing  The fact that many schools have it banned from the reading list is asinine  A must read for anyone fond of lit  Billy Pilgrim is a man who survived the bombing of Dresden as a prisoner of war  He has become unstuck in time and he travels among the different parts of his life  seemingly randomly  Parts of his life seem very real  such as his experiences in the war  while others are somewhat fanciful  such as when he is abducted by aliens and taken to a zoo on another world  As the reader skips throughout time with Billy  they begin to wonder what reality is and could it be that war itself is absurd  The book examines themes such as fate and determinism and nature of war  Although the satire makes the reader think about serious and complicated issues  it was an easy and quick read for me  Was worth reading againIt seems unimpressive during the first chapter  but the way everything is recursive  folding the book onto itself  creates a unique dynamic  This book was characterized as charmingly hilarious with great sarcasm  and though I see where that comes from  there is a bitter sadness that you feel as you are reading it  I loved it   The main reason I m writing a review for this book is to say this  if you haven t read it  go read it  And if it s been quite a while since you ve last read it  go read it again   Un libro che meriterebbe cinque stelle anche solo per questa parte   Tutto il tempo e tutto il tempo  Non cambia  Non si presta ad avvenimenti o spiegazioni  E  e basta  Lo prenda momento per momento e vedra che siamo tutti  come ho detto prima  insetti nell ambra    Su Tralfamadore  dice Billy Pilgrim  non c e molto interesse per Gesu Cristo  La figura terrestre che piu colpisce i Tralfamadoriani  dice lui  e quella di Charles Darwin  che insegno che chi muore deve morire e che i cadaveri sono un miglioramento  Cosi va la vita   really liked this book  thought it was real original  the way the author has us follow billy pilgrim throughout the strange  surreal events of his life is done cleverly  Very memorable story  Wonderfully witty and absolutely unique  If you are going to start reading Vonnegut  start here  I believe that this book really explains a lot about who he was and what made him him  Vonnegut is not just an author  he s an artist  This short little book does so much  Vonnegut unwraps the story little by little  but quickly  shedding morsels of insight on a character or event just when you start to question it  I loved this book  and will probably read it again and again   Some people won t get this  and give it only 2 starsOh     I also read 100 years of solitude  This too is a load of cock  Any one who likes this lads writing is a bleedin liar   One of the strongest depictions of war i have ever read  Brilliantly written  Vonnegut adopts a very unique style of writting which  nonetheless  underlines his main idea  that of war having a devastating effect on everything human  destroying everything beautiful and far from being heroic and honorable  One of the most beautifully written books I ve ever read  Every passage is crafted so thoughtfully  without the pretentious feel of when writers like John Green try to replicate that   Recommended especially to those who suppose the patriotism can be proved by any means and it is something to give respect to   Even if by fighting for it we kill another human beings  The lands  borders are only exist on the paper printed maps   I expect it s best to read this book whole at the same time    but it s definitely quite enjoyable to do it in a more conventionally linear fashion for everyone who s not Tralfamadorian  There s not much more to add here that many people haven t before  but a better book about war  man s inhumanity to man and the grappling with that the narrator takes on is masterful  I had never read anything by Vonnegut before  and I am glad I began with this book  I loved it  From the view of the Dresden incident  and the highlight of the fact that Dresden tends to get skipped when it comes times for people to learn about the war  Despite the age of this novel  published in 1969  the points it raises still hold true today  The mix of semi autobiographical writing and science fiction made for a interesting mix  and with enough social satire thrown into the mix to compliment both sides without over powering either one  I will certainly be looking to read of Vonnegut  and can certainly say that this will not be that last time I pick up this novel   I loved it  This is the novel that really got me into Kurt Vonnegut  It was initially assigned in high school where we had a list of novels to choose from  Luckily  I chose this  and I ve never been more glad that I did  I went out and bought 6 more of his books after finishing this and Cat s Cradle  All around  Vonnegut manages to keep you entertained throughout the Tralfamadorian filled plot  which makes the reading a breeze  Some may call it choppy due to the  fourth dimension  being introduced  however  I think it adds more suspense and depth to the story  I will probably end up reading this a few more times throughout my life  and I can t wait to reach his other novels now  I poured through every Vonnegut novel I could find when I was in high school  Definitely not part of my small town English curriculum and I remember the feeling that I had discovered something really special Reading this timeless novel again  I found myself flashing back to thoughts and feelings I had thirty plus years ago  so I imagined myself as Billy Pilgrim jumping around in time  That was a lot of fun Its just thrilling how sublimely Vonnegut can wrap up the politics  outrage and horror of the Dresden firebombing in this silly time travel story about the novels of Kilgore Trout When I turn 85 I read this novel for the third time and am enjoyed it just as much  This was one of my all time favorite books on tape I listened to while commuting in Los Angeles  The whole war and violence mixed in with aliens and sex seemed appropriate at the time while I was speeding on the San Diego Freeway with all the others  A friend suggested that I might need to clarify my description above  I meant that listening to Vonnegut teleport from a wounded soldier in Germany to an older man on an alien planet with his porn star girlfriend  it seemed like an LA sort of experience  You never know who is in the car next to you or where they have been   I didn t mean that I wanted to have sex with everyone speeding down the San Diego Freeway  OK   Tenho sido um fa de Kurt Vonnegut desde que eu li o seu livro  Slapstick   Li o seu livro mais famoso   Slaughterhouse Five  duas vezes em ingles e por isso  quando decidi ler um livro portugues  escolhi esta traducao  Matadouro Cinco e um livro excelente em qualquer lingua  E a historia dum soldado  Billy Pilgrim  e das suas viagens de Ilium Nova Iorque ate Dresden na Alemanha e ao planeta Tralfamadore  Comeca assim   Escutem  Billy Pilgrim tornou se voluvel no tempo  e termina assim   Piu titi priu   Nas paginas intervenientes ha muitos incidentes loucos e muitas mortes   E e assim  Acho que o tradutor e excelente  Gosto muito este livro  Eu recomendo o definitivamente  There are some books that I feel cannot be truly enjoyed until they are studied with a scholar professor of the author s works  These include  Catch 22  Ulysses  and Slaughterhouse Five  While I couldn t put down my first Vonnegut novel  I know there is a lot that I missed while reading  and could easily reread this book multiple times  and pick up something new with each reading  which is one of the many reasons why Vonnegut is such a great author   I hope to be able to study Vonnegut in an academic setting one day  but until then I will be mesmerized with his genius retelling of the horrors of one man s experience during World War II  and how it haunted him throughout his life   my memory of this is hazy  but it blew my mind at the time and that is the basis of my rating  rather than add all the Vonnegut books i ve read  about 17 or 18 I think  17 of those all in the space of a few months in 1990   i ll say in general that I definitely don t think they are all of equal quality  I remember particularly liking Welcome to the Monkey House  Bluebeard  Cat s Cradle  Mother Night  the ones i particularly remember not liking so much are Deadeye Dick and Breakfast of Champions  If you reminded me of a few details of other books i d probably remember my impression of those as well  but it was a long time ago and I wouldn t guarantee anything now on that basis   And I asked myself about the present  how wide it was  how deep it was  how much was mine to keep    18   So it goes    24   Among the things Billy Pilgrim could not change were the past  the present  and the future    60   Well  here we are  Mr  Pilgrim  trapped in the amber of this moment  There is no why    77   I think you guys are going to have to come up with a lot of wonderful new lies  or people just aren t going to want to go on living    101   Everything was beautiful  and nothing hurt   122   He had supposed for years that he had no secrets from himself  Here was proof that he had a great big secret somewhere inside  and he could not imagine what it was    173   The story of Billy Pilgrim  who sees a one shot during the aftermath of the bombing of Dresden  for stealing a loaf of bread  After the shock of WWII he becomes unstuck in time  and meets a race of time travelling aliens who show him that time is  in fact  not a continuous spectrum  but exists all at one  At one point he imagine all of the bombs rising up from the cities and towns of europe and being swallowed by airplanes as the building a fields put themselves back together again  The planes fly backwards to their ports and the bombs are unloaded and driven  backwards  to factories where they are disassembled  their component parts distributed and buried in the earth   My brother is a huge fan of Vonnegut  so much so that when I was perhaps 14 I tried to read God Bless You  Mr  Rosewater  That dream ended only a few pages in when young me had no idea what was going on  Small attention span at the time  So this was my first Vonnegut read in my last year of high school  It was everything I hoped for  It was thoughtful  interesting  exciting  and unusual  I have not read a lot more Vonnegut since then  something which I regret  End of high school me really appreciate the commentary on implications of deterministic views of reality on the concept of free will  I do not think I took as much away from the book on commentary about war as I should have  I wish I read the book before the movie  Still trying to completly comprehend the meaning of the book but I think its something along the lines that all that is happening in this moment has always happened and will always happen  so relax and surrender to right now My favorite quote from any book ever comes from this book  its the line when the narrotor describes how billy sees all the bombs going in reverse  going back up to the planes and the planes flying backwards  and the people disassmbling the bombs and buring the pieces back into the ground to make sure they never hurt anyone again  A great anti war book about the tanquility of all the peaceful moments in life  I am in love with Kurt vonnegut s writing  I constantly found myself distracted by my admiration for both his writing style and his word choice  I definitely recommend this book Vonnegut as man yra tarsi R  Gavelio dede is Amerikos  Nors ju aprasomus ivykius skiria desimtmeciai laike ir simtai  tukstanciai  kilometru erdveje  to net nejauti  Gal del to panasumo knyga tokia paveiki ir kazkuo artima Be karu istorijos vadoveliai nebutu idomus  bet uz ju visad slypi gyvas zmogus  kuriam visa tai tenka tiesiogiai patirti  Ir tik pazvelge is to zmogaus perspektyvos galime pamatyti  koks s     visa tai  Nieko nepadarysi   vis dusauja knygos pasakotojas  O gal    Just finished  Slaughterhouse V  on my birthday  for my birthday  In 1969 it cost  1 95  I bought a used copy for  5 50  Kurt Vonnegut  Jr has been dead for six years  So it goes  i admire kurt  he was able to tell this story from the most human pov  we can live through the unspeakable and some become like him amazing jewels in the mine of humankind   So it goesThis being my first Vonnegut I see why he has such a large following  His writing style is plain but dark  humorous  and full of complex subtext  Metaficcion  el autor nos cuenta sus dificultades para escribir el libro  La historia de Billy es sencillamente espectacular  Un ser patetico  un loco mas producto de la guerra nos da ensenanzas mas claras que las de Darwin  y con sus viajes nos entrega una historia por entregas apasionante  delirante  una mezcla de ciencia ficcion con novela historica  un narrador escritor que aparece en la trama muy ocasionalmente  todas las historias igual de apasionantes  igual de perturbadoras  que nos dejan pensando colgados del techo sin respuestas claras o precisas  justo lo que esperaria un trafagaldoriano  One of the best books I ve ever read An amazing book  A strange mix of war  sci fi and a great character novel  A must read for any who despise tradition  I always felt that I needed to read this book  It s a cult classic in my opinion and it doesn t disappoint  Quick read that you can get through in a day if you re dedicated   This was one of my absolute favorite books  The author s dark humor and the somewhat off the wall themes made this book exciting  I would definitely recommend it to anyone    The main thing now was to find the steering wheel  At first  Billy windmilled his arms  hoping to find it by luck  When that didn t work  he became methodical  working in such a way that the wheel could not possibly escape him  He placed himself hard against the left handed door  searched every square inch of the area before him  When he failed to find the wheel  he moved over six inches  and searched again  Amazingly  he was eventually hard against the right hand door  without having found the wheel  He concluded that somebody had stolen it  This angered him as he passed out  He was in the back seat of his car  which was why he couldn t find the steering wheel    InterestingVery confusing at first requiring me to backtrack some  but once understood the message is clear and resounding  very adult subject matter however  I finished reading it and I liked it but it didn t leave me impressed  I closed the book and slept  The next day I woke up just thinking about life and all of a sudden realized I was quoting the book  It seeps through silently  For that the author is great   The most important thing I learned on Tralfamadore was that when a person dies he only appears to die  He is still very much alive in the past  so it is very silly for people to cry at his funeral  All moments  past  present  and future  always have existed  always will exist  The Tralfamadorians can look at all the different moments just the way we can look at a stretch of the Rocky Mountains  for instance  They can see how permanent all the moments are  and they can look at any moment that interests them  It is just an illusion we have here on Earth that one moment follows another one  like beads on a string  and that once a moment is gone it is gone forever    With many books on my list  ratings I gave are based on the impact they had on me at the time I read them  without revision or reassessment of the import they might have for me today To be honest  I can t even remember exactly what I liked about the book 30 years ago  but I do remember I was a big fan and afterwards I read several other Vonnegut  and Kilgore Trout   books  I m pretty sure I liked the fact that it was about time travel and aliens  and cared less about the fact that it depicted the horrors of war  violence and mental illness  and the absolutely positively mostly true events described in Dresden  One of the seminal works of speculative fiction that I just somehow kept missing  It s strange  moving  and still important today  I m happy that I did finally dive in   Re read this recently and I forgot how much I love Vonnegut  even made my mom read it  So seemingly random and pointless but then you get so much from it each time you read it  I adore the way this was written  This blends an actual life altering event with radical fiction to produce an entertaining and informative read  I will go back to this many times  OMG I HAD NO IDEA THIS BOOK WAS SO TIGHTLY TIED TO THE TV SHOW LOST  What the hell was I doing when I was watching the show  Either way  Desmond would recommend this book  brotha  MY FAVORITE BOOK OF ALL TIME AND SPACE  there is not a doubt in my mind that I will be rereading this novel until I can smell the wear and tear off of the loved  yellowed pages    This is some deeply quality Science fiction  What really adds to the depth is the fact that the author was present for the historical events giving them some serious added depth I love how this book can be read both as a science fiction novel and as the story of a man broken by war and suffering the severe psychological effects  This book is brilliant   This book significantly relates to Vonnegut s own life  It was a pretty easy read and though some parts may make the reader turn away from the book  it was generally good  One of my favorites  I appreciate Vonnegut s originality and creativity  especially in this book  My mother called it  psychedelic  which is a good description of this book    If what Billy Pilgrim learned from the Tralfamadorians is true  that we will all live forever  no matter how dead we may sometimes seem to be  I am not overjoyed  Still  if I am going to spend eternity visiting this moment and that  I m grateful that so many of those moments are nice    I had to read this book twice to fully understand and appreciate it  Kurt Vonnegut s wit  satire  and commentary is so deeply imbedded in this novel that it must be fully taken apart and reassembled in order to  begin to  understand it all  He deftly uses the character of Billy Pilgrim  and the planet Tralfamadore  to illustrate the many faults of humanity  One of the biggest themes to emerge through this commentary is how a person s free will is in fact an illusion  because our lives are all predetermined stories that we can t do anything to change  Though not everyone may believe this  including Vonnegut himself  it is an interesting way to view how our lives unfold   When I said I ve read this book  I m lying  I haven t read it  but I will  I have  however  read an adapted script    I m going to be in this play for the next few months in the ensemble  as a G I   and as a Tralfamadorian  The concept is brilliant  It is the opposite of anthropocentric  it gets us out of ourselves  Throughout the course of the story  we catch glimpses into the lives of POW  some optometrists  professors    people all over who Billy has interacted with  On top of forcing us to think about other people than the protagonist we always get so attached to  we have to think about an entire alien race  A race with totally different concepts than humans   I read this book on my own somewhere before or around my Junior year of High School  It had a subtle but deeply profound impact on my life  provoking personal contemplation about life  death  the universe and well  everything  Billy Pilgrim s displaced odyssey through time spoke to me as a man trying to figure out what his life was worth  and in a larger context  what life itself is really worth at all  The Tralfamadorian long view concept of time still moves me from time to time  and the depiction of the firebombing of Dresden really extenuates the pure senseless of destruction and human aggression  One of my favorite books of all time  God bless you  Mr  Vonnegut  Hoofdstuk 1  Laatste alinea Dit boek is een mislukking en dat kon ook niet anders  want het is geschreven door een zoutpilaar  Het begint zo Luister Billy Pilgrim is losgeraakt van de tijd En het eindigt zo Poe tie wietAlleen hierom al 5 sterren  Ook de rest van het boek verdienen de vijf sterren en de klassieker status Amerikaanse soldaat overleeft als een van de weinig het bombardement van Dresden omdat het slachthuis waarin ze zitten toevallig bomb proof is  Man denkt ontvoerd te zijn door buitenaardse wezens en leeft daarom paralel aan onze tijd  Aan het einde van onze tijd ontmoet hij in het ziekenhuis de opdrachtgever van het bombardement I really enjoyed this book  I had to read it for my AP Literature class  but I think that I would have read it by myself anyway  Parts of it were extremely messed up and confusing  especially when you start it thinking it is going to be solely about WWII   but your confusion helps add to the overall wackiness of the story  It is very moving  and makes you think about things in different perspectives  I greatly enjoyed the book  but I don t think that most people will  it might be too crazy for some people  There are adult situations in the book  so it is not suitable for younger readers  Other than that  its a great book  and you should read it with and open mind  Slaughterhouse five is fantastic  engaging and witty  It took me a while to finally read this and it was just as strong as I expected  A perfect blend of science fiction and war story with a healthy dose of time travel and just plain insight  Vonnegut sucks the reader into a strange  but believable world  He also plays with narrative voice and plot in ways that I just love  I really love Vonnegut s style  his books flow with such ease  They also get their point across without over doing  and I like that part of it really is the story telling  So over all I just really enjoyed this book  I can now say there is a reason that this is such a well loved and influential book  I re read this book in December with my book group  With the exception of one other person in the group  the rest are in their thirties  I read the book the first time when I was about 25near the end of the Vietnam War  I remember it as a strong anti war book and slightly science fiction  Now I read it as an account of Post traumatic Stress Disorder and it is very relevant to today s PTSD sufferers  I love Billy Pilgrim s escapes to Trafalmador with Mona Wildhack and I love the clever way he puts those links in the story that reference Billy s hallucinations  It was really fun to read this book again and to participate in its discovery by my daughter s generation  Each of the three times I ve read this book I ve devoured it all the way through in a single sitting  whether that was from 4pm to 6am or from 8am to 9pm  Vonnegut s prose is so light  friendly  and readable there s not a single sentence that isn t smooth and doesn t go down like greased lightning  even with the protagonist jumping through time every chapter or so  Thinking about it now this book has done more for my personal point of view of the universe  and human nature  than a dozen years of school and a dozen years of working or even a dozen failed relationships  It s a thin book  but worth your time and space on the book shelf  and in your carry on luggage   Jos jedna ratna knjiga  na tragu Kvake 22    ispreplicu se tragicno i komicno  apsurdna  minimalisticka  gotovo infantilni pripovjedac  ironicna   sve sto volim Second favorite book of all time  Vonnegut is my favorite author  and this book is just so much in a few pages  in godlike chosen words  F ck  this book is too good  Fast  good read with satire enhancing its anti war message  I read it in college  but had forgotten a lot  I think it s the best Vonnegut book  I highly recommend it  Loved  How often do you get to put together a puzzle while reading a book  A complex  tragic  whirlwind of a puzzle that is outstandingly well written      I m not sure what to say about this book  except that I dog eared most pages  and read it in one 4 hour sitting  Kurt Vonnegut is quotable  absurd  and on point  I honestly can t rate this book  it s either a one or a five but I cannot tell which perspective to view this book from  Five  for being comically disturbing  complexly simple  and a good damn story  The symbolism in the story was like no other symbolism because it s wasn t confusing to be picked apart  it just was  The whole book was frank and to the point but so deep at the same time  Nothing was confusing and everything made sense but in another way it didn t One  for being resident and untypical  The story was a story  not a novel  No climax or thing for the reader to follow or prepare for  it was just a big ramble of life and then it was over  This was my first Vonnegut book and the book that won me over  He s since become my favorite author  and has a wonderful outlook on the world that I find relatable  Each tome you pass through a door  you step into another world  Dreamlike  mildly disorienting  And if someone s dead  don t worry  They are alive in the past   Most likely my favorite book ever  but it has been interesting that when I was younger  I found it hysterical  but now when I read it again  it s so much sadder  This is one of those must read books  a classic among the few anti war novels ever written  but very sci fi and imaginative  In a weird sort of way  I did enjoy it   A wonderful novel  really interesting premise  unusual blending of WWII theme and alien abductions  wtf   Would certainly recommend as a book to entertain and make you think   I read this first as an impressionable teenager and  having revisited it as an adult  I realize just how much of my identity was formed from this novel  Poo tee weet   Ok  por partes Este es un libro  que mas que una cronica de un PoW  mas que un relato de un postwar stressed vet  mas que un recuento pro  o anti guerra es un estudio narrativo increible  Este libro no es lo que cuenta  si no COMO lo cuenta  Sus cambios de tiempo volatiles mataron  So it goes  la forma lineal de leer y eso me deja muy en claro el por que este es un libro importantisimo del siglo anterior  Poo tee weet  chavos   Brilliant  Bizarre  Brutal   So it goes  will haunt me forever  I think One heck of an emotive book  Don t question it  accept it and how it makes you feel Wow  Very enjoyable and thought provoking read  A curious mix between Heller and Salinger in style  but with a much more ingenious structure  He handles the concept of time in a very unique way  and the plot moves on apace  although it is sometimes a little difficult to follow the action  The characterisation is excellent with neat little portraits and beautifully observed interactions  Although the anti war theme is clear it is not overplayed and is thoughtfully embedded in alternative viewpoints and off beat humour  One of the finest books out there about the human experience and the insanity of war  This book does not glorify war at all but shows the ugliness  I saw Kurt Vonnegut speak and another audience member asked him if Billy Pilgrim was based on a real person  The answer was yes  Billy Pilgrim was based on a fellow soldier who became catatonic in the underground hell of their prison camp and slowly starved to death Vonnegut is both a realist and a visionary in his craft  Slaughter House Five is beautifully written  showing compassion and humor  It will make you want to cry and then make you laugh out loud  That s just how Vonnegut is  That s just how life is  You can never go wrong with Vonnegut  and this is one of his most well known works  with good reason  I would recommend putting it at the top of your reading list and to start it right about now  You ll be down in 1 2 days  because chances are  you won t be able to put it down  Vonnegut is at his best here  the way he can create such real  dynamic characters who are sometimes awful  sometimes brilliant  and sometimes both  The way he can connect so many threads in different stories to create a picture of the world that  despite having science fictiony elements  feels   real  I could go on and on  but you re way better off to just go read it on your own   The second Vonnegut book I re read this summer  after Breakfast of Champions  Definitely enjoyed revisiting this one  although I don t think it had the same impact as when I first read it in high school  Maybe not a true five star classic for me  but I thought I would round my rating up  since I rounded my Breakfast of Champions rating down to four   Seriously   when is this site going to start allowing half stars    Slaughterhouse Five is right up there with Cat s Cradle as one of the most well known Kurt Vonnegut books  While it s not my favourite  it s obviously an incredible book  I love this book  and I ve proven that by reading it as many times as I have  Billy Pilgrim and the Tralfamadorians have stuck with me pretty hard since the first time I read this book  Like with many people  it was the first Vonnegut novel I got my eager little hands on  It did not disappoint me at all  and that is why I continued on to read every single other novel written by this glorious gift to mankind  It s a perfect introduction or otherwise to Vonnegut and should not be missed  My video review is here   http   tinyurl com 7btdxasThis book manages to create the feeling that both all the time in the world is passing by and yet none at all  Time is explained to not exist and so the book jumps around with Billy pilgrim as he experiences his life from the most genius perspective I have ever seen  The book is seamless  I can t think of a single moment that I wanted it to end and yet the book lacks traditionally deep characters  Each character feels like a shell of a human being  a stylistic choice that Vonnegut explains within the book itself  I absolutely adore this book and I will treasure it for the rest of my life  A must read  Wonderful  wonderful book    though a classic like this does not need my praise or two cents  really  The writing style of Vonnegut is just so unique and clever  He throws in the most poignant turns of phrase and doesn t dwell on them  He just leaves these deep  poignant thoughts at the end of brief  paragraph long encounters and they say more than if he had spend 10 pages on the subject Having the main character  Billy  jumping back and forth through time made this an incredibly fast read  There are just little windows of his life  moments that all build together and slowly become something more  Really brilliant  I loved every moment of reading this book  A moving novel about war and the dignity and indignity of humankind  I wanted to laugh and it cry  it was so ridiculous  and so horribly true   So it goes   Cat s Cradle is still my favorite by a wide margin  If listening to the audiobook  the out of print narrated by Ethan Hawke is very quiet and soothing   Great book  It reminded me of Catch 22  but for WWII  Great story about the insanity that comes from horrendous tragedy and how people cope with atrocities   What do I think  I think I was foolish for waiting so long to read this book  I ve read Vonnegut before  not as mush as I should  this is my favorite so far   god grant me the serenity to accept the things i cannot change  courage to change the things i can  and wisdom always to tell the difference  so it goes  The joke behind the name Kilgore Trout was like an unexploded bomb in my head for twenty years until the day I noticed I was using a Kilgore brand toilet  Life behind the war from 2 generations  Father to son over a span of a lifetime   The fathers  has a tearjerking ending  Highly recommended reading it  Unfathomable that it has taken me this long to finally get to reading this author  Now I can die secure in the knowledge that I have read Vonnegut  So it goes  Classic Vonnegut wit and wisdom read by Ethan Hawke  Made my walks to works for those two weeks delightful and thought provoking  What a master of motif  Definitely one of the best novels I ve read in ages  Kudos to Vonnegut   His writing style is both amazing and refreshing  just what I need on a dreary uni afternoon  I don t usually like books about war  not an ethics thing  just an interest thing  but this one is only KIND OF about war  and Vonnegut does his awesome Vonnegut thing  layering deep insights with comical absurdities  so in the end  I couldn t get enough  When I finished this book  I started over from the beginning again  and found even more to love and admire the second time around  I m disappointed that I didn t read this in high school like so many others  All this wasted time  Making plans to visit the REAL Billy Pilgrim s grave next time I m in Rochester  NY  Turns out his name was Edward R  Crone Jr  and he s buried in Mt Hope Cemetery   InterestingI enjoyed this classic novel which provides an interesting view of one man s struggle with surviving his experience in war  great  engaging read  Was supposed to read this in high school  but didn t  What an idiot I must have been  Great  engaging read   So that s why its called Slaughterhouse Five  This was brilliant   narratively ingenious  well paced  but also dealing with a really difficult subject with a pitch perfect distance  tonally not too detached and yet not maudlin  just    present  and overwhelmed  which I imagine what real war and death on all sides must feel like For some reason my favourite quote is    Really  I m ok   And he was  too  except that he could find no explanation why the song had affected him so grotesquely  He had supposed for years that he had no secrets from himself  Here was proof that he had a great big secret somewhere inside  and he could not imagine what it was   These stars are based on my recollection from 40 years ago  and change   and the fact that I still think of this book whenever I hear the phrase  so it goes    One of those rare classics that are as good as everyone says they are  I didn t read this until my 30s but now I m going to have to reread soon  Fascinating   I sincerely apologize to the world and all its inhabitants for not having read this book sooner There are no words to describe this book  None of it makes sense  yet all of it makes sense Sometimes you d be reading ridiculous paragraphs about Yon Yonson  who works in Wisconsin  in a lumbermill there  and wondering what on earth was even going on  when there would come a word  a sentence or a phrase  that would hit you hard in the stomach  make you stop reading  look at the ceiling and just contemplate the universe  God and everything Yes  the book is that good Reading Slaughterhouse Five is an experience  It has been an honor  4 5 out of 5 stars  I liked the characters and the major story but sometimes it was a bit tough to follow and a bit confusing but it was fun none the less  Very different  Very thought  provoking  I love good humor used in serious matters  I also really liked Billy Pilgram s outlook on life and death  even though he was a literally disturbed   So it goes  It took me a while to become engaged with the plot  but once I hit chapter 3  I was sucked right in  It was definitely one of the best reads I had this break  This is an unusual anti war satire that takes a couple reads  I m not sure I will ever understand everything that goes on but it is an intriguing ride   My favourite book  Even with its strange remove  its stutter step quality  vignettes like birds  But a book with a golden heart  shining with empathy   One of the absolute must read books of all time What happens happens  Or is there more to it Funny  thought provoking and just magnificent in every way Being a soldier robs you of your liberty  You become an extension of a higher power  your government  and at the same time you are exposed to massive trauma  To cope with this one may become an automaton  an unfeeling machine who no longer acts not of its own volition  Vonnegut shows us how people are affected by war and he does it with a marvelous black humour   There are almost no characters in this story  and almost no dramatic confrontations  because most of the people in it are so sick  and so much the listless playthings of enormous forces  One of the main effects of war  after all  is that people are discouraged from being characters  What a trippy novel  The interesting aspect of this particular novel was its slipping in and out of differing time spaces  The main character  forgive me I cannot remember his name  begins in a WWII prison as a German POW  then transports off to some other planet where he is a zoo specimen for aliens  he has a porn star for a mate  Talk about interesting  I will have to say that if you are not one of those people out there who like the disjointed time stories  such as in  Pulp Fiction   then do not invest the time  However  if you are open minded and are willing to follow the metal and character shifts  then this can a be a fun literary treat   I read this first my senior year of High school and it blew my mind  We watched the film in class but it didn t really work because the movie was shot linearly so the concept of the whole book was blown I love the idea of time  and anything to do with WW2 is interesting in my book  And so it goes  Here are a few quotes for you to get a taste of the magnificence this book beholds  The most important thing I learned on Tralfamadoe was that when a person dies he only appears to die  He is still very much alive in the past   He has always pressed it  and he always will  We always let him and we always will  The moment is structured that way   One of several fine books by Vonnegut  This one explores concepts currently central to the TV show  Lost   In Vonnegut s book  protagonist Billy Pilgrim comes  unstuck in time   much as Desmond has over a pair of episodes in  Lost  in February  2008  Even the term  unstuck in time  was used on the show  a clear nod to Vonnegut It has been said that Vonnegut wrote the same book over and over again  and a common theme is his witnessing of the bombing of Dresden by Allied forces during World War II  His insightful and humorous take on the world always makes you think   Slapstick  and  Breakfast of Champions  are two other winners from Vonnegut  This was the first Vonnegut book I read for a class in high school  Usually when I m told to read a book  I balk as much as possible but this drew me in with its strangeness and beauty  Just when you re like  where the fuck did these aliens come from   a profound  deeply stirring line will draw you back in and remain stuck in your head like a line from a song  This book will make you want to get tattoos that say  so it goes  all over your body  or at least that s how I felt  Definitely a great introduction to Vonnegut  especially when you consider his history in Dresden and how much he struggled to write this book  All in all  surreal and glorious   I found this book a more challenging read than other Vonnegut works I ve read thus far  I didn t infer any particular message as many reviews seem to  There is something being expressed in this story about humanity  and certainly about war and our conditioning towards it  Beyond this I haven t organized my thoughts  But in reaching the end I felt that I had experienced something important that maybe can t be articulated any other way than Kilgore Trout s stories  or seeing the universe through Tralfamadorian eyes  I don t know if I could call this book my favorite of Vonnegut s  but it s definitely going to stick with me in a way others may not  I read Vonnegut s Cat s Cradle years ago and loved it but never picked up his  significantly  more famous Slaughterhouse Five Slaughterhouse Five is a book about war and one man going insane because of it  Billy slips in and out of sanity as he struggles with PTSD and how to balance the past and present  His loose grasp on time  and reality  reveals a man using what he can to cope with war  loss and life I don t know what more to say this book punches you in the guts and leaves you wheezing even after you turn the last page  Read it  And if you know a soldier  anyone dealing with trauma or think war is a skip through the park  read it twice  An anti war book about the bombing of Dresden  Germany  in WWII mixed with sci fi elements  time travel and the satirical style of Vonnegut that I came to admire when reading his short stories Billy Pilgrim is confused  Because of the war  because of his kidnapping to an alien planet  because his wife he never really loved and because of so many other reasons  He cannot stay in one time for too long  he is bound to jump Although it may sound like it  there s not too much sci fi to scare away serious readers  not too much war terror to scare off the faint of heart  yet the overall package is a real masterpiece of literature  Highly recommendable  Although this novel tells an amazing story  I think the plot and characters are secondary to the sheer genius of the structure of the novel  As Billy Pilgrim has become  unstuck in time   and travels out of order throughout the moments and events in his life  we are shown these moments and events out of chronological order as well  Of course  the Tralfamadorians  the alien creatures who abduct Pilgrim  would say there is no chronological order to time  it is all happening at once  Only we  as humans  are unable to see it  There is no cause and effect  there is no free will  Everything that will ever happen has already happened and is always happening  Wow  My mind is blown  I still haven t gotten all the pieces back to put it together again This book is so intricate  it s hard to tell what s really going on  Oh  the surface story is pretty easy   it s just the meanings behind everything  the unseen connections  that are so terribly complex  They re always there  and it s driving me crazy trying to figure them all out There s a comment on the back cover that says something like   a funny book but you re not allowed to laugh   a sad book but you can t cry   I think that sums up the tone of this book perfectly  That may sound completely contradictory  but that s just Vonnegut s genius  A mix of science fiction and history  Slaughter House Five was fabulous  Billy  the main character became  unstuck in time  and traveled through time to the present and future  abducted by aliens and relived the Dresden s fire bombings in Germany during WWII as a POW  Vonnegut s prose was straight forward and fluid as if a telling a story straight to the reader  The reader first heard Billy s life story in a brief over glance  later  through time traveling with Billy  saw a deeper look into his life before and after the war  Because of the different dimensions involved with the book  it fully engages the reader  taking them to Tralfamadore and back  Really loved Vonnegut s  Slaughterhouse Five   I recommend not to read the German translation  which is quiet bad  but the English original is wonderful  The story itself is depressing and shows us again the madness of World War II  The senseless of the destruction of Dresden which is reflected by the narrator Billy Pilgrim  An American soldier who is dealing with his experiences he made during the fire bombing of Dresden while he was in captivity  Vonnegut is using surreal and absurd anecdotes to tell his stirring story  I really loved the way he mixed science fiction and anti war novel  Really a perfect way to show the absurdity of war  If you were to ask me what my favorite book is  I would give a slight smile and say   Slaughterhouse Five   This book is about a man who time travels throughout different periods of his life to experience certain events again  This book is incredible and is placed in the time period of World War II  which is one of my favorite time periods to learn about  This book is a great read  however  this book is extremely graphic and has very explicit scenes  I would recommend this book for very mature high schoolers  It is a great book  but with very strong topics and adult themes  children will have to wait until their teen years to experience this gem  This book made me a Vonnegut fan  I had always wanted to read one of his books and had never got around to it  After I completed this novel in a couple of days  I wanted to find out what else Vonnegut wrote immediately  If you are accustomed to typical plot formats  then Slaughter House Five may not be the book for you  The novel involves a main character  Billy Pilgrim  traveling from place to place  like Dresden during World War II to a married life in New York and then to another planet  The novel is thought provoking and will have you considering the implications of the events in the story for the main character long after you have read it   this is the first time i ve read slaughterhouse five  though not the first time i ve read vonnegut  and i have to admit to being a little happy i never had to read it in high school for one particular reason  and it s that i don t think i would have appreciated it this book is beautiful  brilliant  poetic  poignant  heartbreaking  hilarious  matter of fact  fantastical  and more real than most things these days claim to be  and it is due every bit of praise that s ever been thrown its way  i would say i was sad that it was over  but   so it goes  A fractured view of a fractured mind living in a fractured world  Set against the horror that was WWII Vonnegut weaves together pieces of Billy Pilgrim  time traveller  optometrist  alien exhibit and accidental soldier  I really enjoyed the style  jumping back and forth through time with Billy allowed moments of time to enhance future and past moments in the book  Just as Billy himself said you should try to see all moments at once  as all existing at the same time  The book needs to be viewed as a whole rather than a collection of individual moments  that way you can truly enjoy the good moments because you know which ones they are   Wonderful book we were supposed to read in school  but never got the chance  I m glad I did  because it completely changed my outlook on things I was too young to fully appreciate this book when I first read it a couple of decades ago  The nonlinear postmodernist structure allows a freeform way for Vonnegut to comment on life s meaning  or lack thereof   At first disorientating  Billy Pilgrim s becoming unstuck in time provides the perfect structure for commenting on existence  especially given the refrain  so it goes  which is repeated over a hundred time in the course of this short novel  It s a crazy story that just may be the most sane commentary on life written  The narration by James Franco is excellent as well  I can t wait to read this one again and again and again now  Although it s considered a war or anti war novel  I found Slaughterhouse Five the most profound when it discussed the Tralfamadorian view of time  A book so brilliant and crazy I find it hard to find words to explain it s beauty   War and Love   Death and pain   It is everything and more   God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change  courage to change the things I can  and wisdom always to tell the difference  I m not a war buff and only picked up this book when a friend mentioned it had a bit of science fiction in it  The book is unlike any I ve read  While it makes the reader realise the atrocities of war  the way it s written gives it a darkly comic feel  The book is a must read  So it goes    All this happened  more or less   https   theforgottengeek wordpress co    Oh my gosh  what took me so long to read this  After asking a well trusted friend for a recommendation she told me Slaughterhouse Five and I am so glad I picked it up  Always knowing the title but not knowing what the novel is about  I went into it having read other stories of Vonnegut but not liking them  I can see why Billy and Slaughterhouse is an American classic  I laughed out loud every other page which never happens  I think Billy is supremely relatable and that is what makes him treasured  Please read this even if you don t like Vonnegut s other works or don t think you will like the story anything  JUST DOI IT GIRL BOY   So it goes  The story of Billy Pilgrim who gets unstuck in time  A subtle story of Dresden in World War 2  I want to read more of the war  What an experience this book was   zmn fqT rw bh jlw Hrkht nmykhnh   zmn ghy wymsth w ghy bh  qb brmygrdh w gdhshth nmygdhrh  blkhh tw Hl w ayndh dr jrynh drst mthl byly pylgrym one of my favourite books ever  It was crazy and fresh  using science fiction quite unexpectedly  and it worked it introduced me to kurt vonnegut   my n th time returning to a beloved favorite  laugh out loud moments right next to insights that stop you  every time I read it it s a new experience  Great read  The main character is super disturbed crazy due to his military experience and crappy childhood  It really reminded me of Shutter Island   Found this one stuck under a radiator in my 5th grade classroom  and I m pretty sure it changed my life forever  Definitely not for children   I really liked this book  For me Kurt Vonnegut is hit and miss  I ve read 3 now  and this is definitely my favorite  I loved his descriptions  and his main character Billy Pilgrim was fascinating to me  It was hard to figure out whether this was a case of PTSD  or whether he was godlike and could see all time before him  past  present and future at once  His descriptions of war felt real to me  and helped me to understand what happens to people involved in war  I had never heard how destructive the fire bombing in Dresden was  in relation to the atomic weapons used  so I learned a lot  I can see why this is considered a classic  Delightful first time with Vonnegut  Striking and lucid expression of comical genius magnified by deep expressive account of the ravages of war  So profound  This is probably one of the finest specimens of American literature I have come across  Kurt Vonnegut was way ahead of his time  Coming to terms with whether Slaughterhouse Five floats through time or through psychology  or both  is both the genius and joy of the book   Somewhere in the seemingly startled meanderings of this story a startling thing happened  the story turned real  It barreled out of fiction  or internal fiction  into a full story  The amount of heart in this book was astonishing  I saw myself as I see myself  and saw others too  I was touched and want more  I enjoyed this novel greatly   everything was beautiful and nothing hurt   Remind myself of how good the book was every time i see this quote  Most important fiction ever written  THE  GREAT AMERICAN NOVEL  If you don t love this one stop reading  it s just not for you    Love ya Kurt  Sad and funny  high and low  sweet and sour  old and young  sick and sane  Slaughterhouse Five is brilliant even before you start considering how Vonnegut rethinks the form of the novel to express the recurring brutality of trauma   Beautifully childlike in its style  it tackles very difficult concepts whilst at the same time being utterly ridiculous  Having drawn upon personal experience  and appearing as himself for a brief time   this explains some of the terrors of war and the adjustment to life afterwards  Had a tear in my eye by the end of it  Nowhere is Vonnegut s command of the English language demonstrated better than in this book  Slaughterhouse Five is Vonnegut s attempt to write a book expressing his feelings about witnessing the fire bombing of Dresden during WWII which killed 130 000 people  In his introduction he pronounces that he failed in that attempt  because there is nothing intelligent to say about a massacre   I disagree with that  and I think anyone who reads this book would too  Vonnegut is able to clearly paint a picture of his feelings and his experience through his main character in a poignant story that is at times funny and others borderline psychedelic  Excellent book  I think one of the most valuable lessons of the book is the destructive element of war  The characters who survive are the ones without names  and there is little to no real  lasting heroism  Many of the  characters  shine brightly  then leave quickly I thought the idea of time traveling was a cool way to wrap the plot together  I like the idea that  war doesn t follow any logical progression  so this book won t either  This book was also easy  somehow  to get through  There is plenty of dark humor which helps the reader to make his way through a very otherwise grim story HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY reccomend  one of my favourite authors and one of his best books  named for the place in dresden the hero is kept while it was firebombed in ww2 this book is a strange trip about a wierd annoying almost useless man who becomes  unstuck  in time and travels intermittently around the timeline of his life this book also has howard w campbell the protagonist of vonneguts Mother Night  this  like sirens of titan  shows vonneguts sci fi writing at its best  but keeps his strange and dark sense of humour his concepts  like being unstuck in time  and being chronosyndcalstily infundibulated is that right  are truely his own and very unique in writing  This is the first Vonnegut I ve read  It s always been one of those daunting relics from high school literature that I didn t want to force myself to read  However I was delightfully proven wrong  there was not plowing through this book  I started it on a Monday  and finished by noon thirty the next  Vonnegut opens up many thoughts with Slaughterhouse Five  from Christianity and the operations of Man to time travel and Tramfalmadorians  There are a lot of lessons to be pulled from this story of a man who has come unstuck from the standard passage of time  If you re a fan of Modern Lit  I definitely recommend picking this up   I usually say this is one of my favorite novels of all time  It s been a while since I ve read it though  and it deserves a revisitation  Vonnegut is my favorite writer  and I especially appreciate his humorous exploration of nihilism  It s a theme prevalent in all of his works  but Slaughterhouse Five was my first  clear exposure to it  As a beginning writer reintroducing himself to literature for the first time seriously since middle school  I was blown away by quirky creativity that permiates the characters  settings  and storyline of this and all KV s works  Before I read Slaughterhouse Five  I d forgetten how good a novel could be  Slaughterhouse Five is probably my favorite book of all time  I first picked it up because I had recently read an account of the bombing of Dresden during WWII and I understood that SH 5 covered the same material  Boy  was I in for a surprise  Dresden  of course  forms a central theme throughout  but the book zips around like crazy  moving between past and future  a German P O W  camp and suburban New England  even an alien planet  It sounds like a wild ride and it is  except Vonnegut is a skilful enough writer to make it work  and work brilliantly  This should definitely be on your list of   Books To Read Before You Die   So it goes     So   I finally reread this one  I hadn t read it since high school  and have since realized that most of Vonnegut s other books were things I read in high school and early college  At first  I couldn t figure out what the fuss was about  Then I kept reading  and soon it was glaringly evident  He was a genius  this book is touching  strange and so human   despite its aspects of time travel and satire  it deserves a place at the table of all  serious  works  The book is so terrifying and touching   and spot on even in its outrageous depictions  I m going back and reading his other books   especially now that he s dead  And so it goes  I understand the obsession with Vonnegut  I think the fact that my English teacher who is completely apathetic to everything we read actually adores Vonnegut and his novels shows and gets excited about it helps me a lot  This book is a masterpiece  It s not so much the antiwar message  but it s themes in general  We are just average machines who in a larger perspective have no effect on the fate of the world  So it goes  But we can still relish the moments we have cause they always have and will always exist  Do I sound too much like an English teacher  Oh well this book is just great  And I want So it goes written on my headstone  Excellent  It s a quick read  and I can t believe that I haven t read this until now  The language is where Slaughterhouse most shines  Vonnegut s account of the bombing of Dresden and the mind of a man maddened by war reads much like beat poetry  The plot itself  due to constant shifts in the fourth dimension  I would even say is beautifully hard to follow  but the vividness of the imagery makes it hard to ever get lost for long  as each successive economically phrased line paints a brand new picture of each new time and each new place  It s by far the best novel on the subjects of death  time  and war that I ve ever read  Books like this make everything else look like practice  It s perfectly balanced between humor and horror  written in a simple style that you know took years to get right  There s probably something in this book to hate  and probably a lot to hate in it if I were to dig deep enough  you can t write a word about World War II without getting some of it wrong   but I ve got nothing but respect for Vonnegut right now  let me get bitter on my own time  More than anything else Vonnegut reminds me here of Bolano  using deceptively simple sentences to try to write about something larger than himself  larger than the printed page can hold  Fun stuff  a fabulous relevant book  with a clear anti war message but with so much more  Time travel  alien abduction  Optometrics  American Consumerism all packed into a fast paced 157 pages  Written in the 1970 s but not at all dated  Part Autobigraphically Kurt Vonnegut has provided us with a parallel study of the Horror of War and its after effects  Mental Illness or is this souped up Post Traumatic Stress disorder  Great whacky prose but never losing the thread and each individiual strand of the story link easily together Billy Pilgrim and a cast of Characters that all are fatally flawed  but are so beutifully drawn  Masterpiece loved it  This is my second Vonnegut book  first was Cat s Cradle  and they have both been excellent  Slaughterhouse Five is about a man named Billy Pilgrim that involves time travel  war  aliens  and a raid on Dresden which the story is centered around  You learn about Billy s story with his involvement with Dresden  the aliens of Tralfamadorians  and his time traveling mind  You never know where Billy s mind will take him  You might be learning about his family and how they view Billy s insanity  but Billy never stays in the same era for too long  It s a satirical novel about the dangers of war and what it can do to people  You should read this  This is something I really should have read in high school but instead read ten years later  The only other Vonnegut book I ve read is Cat s Cradle which was interesting but too scattered to really have an impact  but Slaughterhouse is quite the opposite  He has a very clear idea what he s doing in this book and does a nice job of explaining to the reader how it came to be and where it s going  I would have expected this to take the surprise out of it  but that s the point really  War is awful  People die  So it goes  But there s hope somewhere if we could only see fourth dimensionally  And this book is a great help in that arena  Engaging read that is both sad and peaceful in turns  Didn t want to put it down once I started  makes me want to read more Vonnegut  I actually REALLY liked this book  I usually find classic American literature to be boring and pretentious  This was not a  just for fun  read  to be sure  Just like there are movies and there are films  there are books and there is literature  This book is probably best read by a group who can discuss the nuances of it and notice and appreciate all of the artistry woven into this insane story  I m glad I waited until I was a more mature adult to read this book  I know that it s often on high school reading lists  but I don t think I could have absorbed a lot of the themes in this novel as a teenager   I was too optimistic  Beautiful  One of those works that you feel stupid writing about because you can t adequately express how it makes you feel  Loved it    I think you guys are going to have to come up with a lot of wonderful new lies  or people just aren t going to want to go on living   Fascinating Not what I expected at all but loved the premise of time travel to tell the story  A different read  I loved this book  I read it back in high school and couldn t get over the depth of it  Great read for anyone who wants a unique story  This is the kind of classic literature that I can get into  It s an off the wall story told in a very innovative way  I will definitely be reading more from Vonnegut  So it goes      So it goes  really well   Definitely one I d read again  Recommend really highly  Vonnegut s interviews on the book are also worth a listen   One of my favourite books  Read a few weeks ago but couldn t think of a review that would justify how much I loved Slaughterhouse Five  I let it resonate for a good 10 days before I started another book  All I can say is that I recommend it absolutely  and will be returning to it again and again and again and again  Tralfamadore  Nao consigo ficar calada a respeito deste livro Raramente fui tao sacudida e surpreendida por um livro E triste  ironico  desconcertante  comovente e vem direto do coracao do autor  E foi direitinho ao meu Nao se pode dar 6 estrelas   My introduction to Kurt Vonnegut and I was entranced for every moment of this book from start to finish  I highly recommend this book  For most of my adult life I ve contemplated reading Slaughterhouse Five  War stories are definitely not for me  I read Galapagos a few years back and enjoyed it very much  although it was a very strange story I just completed the audible version of Slaughterhouse read by Ethan Hawke  his narration was superb   I really enjoyed this novel  Both the story and prose gave me great pleasure  I don t know if I could handle Vonnegut back to back  but I hope to read all his work before I croak  So it goes Footnote  Repetition is a pet peeve of mine  I cannot stand phrases being repeated  but this was an exception  Is it possible to say  classic Vonnegut   I read this in high school but still remember it well  Always clever and thought provoking   Very interesting fiction  Love the genre  time period  perspective on life  Must read the book  before seeing the movie from the 1970 s   This was one of the best examples of what prisoners of war went through on a daily basis  mentally  The movie didn t do it justice  I will forever be in debt to Kurt Vonnegut for showing me what is really wrong with the world  and what it means to actually suffer  It s everything I ve come to expect from the master of such brilliant and dark satire  My only regret is not reading the adventures of Billy Pilgrim years ago  So it goes  One of the most unusual  and weirdly compelling  books I ve read  I m not sure how I got this far without running into it before   I read it as a young woman  forgot some of the gory details  and recommended it to my young son  He just called it an all time favorite    Re reading for book club  since it s been decades since I read it in high school  I just love Vonnegut and his wry  spare writing style  A classic book about war and time travel  I saw the movie a while back and thought I might like the book  too  It was a good read  While I may be a bit biased towards Kurt Vonnegut  I am not exaggerating when I say this is one of the greatest books ever written  The level of dark  absurd humor is amazing  It is also thickened by how amazingly well written the book is  While it isn t a challenging read  you re going to need to be the sharpest of readers in order to appreciate the true depth that this story tells of people and war  If you want an idea of what I mean  read the quotation in the description  Vonnegut takes his own experiences of war and crafts them into a dark and exciting story  I suggest that everyone reads this book  no matter who you are   Anyone who does not think that this book is an anti war story has reading comprehension issues  This is only my second Kurt Vonnegut book but I am already a big fan  Slaughter house 5 can be a little hard to explain to the Vonnegut novice  One part sci fi  other parts political commentary  Vonnegut uses his dry wit and clear anti war views  gained from experiencing the controversial bombing of Dresden first hand as a prisoner of war  to write this strange tale of poor Billy Pilgrim as he travels through time  Vonnegut s characters are featured in their own novels demonstrating an inter connected universe  I consider myself a fan  I ve read this book many times and  unfortunately  have lent it out too many times and ended up not getting it back Vonnegut is by far one of the most unique writers I ve read as far as his style goes  A truly quirky individual  I found great enjoyment in his references to Billy Pilgrim being unstuck in time  the actual slaughter house  Schlachthaus 5    for those Germans out there lol   and the dark and cynical humor always makes me chuckle I love his references to previous work  everything is connected  So it goes    it s like that inside joke that s way funnier if you were there Now I want to read some Vonnegut     Vonnegut has a prose that is broken and slipshod  but its more or less readable  Vonnegut has his moments  but you can tell by the short and hardy sentence structure  that something else is on this man s mind  The book itself is about a time traveling geek who jumps back and forth from a room in space with a naked woman  I know  I know  Sooner or later America is going to have to anty up on the quality of these books they re putting on Best Seller lists in favour of stories that have an actual pulse  Its interesting  but like I said beforehand its really oddball  A good weekend read if you ve run out of Friday the 13th s to watch   I m completely fascinated by this book  Its fractured structure works perfectly  taking you back and forth in time and space  and pushing you into a state of dementia as you try to comprehend the absolute pointlessness of war  Vonnegut has a way with words that is not precious  it s dirty and real I felt like I was aware of the protagonists reality in two levels  since I understood him in a meta level where you can see his mental disorder  but at the same time I understood him from the inside out  where you can see no recourse but to own that mental disorder in order to keep on living after seeing the absurd reality of death  Awesome book  To pen a book where time is not lineal and for it to make sense  entertain  and depict horrific historical events     What an absolute legendary author I like that fact that everyone continues to exist even through death   how logical   everyone s past exists so how could they not  be  I also enjoyed the  free will  angle   not so long ago I came across a school of thought that says no one has free will as everyone would always make the same choice at that one particular point in time as they could never have different information at that point in time     Free will is a myth   Well the tramafordians think so  This is one of my favorite books  This is one of the hardest books for me to comment on  and I feel inflexible about my affection for the book  so much so  that I was irked by Alexie s Flight  even though I like Alexie s work quite a lot There is something about Vonnegut s writing that crawled into my brain  turned several knobs  and said   Go  You have other things to do here  That sounds odd  but that s the best explanation you ll get form me The read on date is an approximation  From about age 10 until my early 20s  I read and re read Vonnegut s work  and then I stopped  I ve started re reading his work again  Amazing  An experience like no other  through fourth dimensional planets and German prison camps and mental institutions  Read this ages ago  One of the few descriptions of war I have ever felt totally compelled to read  Vonnegut is the master  One of the best  Ever  Incredible for Vonnegut s imagination  and his writing  Simply one of the best books ever written  oh myg od     oh mhyg od   oh my g od read it pl EASE if u haven t read it read it because u will die but u will like it My favorite Vonnegut book   not because it is the most entertaining   but because it makes me feel like I m living in his brain  Just re read after a period of several decades  am I really that old   yes I am   This is a true classic which I appreciate much more at my current stage of life  Vonnegut contains a bit of Twain  a bit of Voltaire  and a bit of PK Dick  yet with more sympathy for humanity  So it goes  That phrase rather annoyed me on my first reading  but I accept it now as a clever rhythmic pausing device in V s prose   There was a section near the end  though  where it was a little overused Vonnegut was very lucky not to get pegged into the SF slot  His books are really satires commentaries on contemporary life  Time to re read all  Thoroughly enjoyed this book  The odd combination of fiction and non fiction as well as jumping back and forth works very well  The symbolism and recurring themes were amazing  I m adding this to my new favorites list  An amazing book about the futility of war  but how we ll never be without it   One of my all time favorites  in fact it s probably time for me to read it again  as the words resonate differently with time The five stars aside  next time I hear someone say  So it goes   I m going to slap them so hard they become unstuck in time  I really enjoyed this book and if you haven t read it  or it s been awhile  it s definitely worth the time to  re  read it   I regret not reading this sooner  Then again    everybody has to do exactly what he does  I learned that on Tralfamadore  Slaughterhouse Five is undeniable proof that Kurt Vonnegut was a genius  Who manages to write a story that would sound absolutely crazy if you told it to a friend but is actually painfully sane  clever  deep  sarcastic  thought provoking and just so real    I mean  seriously  only this guy  And  as if it wasn t enough  the book is so well structured and written  with themes that manage to wrap it all together and at the same time never fail to make you take a step back and see what it all really is about  There is only one flaw one could possibly find in this book  and it is that it ends too soon   Strange book but great book  Never knew if it was all in his head or had really happened  Really enjoyed it and author s writing style  I thoroughly enjoyed this book  The characters and story were wonderful  but most of all  I adore the writing style  This is the first Vonnegut book I ve read  and I will definitely read more  I went into this book not knowing anything about it at all  and I highly recommend it that way  so I won t go into any details of the story It s one of those books that stays with you  I finished it last night  and I can t stop thinking about it  I think it s going to stay in the front of my brain for a while Just pick it up  and give it a try  If it jives with you  you ll be hooked after the first few pages  and so it goes  This novel chronicles the life of Billy Pilgrim and his journey through space and time  He is drafted into the army where he has his first encounter with the aliens whom take him through time and space to their home world  he then discovers he has the power to travel freely between this world and his  this novel has many very interesting points on human nature and the belief that human life is minuscule and that death is nothing to be afraid of  I loved reading this story and thought deeply about the meaning of the story  I would recommend this book to anyone interested in science fiction and the morality of human beings  Read with a controlled quiet voice by Ethan Hawke    the perfect choice for this book  In fact  if you didn t enjoy reading this book  you should listen to the audio version    you will pick up the art of the story in a way you might not from reading it  The CD ends with an interview with the author This novel is  absurdist   the author treats as a fact that the main character  Billy Pilgrim  was abducted by space aliens   Tralfamadorians  who can see all of time as a mountain range  so that they not only see death  but life at the same time  so while you re dead over here  here you are alive and fine  I m not too sure how I feel after reading it  I know from experience that I go crazy from reading Vonnegut s way of storytelling  but it stays with me for a long time afterward and I m always thinking about it This will be one of those fascinating things that probably affects the way I think about time and life  And the thing that stands out for me would be the poor horses  They are forever stuck in that unpleasant point in their lives with pain  because Vonnegut didn t show us any other point in their lives that is happier to dwell on    Edit  Here I am  months later  and still thinking about those horses  It s a book with two titles and each of them tells us something about the novel  The obvious one    Slaughterhouse 5  gives us the place and makes us anticipate a story short of peace and quiet while the second title    The Children s Crusade  tells us something about the state of mind of characters inhabiting the book  But that s just where the fun begins  It is a great story filled with Vonnegut s experiences and mixed with a totally bizzare sci fi subplot  It has all the good stuff in it  irony  an absurd sense of humour and characters both humane and grotesque   Slaughterhouse 5  gets two big thumbs up from me  Slaughterhouse Five is a MUST READ classic  Truly out of the ordinary and written in an original format  Kurt Vonnegut has a particular style that really made this story a gem for me  Many famous phrases came from this book  such as the famous  everything was beautiful  and nothing hurt   a popular tattoo choice   I d heard someone say they picked up the book and thought it was dull and pointless  as the plot doesn t seem deep or particularly catchy at the beginning  However  if you are willing to look past the unexciting first chapter  you will find yourself immersed in an exquisitely written piece of sci fi art  I had heard about Vonnegut from hip friends in high school and was never sure what to expect  and never felt terribly inclined to pick him up for myself  But wow  wow WOW I don t know why but I finally picked up my mom s copy of Slaughter House Five and EVERYTHING WAS CHANGED FOREVER  He s got a spare writing style that maybe echoes of Hemingway  all male voices echo of Hemingway  and Hemingway echoes of Whitman  let s be real here  but it is so fragile  so sympathetic  and so wildly creative and new I fell head over heels  Gotta pick up another book by him  Go forth kids  and get your yearly Vonnegut Vaccination   From what I gathered from the book  Kurt Vonnegut attempts to reveal two forms of human s concepts of time  one where time simply reveals a predetermined fate  much like a Newtonian model universe   and another where the actions of humans forms future events  Vonnegut uses Dresden to ask the reader which reality we would want to believe  One where humans are fully responsible for Dresden  and suffering in general  and another where suffering  violence  and pain is fate  and could occur no other way  Basically  Vonnegut asks whether or not humans would want to be responsible for all human experiences  both good and bad  Brilliant and witty  Vonnegut manages to portray the horror of war more effectively through the use of humor and a lighthearted tone  Where other authors might make you weep with their descriptions of some of the events in this book  Vonnegut makes us laugh while still impacting us with the bitterness of the situation  This is one of the books I m most glad to have read  I won t bother raving about each of Vonnegut s books  I just think everyone should read them all  Much of this blurb can be taken as my commentary on most of his books  fiction and non fiction This was not my first Vonnegut  but this book absolutely changed my life  It gave me the words to explain what I d never understood about my own convictions  something Vonnegut did for me over and over again through his books  which in some cases even gave me convictions to articulate  He really did make it easier for me to wake up some mornings  and if I m a decent human being now  it s something to do with him  Excellent  Kurt navigates a difficult story while holding hands with insanity  Was mesmerized from start to finish  While I was reading this  someone said   Oh sure  Slaughterhouse Five  I ve always meant to read that  What s it about  exactly   I mumbled something containing the words  metafiction    time travel   and  war addled brain   It was not a coherent sentence So that s Slaughterhouse Five  And it is glorious  Kurt Vonnegut will always be missed and need to be revisited  He set a new writing aesthetics in the literary world  on the borderline between being lexically rich slash verbose and obviously a bit snobby about it  I can t remember one thing about the plot of this book  but it did start a love of Kurt Vonnegut for me in college  Charmingly dark  I very much enjoyed the sci fi flair to a look at society  war  and how humans deal with death  Check out free audiobook of Kurt Vonnegut s short story 2BR02B at https   www youtube com watch v uDe0T    Powerful  incisive writing  Not much happens in the story but you feel you are listening to a greater minds working   4 5 stars  I thought that this book was amazing and really enjoyed it  Definitely glad I had the chance to read it  Vonnegut wanted to write an anti war novel and he did exactly that   Vonnegut style  And his style is what always impresses me so much  This book tells such a layered story and is so full of symbolism and metaphor that it begs to be re read  It also makes you stop and actually think about what you re reading  If you re looking for a conventional war story that tells you how you should feel and what you should think  then this book is not for you  I think it takes a pretty open mind to enjoy this one  After all  what can you really say about the senselessness of war except  Poo tee weet   When you read the first 20 30 pages your thought is what the hell is this  In the middle of the book you consider the author is crazy  when you finish it you acknowledge that it is a masterpiece   really good but confusing and has really good quotes but his wife s name is the name of an instagram filter      Don t know why it took me so long to get around to this  but one of the best and most beautiful books I ve ever read  One of the best from one of my favorite authors  I re read every few years and it only gets better  So it goes   Is the better way to travel in time and see all the worst things of the world war in a very particular point of view Can t believe it took me this long to read any Vonnegut  Wow  Introductory chapter  just the narrator talking about how he needed to write a book  took me a while to get through  but once I got into the actual book itself  it got very awesome  very quickly  The non linearity in time worked really well  probably the best example of it I ve ever read  not at all confusing  even with the main character experiencing time in a non linear manner  Definitely the best  war book  I ve ever read  and first book I ve read in a long time where I m already looking forward to rereading after I ve had time to digest it  My junior year of high school  my teacher suggested I read this book after loving Player Piano  At a time in my life when I was struggling with how to cope with sadness  Vonnegut taught me that its possible to laugh at the most dismal of situations Perhaps a note from an obituary of Vonnegut s says it best  For countless teenagers  reading Vonnegut was as much an entry into adult life as your first beer  The world became funnier  more dangerous  more exciting  If you were looking to send up authority  question life s meaning or face the worst and keep your sense of humor  Vonnegut was your teacher    I recommend hearing it as an audiobookI could add to the volumes of literary criticism that fills the reviews of  Slaughterhouse Five   but what s the point of that  Rather  I will recommend that you hear the book as an audiobook   the book s a stream of consciousness  disjointed approach works very well on tape  The reader shifts from one scene to another as easily as Billy Pilgrim does  The version I heard was not the one available here  Mine was narrated by Jose Ferrer and he did a wonderful job  Too bad Ferrer has passed on  So it goes http   dwdsreviews blogspot com  Bill  one of the most intelligent people I ve ever met  recommend this book to me almost four years ago  i tried to read it then  on a greyhound bus from kansas to oregon  but it was just too much too swallow now  i can appreciate  Slaughter House Five  as the best war book ever written  Vonnegut paints a picture that is more true to life than the romantic plots of WWII soldiers  Promising to point out  to his war buddy s wife  that every war is fought by the young and innocent  he gives this work of art an alternate title  The Children s Crusade  to appease her anger and do his position against war justice  Vonnegut died last year  So it goes So I had to go reread Slaughterhouse five  And it turns out that the book is much better than I d remembered  and I d remembered it being pretty good This time around  I listened to it via audible com  which is how I read most books these days  The passage about watching the world war II movie backwards brought chills  And it still brings chills  just remembering it It s a strange book   Billy Pilgrim has come unstuck in time   But it works  And the artificiality  the surrealistic touches  which might have made the book so bad  instead make it so much more moving  The single most haunting and persuasive anti war novel ever written  Vonnegut does not try to show us the horrors of war with large words  symbolism or hyperboles  not with moral outrage  On the contrary  he gets us outraged by constantly describing everything in a fatalistic  surreal way as inevitable   So it goes  is the line he uses over and over again  And indeed  so it goes  So it goes  Everyone dies  everything is destroyed and the war never stops  So it goes  Men are shot over nothing  cities burn to the ground with everyone in it  and there s not a thing we can do  So it goes Unbelievably good    There are no telegrams on Tralfamadore  But you re right  each clump of symbols is a brief  urgent message  describing a situation  a scene  We Tralfamadorians read them all at once  not one after the other  There isn t any particular relationship between all the messages  except that the author has chosen them carefully  so that  when seen all at once  they produce an image of life that is beautiful and surprising and deep  There is no beginning  no middle  no end  no suspense  no moral  no causes  no effects  What we love in our books are the depths of many marvelous moments seen all at one time    88  Vonnegut s books have knack for making me feel absolutely nothing  It s not that they don t influence my emotions  it s just that the emotion they make me feel is emptiness  It doesn t resolve  But neither does life  and then we die  So it goes I really liked the things that this book had to say about time  and the metaphor that is used to describe how we  Earthlings  see time  I won t say it  you ll just have to read the book because I don t want to give it away  I really liked this quote from the book   How nice    to feel nothing  and still get full credit for being alive  You should read this book  Loved loved loved this book    Five stars because that s all they have  Realistically a 20 star book   Loved it and wish I had read it years ago  Eclectic  funny  insightful and devastating in places  Genius  Time travelling WW2 soldier that is abducted by aliens  Not at all what I was expecting but I enjoyed it  GreatThis book is as good as you have heard  so buy it and find out what all the ruckus is about  Interesting point of comparison with Dambusters  Especially on the issue of how many perished in Dresden  One of the best books I ve ever read  Seriously  It may well be the book I bring to my funeral  So it goes  Technically easy to read but with so many layers to unfold  this is the type of book best read with a professor to help place it in perspective   I love almost every book this make has written  I even have a slaughterhouse five tattoo  So it goes  Read this first in high school  then purchased the Audible version for running  Still an amazing book I totally recommend everyone to read this book  Especially politicians and militaries should do this   Excruciatingly profound  I feel like I did when I first discovered JD Salinger in 1987  World  Rocked   Very good  really enjoyed the narrative  Jumps back and forth through time seamlessly  The author has written this novel in such a way that it was not important to take note each journey in time  I like the authors ideas on what life is about and what is important and what is not  To be able to see life in 4D like the Tralfamadorians sounds interesting  Found this  upon rereading  at least as funny  sad  and brilliant as I did in college  if not more so   What a lovely book  In the end everything started to all come together when Billy goes into the porn shop  I was hoping that Billy wasn t crazy but now I have my doubts  It seemed like everything all at once was happening in the end  That made it the perfect ending  I also like the obvious life issues Kurt brings up on how people live  Like how we should behave when another dies  the metaphor of the money tree  and so on  He points out the flaws of how people live and I love it   Um livro sem nenhum compromisso com pensamento linear  muito divertido que vale a leitura  Recomendo  This is my second time reading Slaughterhouse Five  It s still by far my favorite Vonnegut   Everything was beautiful  and nothing hurt   A masterclass in wit  If you are into audiobooks  get it on audible   read by Ethan Hawke and it s fantastic  A beautiful and terrifying critique to the absurdity of war as an inherent entity in the human condition Seeming simplicity that rolls up effortlessly into clouds of meaning and almost a sensory titillation  Quality  This is a book to really make you think  As a comparison   Catch 22 made me laugh a lot  Observing the desperate trials of the main character to survive and the impossibility of the task were hilarious  However  S5 is supposedly more humorous and ironic than C22  but somehow it never made me laugh  It is really a book for babies  for little kids send to war  The saddest thing is that they don t even realize what is happening around them   the survival instinct does not even exist yet  It is a sad sad book presented in a very humorous way by the great Kurt Vonnegut  However  I couldn t laugh    I love this book too much for words  Bought in 2005  Read it over and over and never get tired of it  My high school English professor assigned us this to read as a class but I had been sick the week they began it so he let me bring it home to catch up  I ended up reading the entire thing in one night  I enjoyed it so much  This book got me back into reading This is the anti war novel that Vonnegut wanted to write  It was his chance to show the public the horrors of war and the childishness of the combatants  Its strength is that it contrasts the wartime events of the protagonist s young adulthood with that of his later life  showing the effects the war had on him and the people around him  There s a lot of truth in the dark humor surrounding Billy Pilgrim s life during and after World War II   Intense and strange book  Was captivated by how Vonnegut repeated and built images into one big collage  Vonnegut is an amazing writer  Reading this book will show you how war affects a soldiers mental state great subject of a middle school book report to freak the teachers and kids about  loved it  what is not to love about kurts  books   bright  witty  funny  and always a message     I love kurt     A must read for all against the cruelty of war and warfare  Tears of laughter in the eye of the unbearable   so it goes     one of my favorite books of all time  Dark  yet light in its wit  Profound but not overwhelmingly so  Overall a great read One of the best books I ever studied in Literature  It was so cynical and true  that just sometimes shocked with its sincerity  It is very unexpected at times  I fell in love with Kurt Vonnegut purely randomly  Knowing little more about him than the fact that he wrote Slaughterhouse Five  his book The Sirens of Titan came up as a Kindle Daily Deal  so I bought it  I fell hard and fast for Vonnegut s unique style of writing  and his blending of science fiction with stories about people stuck in improbable  even impossible  situations I don t know what it is about Slaughterhouse Five in particular  but the book as a whole is charming  Even the sad stories  even in pages that seem steeped in despair  Vonnegut s writing style brings out the charm  I read this book in my Lit class last sememster at KCC and I liked it a lot more than I expected I would  It was hard to get into at first and when the timeline changes it s hard to follow  After awhile it became more easily understood  I don t think this story is so much an anti war story as some have believed  I think it s more of a story about the choices we make and the consequences of those choices  good or bad  I think it s about fate and destiny and whether we choose our path or whether it s laid out for us despite our own choices or efforts  I did really like this book and would recommend it   This may be one of the best novels I have ever read in my entire life  I have never been so affected by a literary device as by the repetition of  so it goes  to illustrate the impact and death of war  This is claimed to be one of the best anti war pieces in all of history and I believe it  The novel is written from the memoir point of view from another person who is not the writer  It tells the story of a boy carted off to war  He then gets abducted by aliens who teach him how to travel trough time  It is bizarre and often confusing  but illustrates something incredible about the reality of war    This is on my list of 100 classics to read  I started it several days ago  The beginning was disorienting and now that I am well into the middle  I understand what Vonnegut is doing  It is very clever  disturbing and a bit like voyeurism  Did I say disturbing  Whew  I keep putting it down  thinking about it  and picking it back up to find out what new terror of the mind I ll experience I finished  This might be the mother of all anti war books  Given that my day job relates to foreign policy in the Middle East  this is a powerful reminder of the human and emotional cost of warfare  I wasn t ready to ever like a book I had to study  but Slaughterhouse 5 opened me up to Vonnegut and if I gained anything from my degree in American Studies   it s down to this book and John Osbourne s lecture  There s nothing I can tell you that you probably haven t already read about it  It s an account of his experiences during the second World War  specifically the firebombing of Dresden  Despite the autobiographical nature  the book is purely a fictional attempt at writing about his experiences and coming to terms with them Quite simply brilliant  and paved my minds way for his other works   Reading about Billy the crazy  alcoholic vet with serious PTSD is harsh  to say the least  Vonnegut weeves from somewhat sane narrative to something other than that throughout the book  One of my all time favorite passages is when Billy talks about the war in reverse which begins with bombs retracting into planes  planes flying backward to the States and weaponry becoming disassembled in factories and material returning to the ground  It s a painful book full of beautiful passages and startling displacements in linear thinking which caused me to question the sanity of our insane civilization  This book is probably the first book I read about World War 2 that resonated in my mind  and made me question the black and white morality we were taught to view all of the actions of the Allies as opposed to the Axis  And that was when I was thirteen  and just beginning to question a lot of other things  Kurt Vonnegut sort of ushered me in to a lifetime of cynicism and distrust  and for that I thank him The scenes are horrifying  chilling  and will always be relevant to me  It is one of the best war books ever written and one of my favorite books of all time  I cannot recommend it enough  Captivating and haunting look into the subjects of dignity  free will  obsenity  religion  and war  Funny and thought provoking  This book has found a permanent place on my limited bookshelf    A really good read  I just finished Slaughterhouse Five  It is over  The end  So it goes   A book that must be read in a single sitting then re read  I was blown away    and so was Dresden  A satirical novel revolving around World War II  this one is a masterpiece  This is laced with poignant observations about war  sanity  and memories  It manages the great feat of being sad and funny   laugh out loud  at the same time The writing is simple and beautiful  and the central character Billy Pilgrim is a riot  Second time I have read this  Impossible to describe It illuminates the madness of war   This book is insanely funny at times  I lost count of how many times I d had to stop myself from laughing out loud in public as I was reading it  Vonnegut s dark sense of humour might offend some  but I thoroughly enjoyed it  Pick it up if you haven t  It s worth a ride to Tralfamadore and back  Billy Pilgrim slowly succumbs to his PTSD and subsequent insanity  dissociating himself from the real world and joining the Tralfamadorians  It s not sci fi  it s a coping mechanism  He learns the Tralfamadorians see time fluidly  and they know that events  good and bad  are destined to be repeated over and over again  Because of this  they live happily because they  choose  to see only happy moments  What a novel idea  right  Billy s acceptance of the futility of war and his own mediocrity is tragically beautiful  Life and death  love and hate  sanity and insanity  So it goes  It s hard giving a book like this 5 stars not because of the style or writing but because the content is hard to read at times  Brutal  blunt  and yet sadly sardonic this book captures POW life of WW2  Yet that summary does not due this book justice  nor captures what the book is all about  A man gone crazy  or a world gone crazy  and escapiest Aliens  and so it goes  The irony of life has never been captured so brilliantly then by Vonnegut  I m better for having read this but more sad as well  People have depth to them  our minds can only put up with so much crazy before it a  breaks    Hilarious  tragic  and incredibly well written  One of the most perfect novels I ve ever read  There s something about Kurt Vonnegut s writing that just does it for me  I feel on the same frequency  and every line is just a treat  I love every single bit of it  I only wish it was longer  much better than cats cradle  u could really buy in to Billy pilgrim  hoping the best but laughing at the worst made it a page burner Seriously intense  Provoked so much thinking  Will be reading this again  Can t believe it took me this long to read this book  Started to read it because it s a main plot point in Lost  absolutely loved it  So it goes   Listen  Billy Pilgrim has come unstuck in time  Oid Billy Pilgrim se ha volado del tiempo  Just re read this  first time in 15 years  Even better than I remember and a whole lot sadder   4 5 stars  I didn t like it quite as much as Cat s Cradle  Seemed to go by very quickly  Vonnegut s weirdness is not lost at all in this book  Definitely his favorite of mine so far  I was initially a little underwhelmed but the book really stuck with me through the years  I don t know about this one  I had just gotten off of HGTG and was absolutely sick of random for the sake of random  Some of the story telling of this hit too close to that and annoyed me  The more I think about the book itself though  the more I like it so I ll probably read it again   Divorato  Una volta preso in mano si molla solo quando finito Kurt Vonnegut e uno scrittore magnifico One of the best books I ve read in quite some time  I won t be able to say anything here that hasn t been said before  However  anyone who believes war can ever be justified   even something to be proud of   may wish to look elsewhere for their entertainment Central to the story is the bombing of Dresden  Germany  An ugly occurrence in American history which is not widely discussed  but something which sobers to the bone  And though there may be several points of view on this tragic event  there s no escaping its profound impact Is this science fiction  No one should care  I sure don t  Wow  just wow  Great story  Probably the only written first hand account of the Dresden bombing   So it goes A lot to think about concerning war and death and free will and time and mental illness and time travel  And Lot s wife  of course  was told not to look back where all those people and their homes had been  But she did look back  and I love her for that  because it was so human  So she was turned to a pillar of salt  So it goes People aren t supposed to look back  I m certainly not going to do it anymore I ve finished my war book now  The next one I write is going to be for fun This one is a failure  and had to be  since it was written by a pillar of salt        Billy Pilgrim has bi polar like episodes at the age of fourty four  The present and past weaves in and out of the story  Then aliens abduct him and he is left with the knowledge that we never die because we exist in the past  So it goes  It is this event that explains the style of the storytelling but not the actual problem that Billy has with time World War II in Germany was an exciting and devastating  time in Billy s life  In the present life is easy and comfortable  Yet  it isn t comfortable enough to forget the war  As you read and find out more about it  you can understand why  I read this book in its entirety on a train ride from Seattle to Portland  not a long ride  When I met Barbara at the station  I stepped off the train and just started to cry  The book reads like a 2nd order psychotherapy session for someone with PTSD  When the author can t handle the emotions involved with recounting his experience witnessing the fire bombing of Dresden in WWII  his brain puts forth a fantastical  bordering on silly  story of alien abduction  An emotional story of almost unimaginable psychological pain and the horror of destruction  without being told as such   Slaughterhouse Five is easily the best book I have ever read that deals with the concept of time  This novel is short  and somewhat of an easy read  but it is nonetheless an iconic piece of literature  The story of Billy Pilgrim not only delves into the constant shortcomings of human perception  but also comments on the hideousness of war  which is the reason for the subtitle  The Children s Crusade   I believe the comment from Life Magazine on the back cover sums it perfectly      A funny book at which you are not permitted to laugh  a sad book without tears  a tale told in a slaughterhoue   One of the greatest books I ve ever had the pleasure to read  Hands down  Utterly amazing After this read  I think I need a prescription for some eyeware  Poo tee weet  His masterpiece  Not much more to say  A story beautifully and heartbreakingly told  Also recommended which is cited in this book  The Destruction of Dresden by David Irving  I know you read it in high school  but read it again  Definitely worth the time  Easily one I can come back to again and again  Simple writing that cut throughs  You can tell that Vonnegut has a lot of fun writing  and I like that  I don t always re read books  but when I do  they are typically written by Hemingway or Vonnegut   I was also able to find the quote about machines that I had been looking for  Lionel Merble was a machine  Tralfamadorians  of course  say that every creature and plant in the Universe is a machine  It amuses them that so many Earthlings are offended by the idea of being machines   Fabulous  Simply fabulous  Even Ethan Hawke s annoyingly whispery narration on the audiobook version I listened to wasn t enough to detract from how good this book is  What is the point To be the eyes and ears of god the creator  what else Brilliant This was my second read in about 13 years  The me of 13 years ago was not so really impressed  I m glad I m not the me of 13 years ago anymore  Very thought provoking  intense  and the imagery Vonnegut creates is unbelievable   What a darkly comedic head trip  My first taste of Vonnegut was definitely a good one  Kurt Vonnegut s Slaughterhouse Five is a tale that follows Billy Pilgrim  a man who has had an interesting life  having witnessed the fire bombing of Dresden  been involved in a plane crash  and traveled through space and time Slaughterhouse Five really bends description  It jumps from place to place as Billy himself jumps through periods of time between his birth and death The book is entertaining at the highest level  full of wit and black humour  This is a well loved classic  and for good reason  I recommend this to everyone  really  It is one of those must read books   A haunting  magnificent portrayal of the Dresden Bombing and its still lingering effects Mandatory reading  Read it back in High School  again in college  and again as an adult   What an unusual journey and a personal perspective on war  One of my favorites this year  Was is indeed absurd   glad I finally took the time to read this on the flight home Amazing  thought invoking novel  So many loaded statement and throwaway lines  Loved it  kurt vonnegut is one of the most intelligent authors have had the pleasure of reading   Like most people I am suspicious of a book that gets such wide praise  I learned my lesson with this book  Vonnegut does an amazing job at not only captivating the readed but giving the overall futile nature of war and well  life  His writing had me laughing through the book  his irony was hysterical  His characters were more than likeable  and I am a sucker for anything anti war  If I ever become a high school teacher this is one of the first books I would add to a reading list  out of the typical american fiction pot  Would recommend to any reader  5 stars   Heavy  but light  interesting writing style  which will keep you hooked to the pages  Sad yet soothing with a sense of dumb  in a good way  wonder and moral lessons worth pondering over  Dresden as a cornerstone of teaching is a great touch  I knew it was an anti war book going in  but it was different than I expected overall   t qbl z chnd SfHhy akhr  mykhwstm bhsh 4 bdm  wly  lyh yn khtb   lyh x rywywy khml bhzwdy   I can t believe I ve never read this until now  this is a book I could read over   over again  Dos palabras  Im presionante LLevaba aos en la estanteria esperando ser leido    The Art of Manliness brought me here  I m definitely looking to read more of his work  GOOD STUFF KURT RATHER BENDS YER HEAD     if yer payn attnten      get it got it  I liked this book a lot   was able to deal with the choppy treatment of time  and intertwining of a story of the final months of WW II with trips to alien planets and extra dimensions  Doug read it and recommended it to me  It s a hideous war story wrapped up in satire  black humor  and random events that happen to a fictional character who survived the bombing of Dresden  It even considers war from the perspective of aliens who experience life in 4 dimensions  Even though it is 40 years old  it doesn t seem dated to me as some books that we all read when I was teenager do  Slaughterhouse Five  is one of those books where you pick it up and you have to keep on reading  Famously known as one of the great anti war books ever since publication  Kurt Vonnegut s writing oozes style and wit and that s what makes the book such a pleasure to read  All revolving around a soldier named Billy Pilgrim and his exploits during the bombing of Dresden during world war 2  The story then skewers when we find out that he time travels and a alien race called the tramalfordians have  a keen interest in him  I for one loved the book and I highly recommend reading it   Kurt vonnegut is one of my favorite authors so i was really excited to read Slaughterhouse 5  The cover says it is an anti war book but i didnt really get it Slaughterhouse 5 is about a veteran from ww2  vonnegut doesnt decribe the Dredson bombing instead he writes around it in a creative entertaining story which highlights his eccentric writing style The main character Billy becomes unstuck in time and creates his own planet  Kurt Vonnegut has a really unique way to explain things and put his words  If you enjoy his other books i would recommend this that you read this one  Book was required to read for 20th Century Literature course  I dearly love this book  While some argue it may not be anti war book  there is practically death everywhere in this book  While the confusion of the main character travels through time  I got used to understanding what was going on  I loved the dark humor  which engaged me more into completing the book  I learned some things about Kurt in my course which was pretty amazing despite Kurt having a difficult life even after WWII After completing this book  I think now about getting a few more books written by Kurt  I read this book in high school  and loved it at the time  I decided to read it again  because after 12 years  I just couldn t remember the plot at all  And I wanted to see if it was still as moving to me now as it was then  It was I enjoyed it again very  very much  It is a very powerful book  There is  however  a lot of adult content  and I  now  am surprised that we were permitted to read it in high school  I wonder why it didn t bother me at the time     Anyway   well written  engaging  haunting  tragic  and funny  Great book  but not for the faint of heart  Slaughterhouse Five is a very unique book with an entertaining plot  a slew of interesting characters and a number of thought provoking quotes  Vonnegut s central themes touch on free will and whether or not our actions have any significance  He explores these questions through a plethora of absurd situations and a main character unstuck in time who embodies a lack of free will  I found the book to be a great change of pace from other pieces of classical literature  Vonnegut successfully explores deep and depressing topics with humor showing a unique perspective on the topic  I m just now re reading this book  and to be honest i m still not clear on the whole point of the book  I know one thing though  It s got to be one of the most fascinating books i ve ever read  if only because it s so strange and twisted that you just don t know what to make of it  I d recomend this book to anyone looking for a serious and most likely thought prevoking read  I would like to add though  this book is not for the faint of heart  those who are dissuaded by vulgarity or anyone who doesn t have the patience to try and make sense of the various parts of the book   I m not sure how I got this old without having read Vonnegut  Slaughterhouse Five is an amazing book  breaks a lot of rules on how novels are constructed  is as much autobiography as novel  It s a quick read  but leaves one a bit disturbed and with much to ponder   That s a good thing  I like being left with much to ponder   Worth the read just for the Tralfamadorian view of time  but that s just one little morsel of what s packed into these few pages  I will be reading more Vonnegut  Am sorry he s no longer with us  though he s just fine in lots of other moments   So it goes  In one book  Kurt Vonnegut combines science fiction  social commentary  and biting parody seamlessly into one story  This book alone may have been one of the most influential in my development as a teenager  and all of Vonnegut s work  despite its bitter cynicism  made me realize that there were other people disgusted by the horrible state in the world  That was very profound realization for me I can think of no other work that combines fantasy and satire so effectively  but Cat s Cradle  also by Vonnegut  comes awfully  awfully close  This should be required reading in school  One of the best books I have read  it lived up to the hype  I thoroughly enjoyed this story  The story telling was wonderful  I was caught up in the different time and periods of Billy s life  the themes of war  free will and life  Really well written  Possibly a top five favorite of mine now Not as Sci fi as Sirens of Titan  maybe why I liked it better    It s a great story with funny satirical characters but you still get the hard and sad underlying emotions of the effects of war Pacing of the story is good  I didn t want to stop reading or couldn t wait to pick it up again  This book has been described by my peers as  This is how I think  and it is a very natural read that is compelling and relentless  It is both uncomparably funny and very sad and sullen  which is an essence to human existence and all human experience  This book shows that warfare and gigantic world events do not capture us as people but rather give us the opportunity to live beyond whatever we are being put through  This is one of the finest books ever penned in American Literature  reading this is like breathing but enjoying every second of it  Bring yourself to enjoy it today   This has been recommended to me by a colleague  and I am very keen to read it after just finishing another of Vonnegut s novels   Breakfast Of Champions                                                        OK  I am about to start this one                                                         This is an absolutely brilliant book   it would have to be one of my all time favourites  Totally compelling  and utterly mindblowing  I loved it  Will have to get my own copy so I can re read it whenever I like I have a feeling Micayla would really like this one   One of Vonnegut s more critically acclaimed works  the story reflects on his experiences during the bombing of Dresden in World War II  This book is a great example of using a science fiction element in a realistic world to produce a greater meaning  Time travel acts as a plot device in this story  Billy Pilgrim jumps involuntarily through time to make a series of stunning comparisons for the reader  All of the standard elements of the author s style are present and the recording is passable  I didn t care for the reader  but listening to the story was very enjoyable    Listen I have spent this week time travelling with Billy Pilgrim  I have travelled back to the fire bombing of Dresden in 1945 and forward to 1968  And I have travelled further than Billy Pilgrim  forward to 2008  And Kurt Vonnegut is dead  So it goes  And Kurt Vonnegut s book is sad  and all the more sad because it is 2008 and its lessons have still not been learnt  And probably won t be even when you and I are dead  So it goes  But at least there is comic relief  And science fiction  And if I need to  I can travel back to the week when I read this book and reflect  This is a brilliant book  It is hard to pin point what it is  science fiction  historical fiction  anti war novel  Billy Pilgrim is unstuck in time  He jumps from one event in his life to another in no particular order  He knows how he will die when he meets the man who will cause it  He knows the fate of the people he meets long before they meet that fate  Most writers would have the protagonist fighting the future trying to change what will happen  But Billy goes along  knowing that he will always return to a more pleasant time and there is no reason to fight it  So it goes   I just read the book for the first time  It s a book which I am going to read many more times  Can t believe I just read this classic  Still amazing after all these years  A classic  I ve read it numerous times and also very much enjoy the movie  i dont know how i feel about it but i loved it and im dead  so it goes Brilliant writing  unique format  how have a I not read this before   There is literally nothing wrong with this book  Pure contemporary classic   Nothing I can add that hasn t already been said  A great  great book   this is the best book i have ever read the way vonnegut writes is amazing It s about war It s about love and hate It s about post traumatic stress  It s about sanity and insanity It s about aliens  not the illegal kind  the spacey kind  It s about life It s about death so it goes  There could be no better book about the war  That s how it should be written  Not my favorite of Vonnegut s works but it s still quite breathtaking  The idea of the story fascinated me  I loved it  It s definitely in my top 50   Czytelnik po pochlonieciu ksiazki umiera z zachwytu  But well    so it goes  Il piu bel libro sulla guerra o  meglio  sulla stupidita della guerra I may be peculiar  but I think this is the best book I have ever read  This is classic Vonnegut and a must read for anyone wanting to Vonnegut a try  My second favourite Vonnegut novel  But still get five stars  So it goes  This book was a very confusing read but I enjoyed every second  I loved the constantly changing settings and time periods  Billy Pilgrim s life is definitely an interesting one  Slaughterhouse Five is an intriguing and complex book that I think is best described by Vonnegut s own words on Tralfamadorian books   an image of life that is beautiful and surprising and deep   Fifth time through this one and it still does it for me  Love Vonnegut s prose  What can really be said about this book   It s just amazing and has to be read  This is an amazing piece of writing that I think everyone should read   Un libro denso e grottesco  che fonde la piu dolorosa delle Storie passate e una fantascienza estremamente lucida sul nostro mondo e le sue dinamiche  Niente puo essere cambiato perche il tempo e immobile e immutabile  solo questa puo essere la chiave di lettura di uno degli episodi piu sanguinosi e ingiustificati della Seconda Guerra Mondiale  il bombardamento di Dresda  che dovrebbe essere il cuore di questo romanzo  ma che di fatto rimane sullo sfondo  perche non e possibile  per chi vi ha assistito  raccontarlo  I really liked this book  It opens up a lot of things about life and war   Everything was beautiful  and nothing hurt  Vonnegut    a madman of the highest rank  and Slaughterhouse a vessel through which we travel between the gritty  smoky realism of war and marriage on earth  to a planet so many light years away we cannot fathom its distance Actually  once i opened the book i had a suspicion  His talent burns wildly through the pages of this novel  making you stop and read passages several times before you can believe what is written there Fun and unexpected  a classic  a classic obviously  i could see right away why  i wish i had read this in some lit class  although the technique was not really tricky to see through i d love to examine it some more  i loved the layering of stories which seemed to reflect the chaos that is war and that goes on throughout the story and the trafalmadorian dystopia utopia was perhaps tad not suited at some points  perhaps for i ve read it just once  but albeit all a nice atmosphere created to give this sense of message  overall  a great book   i ve been too late to read it  a perfect cry for peace   Slaughterhouse Five is the trippy  partly true memoir of the character Billy Pilgrim  as told by one of his fellow soldiers   Kurt Vonnegut  As Billy Pilgrim has  come unstuck in time   this book is chronologically insane  It is also a rather wandering  non formulaic work  meditating on such things as religion  society  and personal philosophy without any distinct plot arc  Kurt Vonnegut more or less began the story at a point he felt confident about and ended it when he felt he d had enough and it works  Slaughterhouse Five is a spectacular revelation of a read  I read Slaughterhouse Five again  twice  for the first time in over twenty years  It is still a very different book and you need to go into it with an open mind  There was a specific purpose behind my return to the story   it served as the basis for a derivative work I wrote entitled Ilium Way  11  It was created in the new Vonnegut World within Kindle Worlds and follows Billy Pilgrim through a life that turns out to be much longer and fuller than he expected Ilium Way  11http   www amazon com dp B00FEPPZ7YIf you have a chance to read it I hope you enjoy it  A fantastically interesting read  Billy Pilgrim is a prisoner of war  WWII  who survives the bombing of Dresden  Other soldiers pick on him as the book flashes from the various stages of his life  People live and people die   and so it goes   Funny in parts but also telling  The book made me question whether Billy was suffering from some kind of PTSD or whether he was just able to transfer himself from moments of pain and anguish to other more happy moments  Like a bug stuck in amber for a moment in time  so are the moments of our lives  Why me  Why any of us   Ein Satz ReviewDer Prototyp jenes amerikanischen Stils  der die letzten funfzig Jahre pragte  Parataxe  lange erzahlte Zeit  skurrile Figuren  deren gesamtes Leben mit Vor  und Rucksprungen erzahlt werden   deshalb hat Vonnegut den Anspruch der literarischen Vaterschaft von John Irving  den er unterrichtet hat  oder Jonathan Franzen  nur dass sich dieses Buch weit mutiger erweist  wenn es sich nicht scheut  Science Fiction und Zweiten Weltkrieg  Augenzwinkern mit Bedruckung zu koppeln  und wenn es  in seiner Kurze  bis zur entzuckendsten Pragnanz verdichtet  A story of a man who is unable to cope with reality and society as such after having witnessed the most despondent horrors of war  In response  he creates a new reality  where new dimensions  philosophies  and science fiction  Kilgore Trout  are merged into a harmonious and beautiful reality that is no short of paradigm shifting conceptions of life  being  and time  A wonderful book that should be read by all who wish to challenge their realities and grasp of this planet we call home   All moments  past  present and future  always have existed  always will exist    You ll pretend you were men instead of babies  and you ll be played in the movies by Frank Sinatra and John Wayne or some of those other glamorous  war loving  dirty old men  And war will look just wonderful  so we ll have a lot more of them  And they ll be fought by babies like the babies upstairs  So then I understood    So I held up my right hand and I made her a promise   Mary   I said    I don t think this book is ever going to be finished    If I ever do finish it  though  I give you my word of honor  there won t be a part for Frank Sinatra or John Wayne   After LOST had an homage to this book a couple weeks ago  I decided to read it a second time Now  as someone trying to write a book himself  and as someone trying to live in a new place  I find this book to be more inspirational and hopeful than previously   Just finished it again  I love the delicate balance of humanity and cynicism Vonnegut strikes throughout the tales of Pilgrim s adventures  And  in the end  I take comfort in the idea that every moment of our human lives goes on forever  and concentrating on the good ones will make things a lot easier  Part science fiction and part memoir  Slaughterhouse Five is based on Vonnegut s experiences as a POW during WWII  He was held captive in Germany  where he witnessed the bombing of Dresden that killed thousands of civilians and much precious artwork  Billy Pilgrim is a man who has become unstuck in time and we follow him on his travels through time and space  including his experience in Dresden   This anti war novel uses humor to make us examine the utter absurdity of war An easy and entertaining read that will make you think  One of my all time favorites  I didn t think I would find any enjoyment in a book centered around a tragic war massacre  but I did  This book is not a war book  but a philosophical book about time  war and life in general that I recommend reading  and I will now be looking at more books by Vonnegut in the future   Just as good as when I read it in college  A great anti war story   99 100 Well  that was quite the sidewinder     This may be my favourite book of all time  I will try not to repeat other reviews and I am going to stay away from the anti war controversy and just say that Vonnegut somehow manages to blow my mind every few sentences  His use of the Tralfamadorians in Slaughterhouse Five provide us with an outsider s view of humanity and along with the lack of chronology  an entirely new perspective on time and at risk of sounding hella cheezy  the meaning of life  Every sentence in this book means something and every time I read it  it blows my mind a little bit more  Great read  I m looking forward to reading more of his work   Vonnegut s best novel  A satirical masterpiece of modern literature   Not sure why it took me so long to get go this  It s great   Prachtig semi autobiografisch verhaal in typische Vonnegut stijl  gefragmenteerd  ietwat verwarrend en bestrooid met scifi  of niet   Aanrader voor wie eens iets anders wil lezen  I have no idea why I have never read this book before  Loved it   Even better the second time and 8 years wiser  I love Vonnegut  I liked the way he wrote how the main character perceives his life as jumping around in time   underneath the sci fi element  that is pretty close to reality  https   emryal wordpress com 2015 03     Sad and funny and sad again  And funny  Like that  Love Vonnegut   Amazing  This was my first book and I related to his determinism  A great read I will have to read and re read again and again This book is a masterpiece  Kurt Vonnegut was a genius  and it s really depressing to see people calling him a bad writer when Fifty Shades of Gray is selling so well But  no  not everyone will like this book  It s irreverent  it s not what we re taught in school  it s tragic while being hilarious  Think of Catch 22  but with a completely different writing style and humor  The message is timeless  I think that  even if you don t like something about the writing  the message  or the repetition of  so it goes   you still have to recognize its power   A great insight on the bombing of Dresden set in a fictional prose Finally got around to reading this classic Vonnegut novel  Amazing  It s a book about war  and it is quite serious and grim  I would not expect myself to like this kind of book  I read it for cultural background  and now it is one of my all time favorites It intertwines in a very delicate way the cold insanity of the big world and the burning insanity of one human being caught inside its strange ways  It makes you feel the pain of war  the pure madness of it  and at the same time it preserves the sense of beauty of all things in existence and of all turns of fate   So it goes  I should read it again in a few years  Read this book if you at all have a sense of dark humour  Amazing  A dark but hilarious book  reminds me  in the best way  of Catch 22  Love all of his work to a greater or lesser degree  Miss the man  Wow  what an interesting book  Having never read any Vonnegut  I see were authors like David Wong John Dies at the end and Brian Francis Slattery  Spaceman Blues have gotten some of their influence from  I have read some  so called  classics and have been disappointed but this one is definitely different  The time traveling that the protagonist goes through in the story just overwhelmed me  By this I mean the fact that the author can take a topic like World War 2 and mix it in with aliens  death and humor and still have come out with a classic novel  amazing   Leido en Espanyol  antes de goodreads y  probablemente  internet Brilliant sci fi with a history lesson thrown in for good measure  Liked it so much  It is like watching a movie with a non linear plot structure  Arrow of time dissolves in the narration  Gruesomeness of war is well portrayed  So it goes      if ur only gonna read one KV book  then make it this one  not many ppl know that KV was a survivor of the bombing of dresden  this book contains his firsthand account of that time in the war  the bombibg of dresden is on par with the atomic bombs dropped on japan  the reason for this was all the firestorms that were created by the massive dropping of high explosive bombs and incendiary devices  the firestorms actually sucked the oxygen from the air and ppl lungs  folks died by having the oxygen literally sucked out of their body and so it goes  I really  really enjoyed this book  It was so wonderfully strange and straightforward  Amazingly  I have never read anything by Kurt Vonnegut before  although his style is right up my proverbial alley  and I hope that his other books are as good I m on the fence about how to recommend this book though  Although I loved how oddly it was written  I could definitely see how it could turn other people off  However  it is a super quick read  so I would recommend reading the first 2 chapters  and if you don t like it    just stop  You won t like the rest   As I describe this book to myself in hind sight  it doesn t sound like it would even work as a novel  The story is made up of dozens of fragmented and non linear pieces  The plot is a series of offbeat  loosely connected events which are for the most part described elliptically with short sentences of extraneous factoids  But I loved it from the first page to the last  It s a four star read for me  but I bumped it up to five as a hat tip to the author  given the chosen experimental format  I don t see how he could have written a better book than this  This book was wonderful  the writing and overall theme are incomparable  The subject matter is not what I would refer to as wonderful  but I love how Vonnegut presented it  enough fact to get you to clearly see the point without being overly gory and preachy  I can t imagine how he found a way to tell such a story with such dignity as well  My entire copy of the book is dog eared with passages that were full of meaning for me  and that I think I would like to refer to often  I highly recommend reading this book if you have not  It is a short and quick read  I just re read this book on a flight home from Seoul  Korea  I forgot how much I enjoyed this story  Come follow along as Billy Pilgram the unprepared soldier  successful optometrist  Tralfamadorian zoo exhibit and time traveler shares his stories of life  war and time travel While the heart of the novel is the fire bombing of Dresden during the second world war  that is used mostly as an anchor in this story as it veers all through Billy s life  and death  Well written  funny at times  and thought provoking  What else can you ask for in your sci fi  Beautiful  Once you have your head around the style it is a very touching piece of work  instead of just being humorous  It doesn t take long for that to happen either  and more importantly  while you are doing so the language and structure is so intoxicating that it scarcely feels like a search  I would really recommend it  but do be prepared to be a little confused at times and to have an occasional literary sneak attack  He has that gift for getting you to look one way while he is totally setting you up for something else  Very funny and very rewarding  This book makes me want to have an intelligent conversation with someone and then say something that makes me sound crazy  as Billy does by mentioning his abduction by the Tralfamadorians   Then the person I m speaking with will have to question the validity of everything I had just told them as well as my sanity  just as the reader has to question Billy s time traveling throughout the novel  But in all seriousness  this was an intense book that you really have the read the SparkNotes  Themes  Motifs   Symbols  page after reading it to fully appreciate it  I wish I had read  Slaughterhouse Five  before watching the final season of  LOST  Vonnegut s amazing book transforms the hyper confusing theory of time travel into an easy to swallow pill that guarantees understanding I had to go back and read several moments within the story no less than three times  once to see  twice to study  and a third time to appreciate and savor  A book about the horrors of war  time travel  aliens and the notion of free will  Slaughterhouse Five will change the way you think about the things you thought you already knew  Oh wow  this book was so good   I started it  and the beginning was so so  you know  not bad  but not jump out brilliant at you either  But then I kept going  and it got better and better   Unlike a lot of books I ve read lately  which had brilliant beginnings but terrible middles and ends  Slaughterhouse Five is simultaneously funny and sad  And surprisingly  the chronological jumping around didn t feel forced  or confusing I think the best comparison I can make about this book is that it s like what Catch 22 would have been like  had I actually enjoyed it   A captivating book that tells an unconventional tale from WWII  The narrator follows Billie Pilgrim  a person that seems misplaced in the events that occur to him  who experiences flash backs and flash forwards in the form of perceptional time travel  The narration leaps from war time events to events of a less episodic  everyday life and back  with the occasional visit to the time spend as a specimen in an extraterrestrial zoo  The book follows a captive s story  culminating in the firebombing of Dresden  drawing from Vonnegut s own experience of the event  Absolutely phenomenal  I believe many of the underlying concepts of the novel could be expressed through Vonnegut s recurring use of a simple yet immensely thought provoking prayer found within the novel God  grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change the courage to change the things I can and wisdom always to tell the difference             That s one thing Earthlings might learn to do  if they tried hard enough  Ignore the awful times and concentrate on the good ones    After I m not sure how many re reads  this is still my favorite book ever  It embodies so many of the things I love about speculative fiction   weird timelines  encounters with the supernatural  philosophical ramifications of such encounters  and so on   along with so many of the things I enjoy about  literary  fiction   writing integrated with plot  a distinct human element  strong symbolism  etc  And to top all that off  it s written in a way so straightforward and unassuming that at times you forget what a heavy meditation it is  And it s funny  too  Slaughterhouse Five was a very interesting book to me  I really enjoyed the authors style and felt like that is what makes this book so special  Also Vonnegut did a good job of intertwining humour that not only was relevant but helped portray his message  Billy was a well made character that really portrayed the true horrors of war on a human being  The time structure also helped show how confused Billy was  I think the way Billy just resigned towards life really showed me the horrors of war  I highly recommend this book to anyone considering reading it  This man is a genius  he satirized a sad time in history  Classic  Small book that packs an almighty punch   I really love the obsession of human control when there is a lack of it  Read in the 70s  had to re read it  Still a classic  This book reads like a run on sentence  with no punctuation  where the writer has summarily grabbed words here and there and just dropped them in some other location within the sentence  Granted  it s nonlinear  but I kept thinking the story was going somewhere  Then it didn t  Not really  Yet  it was also profound in so many ways I wouldn t consider myself a connoisseur of dark novels  In fact  I don t even know that I d choose to pick one up  But somehow this landed in my lap and I ended up finding it morbidly compelling  Recommended  Incredible novel  Intensely interesting and beautiful  One of the only books I ve ever read more than once  Another wonderful book from Vonnegut   and so it goes     Took me 30 years to read this book  It was worth the wait  I first read Slaughterhouse Five nearly 40 years ago and fell in love with and now I remember why  Following Billy Pilgrim s hapless traveling from this moment to that in his life  always coming back to his time in a POW camp in Dresden  Germany  how it was firebombed by Allied Forces despite the fact that Dresden had no value as a military target There are bits of the book that seem a bit dated  but it s still touching to read how Vonnegut relates the story of senseless destruction and somehow managed to make some sense of it all So it goes   By far  one of the greatest books I have ever read   Awesome book of awesome author in awesome translation emotional  a little weird  never felt like putting it down  Brilliant Vonnegut at his best  I laughed till I cried   Just as wonderful  weird   horrible as I remembered it  This was so brilliant  Kurt Vonnegut  never have I smiled so much when reading  Jesus Christ this is a rough read for such a small book I first read Slaughterhouse Five in my teens  many moons ago   It stands up to the test of time   My kind of book  But definitely not for everyone  Horror  Rage  Insanity  Giggles What more do you want  Reread after five years  still one of my favorites  A really good humourous read by Kurt Vonnegut R I P  Mr Patterson  You re class ruled  as did this book  Peace  One of those must read books  they were children  This one caught me by surprise  I love this guy s writing style  humour and ideas take on life  Great book  Funny and clever  A great combination As for the war bit  the other title  The Children s Crusade  says it all really  Again  great book  Every time I re read this book  I get more from it  A great American classic by a superbly creative writer Ondanks wat meneer Vonnegut u elke drie pagina s probeert wijs te maken gaat het boek niet over Dresden  maar over aliens i don t know how i went 26 years without reading this book  granted  i probably wouldn t have been as open to it  even a few years ago  but it is totally my kind of book  a little sci fi  a little anti war  a little socio political commentary  all wrapped up in a sarcasticly satiric bun  awesome it s a pretty well known book  but i didn t know what it was about until i actually read it  it s not just about the dresden raids  it made a lot of valid and still relevant today points about america  and i wish i had the book here to quote from   I have to admit  I didn t like this book at first  I started reading it but I put it off for a couple of weeks and read something else  But when our Christmas vacation drew nearer  I had nothing much left to do at the University so I picked it up again  This time around  I couldn t put down the book anymore  It really sucked me in  It became hard for me to resist it  It was so interesting and so different from what I m accustomed to reading  I find it really innovative  Nice choice of words  nice plot  love the characters  really love Vonnegut s style   This  by far  was my favorite Vonnegut  I kept looking for some message buried deep within  other than it being against war  but it helped me realize there always isn t some cryptic message  Sometimes  what you need to know is right in front of you  spelled out in plain black and white  His use of aliens and time travel was an interesting take  It made me think about my life  if it s wasted or if I m just settling like Billy did for the longest time  Even though he knew how it all would happen  he changed nothing  I wonder if I d do the same  Listen   Billy Pilgrim has come unstuck in time I was required to read this sophomore year of high school  Though I was at first confused by it s chaotic chronology  this quickly became my favorite book of all time  Vonnegut s writing style  his descriptions of people  places  and things  people nestled like spoons  Billy s spine  the tube that held all of Billy s important wires  are so wondefully unique and lend themselves perfectly to the atmosphere and tone of the book  The most effective not anti war book of all time Po too wheet  Kurt Vonnegut was at the peak of his powers when he wrote this  The novel disseminates Vonnegut s secular conception of the universe and the absurdity of the attempt by various cultures on the earth to develop mythological answers to the basic questions that nearly all human s ask themselves Where to people come from  What is Death What is right and wrong Where is god in all this mess It is a rare thing for a novelist to tackle such heavy questions Vonnegut courageously attacks these mysteries using satire and logic as weapons   This is unlike anything I ve ever read  I ve read and loved many books  and they all left me with some sort of familiar  bittersweet taste  Yet this was different  I felt numb and involved at the same time  on Earth and on Tralfamadore  unstuck in time but stuck in the narrative  A very unusual take on a very talked about period in time  But then again  this isn t about Dresden  is it  It s about every period in time  everything that always was and always will be  And this book will always be one of the most brilliant pieces of writing in my bookshelf  Excellent  excellent book  This book flashes through many different points of time in Billy Pilgrim s life  describing some of the experiences that the author went through as a POW  and hitting upon certain questions about life in a remarkably funny way  Even terrible  horrible things like the bombing of Dresden are talked about and questioned  There are so many ideas  funny things that I picked up on that made me smile  and strange ways of putting things that amused me that I enjoyed reading the book  I certainly would recommend it to others  Absolutely phenomenal  Kurt Vonnegut really turned this novel into a work of art that is so thought out with its details  While for me it made me question typical human nature   how we see time  look at the good and the bad moments of our life  and suggests that fate rules our actions rather than free will   more so than see the anti war sentiment  it is still evident how against sending essentially children into war that have their whole life ahead of them Vonnegut is  Best book I ve read in school for a while  I was quite sad when it ended   Vonnegut s dislocated masterpiece I must have read this 20 or 30 years ago  Strangely  my weak memory of it added to the fractured narrative  Vonnegut teases you with casual flashbacks  flashforwards   of some horrfic and ridiculous moments of war  He was there  Yesterday I read reports of the battleship my father was on which fired 816 16 inch shells at the Bismarck  the blast from Rodney s own guns ripped up the wooden decking  fractured water pipes and wrenched aluminium fittings from the bulkheads  Of 2221 German crew  116 survived  So it goes  Eighth grade was maybe a little young for this  but it wasn t horribly inappropriate for K  I ve read this book so many times and it so influenced how I think that it s hard to be objective about the quality  Ultimately I disagree with the book s presentation of free will  but the image of ourselves as constantly connected to our pasts and the concept of being unstuck in time make perfect sense to me and I was glad to read and discuss these ideas with my son  Also discussing the view of war with a boy who tends to want to be a soldier was timely  Billy becomes unstuck in time and understands the world better than an of us do  Set in the backdrop of Dresden bombing  and merely 215 pages long this book manages to capture the horrors of war without even trying  The fatalistic approach of the book may not be for everyone  though a certain amount of introspection is inevitable   Everything is as it should be  seems to be the overlying theme of book  of us mere humans who only live in the three dimensions seem unaware of our insignificance  All in all this is a book that everyone should read  Maybe this is a book that has limited appeal  I read it many years ago and liked it a lot  and in my efforts to read the NY Times 100 best  I picked it up for a reread  I glanced at the reviews here before I did  and was startled by the negative response  Then I sat down with it  and was even more confused  I love this book  Very much  I m not even sure where to begin  so I ll just say it is alarmingly funny  alarmingly sad  and alarmingly touching  It may be off the wall to some  but to me it is still the amazing book I remember from years ago  This book has very bad language  I think it s on the same level as Catch 22  but it might be a little worse  That said  I loved this book  Possibly more than Catch 22  which is hard for me to admit  This book is amazing  I couldn t put it down  I just can t get over how great this book is  It s written in the Classical style  which such a relief from all the Romantic style books I ve been reading  If you don t like Classical books  you will hate this one  I  however  loved this book  I think it has just become one of my favorite books of all time   Some might refer to me as a deep thinker  or depressed  or not optimistic  or looks at life from the outside more often than not I don t disagree The subtle  as well as the not so subtle commentary happening in this book is  for want of a better word   Incredible This is a book for anyone who enjoys thinking about things deeper than face value   I hope that includes everyone and thier mother This is one of those books that I ll be making subtle references to the rest of my life  humorous or thought provoking  conscious of or unaware  So it goes  I absolutely loved this book  Kurt Vonnegut s satire and black humour are stunningly written and the overall vibe of this book is dark but funny  It was also very intellectual  in the sense that it had many deeper meanings and really left one with a variety of emotions at the end  I actually felt kind of sad at the end  because the way that the main character  Billy Pilgrim s life played out was really melancholy  and the way the author incorporated humour made it somehow ever sadder  Overall  this was an amazing book and a classic piece of literature  This was my first time reading Vonnegut  It doesn t seem quite right to say I  enjoyed  it  but the book resonated with me deeply  Specifically  I was amazed at the way the book was written  the subject matter was okay  but somewhat less topical nearly 40 years later  My ability to analyze critically postmodern elements of a novel could use some work  but I m in a place where those elements can take my breath away  It s clear Vonnegut is brilliant and has complete mastery of the craft of writing  His sanity  on the other hand  is another question   Everything was beautiful  and nothing hurt  Excellent  Simple prose  profound message  Thought provoking and darkly humorous  It is an excellent book and very interesting A really amazing book  I was in Germany and visited Dresden while I was reading this book and it gave the whole trip a different meaning after I finished the novel   My teenage son pestered me for 2 years to read this book after he read it and enjoyed it  I drug my feet  carried it around for the past year  then finally sat and read it in one night You have to follow the constant back and forth in time in order to truly understand the character  The more that is revealed from past present and future the more your perspective changes about what is really happening in his life At the end of the book I came to my own conclusions as did my son  Made for very good discussion  Everyone should read this book  Great perspective on a broken mind after war  A very strange but nevertheless amazing story In two words  Beautifully cruel  This story went everywhere  From war  to regular married life  to a hospital room in Vermont  and even to a planet called Tralfamadore  I am stunned after finishing this  and not only because of how utterly brilliant Vonnegut s writing is  but also because of the beauty that seemed to peek through the ugliness of Billy Pilgrim s life  I ve heard people say that this is  the greatest work of Vonnegut  and I can definitely see why they say that  This book is a work of art  and I recommend it to everyone  If you do nothing else in life  read this book  This book was so good  I died  So it goes    everything was beautiful and nothing hurt  The best representation of PTSD in literature  How is it that I ve never read this before now   One of my all time favourites  Such a classic I died while reading this book  So it goes  I have Kurt Vonnegut tattoos on my hands   Fascinating  His best work  Not to be missed  Messy and sad and beautiful  And it always will be   Now I have to reread the rest of his early books  Excellent  Not sure how long ago I read this   Coisas da vida    Trafalgar      bom livro     This was a GREAT book  I should have read this ages ago  This disconnect between life a death and Billy s way of dealing with postwar life is fascinating and tempting I also loved how the author plumped himself in there once in awhile as if reminding the reader that this was real and not part of a fictional Sci fi story  That the Sci fi story is the way to cope with the absolute destruction of so many lives and that it s really a forgotten part of WWII history even though it was the most destructive and terrifying chapter in my opinion   It only took me 27 years to get around reading one of the best things ever   Uniquely crafted with an incredible message  A long drink of water after being lost in the desert  It s better when you know the truth behind it One of the best anti war books ever written   Classic  Not much else to say  And so it goes    I can t believe it took me this long to read this book  My god  it was incredible    so my love for all things Vonnegut began     tis a brilliant book  by turns devastating and hilarious  My take on this book is that it Vonnegut at once is trying to describe the events and memories of events from the perspective of someone who is trying to at once to make sense of something that doesn t make sense and also trying to avoid the memories of war and somehow make sense of it all and how it plays into his own life which is expected to continue as if nothing ever happened  Kind of like being picked up by space aliens and returned suddenly to continue your life  I enjoyed this book and recommend it to others  and so it goes     I added this book to my  to read  list because it was on my  Books I should of read back in high school and didn t   I really did not know what to expect when I started it  I knew that it was about the firebombing in Dresden Germany  I knew that Kurt Vonnegut was there during the bombing  I concluded that it was more autobiographical  When it turned into a sci fi  I was a bit surprised  By the time I finished it  I really liked it  Vonnegut s nonchalant delivery of some of the details he saw in Dresden made them so much more horrible   The day after the 9 11 tragedy I was siting at my desk at work and I wondered what Kurt Vonnegut would have to say about this disaster  So  I went searching for his email address online  I came to a site that said had a blurb at the bottom saying  to contact my lawyer   I clinked on it for the off chance that it would get to him  I wrote Dear Mr  Vonnegut Are the birds still saying  poo tee weet  Best Regards Todd WalshHere s what he wrote back    Yes  If you have not read this book  read it  It is spiritual  This is a bizarre tale of time travel featuring Billy Pilgrim a German American who serves in WW2 and is abducted by aliens  This is in part autobiographical as Vonnegut a POW witnessed the fire bombing of Dresden and many of the descriptions are directly from his experiences  I enjoyed the book and parts are very funny and weird when it shifts to his abduction to Planet Tralfamadore but highlights the effects that war experiences have on memory and state of mind  It works on several levels with great writing and interesting subject matter  Considered to be one of the Great American Novels  Slaughterhouse Five by Kurt Vonnegut Jr  is simultaneously about the fire bombing of Dresden during WWII  alien abduction  and time travel  The story deals heavily with the concepts of free will  death  the inevitability of war  sexuality and infedelity  and is a satire against Fatalism  I would recommend this novel to any enthusiatic reader who is looking to expand his or her range of genres  Slaughterhouse Five falls into the catergories of science ficiton  dark comedy  and war literature   First Vonnegut book I ve ever read and I was turned into an instant groupie  I looked for every single book of his available in the bookstore and tore through them nonstop  Looked for every interview and short story available online as well  I m short of tattooing Kilgore Trout s face on my arm  That s how much I loved this book  I love the writing  opinions on the world and unsolicited advice for life  I even like the language  random scribbles and page long parenthetical remarks   Not sure which of his books that last line refers to   Absolutely loved this book  A wonderful re introduction to Vonnegut s voice  which I hadn t heard in probably 30 years  I believe I d only read Breakfast of Champions and   some other book of his  This one was more serious than I recall those being  serious in a GOOD way  Powerful  funny  mind expanding  sad  Having read genre book after genre book for my job  it was great to sink into this Side note  I listened to this on a just completed road trip  The audio book was read by Ethan Hawke  who just did a beautiful job  Very impressed  I listened to the audiobook version with Ethan Hawke s narration  and a great  easter egg interview with KV at the end   Honestly  it should have come with a warning   This book is so good that it will spiral your brain into awesome overload and leave you rolling around on the floor  convulsing like a lunatic   Not for the faint of heart   some very harrowing and graphic scenes in both the physical and emotional sense  But  strange as it is  this book has now allowed me to view death as something to no longer be afraid of  Thanks  Kurt  I absolutely loved this book  The depth of insight into humanity and war was fascinating  It does jump around quite a bit  but I enjoyed that aspect   it always kept my attention  It still flowed in a weave of connection over time  I know I m a little biased  as my favorite genre is war literature  But this was more than just a book about war  it gave several thought provoking ideas that made me think about my own life  This book is on another level of aestheticism and Vonnegut is pure genius   Everything was beautiful  and nothing hurt   This book is one of the most incredible books I have ever read  Vonnegut uses all sorts of methods to convey a message about war and humanity including a very confusing time travelling mail character who is absolutely nuts  I adored this book and I can t wait until I can get my hands on some more of  Kurt Vonnegut s books and this particular one in German  the original language  If you ever have to read a free reading book for school I would pick this one as there is so much that you can write about and it is enjoyable too  Loved it    Vonnegut s version of a tale of extreme post traumatic stress disorder reads like a fairy tale for adults  a very dark fairy tale  It is classic Vonnegut  A science fiction novel for people who don t like science fiction  funny as heck  poignant  and above all a very firm statement about the horror of war  This is a very novel take on the war ravaged mind looking for peace  Vonnegut is one of my favorite authors  It s hard to pick a favorite  but this book is definitely up there  along side Cat s Cradle and Mother Night   So good    This is one of those books that can ruin our day because you can t put it down  Vonnegut s way of being light and funny while challenging your perceptions of life drive me CRAZY                                                                 Why me   That is a very Earthling question to ask  Mr  Pilgrim  Why you  Why us for that matter  Why anything  Because this moment simply is  Have you ever seen bugs trapped in amber   Yes   Well  here we are  Mr  Pilgrim  trapped in the amber of this moment  There is no why    Nakonets to prochitala  So it goes  Vonnegut at his best  So it goes  Favourite Book  Read it  So it goes  An AP read turned absolute favorite  Kurt Vonnegut is a radical writer  And I don t believe I have ever used that word to describe anybody before This book was like nothing I have ever read  I had to read Slaughterhouse Five really slowly since it was disturbing  I read a few passages out loud to my husband who asked me     Are you making this up   and  It sounds just like a nightmare    My end result and feeling was the same as going through a real life horrible experience     It s kind of personal and hard to talk about what I thought of it all  I really liked it  So it goes  Hands down  my all time favorite book   One of my favorite books ever   NNNNNNNNNNNGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHread book We know our Heroes  right   Aha    Brilliant  Everyone should read  Made a great impact in my childhood  This is a really interesting book  It gives a strong antiwar message about a man names Billy Pilgrim  who is unstuck in time  He travels through moments of his life  Also  this book had a lot of ironies like poo twee ee  Englishman  etc  This book it one of the best antiwar books written in history     Awesome funny bonkers and touching  The 3rd best book ever written  I m really glad that I read this   Even better second time around    His books make me feel a bunch of stuff I really enjoyed this book  Quick easy to read  sorry to see it end  so it goes         You can t spell Slaughterhouse without laughter   One of my favorite Vonnegut books  Both a statement and an truly enjoyable novel  Slaughterhouse Five has a sarcastic wit that actually keeps the reader consistently interested  Many aspects of this novel are wonderful in their own way  from the anti war sentiment to the science fiction and even the of philosophy tralfamadorians  Slaughterhouse Five contains aspects that appeal to readers who are interested in many different topics  Personally  I specifically enjoyed the historical fiction aspect of book  but as I said  it truly is a novel that most could enjoy  This book is so good in the weirdest way possible   I thoroughly enjoyed this book  classic Vonnegut  He s the best Right up there with Sirens of Titan   One of the best books I ve read in a while  This was my third time reading this book  Once when I was a 16 and once in 2010  It really does get better each time I read it  If you haven t read this  read it  One of the most unique books I have ever read  Better than I remembered  Easily his best work  although Cat s Cradle and Timequake aren t far behind   One of my favorite books ever  Great book  Really makes you think  Absurdly  bizarrely  and sadly wonderful  What else can one say  So it goes   Definitely a good and easy flowing read especially when the readers are going back and forth with billy pilgrim on his odyssey trip  I love vonnegut s writing style  There are more than a few lines that are beyond witty and made me laugh even though the subject of the book is on battle of Dresden  The way he wrote the book and portrayed the aliens perspective on time and moment  left some interesting questions  Highly recommend and you can definitely finish this book in one sitting  but you ll be questioning the books for days   I am quite surprised I never got around to commenting on this book  I read this right after Sucker s Portfolio  For being one of his groundbreaking novels I am equally surprised I did not read this much earlier in life This book was amazing  The picture it paints of an American GI in the European Theater of WW2 is breath taking and enlightening  This mixture of horror and humanity is one that is difficult to put in words without one reading it for him or herself  At many points it brought a tear to my eyes Fantastic work  Definitely some of the finest science fiction in print  However  I am a bit uncomfortable describing this book as science fiction  The genre is very broad  but many do not understand its scope and immediately write off anything described as such  This novel is not  traditional  science fiction at all  if by traditional one conjures up images of Star Wars or Star Trek  Billy Pilgrim s story of uncontrollable time travel whisks by at an incredible speed  with tons of intellectual fodder to ponder for the rest of your lifetime  A nearly perfect book  Billy Pilgrim is definitely one of these anti heroes that you won t ever forget after experiencing all the traumas that he goes through  Using a fragmented plot structure and with time and space ever shifting so smoothly and horrifically at the same time  this is one of those books that must be read if you love great literature and satires  Flying saucers  premonitions are also prevalent in this hilarious and sad read  For me  this was my first Vonnegut  Not quite a perfect read  but it s truly satisfying  Vonnegut was one of only 7 Americans to survive the bombing of Dresden during WWII  he was a prisoner being held in a basement meat locker  the only reason they survived   and this is his tale  Of course anyone familiar with Vonnegut s work will know he has to disguise it as an off the wall time travel novel  but the essential memories remain intact  I was fortunate enough to see Kurt at his very last speaking engagement  in 2006   Be decent  dammit   were his final words of advice to those of us gathered  He died about a year later  This book was absolutely amazing I am not much of a war guy and I went into it with the only idea that it had a cool title  but I soon became blown away by its interesting story and it s readability Normally  I can t read a book unless I have prior information of it or it s recommended to me  this book was given to me by my English teacher  When I read a book  if its boring I cant stand to read it and have to force my self  I couldn t put this book DOWN All and all  even if you aren t into war books  you have to read this   Kurt Vonnegut has one thing in common with Herman Wouk  his best novels are set in World War II  Obviously that war was the central  formative event in both those authors  lives As for Vonnegut  most of the  heroes  of his novels tend to be passive  persons to whom things happen  rather than persons who make things happen  A curious and important fact that all people should note is that amid the insanity of modern warfare  the passive man  such as  Slaughterhouse Five s Billy Pilgrim  becomes a transcendant hero  Hermoso  Una vision del tiempo que hace contemplar nuestras vidas con una nueva perspectiva  Algo que tienes que leer antes de morir  Veo que hay una adaptacion de los anos 70  pero por el trailer prefiero reservarmela  Mejor me espero a la que hara Guillermo del Toro con DON SENOR Charlie Kaufman  Si quieren ver una adaptacion cercana a Slaughterhouse Five  entonces vean el capitulo de Lost  The Constant   s04e05   Eso les puede calmar la espera  Al terminar de leer esto solo me quedo una pregunta por hacer Poo tee tweet   Ten years ago I used to spend a lot of time reading Kurt Vonnegut  I went through five or six of his books  I ve always been a fan    and yet  somehow I had managed to not read Slaughterhouse five until this month  It is amazing and perhaps my new favorite Vonnegut  a close second to Mother Night   One of the most amazing moments in this book is when Billy Pilgirm watches a war movie in reverse  Amazing  The description of a war movie watched backwards becomes one of the strongest statements against war that I have ever read  It is often surprising to me when words on a page can cause such an emotional response  Vonnegut activates something deep in his wordplay and non linear storytelling  The book is not just an account of lives impacted by war  it is about the timelessness of the human experience  and the harm that we cause to each other and the pains that we endure  and furthermore  the meaninglessness of the lives that on which we place so much meaning  Vonnegut s writing is crisp and emotional  filled with depth  This was such a wonderful 200 pages    Slaughterhouse Five  is one of the best examples of playfulness within a particular genre that I ve seen  What I mean by this is that  while it is essentially a time traveling piece of science fiction  it is more importantly a very funny and effective rumination on much more serious topics such as the horrors of World War II  Vonnegut uses escapism not just as a piece of entertainment but as an example of how we can sometimes deal with difficult subject matter  and that is very important to me both as a reader and a writer  I came late to Vonnegut    I was actually reading it when Vonnegut died    but my husband read S5 in HS and said it changed how he thought about things  I was a little surprised  then  to love it at my age as much as he did then  to love the experience of reading it  V had such an economy of language  such an interesting perspective on things  that  in the book  outrageous circumstances become perfectly comfortable vehicles for considering essential human issues  Startling story  graceful and surprising writing  so good  Saw this on a list of must read post modern literature and couldn t believe I hadn t read it before  I listened to the unabridged Audible version read by Ethan Hawke and it was fabulous   both the book and Hawke s reading of it  A great anti war book centering on the infamous fire bombing of Dresden  Billy Pilgrim s odyssey through time reflects the mythic journey of our own fractured lives as we search for meaning in what we are afraid to know  Very tough and very funny  it is sad and delightful  and it works  So it goes  One of the most amazing and thought provoking books ever  I am a Vonnegut fan in general but this is amazing Just a addendum to this   If your get a chance to listen to the audiobook narrated by Ethan Hawke  is well worth it and nicely executed  So It Goes      I ve read Slaughterhouse Five a few times  first for my sophomore English class  and immediately fell in love with it  Vonnegut s style of writing and type of time space travel makes for a disjointed  but interestingly creative narrative  As I have a peripheral interest in psychology  trying to figure out if Billy Pilgrim is insane or not is one of the most fun parts of the book  I loved Vonnegut s ideas on the time space continuum and his creation of the funny little space aliens who could view an entire life all at the same time   I can t tell how much I loved this book  During the first chapter i wasn t feeling so thrilled but soon as I stepped into the second chapter I was hooked  Billy Pilgrim is a Successful Veteran of World War Two who s been stricken with the notion their are extra terrestrial beings monitoring his life and teaching him about death  The book is fast paced and all over the place with ever changing setting and characters it never loses steam  A lot of symbolizing and lessons to be learned  Frankly this book is just awesome    So it gos  Not much to add since so much has already been said   this book fucking rules  I had actually ditched reading this in high school when most people got it  and then went on to read most of Vonnegut s other stuff before finally making my way over to SH5  And  yes  I now have a  So it Goes  tattoo on my right arm  Sounds cliche  right  Well I did it cool  you haven t even seen that shit yet This and  Cat s Cradle  are one of the 20th Century tag teams that wrestled my ass into useful new modes of thinking that I now use daily   Strange  But addictive  Vonnegut at his best 5 5 Would read Kilgore Trout  Clever  Moving  Hilarious  It is a classic for a reason Simplemente genial  Totalmente recomendable  Se podria definir como un canto a la paz  una descripcion de lo que verdaderamente es la guerra y no la imagen que se vende  un relato que mezcla la ciencia ficcion  con la novela historica y la cultura pop  Todo un descubrimiendo  Fantastic literature  My all time favorite book   One of the best books I ve ever read  Maybe Vonnegut s best  Kurt Vonnegut is a legend   Enjoyable casual read Must read before you die  slaughter house five is a story like no other  the story is very interesting and goes out of order  the ethics scale for this book is absolute vs relative  absolute is what stands on its own  like his thoughts  and relative is what is connected  like how the events are connected  but separate  so the question is  what else is related  on its own in the story   This book is simply amazing  Why not to make wars book Brilliant  so it goes  One of my favorite books  An excellent book  A humorous book about non humorous situations  I looked forward to reading each and every page   Amazing  one of my favorites  Heartbreaking and funny Surprisingly hilarious     A book about war and aliens  One of the best of all time  Kurt Vonnegut is epic  I thought this book was simply amazing  I admit I was hesitant to read this book at first as some of the reviews are bad  but I had to find out for myself and I am so glad that I did  It has become one of my all time favourite books   I really enjoyed reading Slaughter House 5 by Kurt Vonnegut  The only thing that I did not like about the book was the number of times that  so it goes  was used  You must also be careful not to read the book too quickly as the timeline jumps around a little bit and can quickly become pretty confusing  The author presents many interesting ideas in a very bizarre way  I thought the tralfmordorian belief of  there is no beginning  no middle  no end  no suspense  no moral  no causes  no effects  was very interesting   That was bizarre and lovely  My first Vonnegut read  Slaughterhouse five is Kurt s tribute to his experiences in the W W   II  Filled with trademark Kurt wit  the book quite splendidly manages to turn morose topics into abstractism wits that are hilarious Following Billy Pilgrim  the  unwilling  traveler in time who also gets abducted by aliens all while managing to stay alive in Dresden Full of quirky notes  this book shall keep you entertained  But it s not just the entertainment  Full of satire and witty comments on society as a whole  especially during the war  ALL  TIME  FAVORITE  A sad book without tears  I honestly loved this book  One of my favorite books   A Post modern masterpiece  An impossible book to set down  Vonnegut s dark humor gives an intriguing account of the massacre at Dresden  The most creative way to tell a war story I have ever encountered   Actually  in order to be fair to one of my favorite authors of all time  I should be able to give this book 10 stars and the other books in the universe can fall somewhere far below that  But this is Goodreads so I give it a five  I ve read Slaughterhouse Five but this time I think it affected me a lot more than in the past  Maybe that comes with age  not sure  My favorite Vonnegut book is still Player Piano  which I think is just brilliant  and would have to extend the star scale up into the middle teens  at a minimum  I ve never read anything like slaughter house five  This novel is a complete stream of Vonnegut s thought process  The novel takes place during WWII and Vonnegut takes a completly difrent aproch to telling a war story  Instead of false romanticsm he tells the story like it is  vonnegut tells the story of the soldier as children of war  and through his retelling one comes to the realization that all war is inveatable  but mantains that he his aginst it  Slaughter house five was fantastic and i loved every min of it  I read this book as I was in the final days of puberty and that wonderful horrible time of chemical imbalance we all experience  It was the absolute best time for me to read it as it greatly affected my mindset in ways I cherish and am grateful for  The simple fatalistic phrase of  so it goes     has been almost a motto of sorts for me and has been a better coping mechanism than any other ive tried  I cannot overstate the importance of this literary work on my life and emphatically recommend  nay  demand you read it  Strano come i miei due libri preferiti sulla guerra  il presente Mattatoio n  5 e Comma 22 di Heller  siano in realta libri atipici  dove il conflitto e un mezzo per analizzare l idiozia del genere umano e dove non trovano spazio descrizioni di atti di eroismo  battaglie campali o altri cliche del genere  Il romanzo di Vonnegut  con il suo protagonista travolto dagli eventi e dai viaggi temporali  rappresenta in fondo la tristezza di una specie destinata ad estinguersi per propria mano  Cosi va la vita  The wackiness of this novel tapped in to a dark and strange part of my brain that I didn t think anyone else inhabited  Under the guise of a war  or anti war  story  Slaughterhouse Five is really a statement of humanity s place in the universe  and our flawed assumption that we  as individuals and a race  are significant  At the same time  the novel explores the fantastic events that can take place in even an average life time  The dichotomy of these two truths has stuck with me  and still colors the everyday of my life   I really enjoyed this book  It is a fascinating way to depict the horrors and trauma of war through the perspective of Billy Pilgrim  a man deeply affected by his time as a prisoner in Dresden  A masterful weave of stories revolving around Billy s traumatized mind drifting through the various phases of his life  This book is an indictment of war and its horrible consequences  It uses derision to point out the absurdity and nonsensical character of war  Its so tragic that one must find it funny to keep one s sanity  This is such a great book  It s very much a Vonnegut book  though  so if you don t like his writing or his subject matter  you probably won t like this book  It s an awesome anti war book  with a protagonist named Billy Pilgrim who becomes  unstuck in time   switching back and forth from his time in the U S  Army during World War II  when he was present at the firebombing of Dresden  to his present life  to a time he spent on exhibit in a zoo on the planet Tralfalmadore with the adult movie star Montana Wildhack  I loved this book because I teach German and therefore was eager to learn more about the firebombing of Dresden  This book includes a first hand account of what happened there   Kurt Vonnegut was a prisoner of war in Dresden during the firebombing  But he gets to that very painful subject cautiously   the real horrors of it don t come out until near the end  The character is described in such a way as to help the reader really understand what it is like to live with PTSD disorder  I think  I really enjoyed this book  Listen  I like pretty much all Vonnegut  and this is my favorite  It s been awhile since I read it  so I forget most of the details  One of my favorite parts is when the main character stumbles into his car drunk and spends an hour trying to find the stearing wheel until he finally gives up and passes out  Vonnegut describes the search for the steering wheel in detail for about a paragraph  then let s us know the reason it can t be found  he was in the back seat of the car  That cracks me up  I need to read this again  SH5 has maybe the best central narrative ploy of all of Vonnegut s novels  the protagonist  Billy Pilgrim  becomes  unstuck in time   and lives the events of his life in random order  which tends to give him a unique perspective on things  Those things most importantly include the firebombing of Dresden  which Vonnegut himself experienced  But he also experiences the births and deaths of family members  and even an alien abduction  A film made from the book not long after its release is also recommended   Excellent Read  An absolute must   So it goes  This is a classic   I can t believe I waited until I was an adult to read this book  Now I immediately recommended it to my teenage son  Then  I rethought that decision  My brother in law is mentally ill  and has read all of Vonnegut s work  Correlation  Probably  Or  at least  I think he is drawn to Vonnegut because he is mentally ill This work will torment you and leave you really questioning much of what you have just read  Fascinating and marvelous  No wonder is has lasted so long in the literary canon of American work   Writing that comes in waves  On the permanence of events past and future  and the fleeting of time  On meaning and the lack there of  On the pitiable every days and just as pitiable deaths of those who experience them  so it goes  Comedy from the infinitely bleak  How else can we respond but with laughter at the absurdity of it all  What else  but maybe a bird s  poo tee weet   Po tee wheet  And so it goes  Kurt Vonnegut is epic  I thought this book was simply amazing  I admit I was hesitant to read this book at first as some of the reviews are bad  but I had to find out for myself and I am so glad that I did  It has become one of my

reread Grandisimo Had I read this before  Was I confusing it with Catch 22 It doesn t matter  This is a superbly written and conceived novel  The protagonist  Billy Pilgrim   slips through time   doing what most of us do every day in our imaginations  an experience in the present makes a connection with something else in our past and off we go By light heartedly writing about being a prisoner of war in Dresden before  during  and after the Allied firebombing of the City  Vonnegut has written a devastating critique of war  And so it goes      I read this because I thought it was one of  the  books a person should read  I didn t expect to like it  after seeing the movie years ago   but for me it is a true masterpiece  combining essential elements of eminent writing with a narrative that moved me in so many ways  from laughter to tears and back again  It is a profoundly disturbing book that gives much food for thought and yet also a strange kind of comforting embrace  It deserves it accolades and now sits on my perfection shelf with few others   So weird  it s great  bretty good So it goes  I loved this book  So it goes  Required reading  Masterful  I honestly don t know what to think    Dreadfully good Absurd and moving  Amazing storytelling  I was fascinated by the way the author chose to tell the story  in terms of the timing of it  Also  the Audible version had a little surprise interview with the author at the end  that was very interesting   I had a very strange reaction to this book  I couldn t stop laughing  Billy is so ignorant  so innocent  so tragic  that you have to laugh   if you don t  you ll cry  Slaughterhouse Five is an excellent commentary on post traumatic stress disorder and how so many people had to live in silence while they suffered through the crippling effects of the world wars  Vonnegut uses science fiction as a way of pure escapism for the narrator and Billy  and teaches us that we should enjoy the moment  not the end  The scale and humanity present in Slaughterhouse Five is only surpassed by Vonnegut s wit  He is able to dive deep into the horrors of war by showing not just the horror  but also the absurdity with equal care and weight  Easily one of the best novels I ve ever had the pleasure of reading  Vonnegut at his best  which is saying a lot  He worked for years on this magical realist  semi SF retelling of his WWII experiences in Dresden  throwing out a long  detailed ms   replacing it with this short  concise tale that melds time travel and memory  There isn t that much to discuss about this book  It is what it is  and it works marvelously The movie  by the way  is the equal of the book  despite it s different emphasis  And you get to see Valerie Perrine topless for long periods  a bonus to any flick  I reread this recently when I decided I wanted my own copy and bought one  Last time I read it was probably 20 years ago  I remembered it was good  and I remembered rightly  This has got to be one of the classics of all time  Science fiction meets World War 2 with a mad dash of anything goes in between  it gives the impression of stream of consciousness writing but seems too carefully elucidated to truly be written that way  So it goes In the class of Catch 22 by Joseph Heller  definitely  I don t really read that much  so when i picked this book up I thought I would just never finish it  like most other books I have read  However  it has sucked me in  it is an amazing read  I have read a little more than half in one night and hope to finish it tonight  I would have probably never picked up the book if not for John Green s  Looking for Alaska   in which the characters discuss Kurt Vonnegut novels  In fact  between  Looking for Alaska  and  Slaughterhouse five  I have a renewed joy of reading   Possibly the best book I ve ever read  I love Vonnegut  I find his writing accessible  interesting  smart  quirky  funny  human  and thoroughly engrossing  This is the best of his I ve read Because Slaughterhouse Five is very much about war  on top of all Vonnegut s adjectives already listed  add  devastating   For such a simple and quirky writer  he certainly gets straight to the heart of things  Though I know this is a science fiction story  I tend to class it as philosophy  I highly recommend it   A must read for anyone  Vonnegut writes about his experience as a soldier in WW2  of being captured by the German Army  and of his front row seat to the fire bombing and utter destruction of Dresden    a peaceful nonmilitary city that was a treasure of art and architecture Vonnegut  a master of writing between the lines  somehow marries atrocity with his trademark humor  This book emanates with a sense of sadness and loss  and yet treads lightly over it as it finds joy and humor in the small things in life   Pages Read  214Slaughterhouse is about Billy Pilgrim getting stuck in time  By stuck in time I mean that he cannot stop traveling in time  His ability to time travel was given to him by the distant alien life forms  the Tralfamadorians  The plot of the story avoids chronological order  It is based on several events of his life  From being abducted by Aliens to sleeping with a porn star  you are taken on a wild journey with Billy Pilgrim  a man who does not know when to stop nor stop when he does not know   This is quite possibly the best book I have ever read  Vonnegut does something magical here  bending time and space to tell a story that is only all to human  using tools and characters that seem anything but  Look closer  You will find a story that is crafted to tell us more about ourselves and the universe than we ever thought could be made from things so strange and other  By using science fiction  he is able to remove his narrator far enough away from the human condition to truly examine it from the outside  Read in about 2 days  majority of which I was relaxing in the hottub on the back deck overlooking the slopes of snowshoe mountain  while the rest of the crew was out skiing  I only got a lift ticket for one day     couldn t put it down    poo tee weet   There isn t any particular relationship between all the messages  except that the author has chosen them carefully  so that  when seen all at once  they produce an image of life that is beautiful and surprising and deep  There is no beginning  no middle  no end  no suspense  no moral  no causes  no effects  What we love in our book are the depths of many marvelous moments seen all at one time   One of my favorite quotes  it seems to me that the Tralfamadorians have a wisdom beyond human comprehension   I might have been far less confused had I actually read that summary before I started the book  I had no idea what I was getting into as I opened it  so it took a while for me to be pulled in properly  This books makes no sense  and at the same time  it makes the most awesome sense  Billy  who tends to shift between planets and time periods and various states of illness  is wonderfully characterised and marvelously insane  This book transcends time and space and is well deserving of its stellar reputation  Vonnegut totally stole my heart with this book  The main character is charming and intriguing  There is a span of 3 pages in which the character recounts watching a movie backwards  I won t spoil it for anyone  but it was by far the most moving and gorgeous thing I have probably ever read  I cried  and read it again  Vonnegut writes with a poetic beauty  His language gets inside you and leaves you love drunk and dizzy  I can t wait to read more of his work  I only hate that it took me so long to do so   I d never read any Vonnegut before  so when I found an old  tattered paperback at a used book store  I figured this would be a cheap way to see what all the fuss was about  The paperback fell apart when I was reading it  So it goes  My ignorance of Vonnegut died and gave way to admiration  So it goes  Seriously  I m going to make a list of Vonnegut novels and read them one by one  scratching them off of the list as I read them  So it goes  I m an idiot because most of my brain cells are dead  So it goes  Favorite Quotes  And what do birds say  All there is to say after a massacre  things like  Poo tee weet     And Lot s wife  of course  was told not to look back where all those people and their homes had been  But she did look back  and i love her for that  because it was so human So she was turned into a pillar of salt  So it goes   That calls for a lot of lenses  and a lot of frames Frames are where the money is   He didn t look like a soldier at all  He looked like a filthy flamingo   On a Vonnegut kick of late i guess    But anyhoo  this is the second time i read Slaughterhouse  i didn t finish it in a single  5 hour sitting like the first time but it was still very good  i noticed so many more tidbits of wisdom and insight the second time around that it almost felt like a different novel altogether  i also came to feel that i ll have to read it a few more times to truly grasp most of the ideas covered within its mere 200 something pages  No problem  i love to wallow in Vonnegut s head   Can t believe I haven t read this book until now as it is on so many highschool honors reading lists  My friends mentioned this book and Vonnegut s Timequake over the weekend and recommended both to me  It immediately reminded me of several books I have read  all three I highly recommend  One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich  A Novel by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn  Martian Time Slip by Philip K  Dick  Time s Arrow by Martin Amis  It also made me want again to attempt the hefty Gravity s Rainbow by Thomas Pynchon  TBC Brilliant awesome Genius Amazing   Gastkramande  En riktig antikrigsbok  Rekommenderas  So it goes Nothing short of amazing  creating order in the chaos of a single mind  Brilliant  hwl ngyz Mind bogglingly brilliant  Classic Kurt Vonnegut writes a novel trying to tell his story of World War 2 with the help of aliens  time travel and an ordinary  passive soldier  Billy Pilgrim  who sees the inevitability of events and knows he is powerless to prevent them  The irony of this lack of free will and the barrage of deaths that we get used to led to a powerful feeling of accountability for our actions  If no anti wars thoughts rise  it is still an interesting journey of a man trying to escape the terrors of war he has seen  Yowza  Sometimes you read a book that is straight up nonsense  and sometimes you frequently ask yourself what the heck is going on in the book  and sometimes you are confounded and confused by said book SPOILER ALERT  That book is Slaughterhouse Five Frequently I was lost  but dazzled  The matter a fact style that Vonnegut uses while discussing the bombing of Dresden is so casual  yet so powerful   So it goes  I honestly did not expect to enjoy this book SO MUCH  But I did  And it was beautiful  I have heard a lot of negative comments surrounding this book and was hesitant to whether I would actually enjoy it  I was pleasantly surprised  I actually really love everything about this book and can t wait to get my hands on more of Vonnegut s works  Speculative fiction is definitely one of my favourite genre especially novels that go into sci fi  Heartfelt  humanistic  brilliantly simple  deeply thoughtful  eye opening and intelligent  Glad I read this book  My first Vonnegut experience  and it won t be the last  great  Absolutely incredible book   An absolutely fantastic read  powerful and moving Because I have been living in the dark ages I didn t know who Kurt Vonnegut was  I impatiently filed him away as a Star Trek character when I heard his name mentioned  So when I stumbled upon this book and was intrigued by the title I had to take a crack at it  It was hilarious  I hadn t expected comedy given the subject matter  Somehow the author manages to twist disturbing subjects into light   funny little anecdotes that take place within something dark  I will definitely read more of his books  this is one of my favorite books im so glad i read it  it is so different than any book i have ever read  the style and the content surprise me every page  aliens and war and time travel  sounds like something i have never been interested in but Vonnegut writes these parts in so naturally that they lose the weird sci fi aspect that i would not take seriously  the book is so funny even though the topic is a war tragedy  dont let the aliens and time travel scare you away  this book is a must read  This is probably my favorite book of all time  This  and The Grapes of Wrath contain the passages that are most likely to help get me through a hard time  This is especially a good read for anyone who is dealing with the loss of a loved one  One page that s stayed dog eared in my copy since the first time I read it on summer assignment was the introduction of  So it goes   It s sad and funny at the same time  which Vonnegut is the master of  This should be on everyone s  Must Read  list  Just re read this book for the first time in many years after downloading a free copy of it from another website   thecopia com  I used to be a huge Vonnegut fan in college but thought I had outgrown him as I got older  Nope  I feel like I ve rediscovered an old friend  The firebombing of Dresden is still such a little known but horrible part of World War II  I never learned about it in school  I have to go re read some more Vonnegut now that I ve read that one  It is thought provoking  side splittingly funny and eminently readable  while also being an unflinching look at one of the most horrific tragedies of the 20th century  Not many authors can juggle this many themes and topics together in one book  all while using a non linear narrative   but Vonnegut is definitely one who can  See the rest of my summary and review of Slaughterhouse Five on my blog   I started this book and wasn t impressed  In fact  I almost stopped reading  I decided to give it a few more paged and am glad I did  The next thing I knew I looked up at the clock  it was 4 a m  and I had just a handful of pages to go  Turned out it was one of those rare finds that you can not put down Still  I can t really figure out why it was so compelling  It s certainly not for everyone  but my advice is  if you pick up a copy  give it more of a chance than just the first chapter before you stop  Love this more the second time through  Love this part in the first chapter   You know what I say to people when I hear they are writing anti war books    No what do you say  Harrison Starr    I say  Why don t you write an anti glacier book instead    What he meant of course was that they were as easy to stop as glaciers  I believe that too  And even if wars didn t keep coming like glaciers there would still be plain old death  Vonnegut s humor in the midst of horror and destruction is artful  I remember devouring this book one summer afternoon as my Mom cleaned the house around me  being completely floored by Vonnegut s free wheeling narrative style  His writing reminds me of having a conversation with my maternal grandfather  who can make even the story of grass growing interesting through his idiomatic choice of words  Vonnegut s non linear narration tends to reveal the ending before the end of the first chapter  but nothing prepares you for the journey to Tralfamador that awaits  A truly spectacular novel  I was wandering in a bookstore when it caught my eye  I had some time to kill so I browsed through it  remembering how much I had enjoyed it when I had read it a few years earlier  Before I knew it I had devoured the entire book  yet again  Vonnegut manages to walk a remarkable tightrope of despair and delight throughout the entire story  Is a predetermined fate make for a meaningless existence or is there beauty and joy to be found within the hapless Pilgrim  This is the kind of story that anyone aspiring to become a writer should read  It is exceptionally unconventional  It bends your mind  and gets you to see that not all stories must be told in the same predictable manner  I have read a few other books by Vonnegut and they all carry the same unmistakable style   you are never quite sure where the writer is taking you  and at the end you realize that it really isn t the end that matters  but the journey that Vonnegut takes you on  Exceptional creativity  Al principio no tenia muchas expectativas leyendo el primer capitulo sin embargo a partir del segundo el libro se tine con matices de ciencia ficcion sin que llegue a ser tal y como lector lo toma a uno por sorpresa  Indaga temas como el viaje en el tiempo  y esas nociones de temporalidad muy bergsonianas  La narracion pasa por diversos puntos de vista y aunque es algo enrredada en ciertos pasajes siempre engancha con un sentido del humor que contrasta y aterriza lo absurdo del relato  So it goes  I firmly believe that everyone should read this book  preferably before they leave high school  The elements of  science fiction  in this book illustrate Billy Pilgrim s madness and  in turn  the author s own anguish at his experiences during the war  I love the gentle tone that Mr  Vonnegut uses as he describes terrible things  He expresses the horrors of the war  and the mind  without brutalizing the reader  in the end making it all the more wrenching  Not an easy read  but an excellent one  Even though this is Vonnegut s most popular book  I think it s his most popular for a reason  It s a tragic and humorous account of the effects of war on the mind of Billy Pilgrim as he becomes  unstuck  in time  his mind so warped by what he experienced in WWII that he is doomed to forever relive what he experienced in Dresen  Germany  This book makes the most convincing case against the concept of war as a solution to mankind s problems as it focuses on the psychic toll on the individual  So it goes   Re reading the book over 25 years after reading it originally  and after reading hundreds of other books I appreciate it even more  Vonnegut s comfort with voice is enviable and I can t help but wonder if he would have had more difficulty getting this book published if he submitted it today  It is strangely prophetic  joking that Reagan would run for president  I had forgotten the fun use of three musketeers as a candy bar and as a war crew  Still poignant and funny  Happily revisited     And so it goes  LOVE THIS BOOK  VONNEGUT   LITERARY GENIUS  As the cover will tell you  this book contains comedic language you dare not laugh at and fills you with tears you dare not shed  The classic satire that takes a dark look into one individual s life pre  through  and post WWII  For those looking for a different take on the war  or a wholly unique way of understanding it I recommend picking up S5  After completing  take a few days to let it digest and revisit some of the passages   Uno de los mejores libros que he leido en muchos anos  Directo  Transpira humor negro  So it goes  I loved the philosophy behind this entire story  It was definitely a good read and my response to this was  simply  there is no ending to the book  That s what s so great about it  So it goes   Epitomises the power of the anti war satire  brilliantly written  poignant  painful  hilarious  So it goes  Time travel  aliens  and how they see their universe in non linear fashion  which is how perhaps we should see ours  even though we can t  yet  time travel   the horrors of war  which are either to be ignored  and hence suffered successfully  or not   in which case the sufferer must go insane  and so on and on through our post war consumer society  This book is a classic forerunner of a lot  packed into a read of no more than one or two short sittings  I enjoyed it immensely  A modern classic  For the life of me  I cannot fathom why it took me so long to pick up this book  Now that I have  though  I wish I had done it sooner  because oh  It left me with that feeling of a good mental meal  where so many thoughts are simmering  waiting for a second or third stir to pull out all the details that might have been missed the first go round Wonderful  wonderful  This is going on my favorites and getting a re read ASAP   And maybe by then I ll manage a more thorough review    What a great  crazy book  While the nonlinear structure and the fatalistic tone get most of the attention  what I liked most is Vonnegut s turns of phrase  He has such a way with words and I often found myself chuckling at his inventiveness  even during the most dour points of the book  not a negative  the juxtaposition is intentional      I listened to the audiobook narrated by Ethan Hawk  Hawk wasn t bad  but not great  He seemed to be exasperated during the whole book   This is still one of my all time favorite books  Yes  it s weird  Different  Not at all what you would expect  Unless you ve read Vonnegut  then you know this is totally his style  I read this in college and was hooked  I continued to check out all his books from our college library and still came back to this one as my favorite  I think it is a book everyone should read  if anything  to expose yourself to his style  I love Vonnegut s way of making serious issues humorous in an absurd way  Impressive  poignant  and emotionally resonant  but never pretentious  Surprisingly funny  Vonnegut s minimalist prose style contrasts with the complex narrative structure as he delves into the inhumanity of man s machines to man  rather than the more typical man s inhumanity to man  A unique voice  Slaughterhouse Five was a stunning introduction to Vonnegut s oevure  I can t wait to read some of his other novels  such as Cat s Cradle and The Sirens of Titan  Utterly incredible  Told with a broken time effect  Vonnegut s novel is passive  nonsensical  powerful  and emotional all at once  Billy Pilgrim  and the other himself  remember the bombing of Dresden in WWII  but the book is much more than an anti war book  As the author writes  one might as well write an anti glacier book as he might write an anti war book   What he meant  of course  was that there would always be wars  that they were as easy to stop as glaciers  I believe that  too   This book is the perfect balance between comedy and intensity  Though the war stories are horrific  the time traveling stories from Billy Pilgrims past  present and future were entertaining  I will now be saying  so it goes  every time I hear of a death  This has always been my viewpoint on death  even though the person is no longer alive in the future  they are still alive in the past and in the present through the deeds they have done and memories of the lives they have touched  so it goes  The Children s Crusade   Slaughterhouse Five is absolutely brilliant and should be required reading for everyone on the planet  Five stars under rates this amazing masterpeice  As many have read it  it would be pointless to give any kind of overview  but the sentiments expressed in simple prose are universal and extremely important for humanity to consider  If you haven t read this book  read it now  If you have read this book  read it again  The cost of war is too high to ignore such truth   One of the most biting cases for peace I ve ever taken in  It s a ruthless destruction of any motivation for war through the lens of experience and absurdity  It blows my mind how be could do both  and without ever trying to shove it down the readers point  When I read it  I felt like I was only witnessing a story unfold  and that Vonnegut was letting me draw me my own conclusions  And he constructs this balance with humor  love and a completely unconventional storyline  but one that works   This was my first Kurt Vonnegut  Sorry if I misspelled that  book  and let me just say that it was good enough for me to fall in love with his style  His brief sentences  his satire  and his overall dark humor throughout the book captivated me  Once I started I couldn t stop reading  The story itself seemed as though it would be confusing  but  he made it so that it wasn t in the least  I don t know how he made a novel about being  unstuck in time  make sense  but  he managed it gracefully    A volte accendo la radio e ascolto un programma di Boston e di New York  che per non sia di musica  quando ho bevuto non sopporto la musica registrata   Billy si pass la lingua sulle labbra  riflett un momento e infine chiese  Perch proprio io     Questa  una tipica domanda da terrestre  signor Pilgrim  Perch proprio lei  Perch proprio noi  allora  Perch qualsiasi cosa  Perch questo momento semplicemente   Ha mai visto degli insetti sepolti nell ambra     A wonderful book to read and a great piece of literature  Very short and engaging  I very much enjoyed Vonnegut s style of writing  though I did not agree with the fatalist viewpoint of the Tralfamadorians  nor could I connect with the helpless passenger of circumstance that is Billy Pilgrim  As a side note   All this happened  more or less  is now one of my favorite lines from any book  and the constant refrain of  So it goes  after every mention of death is sad  yet in some way soothing   I really enjoyed this book  This was my first experience with Vonnegut and I m officially a fan  It s hard for me to explain why I liked it so much  It was a quick  easy read  It is well written and it evokes many different emotions  even humor  while being a book about war  The first chapter is very powerful in terms of setting the tone and the reader s expectations  Even the title is able to convey meaning and emotion  once you understand what it means  Highly recommended  So it goes  I love this book  First read it when I was very very young and the ramblings of Billy Pilgrim through time and space were  to me then  funny  tragic  sad  happy  all at the same time  His jumbled life     yes  Re reading this at age 50 plus  I realized     life is exactly like that  It even seems possible to be away from earth on tralfamadore now and then  Vonnegut genius  Don t worry about what a book means  Just read it  The meaning may not come to you til 30 or 40 years have passed   Vonnegut is loveable and sympathetic and sad  This one is excellent  as are Mother Night and Breakfast of Champions  I don t know who is the better writer  him or Toni Morrison  but one of them is the best we ve had since Faulkner  He starts this one with a non intro quasi chapter  which tells you how his story begins and ends  so I hope you won t mind if I tell you how it begins and ends  Here goes Listen  Billy Pilgrim has come unstuck in time     Po Tee Weet Read this book   An excellent read   fast paced  sharp as a knife and with the classically quirky Vonnegut wit  Arguably one of the greatest anti war novels of the 20th century  by arguably one of the greatest American novelists of the 20th century  Billy Pilgrim comes unstuck in time and lives his life with all the chronology of a Tarantino film  Though this kind of crosscutting between events in a character s life would often be difficult for many  Vonnegut does so with an elegant ease  I highly recommend it  Fantastic  I loved what Vonnegut said in the momoir section about his story of the bombings  He said that he d been working on the book for 20 years  that he d written over two thousand pages  but that the book  ultimately  was a failure  He stated   there is nothing intelligent to say about a massacre   From there  through the story of Billy Pilgrim  the prisoner of war  and Billy Pilgrim  the abducted by aliens dentist  Vonnegut told of his own experience of the Dresden bombings  So is Billy Pilgrim a veteran trying to escape the blue and ivory horrors of what he s seen in World War II  or was he truly abducted by the Tralfamadorians  who taught him how to cope with death  Whether you see it as purely sci fi or anti war or both  this book is a must read  I will say  I fell in love with the text based on Vonnegut s rambling intro about how he s going to write this book  I could read his pre writing experiences all day  It s a shame he s dead So it goes  On Slaughter House Five by Kurt Vonnegut Jr Look at and also read by Michael MercierThere s a way of seeing everything in any manner of way  Some perceptions might be considered psychotic  but then all perceptions might be psychotic also  Perhaps that s one of the psychotic one  This is what I personally found within these pages  If Kurt Vonnegut was still alive I might ask him the meaning  I m pretty sure he d tell me why I bothered reading such crap but I will never be sure So it go s    I tried to read this book once before and couldn t really get into it  This time  however  I read while listening to it as an audio book  and it sunk in Billy Pilgrim s non linear experience of time was a supremely interesting way to tell a story  It is unimportant whether he was sane or not  the commentary on humanity was made almost simplistic by juxtaposing different scenes from different times  My favorite part was definitely the war movie described with a new narrative in reverse  Just as good  if not better  the second time around  Vonnegut s prose is delicious  This is a f cking good one  Perfection  Wonderful read  It s witty in it s depressing content  It has the ability to tickle your funny bone whilst also making you realise the bleakness of the world  I m so glad that I ve read it  On to Breakfast of Champions  Amazing written story of a soldier s experience as a WWII prisoner  and his life afterwards  The timeline jumps around between the past  the present  and other places  Has great theories on the reality of time and on life and death  Quick  and just great  We all need to read this one  Moving  shocking and hilarious Credo che sia il libro piu bello sulla seconda guerra mondiale che io abbia mai letto   In a brilliantly crafted fragmentary narrative  the author takes us on a tragi comic journey through time and space with WW2 veteran  Billy Pilgrim  so that the the reader gets to visit 50s   60s Midwestern America  Dresden before and after it was firebombed and a zoo in distant Tralfamadore  The ultimate antidote to WW2 thrillers  John Wayne war movies  or bloodless military histories  this slim book has much to say on the real nature of war  religion and mortality  So it goes  Poo tee weet  Everything was beautiful and nothing hurt  took me twice to figure this book out  I know    I m slow  but I was learning brazilian jiu jitsu and going to church alot when I read it the first time  I think all subtleties were throttled out of my vision at theat point Anyhow  it is a wonderful vision  despairing while offering an idea or solution of how to cope  even if it is packaged in a ludicrous fashion   I really like an author who not only points out a flaw  but offers new solutions instead of simply critizizing   A postmodern  antiwar  meta   the author addresses his treatment of one of the most horrific massacres in European history  and science fiction novel follows Billy Pilgrim s odyssey through time  The fantastical  nonlinear narrative and existential sentiment as conveyed in phrases  So It Goes   the inevitability of death  and  Poo tee tweet    a question for which we have no answer  which follow the mention of death throughout the novel give expression to the senselessness of war  Not only was this story fantastic  but it was unique in it s story and content  offering a reading experience of  debatably  a masterpiece  Also  it seems to span many genres  part biography  part science fiction  part philosophy  etc   The author also has a uniqueness to his voice  and even a sense of humor  He even places himself in the novel in the middle of an unpleasant bowl movement  In the end  this novel certainly is bizarre  but it s not the type that makes you cringe   Vonnegut is the best   this is the third Vonnegut book I have read and he is quickly becoming my favorite author  I would rank this as one of the most unique and creative war novels ever  The book is certainly about the bombing of Dresden  but it comments on and captures a lot more  If you are looking for a shootem up war novel  this certainly isn t it  If you re looking for a clear perspective on war  life and the lightness of being this is your book Highly recommended     Such a bizarre and funny book  and I never believed that I would enjoy it  Now I ve read it some three times now  and I wrote my final thesis on it  Every time I read about Billy Pilgrim   his obscure trips to Tralfamadore I get something new out of it  Not so much a book about pacifism  but about war as something that s unstoppable  It will happen anyway  and that s just the way time is structured  Any book that can discuss an abstract idea like time so eloquently is worth a read  I ve reread this book  the last time that I ve read this book was when I was in summer school  and I believe that Kurt Vonnegut is a fantastic writer  Slaughterhouse 5 deceived me in terms of analyzing a book by it s cover    I even watched the movie   it felt different watching the movie instead of reading because Vonnegut uses metaphors  and loads of literary devices in which the mind can picture  and when you see a depiction of it as a movie  your whole perception just   changes  At just over 200 pages  Slaughterhouse Five says so much in such little space  Themes like time travel and alien abductions are mixed in with war  fate  and depression  creating a feeling that the latter are just as ridiculous as the former  Vonnegut uses allegories and lets the reader draw the conclusions  We re also left to wonder how much of the book is autobiographical  This is my 3rd Vonnegut novel  I ve also read many of his short stories  and he never ceases to amaze me  Light and dark and weird and moving   it was psychotic  halarious  depressing  and genious  I loved it  Wow  I had never read this book before  It s amazing  I will be thinking about it for a very long time  Recommended    Classic  I like Vonnegut for the same reason I like Stephen King   neither of them sugarcoat anything  Something that I really liked about this book is that there was no meandering or pointless text  I felt accomplished after reading it and I thought that the time travel dynamic worked unbelievably well  I would definitely recommended this regardless of what you like don t like I listened to the Ethan Hawke audiobook which you can find on youtube     Perfect voicing  One of my all time favorites  So glad I decided to re read it this year  AH yesse  verie goode  One of the best books i have ever read  It is an interesting story  but what i enjoyed most is the spicy humour and the way of placing his own point of view that Vonnegut has on this book  I really got touched and inspired by him  and could not agree more with his view of society  He is my current hero Of this book  i loved the time travelling resource to explore all the feelings and madness  I just wish that the book was bigger and that Theodore Trout were real   I loved this book  Vonnegut expertly fit a thousand pages of material into only 215 pages   Excellent A classic  Loved it  Takie dela  So it goes  Nominee  1970 Hugo Award for Best NovelNominee  1969 Nebula Award for Best Novel I really enjoyed this book  Then it ended and I was sad  So it goes   Brutal and wonderful  One of the best explorations of the theme that wars have no winners  There s not much more that can be said about this book that probably hasn t been said already and much more eloquently  I have assigned this book to my students two years in a row since as they all are looking to go to West Point  they need to see the opposing POV as expressed by individuals like  Kurt Vonnegut  Granted  most think he is a whiner or an idiot  but they get that into their skull and hopefully it sticks somewhere  If so  mission accomplished  A stellar irreverent rollick that takes the reader everywhere  An overwhelmingly sad central plot  but an acerbic Vonnegutian wit that gleans humor over a subject where humor is socially contraband Overall  a quick  easy read   densely packed with morose historic fiction  utterly original facetiousness  and time travel  Those three things cleverly slung together make a novel that only Mr  Vonnegut could have conjured and only the appreciative reader can enjoy  A second reading was definitely rewarding here  I also got to read it very quickly this time  taking only a handful of breaks  which was also worthwhile  Vonnegut is always good  and does a great job of demonstrating where sci fi can go places other genres can t  That idea may be presented most clearly in this book   A good runner up  of course  is Cat s Cradle     slkh khnh shmrh pnj   fSl hy khwthy drd   prgrf h w jmlh bndy h y jd z hm khh

What is so special about this book is that it is so writerly  The levels of artifice  all the strange strutural and linguistic devices employed  even the compellingly detached narrator all add up to create a great work of art about war  I found this more painful  funnier and angrier than any other book about war I ve read  Even if you are not interested in novels about war  this would be a deeply satisfying book to read  This is one of those books that I can honestly say changed my life  As I read the back and forth of the timeline  I found myself musing on time as a linear model or time as a circular model  or time as a circular and yet overlapping quantum kind of time  I had always felt out of place in linear time  and this book helped me to understand kairos and chronos finally once and for all  It has  since that time been on my list of books that everyone should  and indeed must read  2009 06 01Started reading this in a race to finish before Jim finishes Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance  This is an extremely unfair contest I am digging the conversation with Billy Pilgrim 2009 06 04Devoured this like a snake  It s great  what can I say that hasn t already been said about it  I haven t heard many people say that it s funny at times  which it is  I laughed out loud some  But generally burning people isn t all that lighthearted  Until his recent death  this was the classic story of the greatest living writer  Not sure who carries his torch now  but Kurt Vonnegut was an unappreciated genius  Most of his work borders on weird Science Fiction  as this one does  but his horrible experience as a POW in Dresden during the waning days of the European Theater of WWII is captivating in this book  It helps if you have an offbeat sense of humor as I do  but this is a classic that stands up for all time  I couldn t put this book down  With a background in psychology  I was very interested in how he described a character s symptoms of PTSD over a period of time without actually coming out and saying  he had PTSD   Vonnegut shows you what he wants you to know  he doesn t tell you  I will be reading any other books of his that I can get my hands on   An unconventional book by my standards  Absolutely like nothing that I have read before  The book focuses mainly on Billy Pilgrim who can travel through time which he learned how to do from aliens or tralfamadorians  It tells about the bombing of dresden but in a kind of unbiased sense because although the city was bombed billy continues on and sees dresden as it has been throughout time as the tralfamadorians do  I love this book and will most definitely reread it   With his usual casualness and hilariously droll tone Vonnegut will rip your heart out and show you your mind but you won t feel any pain you ll be laughing so hard    billy pilgrim came unstuck in time  This   at first   seemingly innocuous line must be one of the most resonant of twentieth century literature  You ll understand why when you ve read the book  My first Vonnegut novel  and my first science fiction novel  I was hooked from the first chapter  And up to this very moment  it s my favorite book  What s not to love  Vonnegut s simple writing with complex meanings  his distinctive characters  realistic plotlines that cross paths with the world of the Tralfamadorians  mentioning of historical background  and the connection I felt with this novel  Truly  it was a work of genius   Everything was beautiful and nothing hurt   This is one of my favorite books  Actually  I think it may tie with Cat s Cradle as my favorite  There are so many nuggets of wisdom worthy of meditation in here  communicated in such a silly and bizarre way  that I can t begin to comment on them  I recommend that you read one page of the book at random  If you don t like it  then don t read the book  Vonnegut is not for everyone  but for the people who like him  they LOVE him  You ll know within one page if you do  5 sterren  Zo gaat dat   I loved this a lot  An extremely powerful story told in such a unique way Brilliant piece of anti war literature  haunting details I won t be able to forget even if I chose to  that capture the unimaginable terror war inspires and the out landish utter insanity of its nature   couldn t imagine it could be executed so brilliantly  thourougly and amusingly in so few pages without ever becoming tiresome  boring or unnecessarily cynical  Tender and truthful  a work of art I would recommend to any human being with a soul and a conscience  Fantastic  Slaughterhouse Five is a novel that I will always carry in my heart and will always cherish as a book that changed my life I have no words  I loved it  It was brilliant and so well written  Every time I picked it up you d have to pry my eyes from the pages  Much thanks and love to my wonderful Aunt Martha for yet ANOTHER book that I loved immensely     3 I completely immersed myself in this book and loved every second of it  The question of whether Billy Pilgrim was actually  unstuck in time  or simply just insane is one that I continue to debate in my head  I love the ideas Vonnegut presents in this book and the fact that this novel makes you think about what you believe in  i e  fate vs  having control over your life  is something I m always looking for  I can t wait to read the rest of Vonnegut s writings  Funny  fast paced  biting and very intelligent  It has gentle nods throughout to science fiction that fans of the genre will love  The masterful quality of this book is the rendering of typically depressing or horrifying scenes into whimsical little snapshots that blink in and out of existence  The result is a culmination of images  recurring phrases and scenes that builds an uplifting aesthetic  one of appreciation of life and it s oh so fleeting nature   I read this on the way from Phoenix to San Diego  This is a brilliant sad  and easy to read work by Vonnegut  WW II is seen by many  including myself as a just war  However  in truth  modern war is always waged against the weak and defenseless  mothers  fathers  children  the elderly and the innocent suffer greatly regardless of the cause or justification  Vonnegut describes the horrors and aftermath of war with a sense of sad detachment  A true masterpiece  I thought this was a thought provoking book that was very well written and very imaginative  Vonnegut s flow was exceptional and he left you with the desire to read more  Some of the book was true  whereas other parts are fiction  His ability to weave fiction and truth is amazing  When I first started reading this book I did not realize the direction it would head  Also  I didn t realize that some of the events in this book are based on Vonnegut s own experiences  This is one book that I will recommend to anyone  It s short  it s got pictures  it s funny  and it deals with some pretty heavy topics all the while  A book that deals with war but doesn t glorify it  Vonnegut is one of my favorite authors  I have read several of his books but Slaughterhouse Five is my favorite  I had no clue about the Dresden bombings before I read it and I was just happy Vonnegut survived to wrote such a lovely book  A  for the old bastard  This is one of those books that takes multiple reads to understand  The words are heavyset with metaphor and character development  to the point that it tired me to read a few pages  It is entirely BECAUSE of this arduous journey that I love this book  Few pieces of literature dare to respect the intellect of their readers like Slaughterhouse does  It changes your entire perspective on war  death  humanity  and time  Well worth the mental and emotional investment  I read this book in high school  probably against the wishes of various conservative school board members  Apparently  knowlege about the bombing of Dresden was frowned upon  I thought it was one of the coolest books I d ever read at the time  I had to read this in English class and it was something I  actually  enjoyed  which is rare when you  have  to read something   I ve read some of Vonnegut s other work and it s all pretty good at worst  but this is his best  In league with Catch 22  but not as side splittingly hilarious  It s dark  but I didn t find it nearly as depressing as Cat s Cradle  There is a positive underlying message about learning to accept the things we can not control  In typical Vonnegut fashion  brilliantly deep and creative despite relatively simple prose  If you DON T consider this book anti war  I think you completely missed the point  44 years later  we re still fighting  And so it goes  The reason I love Vonnegut is that he does not tell us how things  are  or how they  should be   but how they  feel   He seems to believe that this is the only thing we can really teach each other  rather than a commandant list of Shalts and Shalt Nots  Vonnegut offers an undeniable  antididactic view of human experience which insists on empathy  smothers reactionary response  and drowns out rationalization  It is THE humanist artwork of the 20th century  I read this book  with absolutely no idea about its story  Vonnegut s a genius  and unlike proust he didn t have to write a 4k page tome to prove a point that in the folds of time is where we all will end  Billy Pilgrim you poor soul  I d recommend it to anyone who wants to be amazed and end up with a bittersweet aftertaste  Funny  dark  and a must read  wish I had read it earlier  but I guess it s alright to have read it now that I can comprehend it better   Excellent   Vonnegut uses satire and creates interesting characters to share his story of the effects of war and destruction on soldiers and people  The setting is WWII and after  The main character Billy Pilgrim narrates the story through his experience as a POW during the war and in his fantasy world Tralfamadore due to post traumatic stress  It is sad  humorous  and thought provoking in the futility and responsibility of war  I highly recommend this book  So  I ve never read any Vonnegut  but this was on my list of  Classics I Really Should Have Read but Haven t  I read it  And loved it  Actually can t wait to read more Vonnegut This book is my aunt s favorite  which means I should have read it sooner  She s got great taste in literature  The way this book is structured grabbed me from the start  I always appreciate a book that s not structured linearly  And this one is fantastic Seriously  Read this  Beautiful  Excellent ant war commentary disguised as an interesting story  The concept of free will and pre determination  two of Vonnegut s favorite topics  are utilized in a unique way to press his point about the inevitability of war amongst the human race   Re read this book  first read in 2007 when I was 19  now reading in 2012 when I am 25   I love it now  Again  another example of not having enough life experiences to relate to a book when I was younger   not that I am old now  just wiser I do agree with the blips on the back from Life and The new York Times  about it being  a funny book at which you are not permitted to laugh  A sad book without tears   Some parts were so horrifying and others very funny   A classic writing often surprises me by its depth and the way it presents itself  And the story often turns out differently from what I would have conjured from reading the title  This book at least answered one of my puzzles about people s fascination with science fiction  It goes like this  So they were trying to re invent themselves and their universe  Science fiction was a big help   Agree with the review on its back cover  a sad book without tears    tak to chodi   Najboljsa knjiga Kurta Vonneguta doslej  Najbrz zato  ker se po prebranih treh knjigah v tej razloci marsikatero znacilnost  ki je prej ne opazis  Povezovanje zgodb med seboj v knjigi in med knjigami je mojstrsko  vmes Kurt navrze se opis svojega pisateljevanja  Trout ni znal pisati  imel pa je dobre ideje  Obcutek  ki preveva marsikoga  morda res tudi Kurta  In Kurt je Kilgorov shadow writer ali obratno  kdo ve  Noro dobra knjiga  nujno za prebrat  Serendipitously finished on Vonnegut s birthday  Definitely a quick read  Few books have given me such pause after reading  I m torn between a distaste for what I perceive is the overall message and an appreciation for the meta fictional manner in which the story develops  Reading it s quickly only made me want to start again from the beginning to figure it out more  Devastatingly sad and less funny than I had been told  but nonetheless very moving   This book remains one of my favorites for it s matter of fact take on life  war  time travel  and death  So it goes  Bizarre and convoluted but kinda ingeniously brilliant  Time travel   aliens   WWII       I don t know why I haven t read this book before   This is such a powerful story  exploring what is basically the main character  Billy Pilgrim s post traumatic stress  after barely surviving WWII and the bombing of Dresden  The story flows back and forth as Billy believes himself cut adrift in time and space and it is here that the dark tragedy of war is so poignantly explored  A dark and deeply moving book  definitely one I will revisit in the future  Gripping saga of world war two  There are no heroes or villains  just people caught up in a painful situation and trying hard to stay alive  some not even wanting to do that  One can call it a anti war book because it captures the impact of wars on ordinary people s life   even those who manage to stay alive suffer for the rest of their life  The writing style is so gripping it is hard to put it down once you start getting into the flow of the story   One of the most amazingly well written books I have read  Very Vonnegut  Scattered enough to put the reader into the mind of this veteran narrator  and short enough to keep our attention  Slaughterhouse Five is a powerful statement  Perhaps even more so in the post war reintegration into civilian life  but also in the exploration of WWII in Europe  The desensitization of death at first seemed heavy handed  but eventually became a very effective tool in pointing out how desensitized the reader may already be  So it goes   A great book that I will probably return to again at some point this year  Billy Pilgrim s complexities of character are currently beyond my comprehension  So it goes  That and I really want to read England Made Me  God grant me serenity to accept the things I cannot change  courage to change the things I can  and wisdom always to tell the difference  Even slammed in an Oxford comma  Until next time Kurt  Breakfast of Champions is on my list  Kurt Vonnegut holds a special place in my heart  and yet somehow I had never read his most famous book  There is so much perspective and humor in this short novel  It places it is more poetic than anything  And I d quite like to have four dimensional vision  but wouldn t we all    Mr  Vonnegut reminded me of two things while I was reading this  that humor is perhaps the most powerful tool humans possess and that we never really die  So it goes   I taught this book to first year undergraduates at Queens University Belfast and  previous to this  met Vonneghut at the Cheltenham Literary Festival  where he gigged with Gore Vidal  in 1998  The book is a brilliant mix of satire and sciebce fiction and the shift from the real to the surreal prefigures a lot that is great in later science fiction including Nigel Kneale s Kinvin  Ian banks  The Bridge and both British and US versions of LIFE ON MARS Wow  Amazing  I Hated this book and yet I loved it  It was horrible to read but it was amazing to examine the skill with which it was written  War is horrible  but  It has been said that for evil men to accomplish their purpose it is only necessary that good men should do nothing    Charles Frederic Aked  Should we just stand by and let evil win because war is horrible  of course we can t so there will always be war  because there will always be evil  I immediately loved this book as I began reading it  It s hard to put a genre on this book but I would have to say comedy war science fiction inspirational  There was so much to love about this book and the story is so amazing  It kept me laughing and guessing with every chapter  The story continues to get more intriguing as it goes on and the message in the book is so great  Everyone needs to read this book and everyone will enjoy it  Guaranteed  There isnt much to say about this book that hasnt already been said  I have heard for a long time how great Vonnegut is so I decided to pick this book up  I feel like for someone to really enjoy the book they need to have a somewhat working knowledge of the bombing of Dresden  I having heard that before read up on the event before starting this book  I have to say that I enjoyed every minute of the book  It wont be the last Vonnegut novel I read  A masterpiece of dark humour that encompasses a fantastic tie dye view of war  Slaughterhouse   five was is an incredible landmark in my readings  Vonnegut ties everything together so gracefully  from the impossible time travel of Billy Pilgrim  to the anit war sentiment he creates  to the meaningless of life  I highly recommend this book to readers who are interested in deep thinking concerning human emotion  morallity  and heroism unbridled by society I picked this book up after hearing it referred to on a tv show  of all places  I had never before read a Vonnegut book although I had heard the name  Slaughterhouse Five   This book fits into the line of books that I ve been reading lately that says  re think everything you take for granted   I really enjoyed this book  Immediatley after finishing it I was compelled to research the firebombing and to tell my husband as much as I could find out   This book blew me away  I had been aware of it for a good while but never really thought about reading it  I remember reading it the first time and when I came to the end just wanting to read it again  I can t think of any other book that has sparked this reaction in me  The only way I managed to stop myself was to jump online and buy a couple other Vonnegut books  The writing is great and the story original and I look forward to reading it again   I would have to confess to not getting it  Specifically  I don t get why this is lauded as a classic of literature  I understood the themes  purpose  plot  and where it was meant to be funny  though I don t recall actually considering it funny at more than one or two occasions   I just   don t get it  Perhaps it s a generational thing  or I m simply too cynical for my own good  Feel free to explain it to me if you think there s something I m missing  This was the first book i read  or actually re read  after my father died  I choose this book for several reasons  First  it was my father who first introduced me to Vonnegut back when I was in high school  Secondly  because of it s unusual take on death  in this book  time is not linear  It is a series of scattered moments  Therefore  when you re dead  you were simply doing better at other moments   everything was beautiful and nothing hurt    Kurt Vonnegut was not just a great American author  he was also a veteran of World War II  He served in the US Army  and this book is his memoir of when he was captured by German forces and kept as a prisoner of war in Dresden  Germany  He tells the story in graphical detail of what it was like for him when the Germans dragged him and other POWs out to force them to help clean up the city after it had been fire bombed by the Allied forces  Brilliant  Vonnegut at his very best  Was one of my favorite books that I am glad I read  At first it is difficult to stay focused with all the changes  Very good book  I recommend you read Amazing  Really good  Never read Vonnegut before so didn t know what to expect This is laugh out loud funny in the main  V easy to read and v entertaining  I really chimed with the determinism and the time theory most of which i go along with  So good I started re reading it immediatly  and  strange to say enjoyed it more because there are elements at the start that only make sense in the context of later informationRecommended to all I love this book  I can t wait to buy my own copy  There s space and time travel  The inevitability of life and death  I can t believe I waited this long to read it  I can t wait to suggest Slaughterhouse Five to other people   I loved this book  I loved it so much I went right back to the start and read it again after I finished it the first time  Will be reading more books by Kurt Vonnegut for sure     Luminous   Brilliant Man this is good  My favorite by Vonnegut by so far  It s crazy to think books like Breakfast of Champions were written years and years after this  Slaughterhouse Five being ridiculously better This is one of those books I can read again and again and it s better each time  Since reading this I ve really wanted to visit Dresden  maybe one day I will My Youtube  Completely irrelevant to books  https   www youtube com user TriWingz    Billy Pilgrim got himself unstuck in time and managed to survive being firebombed in Dresden 1945 and hijacked to planet Tralfamadore and marriage to silver screen sex bomb Montana Wildhack and  Oh Billy  I m going to lose weight just for you  the horrible accident that took his wife   Don t settle for the movie version  friends  because the book is a lot deeper and you ll never forget Paul Lazzaro now  will you   You better not   A really brilliant novel  I picked it up after reading Cat s Cradle and enjoyed it emmensly  Vonnegut is funny  brilliant and makes more sense then most other things  His look at war is at times funny and sad  as is life in general  Probably my favorite thing ever written on war  since Vonnegut has more or less the same beliefs on war  that it s a dirty messy thing  but I tend to have more belief that we can get out of it at some point  I don t know why it took me so long to read this book  I had read a handful of other Vonnegut books and adored all of them  but this one just never came to the front of my reading list  Finally  I got a copy in my hands and just devoured it  Vonnegut s style and sense of time are fantastic and invigorating  and about his treatment of the horrors of war  all that can be said has been said  I d highly recommend this to anyone  without exception   This was my first taste of Vonnegut and along with Thurber inspired my writing and in many ways ideals  In this book he presented an anti war message in a sci fi motif in such a way that even if a person didn t get the message he was trying to convey  at least the reader got an interesting and entertaining story  Because of his experience of the fire bombing of Dresden  this also has a very personal touch that really adds to the impact   This is one of the greatest novels I have ever read  Parts science fiction  social commentary  a war novel  and a dark comedy  this unlike anything you have ever read  In other words  it s Kurt Vonnegut  This is highly recommended to anyone I know who wants a novel that will challenge their boundaries and try a unique experience in reading  SERIOUSLY  READ THIS ONE BEFORE YOU DIE  So it goes   EVEN IF IT MEANS IT S THE LAST THING YOU DO   when one said war  novel  the first thing used to come to mind was  All quite on the western front  other remark staff  or  farewell to arms and something like that   But now I think the best book I have read on revealing the true essence of war  its stupidity and its inevitability  It not only shows how horrible  cruel and human war is  but also how discouragingly useless it is  It should be obligatory to read the book in any army  On the second read this got even better  It is such a disjointed thing of beauty  The imagery is top notch and what Vonnegut chooses to show us is perfect  I wish he didn t say  So it goes  so dang much though  Cutting that repetitive tool out would elevate this book even further  I am generally pretty unwilling to sit through war novels because I feel like I ve heard all of it before  but Slaughterhouse is  if nothing else  different  Vonnegut s masterpiece  I first came across Vonnegut in high school  reading the play version of Welcome to the Monkey House  I read this book after watching the TV show LOST  Seeing that this book was an inspiration for a character s journey in the TV show  Billy Pilgrim is unstuck in time  Moving from a prisoner of war to being stuck in a human zoo on an alien world  this novel is full of humor and has left an indelible mark on pop culture   A modern day classic that deals with a number of themes  chief among them the horrors and absurdity of war  The book has to do with the arguably cynical Allied bombing of Dresden near the end of World War II  Vonnegut was actually on the ground at Dresden during the air raids  as he d been captured by German troops  His job was to collect dead bodies in between rainfalls of incendiary bombs  Slaughterhouse Five might be Vonnegut s best book   Even better than I remembered  One of the best parts has to be the time traveling description of experiencing World War II backwards  planes putting bombed out cities back together  flying home  soldiers turning in their uniforms and enrolling in high school  and returning the bombs to factories where they re disassembled and turned back into minerals  which are in turn buried in deep mines where they won t be found How do I not own this book  I read this book a really long time ago  but it is fantastic  It s beautiful and surreal  The quintessential Vonnegut here  one of his best works  They did make a movie out of it  and the movie isn t so bad  It s a little hard to follow  but it s a fairly decent adaptation  The book s way better  though  I think it s loosely based on real events   Vonnegut was serving in Dresden when it was bombed  I could be wrong  don t quote me here   Enjoyed this book  I have been on a quest to read some classics that people continuously talk about  I do not expect much from classics as I liked few when I had to read them in school  This book proved to be funny and serious at the same time  It is a different type of view story when it comes to war  The characters are portrayed in a way that I can visualize each  I felt as though I was with the soldiers seeing everything happen   An amazing book  A story where everything is happening all at once for an eternity  This makes it even harder to form a solid review  The protagonist is an American prisoner of war who stood by when Dresden was bombed  But don t confuse this with a war novel  it s not  He has flashbacks to his future and past life  As silly as it may sound  it s probably the best description of this book you ll get from me  BTW  Aliens included  Listen All this happened  more or less  I read Slaughterhouse Five when I was a young teenager and it was the greatest thing ever  I stole it from a high school classroom  No one was executed  I don t steal things anymore  Not even books  So it goes I re read this in my late twenties  older and wiser and still filled with resentment  This story is the most wonderful piece of literature that ever was  is or will be  And so on  Wow  Can t believe how much I liked this book  I m also surprised that I hadn t already it  Going to have to start reading more Vonnegut  The definitive anti war novel Everything was beautiful and nothing hurt  One of my favorites  I ve read it often and will return again soon  Finished it in one sitting  and I still can t stop thinking about it  I think I m going to buy it for myself  originally read school copy   This was so awesome  Vonnegut used sci fi and some well placed humor to talk about some very serious topics and memories from WW2  Billy creates this experience that he was kidnapped by aliens that see in 4 dimensions to cope with all the death and trauma he witnessed  Since they see everyones lifespans all at once death doesn t bother them since that is how that moment must always be but they are alive in other moments  So it goes  Unexpected This books captivated me from the beginning to the end  And exhilarating experience of war  time travel and aliens   Time Travelswritten as music with immeasurable time measured  with unstructured structured  SF is an etude of what it s like to be Billy Pilgrim  people never die but live through the verses and refrains of WW II  of jive in the 1920s  and of square dances in country barns  It s otherworldly and down to earth in turns  the melody will echo in your mind long after the song has been sung  I hated for the music to end  Gets better every time you read it  I love Vonnegut  and I loved this book  This is the first novel of his that I ever read  He is such an honest writer  I feel like he captures life  horrible  disgusting  hilarious  happy  sad  beautiful  strange  I loved this alternate look at WWII  especially Vonnegut s cameo  is it a cameo if it s in a book   when the soldiers are all in severe intestinal distress after their first decent meal in weeks  Anyways  great book   when i read it in high school  I thought it was a wild  wacky pie in the face of convention  I read it again a few years ago  and it now it seems so clearly the tale of a man   the writer   struggling  and failing  to recover from trauma sam shepard said something about his dad s generation  who had all fought in WWII as having been all broken in some way that no one has ever acknowledged  this book is of a piece with that   This book is so wonderful  and so very disturbing  I don t like war stories  and when I first started reading it  I got a little nervous  But I ve realized it s not a war and death story  but a life story  And it is so bizarre  I can t wait to finish it 11 12   Wow  This book is kind of a mind fuck  I really  really liked it  but I don t know that I could accurately describe it to someone in telling them to read it  Just wow  This is my all time favorite book  I finished it at 10 00 on a friday night  and started reading it again when I woke up saturday morning  not the whole thing just sections  My only warning to those who have yet read it is that the first chapter drags a little because the story begins at chapter 2  chapter one is more of an introduction  This is the only book that when I see a bad review of it I think  how can that be posible   I have been on a streak of some absolutely great books lately   this is no exception  Absolutely fantastic on many different levels  as a novel but it could also be taken as the manifesto for a philosophy that could help one get through the toughest times  Bizzarre  exciting  anti war statement  but also an ode to life  with a final message that states  even if I ll live forever  I will be glad to be living through some great moments   So it goes  Poo Tee Weet  An Anti war book  You might as well write an  anti glacier  book I judge a book by the number of memorable lines and images it etches in my mind  You will find few books with as much vivid imagery   Dresden fire bombing  Human zoo on a distant planet  Nor will you find many books with the social impact and perspective of such a keen observer of the human spirit as Vonnegut  Good stuff  So dark  twisted and intriguing  Every time I read this book I find something new to marvel at  laugh at  or wonder about  Vonnegut was truly a master of dark humour and Slaughterhouse Five is  in my humble opinion  one of his best  Listen  Billy Pilgrim has become unstuck in time  and you will find yourself unstuck as when you read this book you ll wonder where the time has gone  It s that hard to put down  So it goes  Poo tee weet  Devastating  I did not know 135k people died in Dresden nor that it was called the  Florence of the Elbe  nor did I know that Vonnegat was actually there  It seems as if he couldn t make sense of it  that life just IS and it won t change     So it goes   The first chapter starts with KV trying to figure out how to get the story down  it was devastating  Then comes the crazy story with aliens and time travel and of course the war   I love Vonnegut s ability to make you question whether or not his books are supposed to be funny  then make you laugh twice as hard when it doesn t matter  Of course  you question it because there s a whole serious mess taking place amidst the dry humor  which makes it so great  This book in particular switches effortlessly from the ridiculous to the unimaginably  true   WWII   drawing an interesting parallel between the two  I read this for a comparative lit class in college  during the Vietnam War  and weeping in different parts  I was also disturbed by my fellow students who found it funny  I guess I didn t feel like laughing at the dark humor  I remember in the description of the fire bombing of Dresden the women who in trying to escape the fires went to rail road water tower and were boiled to death  A must read for those who think is a virtue  This was one of my favorite books now  I find Vonnegut s style of writing to be extremely interesting  It is one of the best books that conveys the realness of flashbacks associated with PTSD  and he does it with aliens  which seems difficult to pull off  but it works  I recommend this book to everyone  although the beginning does start off a bit slow  in my opinion  so be prepared to push through the first twenty pages or so   If you need one of your Goodreads friends to tell you Slaughterhouse Five is good  then you re beyond help  I will say  though  that returning to this book was a pleasure    I worried it was one of those things I liked as an adolescent  like certain Tom Robbins novels  but would find really lame as an adult  I did not  though  In fact  I think I liked it even more as a 31 year old nerd than I was capable of as a 14 year old nerd  First time I ever read this book  and definitely not what I was expecting  In fact  Vonnegut refuted all my assumptions within the first chapter    and then things got weird  Very breezy reading  with many pearls of wisdom I keep reflecting on even now  I suppose I m also partial since I have an interest in modern German history  and the book is ostensibly about the fire bombing of Dresden   along with everything else   So it goes  Slaughterhouse 5 is a darkly satirical  yet deeply philosophical novel  Not only is the story and plot enjoyable  but Vonnegut also expertly interweaves philosophical objections about time  free will  war  and death   so it goes   within the pages  Vonnegut s approachable prose also allows for a hilarious and thought provoking read  Slaughterhouse 5 is immensely enjoyable and a contemporary classic that will last throughout the ages  WOw  this is way in back memory  but the small place that houses the memory of this book is a warm one  I remember the Tralfalmadores or  doreans   and that it confused me how it turned from Dresden to a zoo on some other planet  I was like   What  How d that just happen   And I remember reading it over and over again just to make sure I didn t miss anything  But 6th grade as a whole was kind of confusing  like puberty in that way    Read this while in the London Airport  My first Vonnegut book and am in love  I m very picky about the types of humor that I enjoy  especially in literature  and for me this was it  It s humor that both makes you think and tugs at your heart  I felt like I both learned something  and my creativity was stimulated  His use of metaphor is remarkable  It was like reading the work of a highly intelligent 6 year old  Absolutely loved  This was the first book I ever read by Kurt Vonnegut and it made him become my favourite writer I don t think this is his best book but it should be read first as it gives a great background to him as a young soldier in Dresden during the second world I find Vonnegut s writing beautiful   it is succinct and seemingly simple but is incredibly powerful at the same time  I urge everyone to read this and go onto to read the rest  Slaughter house 5 is a must read Vonnegut  It skillfully blends black humour and satire to portray the life of titular character Billy and the impact of the Dresden bombing experience on him  The sardonic and light hearted tone in the novel is a stark contrast to the heart of message  one that is serious and attempts to conjure a change in perception of the war  A reading of the novel will no doubt leave you a pacifist for life  My favorite author and one of my favorites by him  It was the first Vonnegut I read and am pleased that after so much time it still packs a wallop  In his unique darkly comic style  Vonnegut gives us a book full of thought provoking fun  deep thoughts lurking in wild fantasy and a wonderful anti hero in Billy Pilgrim  I rarely read books more than once  but I will return to this one again and trust that it will still resonate  There are three fascinating points in this fantastic book 1  The Tralfamadorian Weltanschauung and their remarks on the nature of time  meditations on how one can come unstuck in time  and on how everone is alive somewhere at sometime  despite being not physically philosophically deep  have not been void of joy 2  The banality of mankind and his tepid reactions to cruelties of war 3  Billy s absurd death by Paul Lazzaro  Still my all time favorite Vonnegut novel  though probably just because it was my first  Many people swear by Cat s Cradle or Breakfast of Champions  though they usually inform me that those were their first Vonnegut books too  This one is also special in that it is often one of the three books considered to be the holy trinity of literature to come out of WW II  along with Mailer s The Naked and the Dead and Heller s Catch 22   Just finished this yesterday  10 16 07   A classic that deserves the classification  Billy Pilgrim was Forest Gump 30 years early  although not a Gump style dunce  Rather  an innocent at the mercy of the forces of time and history  Peters out a bit at the end  but otherwise a thought provoking novel Illustrates why war is Hell   and how Vonnegut  understandably  never got over his experience in Dresden  So it goes   One of the best books I have ever read    Slaughterhouse Five  is short but extremely profound  It s a cynical  sad and paradoxical cry against the war and its brutality  Vonnegut uses his prose like poetry  giving you a series of imeges as gifts for your thinking  Billy Pilgrim is one of the most human character I ve had the pleasure to encounter in my literary trips  This is a book you have to leave on your nightstand just to re read some pages every now and then  So it goes  Great book  This was my first Vonnegut book but I will be picking up some others      The mind of Kurt Vonnegut is complex and unique  as exemplified in this extraordinary novel  I found myself torn between many emotions and conflicting thoughts  and I felt so much more at one time than I thought possible  The simplicity of the sentences and language belied the turmoil and subject matter involved in the story  Overall  it was an incredibly thought provoking book that I would definitely love to reread  Kurt Vonnegut never fails to grip me with his unique writing style and his careful blend of  reality  and sic fi  Combined with the crossover characters and elements in each of his books  I find myself feeling enriched with each novel I complete  If you know zero about the bombing of Dresden  which was me before I read this   it s a great way to educate yourself upon the topic whilst enjoying a fascinating piece of fiction   It is so short and jumbled and jangled  Sam  because there is nothing intelligent to say about a massacre  Everybody is supposed to be dead  to never say anything or want anything ever again  Everything is supposed to be very quiet after a massacre  and it always is  except for the birds  And what do the birds say  All there is to say about a massacre  things like  Poo tee weet   One of the greatest anti war books   Second best book in the world  My favorite book  Read for  20th Century American History  in high school  and elective class with the best teacher in the school that should have been a full year instead of only a semester  I loved Billy Pilgrim s horribly banal and incredibly imaginative life and how he himself makes no judgement on it  just lives through it  every moment at any time  I need to read more Vonnegut  but I think this will remain my favorite of his books  I would never choose to read a book about the war  but  Slaughterhouse Five  is written very differently and would never cut it as a history book  Kurt Vonnegut  took a very tragically serious war experience and transformed it into a dark comedy about time travel  the war and aliens from planet Tralfamadore  I laughed  I cried but mostly  I enjoyed reading my first of Kurt Vonnegut s books and plan on reading more  It is a strongly satirical anti war piece about Billy Pilgrim who gets  unstuck in time  and simultaneously goes through different phases of his life which include living on another planet  Tralfamadore   having two wives and bombing of Dresden  Reminiscent of _Catch 22_  It was wonderful  and wonderfully read by Ethan Hawke  Then  at the end there is an interview with  very old by then  Vonnegut  and a fragment of the movie  Vonnegut clearly loved the world so much  and hated what it continued to become  His short stories tell that story too  but here  it s a beautiful  melancholy  terrible kind of dream that moves through time shows the reader the confusion  strange moments of beauty  and despair of the war  encapsulated in the decimation of Dresden  a city so beautiful that its ruins were described as pieces of lace strewn about  So it goes  This book   I can t even begin to explain it and how it is now easily a favorite I feel like I m being told this crazy story by an old grandpa   that this guy has suffered so much and the things that we do is sad and unavoidable because we keep repeating our actions over and over again  There are so many hidden things in this book that I will one day read this again and again  I can t even begin to explain this book  this book was one of the great books of the first half of this century  unlike a lot of the modern writers like Faulkner Woolf and Joyce Vonnegut was easy and fun to read with out compromising the revolutionary nature of his writing  the book is a continual barrage of tangent passages using alien imagery and good prose evoke a story of tragedy irony and aliens  Any one who hasn t read this book already needs to read it   A strong  moving  often funny and often sad portrait of the impact of war on everyone it touches  He wrote that he subtitled it  The Children s Crusade   because World War II  like all wars  was always fought by children I will always be grateful that I once heard Kurt Vonnegut talk while he was still among us  he was funny  wise  and concerned and outraged by a lot of what he saw going on in the world and our country  Well  it was the first time I was introduced to the late Kurt Vonnegut  Unfortunately I never got to realize my dream of stalking him in NYC  but maybe I will stalk him later  in another life  It is in my top five books  We had to read it for class and I was literally the only one who liked it  That s AP English for you I guess  I would like to read it again soon just to pay tribute to my love  Kurt  RIP   Wow  After the overwhelming mourning and praise for Vonnegut after he died in April I thought I should actually read some of his books Slaughterhouse Five instantly became one of my favorite books  The way Vonnegut braids his story telling with science fiction and character development really made an impression on me  It was an enlightening experience across the board  as all Vonnegut s books have become to me thus far  The five stars are given based on how I felt the first time I finished reading this  maybe twenty years ago  when I sat on my bedroom floor and cried and cried because I had been laughing so hard through out the book  not expecting the last sentence  I won t share it here I just read this a second time and did not cry  maybe because I knew what was going to happen  I still laughed and I still felt aches in my heart  I absolutely adored this book  The different philosophies Vonnegut addresses are absolutely fascinating  especially the philosophy of the Tralfmadorians  Though Vonnegut is known to be a complicated author to read  I found Slaughterhouse Five a fairly easy story to follow  Though I haven t read many other Vonnegut books  I might suggest starting with Slaughterhouse Five if you are new to reading Vonnegut  Happy reading   And I say to Sam now   Sam here s the book   It s so short and jumbled and jangled  Sam  because there is nothing intelligent to say about a massacre  Everybody is supposed to be dead  to never say anything or want anything ever again  Everything is supposed to be very quiet after a massacre  and it always is  except for the birds  And what do the birds say  All there is to say about a massacre  things like  Poo tee weet     This novel is never not interesting  I love that it explores time from a different stand point to how it is perceived  It s a very measured approach and quite appropriate to real life physics As much as Billy must be a really despondent person to know  the span of his life  as it always was  as it always will be  as it always is  is beautiful and poetic So it goes  I loved this book and so on     Vonnegut s dark humor and cautious humanism really impacted my psyche while I was reading Slaughterhouse Five  Without being too heavy handed  Slaughterhouse Five explores such topics as nuclear warfare  ecological destruction  and human existence in a delicate manner  If you don t mind being constantly reminded of human imperfection  this novel is the perfect way to put your life into historical and human context  Loved this book  It seems more like the philosophical rantings of the author than any particular plot  I really liked his writing style  it was different to anything else I ve read  and it felt unique  I also enjoyed the story of Billy s life and the concept of being unstuck in time  I ve always known that time is a man made concept  this book just portrayed that messages in an interesting and exciting way   A deceptively simple but incredibly complex novel  requiring you to think over it at length once you ve finished  This was my first Vonnegut novel  I was drawn in from the very beginning  Vonnegut s ability to pull readers in and keep them coming back for more is astounding  I ve never considered myself much of a sci fi reader  so I wasn t sure I would enjoy Slaughterhouse Five  But it s so much more than a war novel  or a sci fi novel  It s an experience  I m picking up Cat s Cradle next  hopefully I like it just as much  I first read this when I was going through every Kurt Vonnegut book in the library  He was one of my favorites the summer I graduated from high school but I don t think this particular book stood out for me at the time  I reread this one about three years ago  however  and I have to say it is one of the most moving books I have ever read  especially reading his introduction to it for the 25th Anniversary Edition  This is the book that is my stock answer to the inevitable question  So what s your favorite novel  I ve read it every couple of years for over three decades now  and I ve never grown tired of it I think that what I like most about Slaughterhouse Five is that on one level it is so light  so free  so easy to read  Yet on another level it is so profound and so moving I really miss Kurt Vonnegut  So it goes  Confession  I liked this book so much as an undergraduate that I am afraid to read it again for fear that it might not hold up  And yet there are so many images  scenes  jokes  and  yes  even drawings from this novel that remain with me still  How can I not reward that with 5 stars  Not to mention  it could be argued that Vonnegut pretty much invented the whole funny sad thing  And I love that thing   When I first started this and was hit with it s basic absurdities  not that I was surprised by them as it s known as an absurdist classic  I groaned and thought   oh  I m not gonna like this   But as I fell into its rhythm and was confronted with sad  ironic truth after sad  ironic truth I found that in the end I loved it  On a side note  this version is read by Ethan Hawk  who does and excellent job of narrating   A great book worth reading at least twice  The main character Billy Pilgrim has become  unstuck in time   and the book moves back and forth throughout Billy s life  including his experience as a POW during the bombing of Dresden and as a zoo exhibit on the planet Tralfamadore  The absurd humor and resigned tone of Slaughterhouse five belie the horror of war and the bombing of Dresden that are at its center  My God  this is without a doubt my new favorite book  Although at times it can be  blegh  and nearly unreadable  like Kilgore Trout s novels  it is still brilliant in its dramatic timing  delivery  and stream of consciousness  And begin playing  I don t care  I love it   to describe how I feel about this book  as I do not care what anybody thinks that is saying that it is a bad book  because it is wonderful  Mi sento instabile nel tempo  Mi siedo  Prendo la mia copia di Slaughterhouse Five tra le mani  Lo leggo da sinistra a destra e poi lo rileggo nel senso opposto  E un romanzo su un uomo che scrive un romanzo di guerra sulla Seconda Guerra Mondiale  Letto al contrario fa piu o meno cosi Continua a leggere la mia non recensione  qui  http   www arturorobertazzi it 2012 0    One of my absolute favorite books  Maybe it s because we read both of them in the same year of high school  but I can t help comparing this to Catch 22  Both address the absurdity and monstrosity of war  but this does it in about 1 4 of the space  manages to stay very funny throughout  and is inventively structured I read this book every year or so  just to remind myself of what it says  It s that good  Fantastic  Vonnegut uses science fiction to convey his experiences in the war through someone else s eyes in quite a comical way  This book left me thing about fate and free will  I enjoyed his concept of time  and it left me wondering if that could be true  This book made me laugh and reflect on many new concepts to me  I liked it so much I even wrote a pretentious review  I think that s something  Kudos  Kurt   OK  this is the one where Billy keeps jumping back in time to the Dresden bombings  while at the same time being like a Connecticut insurance salesman  The Trafalmagorians are to blame for pretty much everything  though  because they  in their alien screwballishness  beamed down to Earth and screwed up the whole Jesus story  So  this whole time people have just been all fucked up over a big alien  woops   episode   Great book that shows the life of a World War II veteran in a somewhat witty light  With humor that you feel bad for laughing at and sadness that doesn t make you cry  this book is a literary work of art  Time travel  aliens  and a veteran who relives the moments of his life knowing full well how each moment will end  Fantastic novel  amazing literary technique  I ve been made a fan of Kurt Vonnegut from page 1  I enjoyed how the sad  likely  delusional  and often dull life of the main character was perfectly suited to the non sequential method of telling the story  The many cleverly worded and uniquely conceptualized quips made for writing worth dwelling on  Unlike many of the other shorter classic books I ve read along these lines  this story wasn t under written or left lacking  it was concise but well rounded out      passing into death  which was violet light  There wasn t anybody else there  or anything  There was just violet light and a hum  So it goes  War movie played backwards till the bombs were unmade  So it goes  Well  here we are Mr  Pilgrim trapped in the amber of this moment  There is no why  Billy Pilgrim s psychic break manifest itself as himself reporting to be a time traveler in his own life   I ve read quite a few of KV s books and always found his humor clever  but never quite understood the reverence that some have for him    until I finally got around to reading Slaughterhouse Five  Who would have even conceived it possible to deal with overwhelming tragedy  of not just Dresden but the human condition  with so much grace and humor  This is a very important American book that no one should miss  One of my all time favorites  Vonnegut has a way of telling a story not so much like a storyteller  but more like a sarcastic and honest friend  As usual  there are no villains  little if any suspense  and the factual  in this case the Allies bombing Dresden  is blended with science fiction  Vonnegut s books are one of the best reminders of why the novel is still relevant in the age of television and movies  Right  I somehow managed to miss reading this during my school years and for many years later  I m glad I remedied that  Vonnegut s writing is incredibly clear  concise  and matter of fact  even when talking about the most gruesome war imagery  That made it all the more powerful to me  His tale of poor  odd  damaged Billy Pilgrim illustrates the insanity and absurdity of the War Machine  Amazing book  Another reread for this month  A classic for a reason  Funny  insightful  biting  and thoughtful  Vonnegut really takes the reader on a journey in a short span  I can t believe how much he crams into 150 or so pages  Not going to bother with a recap and full review  as so much as has been written on this book  Just read if you haven t  And if you have  read it again  It holds up  Totally timeless  So it goes  4 5 5  Even 17 years later  I cannot express the impact that this book had on me  Nonlinear narrative  Check  Author interspersed into his own story  Check  Lifelong appreciation for a versatile author that led to corners of reading previously unconsidered  Double check  Curious about Vonnegut  Start here  Want the voice of generations  Start here  Thanks for your words  Kurt  I miss you  So it goes   Ikinci Dunya Savasi belgeselini tersten izlemesini anlattigi bolum okudugum en guzel seylerden biriydi sanirim  Hikaye zaman zaman bir denemeye  veya bir aforizmalar serisine donusuyor ve bunu cok basarili sekilde yapiyor  Yazar ayrica zamanda yolculuk sekanslarini herkesin kolay kolay yapamayacagi bir ustalikla yazmis  Baska bi durumda kafa karistiracak hizli ve kisa gecisler aksine kafa acici bu kitapta  Sensacional  Asi fue  Fantastic  Absolutely stunning  Perhaps this is in defense of my younger self who tried to read Vonnegut during his highschool years and didn t get it  but I think there takes some maturity and awareness to appreciate and enjoy this writer  I don t think I had that when I was 15 or 16  I didn t  get  him  I think I do understand him now and can appreciate what he was doing in this book  I m going to try others by him in time  Clever  devastating  somehow sexy  and genius  Before this  I d only read Vonnegut short stories  which I loved  At the recommendation of Elijah Wood  I picked this up  and I really enjoyed the juxtaposition of the reality of the bombing of Dresden  which Vonnegut experienced first hand  and the fantasy of alien abduction time travel  I totally dug the alien philosophies on time and perspective   there are some books that kick you in the gut and don t ever leave you and this is one of those  this kicked me in my chest and knocked away my wind and the second i could breathe again i was filled with the cold sharp air that spins your brain into a lovely storm  i am sure i will read this again  maybe years  maybe months from now  but definitely again  i ll have this one with me forever  i loved it   I wonder how I would feel about this book if I read it this month  I remember the extraordinary power of this novel and I was really surprised that it was not really a time traveling science fiction story  I did  get  the idea that it was a humanist novel at it s core which resonated with my college experiences and the political zeitgeist of the time  Everyone read Vonnegut in college  right  Or should  I had been interested in reading this book for awhile  and when I finally got the chance  I was not disappointed  Once I began  it was hard to put it down  Kurt Vonnegut  in my opinion  is one of the greatest authors of all time  He created a beautiful  humorous story  It pulled at my heart strings and made me smile  I cannot praise Mr  Vonnegut enough  and I cannot wait to read the rest of his work  This book I also read in high school and it really was one of those books that changed the way I understood a lot of things    WWII for instance  I had started Vonnegut with Cat s Cradle  This was the second of his novels I read  What did I learn from it  What did I learn from Vonnegut in general  That s worth a bit of thought  so you ll have to check back to see what I come up with in a bit     Slaughterhouse Five starts out slow but soon turns into a book I found hard to put down  Time travel in your own life line with the thought that you re always alive  but also always dead at some point is an unique take on the other versions of time travel out there Additionally  vonnegut s style just flows easily and you seem to become engrossed in the story without realizing that it s happened  Vonnegut is pretty great  He subtly tells a story while he entertains his readers and keeps us on our toes  I loved how he used time travel and memory to tell us about fictional characters in real events  There was a sense of intentional unease in trusting his main character  and I found it interesting that he also included the narrator as a minor character  Very interesting  and very hard to explain  My first Vonnegut  surprise   I really enjoyed this book  It was another quick read  and I find that I quite like Vonnegut s style  I look forward to reading more of his work  What hit me the hardest about this book was the Tralfamdorian s concept of time  I suppose it s a bit comforting  if anything  I hope to add a copy of this book to my library very soon  and I see myself reading it many  many times  When I read this in high school I thought of it as a nice little science fiction story  without much point  When I read it again recently  I was surprised to discover that it was so much more than that  It was a poignant story of a man being overwhelmed by his war experiences and breaking with reality  It s not  science fiction  at all  but psychological drama  and very powerful when read that way  I really liked this book  I like Vonnegut s style anyway  from the sentence structure to the humor  The time travel concept and the all moments exist at once concept I also enjoyed  It s a pretty scathing commentary on war  I think  without being overly preachy or obvious  I can t imagine going through what Vonnegut went through and coming out at all intact  mentally  I m glad I finally read this   I kind of wish this were the first Kurt Vonnegut book I d read  I don t know if it was the books I chose or the time in my life that I read them  but I really have never liked Vonnegut before  Now I LOVE him  I can t seem to put into words just how impressive  profound  and affecting I found this novel  I love writing that can make you laugh with one passage  and stop you dead in your tracks the next   I ve read this book several times  most recently 2009  What I look for in a great author  and in a great book  is for the author to write a book that no one else could have written  That s we have with _Slaughterhouse Five_   Vonnegut s singular vision  All the previously used adjectives are true  funny  raucous  sarcastic  But the story itself is heart breaking  appalling  and powerful  Pure genius  Una novela virtuosa tramada magistralmente  en la que la historia se perfila a traves de raccords casi cinematograficos a taves de los cuales se mueve un personaje soberbiamente delineado  protagonizando una historia que lo tiene todo y que combina con inusitada pericia un sinfin de generos de tal modo que ni se percibe la transicion entre ellos  cuyos limites se desdibujan en esa esplendida voz narrativa  If you haven t read this anti war novel yet  you should definitely do so  The description on its back is dead on  it s a tragic read  yet you cannot cry  and at the same time it is funny  yet you cannot laugh  Wonderful imagery and language  I like Vonnegut s writing style  It s sarcastic and ironic and matter of factly all at the same time  This book made it to my all time favourite reads  So it goes  How have I not read this book  In any case  it s in the Amazon Prime lending library  and I m at a loss for what to read now that I m done with Infinite Jest  so why not    Ok  so this was a weirdly fitting follow up to Infinite Jest  I swear I didn t plan it that way  I was just being cheap and trying not to spend money on books for a few weeks  This book was so dense and full of philosophy that I think I ll need to read it a couple more times before I can catch everything the author was trying to communicate  With the first read  however  I enjoyed the chaos of the plot and was impressed with the concepts that were introduced  The writing was beautiful  as were the author s ideas  It was also surprisingly funny  Vonnegut s got jokes guys    Didn t read this in high school  read it in college  and got ADDICTED to Vonnegut  I haven t kept the pace and read everything he s ever written  which is probably why I haven t suffered the Vonnegut burnout that a lot of fans seem to suffer  The story of Billy Pilgrim and the Dresden firebombing is  to me  war in all its absurdity and in sarcasm and irony  the last rational responses to such horror  I m not usually big on war stories  but this one had enough sci fi fantasy to keep me interested  I really liked how there was a sense of continuity throughout all of it despite all the time traveling  it matched the whole  Tralfamadorian  sense of time  The detachment we had from Billy s thoughts and feelings made him seem even stranger  more damaged  It was all very simple  yet complex  So it goes   3 This is one of my favorite books  Vonnegut manages to be both bitter and heartfelt in his portrayal of a veteran of World War II  and he  himself a war veteran  cuts through the usual romanticization of fighting in that war  Moreover  the device that Vonnegut uses to do this  Billy Pilgrim s dislodgement from time  is unique and effective  A great  brilliant  funny  sad book all in one   So it goes   Read this while staying in Dresden on a backpacking trip through Europe  It was one of the only books I liked well enough to carry with me for the remaining month of the trip rather than trading it away  I think that being in Dresden while reading the story had something to do with that  Vonnegut  as always  astounded me with his insightful and funny writing  I guess there s a reason classics are classic  Loved it  It s funny  It s thought provoking  It s entertaining  It s easy to read  I m devouring all Vonnegut now  This is a must read   said the girl drinking coffee  And so it goes  The endlessly inventive Kurt Vonnegut makes a gripping  powerful case against war  Anybody listening  I didn t think so  Best book I ve read in a while  liked it a lot   There isn t much that hasn t been said here about Slaughterhouse Five  As far as my opinion  here goes I liked the book because it was entertaining and interesting  Vonnegut managed to write time travel and aliens into a story and not have it be too cliche  As far as the negatives go  his prose bordered on being overly simplistic But overall I d say solid four or four and a half stars  I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this wild ride  About 100 pages in  I couldn t put it down   Phenomenally well written  This book is a classic for a reason  The satire is spot on and so incredibly Vonnegut  I loved the constant use of certain repeated phrases   So it goes   being the most prevalent one  This is actually only the second of his novels that I ve read and I need to jump on some more here before too long  That should be another New Year s resolution  Read more Vonnegut  My first Vonnegut  and I loved it  Great storytelling  simple sentences  sensitive portrayals  The author s father s quote at the beginning sets the tone   you know   you never wrote a story with a villain in it   This is a story about the bloodiest day of WWII  but it s hard to find villains  This book is perfection I cannot believe this book hasn t crossed my path before  I read it in one evening next afternoon straight through Sparse brutal prose  Every line is memorable  punches you in the gut  or makes you think A haunting  realistic  horrifying look at the banality  absurdity  horror  of war   the impact of trauma on the lives of men  Everybody should read this one To be hones I did not finish this book in class an I will definitely work my best to finish it over the summer  With that said  I absolutely loved the idea of the book and the theme about being an existentialist and the ideas of existing in all other times and the idea of  dying    so it goes   The quote of being unstuck in time really made me think about everything in a little more depth Honestly one of the best and most creative books I ve come to read  Its anti war discussions and broad aspects make the story more than just another simple book  It is one of those books that makes you sit around and analyze the way you conduct your life  Reading the book has given me new outlook on who can be summoned to fight in a war  Would definitely read again and may become a favorite   It s vonnegut   nuff said  I can t believe it took me this long to pick this book up and read it  I had known about the book itself  but essentially nothing about its contents  which made it a captivating read as well as a surprising one  Seriously  what is wrong with my education that I didn t read it in high school  So  it has some dirty words  Whatever I look forward to reading it again in a year or so  Um livro estranhissimo  Despertou me tristeza e risos ao mesmo tempo  Relato autobiografico sobre o infame bombardeio de Dresden  mais mortifero que Hiroshima  mesclado com as alucinogenas experiencias do personagem alter Ego de Vonnegut  eis aqui uma experiencia de leitura pertubadora e ao mesmo tempo instigante  Ao final de cada difressao macabra e mordaz   o comentario  Pois e   e a Vida    A modern classic  if a bit depressing  While it is often called science fiction and contains elements that can easily be considered as such  I instead think of it as  realistic  fiction where the main character is unstuck mentally  not actually unstuck in time   Not that there is anything wrong with science fiction    I read it all the time    but it does not really feel like SF to me   This is THE BEST NOVEL I HAVE READ THIS YEAR It speaks human nature with almost no 3rd voice analysis  What Billy does and goes through makes the story powerful and very sensitive The time travel pieces are pure poetry Splendid 15 Things Kurt Vonnegut Said Better Than Anyone Else Ever Has Or Willhttp   www avclub com articles 15 thi    LOVED IT  Well it s a re read so obviously I loved it  I think that this man can do no wrong  Honestly  The synopsis from Barnes and Noble will probably make you shy away from this  but don t  It may take you a few pages to get into it  but once you do you will be pondering and laughing all the way through P S my back tattoo is the headstone from this book  soooo ofcourse it got 5 stars  When I read this in high school I thought of it as a nice little science fiction story  without much point  When I

war  Would definitely read again and may become a favorite   It s vonnegut   nuff said  I can t believe it took me this long to pick this book up and read it  I had known about the book itself  but essentially nothing about its contents  which made it a captivating read as well as a surprising one  Seriously  what is wrong with my education that I didn t read it in high school  So  it has some dirty words  Whatever I look forward to reading it again in a year or so  Um livro estranhissimo  Despertou me tristeza e risos ao mesmo tempo  Relato autobiografico sobre o infame bombardeio de Dresden  mais mortifero que Hiroshima  mesclado com as alucinogenas experiencias do personagem alter Ego de Vonnegut  eis aqui uma experiencia de leitura pertubadora e ao mesmo tempo instigante  Ao final de cada difressao macabra e mordaz   o comentario  Pois e   e a Vida    A modern classic  if a bit depressing  While it is often called science fiction and contains elements that can easily be considered as such  I instead think of it as  realistic  fiction where the main character is unstuck mentally  not actually unstuck in time   Not that there is anything wrong with science fiction    I read it all the time    but it does not really feel like SF to me   This is THE BEST NOVEL I HAVE READ THIS YEAR It speaks human nature with almost no 3rd voice analysis  What Billy does and goes through makes the story powerful and very sensitive The time travel pieces are pure poetry Splendid 15 Things Kurt Vonnegut Said Better Than Anyone Else Ever Has Or Willhttp   www avclub com articles 15 thi    LOVED IT  Well it s a re read so obviously I loved it  I think that this man can do no wrong  Honestly  The synopsis from Barnes and Noble will probably make you shy away from this  but don t  It may take you a few pages to get into it  but once you do you will be pondering and laughing all the way through P S my back tattoo is the headstone from this book  soooo ofcourse it got 5 stars  I don t think there is anything I can say about this book that hasn t already been said  Or written It s one of my favorites  I ve read it countless times and am awed every time by the work that went into it  The craftsmanship Plus it s a great story AND it s persuasive as hell AND there are quotable lines all over the place I would recommend this book  Amazing  When I read it  I found out what a great novel is  It made me think about the world around me  with plenty of laughs along the way  without taking itself too seriously  and making the bare minimum of sense  If you have not read this book  you should stop whatever you are doing and read it immediately  Its been years since I first picked it up and I still say  So it goes   Funny  surreal novel involving time travelling between the latter stages of WW2 unto the 70 s and a distant travel which lacks a time dimension  Puts the boot into war and makes gentle fun of all things American whilst hitting pretty hard the horrors and cruelty of war   bullying  thuggishness  torture and the genocide of the Dresden bombing  Absolute classic that still resonates  Wonderful So many books have stolen from this  look at Dr  Manhattan in The Watchmen  but who cares All the varying elements blend seamlessly somehow in the narrative and the book is fun of so much beauty and horror and wonderful images and ideas My only critique  and it is a small one  is that I wanted maybe just one more sentence at the end to make the final visual soar  This is among my all time favorite novels  I know a lot of people have trouble with this novel  The novel doesn t follow the neat  formulaic process of most novels  it s a bit disjointed  which I m learning is a trait of Vonnegut as a writer  However  he s witty in an understated way and incredibly fun to read once you get beyond the paradigm shift his book can certainly cause   Uma historia muito bem contada  o kurt vonnegut consegue nos transportar para dentro da pele de Billy com uma destreza espectacular  Faz com que nao queiramos parar de ler  e e assim  conseguimos ver e sentir o que ele escreve com uma clareza espectacular  dos meus livros favoritos  nunca pensei gostar tanto de um livro sobre a guerra  mas este livro e muito mais que isso  e e assim  My new favorite book  It s so unique with the time warping and WWII setting  The detached  third person narrative fits well with the subject matter of someone detached from time itself  It took a while to get into the non linear timeline but once I did I was very engaged with with the book  I would wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone looking for something quick and a bit mind blowing  Classic Vonnegut  I remember reading the first time and thinking that it was a sci fi book  Now I look back on it and realize how it is just the story of Billy Prigrim who trys his dardnest to escape the brutalitity of war  Sure  his fantasies are out there  but they never happened  These are just PTSD flashbacks or whathaveyou  I love Vonnegut s use of time  Brilliant read   Sonsuz zamana insan nesnesini zarif bir sekilde konumlandiran kitap Trafalmadore lulari daha iyi anlamak icin  es zamanlilik ilkesi ne asina olmak gerekir  Bu ilkeyi Vonnegut kitabinda cok guzel bir sekilde aciklamis  Gokyuzune baktiginizda yildizlari noktasal degil de cizgisel gormeye baslarsaniz es zamanli yasamayi ogrendiniz demektir  Trafalmadore da bulusmak umidiyle    Vonnegut s great anti war novel  This book disparages war while managing to also spin a note worthy yarn about a time displaced Billy Pilgrim  or a demented Billy  one of the two and the anachronistically ordered world he walks through  At once both quietist and pacifist  this book  constructed of trademark Vonnegutian prose  deserves the acclaim and strange looks it is so often given  Not what I expected  but definitely a good read  For some reason I thought that someone so popular would have a more  for lack of a better term  professional writing style  But I really like that the style wasn t like every other book you read  It was more like reading someone s mind rather than reading a novel  I will be reading more from Mr  Vonnegut     And so it goes       I read this in 9th grade  and it inaugurated a binge of reading Vonnegut s novels  Every teenager should read this book  About a young American soldier s experience of the fire bombing of Dresden  and his subsequent capture by aliens from Trafalmadore as a zoo specimen who is given the ability to re live any moment in his life as compensation for his imprisonment  Brilliant book  Vonnegut gives the impression of having a drunkenly honest  late night conversation with an old friend  humorous  if slightly frenetic  Given its stark critique of life and humanity  the book comes across as surprisingly light hearted  The reader does not mourn the tragedies described  but treats them as interesting and unavoidable happenings of a chaotic world   So it goes   So Amy was right  this book was a literary treat  Well  maybe not a treat exactly   I wouldn t describe it as appetizing or anything  It s definitely a must read   if there s anyone out there who hasn t read it now that Amy and I have Although there were many many sentences I had to read twice   I have to say that this was my favorite   The champagne was dead  So it goes   Perhaps the sneakiest book about shell shock you ll ever find  It takes a while to understand  and at first you do wonder whether Tramfaldores really exist or not  but when you think of it you realize the truth of the character  It s a wonderful book  written brilliantly with descriptions both human and razor sharp  and a true piece of art in fiction  I highly recommend this book  So it goes   This book is in my top 5 favorites books of all time   50  World War II book  50  science fiction  100  crazy  I loved the writing  enjoyed the story  but it all felt very pointless  Then I watched an analysis and found out that  semi spoiler  it s supposed to be  It s an intentionally crazy  almost nonsensical book about living through war and trying to make sense of it  I enjoyed it  but I know a lot of people who wouldn t   This book is going to haunt me  The messages and themes of this book are so god awfully powerful  it s not even funny  Vonnegut has the amazing ability of being able to mix pure hilarity and brutal honesty together seamlessly  This book will change the way you look at war and violence and pain and suffering and life in general  It s incredibly beautiful  Just  wow  WOOOOOOOW  Sad  hilarious  and unique   It was an amazing book that I will thoroughly recommend to anyone who loves dark humor and satire  Even if you don t  it s an amazing read and it will honestly be enjoyed by anyone  Anytime a character dies on TV or in a book I am reading I automatically and involuntarily say to myself  So it goes   This honestly is a brilliant and thought provoking modern masterpiece   Excelente  Siempre me fascina la cercana relacion entre la literatura y los trastornos mentales  en un momento y acostumbrados de pronto a la narrativa magica de otros autores no sabemos que tanto los sucesos extranos se deben a los trastornos de Billy Pilgrim  a la poesia de Vonnegut o a la burla misma de lo mas absurdo de todas las cosas  la guerra  Me lo disfrute demasiado  I thought the book was unique  What can you say about Kurt Vonnegut  that hasn t already been said about Kurt Vonnegut  To some  Vonnegut is a religion  To others  he is misunderstood and not read as often as should be  Of course  Slaughterhouse Five is the classic  and even if one does not include Vonnegut as religion  this classic should definitely be read and read often  It is part of the Canon   A fantastically absurd book  I thought that  given the tone of the summary of the book on so many other sites  that this book would be difficult to get through  It only took me three days Some of the best three days I ve ever spent This book definitely deserves to be on so many peoples  Favorites Lists  If you haven t read this one yet  read it  You ll be happy you did  I finally picked up Slaughterhouse Five one day  after Kurt Vonnegut had recently died  It was probably partly out of regret  as I didn t read what is argued to be his best novel during the great man s life  So it goes  And I figured out about halfway through that this satirical  existential  sci fi novel that made me laugh and cry was going to be among my favorite books ever  Slaughterhouse five is an eclectic retelling of Vonnegut s experience during the Second World War  It is an unstringed novel which takes you places  It makes you question free will and the inevitability of death and human desire for destruction  It is a satire of war   intelligent and purposefully not funny  It is a short yet extreme and infinite read  A Vonnegut classic  Vonnegut is one of my embarrassing gaps  And going into this  I wondered if this would be too mannered for me with all the  so it goes   But  though I learned about the Dresden bombing in college  this really gave it resonance  It s in anti war book that sneaks up on you because of it s  mannered  narrative  But by the time it ended  it really got to me  Glad I read it  I love any and all books written by Kurt Vonnegut  He is my favorite author  I have read and have every book he ever wrote  Just love his writing style and absurdist views  Another author who blows me away in this same type of genre is Tom Robbins  Half Asleep in Frog s Pajamas by Tom Robbins is an amazing read  Jitterbug Perfume is another favorite of mine by him  First off  this is not strictly a science fiction book  Its more a book about the worst that humanity has to offer  and trying to extract meaning that  It actually reminded me of  The Plague  in that sense  only darkly humorous  I was moved to tears during several parts of the book  This will go on my shelf as one of my favorites  and I plan to re read it several times  This is an excellent anti war novel that everybody should read  Vonnegut takes a different approach to the bombing of Dresden in 1945  he connects it to a sci fi story  Of course  it may not be liked by everybody  but the whole message of the book is excellently conveyed nevertheless  I really regret it that I haven t read it earlier because it is so beautifully written  I cannot believe I have never read this  Billy Pilgrim becomes unstuck in time   He was abducted by aliens  the Tralfamadorians  Now we see his life as he does  jumping from the prisoner of war camp  to his speaking tours  to his family life on Tralfamador  It all reads so smoothly  But the story is not about Billy Pilgrim so much as it is about the horrors of war  A little confusing as first but then really liked it  Is about the bombing of Dresden  Germany at the end of World War II  Is a satire anti war  The author was really in the war and was a prisoner of war  just like the character  Billy Pilgrim  The story goes back and forth  between the present and the past  Very well written  Says  So it Goes  in the book 106 times  Vonnegut tried for years to write a novel that properly expressed his feelings about his experience as a POW during the Dresden bombing  He finally did it by combining the story with aliens and time travel  Vonnegut expresses his sorrow of man s inhumanity to man and masks his anger with black humor  The result is one of his best novels  and a science fiction classic   Clever  transcedent and truely unmissbale  one of the best books I ve read and an amazing intorduction to post modernism for anyone unsure of it  amazing A sci fi classic that more than holds up  Slaughterhouse Five s exploration of human morality along the spacetime continuum offers a unique perspective on happiness  sorrow  and the horrors of war  Alternately funny and serious  the book makes good use of Vonnegut s efficient prose to tell a compelling story as relevant now as it was when it was written 44 years ago  This book is very similar to Catch 22 in the satirical anti war attitude  Vonnegut s ideas and stories about war make you think about everything you have ever been told  I don t agree with all of his positions but I do like how they stimulate thought  I think everyone in high school should have to read this book because it has so many hidden gems to discover and tear apart  This is a classic Kurt Vonnegut book  The way Vonnegut deals with his own experiences with the war and coming back to everyday life is reflected throughout the book  The book itself is well done  humorous but very haunting  I also recommend the movie  As a hardcore fan of Vonnegut I approve of the movie  most of his other books that were turned into movie  not so much     If there s any book to provoke your thoughts on war  it is Vonnegut s Slaughterhouse five  From the characters to the plot structure itself  everything in this book reflects some destructive aspect of war  His satirical voice and humorous snippets provide a great read for those looking for a compelling read while also entertaining those who just want a good book   OMG  Why haven t I read this book until now  Put it on the top of your reading list  A real look at the nastiness of war and state of the human affairs  Great book  I love the nonlinear style of the book and how nonchalant it is about death  Adds a sort of humorous tone to a somewhat sad book   Instant favorite  Great Book  Brilliantly funny with a cutting edge of sadness  So it goes   I opened this book without knowing what to expect  But what I discovered was something really wonderful  I met the Vonnegut you all talk about  I knew who Billy Pilgrim was and I learned from the tralfamadorians  This might sound stupid  but with this book I learned how to laugh  Everything is better with laughter  And as the mantra of this book says  so it goes   absolutely fantastic  read in one shot  loved the satire and cynicism  it was hilarious and sad at the same time what This book deserves a five but I m not going to give it one because it unsettled me in a way I was not anticipating  This book made me think about time and how time warps or impressions  Time is a man made concept so what if we uninvented  that s not a word  it  This is one of the best classics and school books I ve ever read and I m pleased that I enjoyed it   This book is totally twisted  It s historical  sci fi  and drama    an interesting combination  At first I was annoyed by the often repeated  and so it goes  but after awhile it grew on me  The part about the dog made me cry but all is fair in literary context and I m over it  oo i didn t know you d read that  i just read it last month for the first time  i d never read vonnegut before  i loved it so much it inspired a major rewrite in my novel and i m teaching it in the spring     This was an increadably interesting story  Mixing sci fi with historical events like the bombing of Dresden  It discusses time which is honestly not a subject I am very interested in  However after a while the writing became repetitive  I understand this was used to make a point about time  but it made it frustrating to read  Other then that I loved this book  What a powerful book       and so it goes         Bad things will happen and there is not a damn thing anyone can do to stop it or change it The story written by a WW2 vet based on a real life colleague of his who fought with him at Dresden  It is the story of how veterins deal with war and its after effects  Superbly written  this book must be read  Painful  but honest  A book everyone should read  along with the non fiction documents that were in the appendix  Utterly horrifying to me when I read it as a young person  Still utterly horrifying  Most of all this is an attempt to find a way through  in the face of such horror  I love this writer  for his humour  his passion  and his truthful  searching spirit  When I originally started reading this book I was kind of like  WTF   I didn t really get it and at some points I was even like  WTH  This is just stupid   But the very second I finished the book  ok  probably a chapter or two before  I was like   Ohhhh   And I loved it  It s one of those books that really makes you stop and rethink some aspects of life in general  I hate to reach for that  top shelf description  for anything usually  but this book is an exception  This book was life changing for me in its matter of fact approach to life and death and ability to drive home the points it feels are important  I picked this book up in high school and have reread it a couple times since  Vonnegut was one of the best to be sure  Another great American classic ticked off my list  Slaughterhouse Five is an anti war book that should be on your must read list  The use of absurdism and black humor reminds me of Franz Kafka but this is an entirely different league of its own For full review  please check out my blog entry  http   seejy wordpress com 2013 11 20    The novel that gave us Billy Pilgrim  the Tralfamadorians and  unstuck in time  is the greatest of Vonnegut s offerings and one of my favorite novels of all time  Take away the weird science fiction aspects and you have a story about people and things they do to one another  good and bad  More than that  it is one war veteran s plea that there not be any more wars  Wow  What a bizarre  thought provoking book  I m ashamed to admit that I was unaware of the fire bombing of Dresden before I read this book  In this respect  Vonnegut accomplished his goal to tell the story of Dresden  But to mix in the sci fi was a stroke of genius  from a literary aspect  Warning to my LDS friends  there are several f bombs throughout   Very cool book    I really like Vonnagut s sense of humor and style of writing  It s a war book  but it s also touches on science fiction  is really about how life just keeps going  crazy things happen  people die  etc    and there s really nothing we can do about it so we just have to keep living and accept what comes at us  I strongly recommend this book  Slaughterhouse Five is a retelling of Kurt Vonnegut s experience as a prisoner of war during the firebombing of Dresden in WWII  I thoroughly enjoyed reading about his memorable characters  and the gallows humor present throughout the novel  I also enjoyed his unique style of writing  I would recommend this book for anyone who wants to try something different  I still feel like there s so much about this book that I just don t get  but I love it  It s written in such a great way  not a single word is wasted  Even though I didn t really know what was going on half the time  it was so

ago  But  after rereading Slaughterhouse Five  I can honestly say that I remembered less than 5  of it  Which is a shame because it revolves around serious and important issues like war  death  predestination  self will  time travel and aliens  I bump my ratings up to 5 stars   This is a fantastic novel by one of America s best modern science fiction writers  Not only will one enjoy the captivating story and Vonnegut s unique story telling ability  but also his interesting take on humanity through the genre of science fiction  For any Vonnegut fan or someone unfamiliar with this author  Slaughterhouse Five is a good read  Beautifully and hauntingly read by Ethan Hawke  The story is is a marvelous cross between the absurd and reality  The cadence of death proclaiming  So it goes s has me repeating the phrase in my head constantly as I wish the news every evening  If you haven t read this  go do it  If you have  it s worth listening to Mr  Hawke s spoken rendition  This book was wonderful  It reminded of how c S  Lewis sounds in his space triology  but had a totally different effect  The theme of the book is that war is horrible and it does have some sections that are not for the faint of heart  I agree with one of the reviews that said it is a funny book that you can t laugh at and a sad book that you can t cry for   At first you think it is too glib  The short sentences  the short paragraphs  the ironic humor  But it begins to dawn on you that his vision is much more huge than you dreamed  This book is about no less than the meaning of war and the meaning of life and the meaning of death   So it goes   I think this is one of the most towering works of our time   Another book that I have read countless times  Vonnegut is one of my favorite authors and his death last spring hit me like losing an influential college professor  or a close uncle  This is my favorite book of his  it expertly incorporates so many of the themes integral to his body of work  Fantasy  love  tolerance  acceptance  It reads so many ways    Listen  Billy Pilgrim has come unstuck in time     Is there any greater opening sentence than this  Deals with the randomn nature of human life  and more importanly  the human capacity for perseverance through the most horrifying of circumstances  in this case  the Allied firebombing of Dresden and the emd of WWII  an event Vonnegut witnessed first hand   The going between two story lines confused me at times  but it was so funny very often  I would often find myself laughing out loud while reading this  It was also easy and fairly quick to read because of how well it was written  I appreciated the story line involving other species because it was so imaginative and fascinating just to imagine in my head  I read this book when I lived overseas in Japan as a foreign exchange student  There were few books around for me to read  so I ended up re reading what few books I had several times  This one was by far my favorite  I still enjoy going back and re reading it  I find something new each time  I found there to be layers of sarcasm that had me howling  One of my favorite books of all time  I have gone through several copies that were never returned after loan   but keep loaning as I hunk everyone should read this little treasure  it gives such a quirky feel an extreme moment in history  while making you cocky your head and say  wait  did I just read that right   a must read  short and easy  as well  Vonnegut is a fantastic writer  and even though this novel is primarily about war  its themes delve in to the heart of what drives the human race  This book is sarcastic  deeply sad  and even a little bit funny  This book will make you think  but at the same time it is a fast paced read  I think everyone should read Vonnegut at some point in their life  his magnum opus as designated by the literary elitei personally think that distinction goes to galapagosorcats cradle this book is important because of its styling the play with time makes it super great for any writerlooking to expand their mind in the craftwithout using tabs of acid well  you should do that too while reading it  So  part of my new year s resolutions was to go back to those books you read in high school  I ve done Fahrenheit 451 and Slaughterhouse Five thus far  I really enjoyed this  It was my first time with this book  and my second Vonnegut  i d read Timequake   I can t believe I had never read it before  I hope to come back to it before terribly long  I thought that this book was brilliant  The writing is superb  and the points that Vonnegut makes are witty and concise  I thought the ending was a somewhat lacking  but I think that was Vonnegut s point  not spoiling it   Also  I recommend reading the author s note before reading the actual book  I appreciated this book more because of reading that note  I had never read this book before  assuming it would be horribly depressing  It wasn t  The story of Billy Pilgrim and his life s journey  focusing on his experiences in WWII  As a POW he experienced the firebombing of Dresden and his experience affected the rest of his life  Ultimately the story is a commentary on war and its waste and futility  Reread this on a quick airplane ride and appreciated it even more the second time around  Vonnegut s descriptive language and satiric wit are fantastic while examining the darkest underbelly of humanity  Inspired me to read more of his novels and I ll re view the respectable movie made in 1972 starring most memorably Valerie Perrine as Montana Wildhack  I recently re read this  having found a disintegrating copy in the back of the used books store for  2  Combined with Catch 22  Slaughterhouse Five provides one of the few non heroic looks at World War II  and time travel  for that matter   There s no heroism  no nobility  no redemption  there s only people acting out their tiny little part in time   Everyone has a Kurt Vonnegut phase  I started mine with Slaughterhouse Five  Although I prefer Cat s Cradle  S 5 is a good primer to Vonnegut s imagination  healthy cynicism and delicious  in a sparse  pithy kind of way  prose style  His writing feels very natural and organic  it s easy to relate to  and for this  he remains one of my favorite authors  I just read this for the third time  What a great book  It isn t easy to do funny and horrifying together  at least intentionally funny and horrifying  but S5 does it beautifully  It was especially interesting reading it while I am finishing up the Vonnegut letters

verodik vissza a fejemben  I knew the book jumped in time  and I thought it would be harder to read because of that  It wasn t  and it actually made the life of Billy Pilgrim much more interesting  It was an interesting look at life  time  and experience  The Tralfalmadorians made me rethink a lot of my life  and I find myself uttering  so it goes  much more often  Truly one of the best books I ve ever read  I can easily see why it s a classic  It s definitely reached my top ten favorite books of all time  It s both sad and hilarious in a strange way and wasn t at all what I was expecting  I think everyone should read this book at some time in their life  I hope I read it several times in the future  I flew through this over the summer  I have always wanted to read this book  and Vonnegut did not disappoint  This was funny  insightful  and a little sad at times  and follows Billy Pilgrim through time traveling  war  and life  It s one of those books that  once you finish the last page  you sit in silence for a few minutes  soaking it in   Just as applicable today as it was in 1969  This will be short because of all I have read few things to me have been as poetic and true as  so it goes    The last time I read this book  I was 12  It has lost none of it s poignancy in the intervening 40 years  I have lost many of those close to me during those years  so it goes  I hope Mr Vonnegut is still there somewhere  and that the Tralfamadorians are right    In any event  I thank him for the laughter  and deep thoughts  that he has given me   War  gloomy  dismal  morbid  So it goes   Beautiful  One of the funniest and most depressing books I ve ever read  That s probably what makes it so good  Definitely in my top 10   So it goes   This book  despite its subject matter  was sinfully pleasurable to read  Each line better than the last  Kurt could write a whole novel about clipping one toenail and it would be delightful  So it goes  Finally getting around to reading this classic  I have to say I m very impressed  I ll have to think about it some more  but it does leave  at least to me  a depressing feeling by the end  Perhaps that s a byproduct of the themes   free will  war  etc  Still  I would highly recommend this to anyone who doesn t mind farcical light sci fi tales  This book may in fact be my favorite of all time  That is a difficult thing to quantify for me as I love sooo many books and I ve read sooo many books that things get a liitle jumbled  however  I ve never been tempted to tattoo a quote from any other book on my person  This is probably the only book that will ever have this distinction for me  What do I think  I think Kurt Vonnegut was a genius  an artist in every sense of the word  I think why didn t I read this sooner  I think I m going to be reading lots and lots of Vonnegut in the immediate future  I could not put this down  Within the first few pages of this book I knew I was in for a treat and I was not mistaken   This book deserves its lasting continued ranking as one of the greatest novels of our time  It is not at all what I was expecting but I enjoyed every minute  Vonnegut s use of Billy Pilgrim s visits with aliens and time travel as tiny window on to his  Vonnegut s  experience in WWII and the burning of Dresden is genius  A really fantastic read  An amazing novel about the nature of war  being human  and trips to outer space  This novel will change the way you look at fiction and challenge you to think outside of the cultural norms that you feel comfortable in  Vonnegut has a skill for non sugarcoated truth and a style of writing that is both subtle and stark at the same time  A must read  Teurastamo 5 on klassikko  must read kamaa  mutta ei vaikealukuinen silla tavalla kuin arvostetut klassikot usein sattuvat olemaan  Se on kertomus Dresdenin joukkotuhosta toisen maailmansodan aikana  teos  joka on seka totta etta taytta fantasiaa  Mielenkiintoisinta on se  miten rajat ylittyvat niin  ettei aina tottakaan uskoisi tapahtuneeksi   I first remember my history teacher describing the scene wherein the main character watches people living in reverse  being dug out of the ground at the beginning of their life and then ultimately becoming a baby put into a womb at the end of their life     all part of the main character s becoming  unstuck in time     one of Vonnegut s best  So  I was trying to give a synopsis of the book s plot line to my wife and her response was  Why do you read that kind of dark and violent stuff   Pretty funny  To anybody out there who hasn t read this  it s especially good as a follow up to Catch 22  I also noticed that it makes a good novel for practicing your psychoanalytical skills  Word   I love this book and will re read it again soon  My first reading of it was in College  But why not sooner  Its one of the most well written books I know and can imagine it taking just a day to read if someone was so motivated  But its best to re read and let it sit with you perhaps  The story  the images  and the meaning are impressive   Kurt Vonnegut is an absolutely brilliant writer  no doubt about it  In Slaughterhouse Five the plot intertwines with some of the greater questions of mankind  Free will vs  extreme structuralism being one of the most important ones  Merging that question with the cruelties of WWII in a easy read  rather light hearted novel is a grand achievement  If you re not familiar with Vonnegut s style  it will be a difficult read  but well worth the effort  Vonnegut is a satirist and cloaks his sarcasm in the science fiction genre  His main target is the allied fire bombing of Dresden in WWII  one of many atrocities of the war  You ll me Tralfamordorians  terms like Poo te weet and so it goes  One of my top three favourite books  Setting aside its deeper meanings of the effect on the human psyche by the trials of war  the science fiction elements used to communicate those themes are seamlessly implemented and endlessly entertaining  The insanity found by the protagonist is a comforting one  all too tempting to indulge in myself  Really loved this  My first Vonnegut book and my fav so far  I loved that although the subject matter is harsh  V keeps it going with humour however the overall tone just makes my heart ache  I loved the part in the beginning where the narrator gets drunk and calls all his old friends   very realistic  alcohol and phones go hand in hand  I don t know if this was my favorite Vonnegut book or not  but it was definitely a seminal work in American literature written in the second half of the 20th century  If you have a chance to read some of his essays on the bombing of Dresden  do so  He was there and it shaped his view of the world and his literature for the rest of his life  This has been my favorite novel and author since high school  I never expected to enjoy something of the science fiction sort and everytime I try to explain this book to someone I think it must sound horrible  Nonetheless  I found his humor engaging  his words stimulating and the message vital  Love him or hate him but this is his best work  Vonnegut s masterpiece in my opinion  This novel played around with the idea of insanity and the very fabric of space and time well before it became the cliche but still manages to be deeply philosophical and insightful  This book is the reason the phrase  So it goes   entered my vocabulary and even took on a transcendent  zen like meaning  I read this book in saturday school  I read the entire thing in 4 hours  Its a great book  Very entertaining  and real  I laughed out loud when Billy Pilgrim was wandering in his gold coat with the fur vest  I have no idea why it was funny  I mean it shouldn t be  but I sure laughed hard  Life is funny  even when it s depressing I guess  Maybe the BEST book in the whole world  and I am very difficult to please  I am mentally reeling a month later  and still comparing all the books I am reading to Slaughterhouse 5  Even the introduction is a masterpiece  To those people who say that the book is  about  the Dresden bombing  Vonnegut s writing completely transcends cold facts  I can honestly say I enjoyed reading this book  It s written in a  cool   almost casual way as if someone is just speaking to you and telling this story to you  The flashbacks the character goes through are something else   jarring in a way  it almost forces you to become unstable  It s a good read overall and something I d recommend   This was my first Vonnegut read   apparently everyone I ve ever met was assigned him in college    and somehow I was never assigned such things   But I ve found him to be wonderful   totally addictive  The book is smart  dark  hilarious   heartbreaking  It stays in your head for weeks after reading it   completely amazing  Well done  Sir   Love it love it love it  It s about time and space and life and death and about where we come from and where we are going  Yes  it is weird too  jumping around time and space  between fiction and fact  or at least to fact as the author would like the reader to think  and yet  the story is always clear Absolutely a must read for everybody  If you are someone who highly appreciates an author who uses lots of detail then this book is not for you  Vonnegut has a somewhat dry writing style and if you don t engage in the story it can get boring  I however found it to be a great book  and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for something different compared to most books  I m glad that this book deals with aspects of war that are so often overlooked by those who glorify war and war killings  I also hadn t known about the air raid of Dresden  you d never guess what had happened there driving through it today   In reality  there is speculation over the number of deaths by the raid  anywhere between 25 000 500 000  I read this book as part of a book club that some of my friends and I had started  At first I wasn t sure when the suggestion was made  But I had to read it  It was alittle hard to get into the flow of the book at first  but then once you do it s an eye opener  If you like a little sci fi and alittle war history you would like this book  This crazed escapade  it turns out  reveals the magic of Dresden and the insanity of the war that laid it to ashes in one of the only ways it could be done  retired dentist now time traveling visionary Billy Pilgrim and failed author Kilgore Trout  two of Vonnegut s most indelible characters  help make sense of the completely nonsensical  A very funny  touching satire of war  Vonnegut is hilarious  but through his humor he s conveying a deeper message  I read this book before having joined the military and didn t really grasp it  after having joined the Army and trying it again  though  the book made much more sense  Slaughter House 5 is definitely my favorite Vonnegut book  Really couldn t put SH5 down  The way Vonnegut jumps between time so effortlessly is an art  I m surprised it wasn t a choppy read  I m usually not a fan of war novels  but some how this book didn t feel like a war novel even though war was the majority of subject matter  Lot s of unanswered questions in the end  So it goes  Worth the read   Amazing book with Vonnegut s biting social commentary and bizarrely well flowing storytelling  As per his other similar books the story is made of a main character  with small stories and strange events combined into a single book  As long as you like an abstract  hilarious  heartfelt and emotional story line  you ll like this just fine  I loved this book  It s incredibly post modern  with a little bit of extra weirdness thrown in  It s an anti war novel that also manages to throw in some alien abduction and bird  both of which turn out to be surprisingly significant  Overall  a very good read  and a great length for anyone who s looking to do just a bit of light reading  Wow  so now I get why people love Vonnegut  The story this book told and the way it told is were fascinating For a book nominally about the firebombing of Dresden there was very little actually about Dresden and almost nothing of the bombing itself  I guess it makes sense that you can t actually write a novel about such an impersonal event  The use of repetition and pattern in this book make the story telling exceptionally poignant  I also love the way Vonnegut breaks some of the classic literary rules  so intriguing  More importantly  saw Jess reading this book on an episode of Gilmore Girls  so if that s not reason enough to read it  what is  Am i right  Anyway  loved it   Slaughterhouse Five  is a classic in science fiction and I ve always meant to read it  I see now why it is a classic  There are so many ways it could have gone wrong  so it takes a brilliant writer to make it come out right This is an adult novel  Make no mistake  I probably won t read this book again  but I m glad I read it  This is probably the fourth or fifth time I ve read this book  and happily so  I would give it 500 stars if I could  The absolute best   This is one if those novels that seems to transcend any kind of rating or review  How very lasting and powerful Vonnegut s message is regarding the physical  mental  and spiritual impact war has on one human and its spread to the human race  Ultimately  expresses Vonnegut  time affects everything and nothing at all   so it goes   I m a huge Vonnegut fan  and this is a very gripping set of stories  or flashbacks  I would recommend this book to anyone who can understand black comedy because it does take some serious events and turns them in to satire and black comedy  if you can take a sick and twisted joke  read it for sure  This book never disappoints   A funny  yet bleak account of the bombing of Dresden in WW2  Billy Pilgrim somehow manages to survive the war but his mind is fragmented and he believes he has become  unstuck in time   What strikes me however is the lack of freewill that humans show in war  that atrocities become the norm and life is truly cheap when we allow it to be  I never thought I d encounter a story about the bombing of Dresden that reads in such a straight forward yet ironic manner  Vonnegut s weaving of Billy Pilgrim s travels through time and space with the horrors of World War II  and an occasional nod to the fact that he was there  captivating and hilarious  yet eye opening and troubling    Listen  Billy Pilgrim has come unstuck in time ___ How can there be any meaning or direction to life when there are people willing to wage war against humanity   The fabric of life in this anti war book ranges from wet dreams to bayonets and stresses there is no such thing as a good war story  So it goes ___ Poo tee weet  I love Vonnegut and this is one book of his that I have heard several people say they liked  Why  I can only answer for me  because it dared to address the Dresden bombings in a typical Vonnegut fashion involving time travels and aliens   There is a strong sense of the futility of war and a disappointment with humans in general  Love it  This is a wonderful little novel  Everything that is going to happen  has happened  and is happening  It is a thoughtful meditation on not only war but everything that happens in life and how we are ultimately just pawns  shifted here  shifted there  never knowing but always moving forward until we aren t anymore  And that s okay  too  The third time I ve read this and it rewards repeated reading  A couple of observations  1  Reading on Kindle allowed me ascertain that the  So it goes  motif appears 106 times throughout the book  2  Curious and jarring to see David Irving quoted as a credible source of information  I wonder when the last time that happened was  So it goes Billy Pilgrim is moving though time and Kurt Vonnegut appears periodically  just so we know that we are watching a grand play  full of sound and fury  signifying nothing If time is not fixed and one could only see how the past  present  and future are all part of one cloth  we wouldn t read this book  So it goes  I just re read this book for probably the 3rd or 4th time in the last 16 years  It was the first Vonnegut book I ever read  and I still think it s a glorious example of his work I don t care to say more  because I think everyone should read this  And if you ve already read it  read it again Vonnegut was a genius So it goes  This is the first Vonnegut book I ve read and I am surprised at how much I liked it  I always knew it was a war book  but when I heard it was also a time traveling alien book  I was in  The non linear storytelling was deftly written and the bombing of Dresden was so vivid  that I completely understand why this is considered a classic  I read this initially when I was in junior high school  I think  Just reread it and was reminded of how much I enjoy Vonnegut  He has an amazing power for making you laugh at the most tragic things  Like Kilgore Trout  however  his writing comes nowhere close to the power of his ideas  Luckily  he knows this  and makes no bones about it  Vonnegut was my attempt to full fill my need for classic science fiction  So many years wasted not having read this book  FIrst and last chapters show how hard this book was for Vonnegut to write  The Tralfamadorian s show the authors unique perspective on life  war and free will  Which is simply  So it goes  A Must read book  I read this book for my AP Lit class my senior year of high school  I remember unknowingly reading ahead of everyone because I enjoyed the book so much  It was very challenging to read this story in pieces as my instructor encouraged us to  I thought the novel was fast paced and deserved to be read at the pace in which it was intended  War novel  Not particularly interesting  I had heard of this book for a long time  I finally read it  I loved it  The story is all over the place since Billy Pilgrim is involuntarily traveling through time seeing different portions of his own life  You get to see his life in the same way the Tralfamadorian s view their own  all at once Great book  I highly recommend it  Wow what a great read  It s like the simplicity of Hemmingway s wartime writing mixed with the sci fi futuristic style of Ray Bradbury  But this particular  sci fi  book speaks to me on a greater level  because the fantasy world created by Vonnegut certainly creates a metaphor that can make human beings shiver about their existence   I could not put this book down  I was entirely intrigued until I finished reading  It led me to read a dozen or so books by him  and until I got to Bluebeard  I was pretty much transfixed by his writing style and the content of his Fiction  Would definitely recommend to a friend  or even an enemy  Cause ya gotta share the love  duh   Vonnegut is my favorite author  Everything he has written  I have loved  This is a classic and so I feel compelled to  favorite  it  I actually probably liked Hocus Pocus more  but Slaughter House Five was the first Kurt book I read  and I distinctly remember  getting  his style of writing and how he viewed the world  He hates it   This book gave me a good sense of what it might have felt to survive a traumatic event in WWII  Ultimately wished I had read it in a classroom setting  probably American Lit I in college  or along with other people so I could discuss it with someone and really work out the bits and pieces of the book  Still thinking about this one   I wish someone had introduced me to this book earlier  what a great piece of literature  This could possibly be described as a  WWII book    but it s not  It deals with the bombing of Dresden  and while there are many powerful passages regarding that topic  the book itself is about psychology and memories and fear and interpretation  completely amazed by how much I enjoyed this  I ve never considered myself to be a reader of science fiction and war isn t typically a topic I choose to read or enjoy reading  so cleverly written  got through it in two days  probably would have been sooner if I was less busy  highly recommended to people who don t think it s their thing  A book that knows it s a book and yet lives and breathes in your hands  comfortingly revealing the linear concept of time to be nothing more than a human neurosis  I think in Palm Sunday he gives letter grades to all his books  or was it Timequake  My memory   Where am I   Ma   I m dyin  Ma    and I m pretty sure this one got an A  I read Slaughterhouse Five because I found out that it was the source of one of my favorite quotes of recent years  It was on the door of a  hippee van  that was parked across the street from my abode  On the driver s side door was painted  Everything was beautiful and nothing hurt    it was my first Vonnegut book  It did not disappoint  I m so lucky to have stumbled on this book at such a young age  Slaughterhouse Five is at times funny  beautiful and awe inspiring  It played a large part in forming my personal philosophy and political stance  I became socially conscious in junior high thanks to Kurt Vonnegut  I just wish I had the chance to thank him personally  This cult classic is a darkly hilarious  cynical  absurdist romp following World War II soldier Billy Pilgrim as he becomes unstuck in time and ricochets from decade to decade of his life  in no particular order   most poignantly during the gruesome firebombing of Dresden  A powerful anti war novel  this is Vonnegut at his best  Jumping through time within your own life which causes him to live a non linear existence has resulted in Slaughterhouse Five being source material for every time travel book since I read this book right before reading Torchwood  Trace Memory which is based on the same principles of Slaughterhouse Five  One of my all time favorite books  Vonnegut is a master  In his witty  sci fi way  he is a social commentator of the highest order  giving a fresh look at the way we see our lives  our impact  and our development  And now  Lost is borrowing the  unstuck in time  concept  so let s see if Desmond ends up in an Alien Zoo or World War II    I ve finally read the book I ve heard so much about  Funny  I ve read at least 3 other Vonnegut books but never this one  I m always impressed by Kurt but I was unprepared for this one  My favorites scenes are stealing the syrup and the reverse war movie  Because of this work  I d place Vonnegut up there with Faulkner and Steinbeck  I think the genre could only be described as anti war literature with a science fiction twist  Yummm This is a story within a story and generally  and non sequentially  follows the life of Billy Pilgrim  a WWII prisoner of war  The novel deals with death lightly  matter of factly because  as you ll hear over and over again  so it goes  I read this during my high school Vonnegut obsessed phase  and it s still my favorite of his books  The most lasting image for me is that of the main character ending up reliving the happiest moment of his life over and over again in the afterlife  I d like to reread this now that I m older  and see if it still has the same resonance    This book is probably in my top 3  What can I say about the sheer genius that Vonnegut was able to convey in his heartbreaking anti war message  I promise that you will laugh and laugh  but silently to yourself  Then  you will examine yourself with questions regarding time  mortality  humanity  and the moral compass of your soul  One of my favorite books of all time by my absolute favorite author of all time  This book is both a perfect introduction and a master class in Vonnegut  This man changed the way I think about and look at the world  To me  this book is required reading for everyone on the planet  And if Vonnegut is right  maybe a few others  I love LOVE LOVE Vonnegut  Definitely going to give his work more attention in the future because his writing is so so great  It is an amazing novel  It gives you a lot to think about  Hilarious I read this book in high school for a class called  Literature of Alienation   I think this book goes better when you have someone to discuss it with  I still like the character of Billy Pilgrim  but strangely  it seems his knowledge of Time Travel makes him a spectator rather than a participant in the world  More later   Another great Vonnegut novel     it was really interesting to read this novel after reading several other Vonnegut stories  This novel was written later in Vonnegut s career and he brings characters from other novels into this story  Perhaps he does this in other novels as well  this is just the first time I found it   Brutal  Hilarious  Sobering  I won t read it again  but I m glad to have read it once  All the happy parts make you cry  All the sad parts make you giggle  It s that kind of bitter satire  People would be surprised if they knew how much in this world was due to their prayers     billy pilgrim s mom  slaughterhouse 5  As soon as I started Slaughterhouse Five I expected to love it  and that s just what happened  The idea of Billy Pilgrim being such a normal guy  yet being abducted being one of the only humans that understands  time travel  is amazing  I think the story is highly entertaining and Vonnegut has the right touch of dark humor   I learned that I need to read more Vonnegut  Very easy to read and enjoy  I just get the feeling that I m missing lots of meaning or symbolism or something that s in there  I think I need to ditch that unnecessary worry and just enjoy the humorous  fatalistic way he deals with various subjects  Such as war in this case  I love the sub title  The temperature at which books burn  I could never bring myself to throw a book in a fire  Not even a Rush Limbaugh book  Fahrenheit 451I just realized I wrote a review of the wrong book  DAMN IT  The only good thing that came from being a TA for Mrs  Giotta circa 88 89  besides staring at Lori O Keefe s ass   She recommended I read this book  Actually  she recommended the AP class to read the book  I believe I was the only one to heed  Vonnegut still my favorite author and this was the book that popped my cherry  POP   I find it nearly impossible to write a review for questionably my favorite book ever  Basically this is an absolute must read  It will likely hook you to Vonnegut s style like it did me  Regardless  I will forever be a literary nerd and am looking forward to tattooing so it goes somewhere on my body in the very near future  Definitely one of my favorite books  Vonnegut s critique on human tendencies to want and need explanations for everything are very relevant  He toys with the idea of fate and free will  interestingly  and my favorite thing about it is probably how this novel is historical  anti war  and science fiction all in one  Great read  This is without a doubt one of the best books I have ever read  I read this a long time ago and have been yearning to read it again  have thought about it ever since  and watched the movie several times  The best anti war book  which I believe is actually based on Vonnegut s own experiences  to ever have been written  One of the most interesting anti war books one can read  Vonnegut doesn t so much speak out against war but against our ingrained human ignorance and foolish values  Vonnegut exposes the absurdity of war  but shows that the true tragedy of war is that it shows humans to be the stupidly absurd  convention bound species we are  Aparentemente  o livro n apresenta nada demais  Vonnegut Jr  ficcionaliza sua participacao na segunda guerra mundial e testemunha o ataque a cidade de Dresde  Alemanha   Com sobreposicao de tempo e espaco o autor confere um belo relato do que consiste um ser humano no mundo pos guerra  isso e o que o torna tao fascinante   By far my favorite book    It s an excellent anti war story while still being the kooky and fun sci fi romp you d expect from Vonnegut  Moments of heart shattering beauty tragedy    And truly absurd moments sometimes on the same page at a passage that made you tear up  Truly a masterpiece  Don t skip the author s forward    A strange and thought provoking book  I highly recommend it  especially if your life feels crazy and out of control  I never thought a Kurt Vonnegut book could be a  self help  book  but this one has done so much for me during a time in my life that seems filled with both some of the best moments and some of the worst ones   I was speechless with this book  It was so well written   engaging from start to finish  Very dark  but funny  disturbing and uncomfortable  It s not a very challenging book  The meanings of the symbols and the structure is understandable  I highly recommend this to anyone who are looking for something different  Just read it  Vonnegut has an incredibly distinctive style of writing that I really enjoy  This might be my favorite work of his  it is so dark  yet comical  and frankly  very weird  I think I might re read this right now  I decided to make my first Vonnegut a classic  and it was a good choice  I m still digesting this  and will probably be mulling it over for a while  but it s a deeply personal and detailed look at the horrors of World War II and the bombing of Dresden  and one man s attempt to re find  normal  after implausibly surviving both  One of those books that just grabs you by the heart It leaves an impression you can t shake of the real cost of war I have the 25th anniversary edition a tresured addition to my library  Also see Galapagos by the same author an acerbic trip backwards in evolution nihilistic but funny and meaningfulto our time  Among my favorite pieces of literature ever  Vonnegut s ability to weave unceasing humor with deeply affecting pathos is a marvel to behold  Within this short novel  he explores an abundance of human emotion  all while telling a slapstick  slightly disturbing  but mostly absurdist tale of a man unstuck in time and space  I am a die hard Vonnegut fan  so I picked this up and bought it at a recent library sale  It s the first time I ve re read it since high school  and it is great  naturally  How are his books so simple and so genius all at once This one has a special oomph  as much of it is based upon Vonnegut s actual war experiences  Strange  science fiction laced anti war message book  but for the life of me I will never understand why in high school if you read Vonnegut in public you are considered shockingly intelligent  He s a good writer  he s funny  and he has written some neat books  but there s more challenging stuff out there  kids  Really  I reread this again for the umpteenth time  I still think it s terrific  However  it felt a bit different  The funny parts still made me laugh  but the sad parts more sorrowful  My favorite passage in fiction remains the description of Billy Pilgrim becoming unstuck in time and seeing the war documentary backwards   I can t remember a time when I picked up a book and insisted on reading it from front to back in one day  It was a mere 200 and short pages  but if there is no foot hold there is no danger  I will surealy read this one again  It goes on my top shelf like a good bottle of whiskey  I wish I had found Vonnegut earlier  kurt vonnegut is amazing  crazy  poignant  funny  and philosophical all at the same time  My favorite part was the image of Billy Pilgrim watching a war film in reverse  It stuck in my head  it was so beautifully done  and i think it would be a fun writing exercise to give a class  i might try it  lets all try it  it s a story bound by time and at the same time it s far from linear  You re told how the book starts and how it ends during the first chapter  You  along with Billy Pilgrim  experience his life through jumps in time and no matter how ridiculous or sad or peaceful that moment is  you always know that so it goes  Amazing   You know  if Billy Pilgrim had just written a novel about his ideas about war  space and time instead of sneaking onto radio shows and writing inflamatory letters he might have been seen as an imaginative literary genius instead of as a crazy damaged person       oh wait This is a book I would save in a fire  Vonnegut s writing  I think  is an acquired taste  But it s one worth developing  He was one of our most original authors  and this story of soldier Billy Pilgrim s spontaneous time traveling is the best example of how he juxtaposes fantasy with real life  comedy with tragedy  and the absurd with the common   This book changed the way that I read  I used to always have to search for a point or deeper meaning but this book  because of it s themes and structure  made me realize that it s more about the experience  It s funny and thought provoking for it really makes you question what we define as reality and living   I loved how he had history in here too  not quite as depressing as Sirens of Titans because of the resigned tone  but definitely lots of fascinating ideas about time  human dignity in the face of atrocity  and the futility of resistance to the inevitable order of the universe  actually  I loved it  And so it goes  Kurt  you so crazy  I wanna have yo baby Turns out this is one of those pesky little books that seem so simple on the surface and you read it in one sitting and then everyday for the rest of your life you see it reflected in facets of your experience and you are amazed and pleased and also a little sad  So it goes  I was a Vonnegut virgin before reading this book  and I don t think I ll ever be the same  This guy defines modernism  for literature and cinema  Chuck Palainuk and many other owe their niche to Vonnegut  who created it with this book  his story of his experience in the firebombing of Dresden during World War II   My introduction to Kurt Vonnegut    I appreciate his clarity of thought and simplistic approach  I love his humanity and his ability to find humor even where it seems none could exist  His writing style is very approachable  I like the way he tells a story  I burn through his books faster than any other author  This book was recommended to me by my Philosophy of Mind lecturer  on the subject of perdurantism he referred to the tramalfadorians in the book as seeing the universe in a similar way  Along with being a very enjoyable sci fi book  it also helped me see things in a different light  I can t recommend it enough    Chris Zawodniak turned me on to this book in high school  and I think about it all the time  A teacher once told me that you have to read Vonnegut before you turn thirty  and I m so glad I did  Incidentally  the movie by Stanley Kubrick exactly captures the sense of light in the city of Dresden  And so it goes  I read Slaughterhouse Five this weekend and all I can really say is an inarticulate  wow   Rare is the book that can change your perspective so quickly and effectively that even the view from a much beloved couch seems different I feel different  I was a different therapist in the room today because of it Amazing  I loved  loved  LOVED this book  This is one of those kinds of books that changes flavor on multiple reads  The plot line is constructed in the most Trafalmadorian way  scattered bits of a life presented seemingly arbitrarily  forming a complete man who survived a war  Will always survive the war  And so on   This is one of my all time favorite books  It made me think  question  laugh  cry  and nod in recognition  From the moment I finished this book  I immediately set out on a quest to read all of Vonnegut s novels  An amazing writer with a truly fresh take on life  Just finished reading this again  better every time  I think what I learned from Vonnegut was the way that comedy and tragedy could work together  The crazy juxtapositions that he creates seem so unlikely when described from the outside  but from within his novels  and this one especially  it all makes sense  This made me want to read Vonnegut again for more insights   An unforgettable  heartfelt snapshot of the life of a man who may or may not have come unhinged in time  and may or may not have been captured by aliens who see into the fourth dimension   Slaughterhouse Five  is one of the rare SF books that truly transcend the genre to produce a unique argument on human nature  A mind bending  thoughtful read that will leave you wondering about the natures of time and space  Vonnegut delves into these topics with a witty  unorthodox  but totally Vonnegut approach  and serves up a delightful piece of fiction    because that was the way the book was structured to be for that moment in time    Vonnegut s writing style is extremely easy to read and very interesting  I wish he ended this book with a bit more detail on all the various stories  but it was definitely enjoyable  Wonderfully dark wit  His style of writing in short  halting paragraphs slowed down the narrative though  While this style allowed for stronger impact of points and punchlines  it was distracting  jagged  and somewhat discouraging  I had trouble maintaining interest  but I did eventually finish it and I m glad I did  What can I say about this book  It skyrocketed to the top of my favorite books list as soon as I put it down  I think what I like most about it is how it carries you along as a sort whimsical  comedic story and then BAM  Out of nowhere you find yourself deeply moved by just how profound it all is  Amazing  How can I rate this book  I really can t  This is one of the best books I have read  The way the author makes such terrible situations seem so humorous  how anti government he is  for very good reasons   The book mixes war  with death  with aliens    so strange  but works so well  Everyone should read this book  Easily one of my favorite books ever  Life is not fair  it can be cruel  and the universe certainly does have a way of picking on everyone  I love the imagination  and I love that life makes fun of you no matter how serious the situation  Also  the thing with the horse photo  what was that   It still amuses me  A great book about World War II and time travel  The main character keeps bouncing through time so the book reads in a schizophrenic haze of death and despair  The books not all depressing  but there is quite a bit of social commentary and bad things happen to pretty much everybody  I highly recommend this book  One of the most powerful condemnations of the insanity of war from a man who lived through the horrors of the second  war to end all wars     a must read for anyone who thinks war is simply about patriotic words  collateral damage  and the death of others we do not know but have been taught by our leaders to hate  One of my favorite books of all time    I d say my favorite book by Vonnegut  but I love Breakfast of Champions and Cat s Cradle as well  Tough choice  This one is more autobiographical than the others  Somehow his dark satire is even darker in this book    probably because it is based on real life and a real war  This was really brilliant  Vonnegut writes like an odd cross between Douglas Adams and George Orwell  I was surprised that a book could be about time travel and aliens as well as World War 2 and the destruction of Dresden  and for it to actually work  Philosophical thought  humor and tragedy all balanced perfectly   Loved this  Couldn t put it down  Sorry kej  for finishing so soon  Truly an outstanding antiwar book that makes you laugh to yourself when you shouldn t and cry when you aren t sure  I also appreciated the references to indianapolis and iowa city  Much less important than the story  but made me feel famous  Not enough can be said of this book  It s funny  serious  sad  happy all in one Kurt outdid himself by being honest and open  yet distant at the same time  I felt like I knew who Billy Pilgrim was  yet I didn t know anything about him  I felt for him  He was the Lester Burnham before there was Lester Burnham   It begins like this Listen Billy Pilgrim has come unstuck in time It ends like this Poo tee weet  Personally  I liked Cat s Cradle and Sirens of Titan better  but this is certainly top notch Vonnegut  Looking forward to visiting his memorial in Indianapolis soon So it goes  Very entertaining  one of my new favorites  I was pleasantly surprised by the unexpected sci fi element since I heard much of the subject matter was about WWII  Tralfamadorians have given me a very interesting new philosophy to ponder    I can t think about death and time the same way anymore  So it goes  Partly a story about a man in war  partly a science fiction story about a man and plunger shaped aliens  Both equally unbelievable  but sadly one of them is true  It s a remarkable feat to talk about such a tragedy in such light and sparkling language  This contrast gives the book great power and impact  So it goes  I sat down  buckled my seatbelt and took the ride of Slaughterhouse 5  Bizarre  insightful and black humor abounds  I ve read Vonnegut before and I ll read him again and I think I ll always finished his books by saying   what the hell was that  but I m pretty sure I liked it   So it goes       Best Vonnegut ever  The irony is  it seems like he probably hated it  I really like how Billy Pilgrim is the antithesis of a hero without being an anti hero  more like an un hero Also  the idea of making up a sci fi writer just to come up with book ideas instead of actually writing them is pretty useful   Highly recommended  I love the way that Vonnegut plays with narrative time  and the function of a story within a story is clever and delightful  Reading this  you never knew what to expect  which is really what a book should be like  Wow  What a book   is it a war story  sci fi  or the psychotic ravings of the mentally ill  It follows the out of sync life of Billy Pilgrim   from family life in the US  to the fire bombing of Dresden  to the distant planet of Tralfamadore  and of course to slaughterhouse number five  And so it goes    I loved this book   it s so strange and in such fractured pieces  It s so completely unbelievable and yet it s perfectly easy to read and understandable in some emotional  intuitive way   I can t imagine the mind that could manipulate all those little pieces and bring them together in such a poignant way   Mezcla fabulosa de ciencia ficcion  humor negro y literatura de la II Guerra Mundial  Mas profunda y humana que muchas otras que he leido de la IIGM  Es el gemelo irreverente de Catch 22 y eso ya es decir mucho  Literatura de un autor que no respeta al establishment pero tampoco trata de ser un rebelde  It was like reading  Watchmen  with a much higher sentimental level  Random but poignant and beautifully inspiring  And the best thing of all things  Now I know exactly what to say whenever I pray to God I couldn t find any reason to not to include this terrific title into my favourite book list  Vonnegut says things that no one else dares say about war  He jokes about those same things in the next sentence  You can t tell if he s trying to be crude  or if he s simply stating the facts  His character development is so unusual that it forces you to focus on the events instead of the feelings  Vonnegut shows how varying the chronology is supposed to be done  A story where the sci fi helps with the historical  where the emotional dislocation of surviving the fire bombing of Dresden can only be explained by comparing it to appearing in an extraterrestrial zoo  Beautiful  sad  and funny   Simply the greatest  Vonnegut write in short choppy paragraphs often jumping to and fro in time much like his characters  He wrote this because  I had a lot of shit in my head   it is at once tragic  hilarious  autobiographical  with Martians   and relevant and accessible to all generations  So it goes  This book was entertaining on many levels  It was like an onion with many layers and contained history  sci fi  humor and the typical family drama  I was moved to read it because of a book ban article and I am glad I did  When someone tells me I can t read something   you bet I WILL  And so it is    Quite a special unique book  At times I wasn t sure if the author has gone crazy or if there s something I am not getting  Quite a lot of time traveling and other unusual things you would not expect in an anti war novel  But at the end all  clicked  nicely and the book leaves you with really moving feelings  I read previously that it was in the same vein as Catch 22 which I read about 2 years ago I liked Catch 22 but found it quite hard to read  Couldn t help being bored at times  No such thing here  The style is dry  no flourish  to the point  it leaves you as any great book should leave you   amazed   This is my number one book to fall back on when I need a quick  comforting read  I am sure that is not where most people would go as a description of Slaughterhouse Five but the story is just so wonderful and the message isn t quite what I d call anti war  more like  death isn t to be feared   So it goes  I honestly could not put this book down  I was reading it in every spare moment I had  and not because I hadn t started it and I had to have it finished for my previous English class  There are so many different layers to the story that I wouldn t be surprised to find new elements if I read it a second time  The subtitle  A Children s Crusade  is very explanatory  War is fought by children  young men and women who are sent to give their lives for something they do not yet understand  It is a horrible situation  and I feel there is a lot more validity hearting this from someone who experienced war himself  A brilliant post modern novel  Easy to read  laugh out loud funny  and deceptively simple  It is the kind of book that makes you say  I could have written that  Don t believe it  You couldn t  Like I said  it seems easy  it s not  Brilliantly mixing science fiction with satire  Vonnegut is our modern Twain   This is the second time that I have read this book and I m still greatly moved by it  You travel back and forth in time along with Billy Pilgrim as he lives and  relives  joys and traumas in his life  The book leaves you with an appreciation for life and an a great sorrow for the devestation of war  Billy Pilgrim has become unstuck in time    Vonnegut s greatest novel holds up the life of a man as if it were a faceted jewel  Sewn with Vonnegut s real life war experiences  Slaughterhouse Five is also a glimpse at a lost world  Dresden  and the delicate moments we string together and call memories  Just re read this  one of my all time favorite books  with my daughter  who read it for the first time  Still a great story told in Vonnegut s incredible style  The horrifying details of war are juxtaposed with the absurdity of human behavior  and presented in the context of travel through time and space  A very unique book written by an unconventional author  His writing can be darkly humorous but also be deeply thought provoking at the same time  I enjoyed this book because its themes were unique and its setting  characters different to anything I had read before  Read some more of Vonnegut s books too  Smart  funny  highly accessible  easy to read  and very sad in some ways too  Finally finished this book and I quite loved it   You ll pretend you were men instead of babies  and you ll be played in the movies by Frank Sinatra and John Wayne or some of those other glamorous  war loving  dirty old men  And war will look just so wonderful  so we ll have a lot more of them  And they ll be fought by babies like the babies upstairs   One of the few required novels I ve had to read with a character I can relate to  another one off the top of my head is A Prayer For Owen Meany    A story with humorous sub plots and individual characters  but with a sad overall story of a man s life before and after a traumatic war time experience   Everyone should read a kurt vonnegut book at some point  This fellar is of his rocker  and I love it  He manages to add humour to the brutal horror of war  whilst still maintaining respect  Hats of to the guy  as he served during the second world war  probably what sent him aff his chump right enough  I can t remember the last time I read a book that made me nod and grin like a fool   Yes  That s it  exactly  How did he find the words to articulate my jumbled thoughts   Like a contemporary Dostoevsky  I can say  This man understands  Well  unfortunately  that should be  understood   So it goes  While Slaughterhouse 5 is credited as being his best book  I do not agree that it is his best  While it certainly was Vonnegut s first book in such a daring style  he continued to improve after writing it  Still  I have read it two or three times and denying its greatness would be a dead lie  So it goes  How had I not read Vonnegut until now    His writing is just like I want mine to be    funny  insightful  poignant  and then funny again  You have to be a master in order to mix aliens who put humans in zoos and the horrific bombing of Dresden during WWI  yet still manage to weave hilarity into the mix  This book was not what I thought it would be  It was definitely an adventure and a lesson in detachment  It was amazing how he created the character of Billy to emotionally tell the story of his times in war  I love how it s all depersonalized by simply saying  And I was right there A must read  A fascinating read full of serendipitous moments  like being sucked into a time warp  Though described as an anti war book  Slaughterhouse Five is creative and surprising  darkly comedic  and has an awesome science fiction edge  Throughly enjoyed reading it  Kurt Vonnegut has an addictive style of writing   RE READ FOR PURPOSES OF RESEARCH PAPER I love everything Slaughterhouse Five  I love the narrative structure  which isn t really a structure at all  I love the birds  Billy Pilgrim s porn star baby maker on Tralfamadore loves the bees  and everybody loves the Shetland pony  What isn t there to love  Absolutely amazing  That s all I can say  Though it was sad and depressing sometimes  there were definitely some funny moments  This is one of those books that you just read and it makes you so much more aware of things  I don t know how to explain it but I know that I would recommend this to anyone   So it goes The book started off in a fashion which irritated me   an author telling a story about how he needs to write a story  But the book quickly turned into the brilliant tales of a man who doesn t  always  never wanted to live  Vonnegut s book considers time  war  life and love with complexity  Slaughterhouse Five is one of my favorite books of all time  As a history fanatic I completely enjoyed Vonnegut s rather unique way of showing the horror of being in Dresden during the carpet bombing  This book blew me away when I first read it in high school and it s still a fantastic book to re read  Vonnegut at his comical best  Tying in space and time travel as a sort of extra nuance as if it s nobody s business  but still convey a sense of dread in his lead roles  Vonnegut can make you read a mile a minute  This mile might need to be re read a couple times  but I believe that s part of his genius  My 15 year old nephew put my mother  his grandmother  in a flood of tears when he said he d go fight in Iraq  He received a copy of S 5 from me that Christmas  I decided to re read it then as well  It s a strange and powerful novel that leaves you with one conclusion  War is absurd So it goes  When Vonnegut passed we lost a national treasure  His thank you librarians who wouldn t give up personal info for the Patriot Act touched my heart  Randomly  apparently Vonnegut was a temp in a lab where his brother worked for IBM  doing mad scientist first generation geo engineering crap circa WWII  This is the first Vonnegut book I ve read and I m now a fan  This is a story about the bombing of Dresden  WWII   alien abductions  becoming  unstuck in time   as well as war  death   so it goes    life  free will  God  time  etc  I loved Vonnegut s writing style and humor  Definitely a classic  Perhaps the first truly post modern novel  this is a brilliant analysis of the psychological effects of war on an ordinary man  It is horrifying and hilarious  sweet and bitter  and it expertly blurs the distinction between autobiography and fiction  Oh  and there are aliens who look like plungers   Classic  Vonnegut is such a skilled story teller  Once again  he takes you on a tumultuous ride  flashing between present day and WWII Germany as his hero has become  unstuck in time   Vonnegut is unparalleled in his cleverness and creativity when weaving this tale  He s simply one of a kind  Awesome exploration of war traumas through fiction  Easy to read  almost as if Vonnegut had written a light tale  but it s a pacifist novel  with a bit of autobiography and even meta fiction  It s a true masterpiece  that shows Vonnegut s talent  making an easy read out of something so complex  Beklemmend en beangstigend  In hallucinerende stijl beschrijft hij wat hem is overkomen tijdens zijn krijgsgevangschap in Dresden tijdens de tweede Wereldoorlog  Zeer indrukwekkend  Vertaling viel ietsje tegen  Zinnen liepen niet allemaal even lekker  Ondanks dit minpuntje toch fantastisch There s certainly nothing that I can say that hasn t already been said about Slaughterhouse Five  This was my first Vonnegut novel  but it certainly will not be my last  Absolutely remarkable  Perhaps I will have more to say after it has finished sinking in Recommended for  everyone  Seriously  I was not entertained with this book at first  But in the end  it s seemingly trivial and satirical nature turned out to fit it perfectly  The tralfamadorians sure taught me a few things  Just read it  No matter what you will walk away with some new knowledge so why not go ahead and read it  Funny  sad  sharp  chaotic  and pretty much perfect  Is it an anti war book  Meditation on the meaning of eternity and our place in it  Is it about the nature of death  which is all around us  all the time  Or is it all of the above  Whatever it is  it s one of the best novels I ve ever read  Fucking amazing  I am so full of feels that I can not talk about this book properly  Perhaps the most amazing book I ve read about World War II at least as an anti war book dealing with mental wellness of the ex soldiers  A must read for every history lover  Really  I m OK   And he was  too  except that he could find no explanation for why the song had affected him so grotesquely  He had supposed for years that he had no secrets from himself  Here was proof that he had a great big secret somewhere inside  and he could not imagine what it was  Five word review  Chaotic classic  So it goes  Wow   cannot believe it took me so long to get around to this one  I will be teaching this next week and I am humbled and scared to do so  Because of the brilliant humor  I feel any attempt to discuss it will be like explaining a good joke    you just don t do it  You either get it or you don t  Its a strange book   I would have said that it was partly about the effects of war on a person  but everyone else seems to take the time travel component at face value  Even though I was wondering if I missed the point  it was still an enjoyable book  Vonnegut s writing style is very enjoyable  Absolutely brilliant  The way that Vonnegut writes about the Tralfamadorians as an allegory for what is happening in the rest of the story is fabulous  I was impressed with the straight forward and clear writing  There is nothing overly pompous or complex in this book  but it is brilliant  Geez  Good  Not a single sentence in the book that makes you reconsider what you ve started  Each word is like a wormhole that sucks you into the next one  like it or not  And if you don t know what it s about  don t look it up  because chances are that you won t want to read it then   Slaughter House Five is by far the most interesting book I have ever read You never know where the main character is going to end up next  From the present to being on an alien planet the author takes the main character to several different settings to show different themes through out the book  First time I d read this since an undergraduate module that had it as required reading  and I definitely enjoyed it more  which isn t to say I didn t love it before   Utterly masterful in the way it balances laugh out loud humor with the absurd and alien imagery of war   Um  indeed  Billy  This is a must read for everyone  Vonnegut is a master in making you care about nonredeemable characters and sprinkles on hope just when you think there s no good fighting the good fight  I have read this book three times now  It will likely reach my  comfort reading  shelf before too long   My first Vonnegut read  and it was over all too soon  I loved this book  and the blend of science fiction with detailed description of the Dresden bombings  I finished it in a weekend  and it really gave me an appetite to read for pleasure  Good mix of comedy and tragedy  go read it right now  I found it as one of most illuminating books about the disgusting nature of war  It was humorous at the same time  if I remember correctly Was it ICC  and not a tribunal of victors  in charge WWII crimes  Trueman and Churchill would have probably gotten life for Dresden  Hiroshima and Nagasaki  So it goes  Hands down my favorite Vonnegut novel  A crazy trip through time and space  Billy Pilgrim s story provides a pragmatic and cynical  yet hopeful and optimistic view of the chaos that is life  I read it again and again and always come away with some little nugget of knowledge   Billy Pilgrim s  unstuck  trip trhough his own life changed my view of the way we live our lives and the way we perceive everything around us  The joy  fear  freedom and tragedy of seeing existence as a whole make his journeys through his own life an homage and a map to the american life  my favorite book in the world  I have the gravestone w  everything was beautiful and nothing hurt  as a tattoo lol  If I could read nothing but this till I die I m fine w that  I think that this  maaayyb  combined w  Welcome to the Monkey House is the best creative fiction in the last 50 100 years  Tonight I completed Slaughterhouse Five     I ve never read anything like this  I heard about this book because of it s considered one of the greatest English books ever written  The writing in this book kills the writing from books I enjoyed just a few weeks ago  ie The Hunger Games   So it goes  Vonnegut has a great sense of humor and an offbeat philosophy that he works into his books without being preachy or obtuse  a difficult task  Reading his books I ve often felt that he was putting words to things that I have been waiting for the words for  This is my favorite of his books   As with all of Vonnegut s work  you have to be on your toes and carefully follow  I really tried to imagine what someone would have thought reading it when he first released it  I cannot imagine any WWII vet painting a picture or describing the war with that kind of language or description  From the very start this book will grab you and simply won t let go  A wonderful mesh of realistic accounts from the bombing of Dresden during the second world war and some thought provoking sci fi elements that really create a memorable  beautiful and scary story  A must read for everyone   Even given some outlandish threads  the attitude with which Vonnegut approaches war  life  and death provokes interpretation from the reader  I flip between trying to find the hidden meaning and underlying messages  and wondering if it s supposed to be taken at face value It s on Gutenburg  I learned that Kurt Vonnegut is a complete genius and masterful writer  The first Vonnegut book I read was Sirens of Titan and that hooked me to Vonnegut  I have read and reread a lot of his books throughout the years and it seems like a fresh read everytime  Always get something new out of it  I honestly stayed away from this book for a while because the synopsis is hard to wrap your mind around but as always Vonnegut makes the unreal and unimaginable come to life in a strange and warped tale  Sometimes the plot summary doesn t tell the whole story  It s worth a read and a re read   It s the third time I read it and I like it even more  Reading it in Germany was a little awkward though   Vonnegut has an incredible imagination  but the absurdity of his characters situations have pretty deep meanings  and of course can be hilarious   in a very black humor kind of way  One of the finest books about war ever written  Vonnegut provides a tragic book that doesn t provoke crying  A funny book that you don t really want to laugh at If you can only read one book this summer  read Harry Potter  If you can read two books  read Harry Potter and Slaughterhouse Five  Not only is this Vonnegut s best novel  it is also his most important novel  Every young American should read it as it makes for a great gateway from young adult fiction into the world of adult fiction  and it imparts information that helps one move from childhood into adulthood  The main thing to remember about this book is that it gives an altered perspective    not a plot twist  not a story telling device   but a plain old imaginative plot change that is entirely mind blowing   I found Slaughterhouse five s non chronological narrative interesting  Along with it s themes including  the lack of free will and how war is a destructive force  All in all this is a great book if you re into  Post Modern Fiction  MetaFiction  Fiction about War  and Science Fiction  Excellent  easy to read book  The style reminded me of Catch 22  Rereading this book reminds me that Kurt Vonnegut was an amazing genius way ahead of his time  I recommend reading Mother Night and God Bless You Mr  Rosewater before Slaughterhouse Five in order to better understand the character references made from both books  beyond Kilgore Trout   Good but a little confusing I could not put this book down  I love the story and how it bounced between past  present  and future  It is simply a classic story and one that I will be adding to my actual bookshelves soon   I think I cared more about Billy Pilgrim than any other character I ve encountered  What a long strange trip  I loved every page of this book  One of the best books I have ever read  Vonnegut is a fresh and enlightening story teller   although he is a bit on the cynical side  I truly like his style  Even if he is a crazy old man  This story of war and death is a good read  and important read  but not for the feint of heard   I really liked this book  Kurt Vonnegut has a style of writing that just resonates with me  I couldn t put this book down and I loved every single minute of it  His outlook on religion is definitely my favorite aspect of his novels  It is not uncommon to hear me saying  So it goes   This is the first book I read by Kurt Vonnegut and I simply loved it  The best way I can describe it is as a really witty inside joke from which the reader is never left out  I really liked the author s straightforward  punchy style  and I m really itching to read more of his works  When I found stacks of this book in my high school library  unused  I had to read it  When I d read it and learned that these books would  never  be used at my small town  conservative high school  I had to steal it  It s the only book I ve ever stolen in my life and I AM NOT SORRY  Ha  I gripping account of a soldiers Post Traumatic Stressdisorder or a similiar mental healt issue  Probably long before it was seriously considered as a mental health issue  Billy Pilgrim certainly reminded me of guys I met from the Vietnam fun house while I was in service at that time  I read this book in 3 hours  The first hour during various 10 minute breaks at work and the next 2 on the subway  Vonnegut is like a fantastic modern version of Voltaire s satire  Neitzche s aphorisms and something all his own  I have yet to find a more unique and fantastic author   I ve read this book in high school and again as an adult and found it amazing both times  I love the way vonnegut writes  it s on so many levels  I think I could read it again and gotten more out of it  He hooked my with his writing on this book and have been a fan ever since   Even though some of the contextual information about the firebombing of Dresden is less than accurate  the overall effect of the book is questioning what we think we know and how we know it  I especially like how Trafalmadorians complicate the notion of time and our concept of the past  Slaughterhouse Five is a terrific book  I read this in parallel with Life After Life   review coming soon  edited to remove an embarrassingly wrong statement  Thanks  Suzanne   I had zero expectations  I was completely surprised at first by how odd ball it was  but then by how intriguing it became  Such an all over the place read  but very captivating and provoking  When I finished it I said aloud  wow  What a book   it was good  very good  upon reflection   I love this book  I love Kurt Vonnegut  He writes the way I think sometimes   random things thrown in here and there  sometimes jumping from one story to the next and then back again  and inserting weird drawings from time to time  Very different from any other author I ve ever read  One of my favourite books  Non linear  funny  and I still  to this day  can t get over the aliens with their living in the past present future at all times philosophy  This book discusses the horrors of war  time travel  and learning how to accept the crap that is life as is  Love this  KV manages to make the story of a World War II Veteran who has come unstuck in time and been kidnapped by aliens as he relives the horrors of his wartime experiences believable  The humanness in the detail makes the world of Billy Pilgrim feel as real as any other part of our own world  Absolute classic from beginnin to end  One book that would have no question about whether it was included in my top 3 books of all time  Funny and harrowing  Managing to combine a second world war memoir with a time travel and alien sci fi  And just as bizarre as all that sounds to boot  One of my all time favorite authors  This is everything you could ask for in a book  A classic  a must read  funny and heartbreaking  How can you not love a book that strikes a balance between the crushing realities of war  death and loss with humor  aliens and time travel  That is all  I think I avoided reading this in the past because I thought it was a  war book   I only recently found out that it also featured aliens and time travel   sign me up  An often funny and touching look at life and the meaning of death  I can see a re read of this again sometime soon  A very readable  well written novel by a modern American master  Funny  poignant  insightful about the lives we lead and the absurd horrors of war s mass destruction  I wholeheartedly recommend it  A great book that helped me to love reading  I would suggest this to anyone who wants to start reading Vonnegut  This is one of the most humorous and definitely one of the most random book I have ever read  Yet throughout the memories of tralfamadores and the war    There is a underlying message to remember every moment  not just the outcomes  I love this book  it is definitely in my top ten  This is a must read  Many people will find this book hard to read because of its nature of being a complete understatement and coming off as a non serious novel  when it is  I don t blame Vonnegut for his syntax because of what he went through in the war  Wonderful Novel  Read it  My first Vonnegut book  and I was definitely not disappointed  I would do a poor job of describing this books plot adequately  So instead I will just say that this book has everything from pondering the meaning of war  to an alien run zoo housing humans  Just read it  It stayed with me  Great book  I love the fact that the story has no linear path and that it does not develop chronologically  Vonnegut has accomplished a very creative method of writing in this book  The satirical humor in this book is hilarious but it also the scary truth  Must read for everyone  I d forgotten how powerful this little anti war book is  Written in starkly simple language  it tells the story of Billy Pilgrim  who comes  unstuck in time   traveling back and forth to different points of his life  including the fire bombing in Dresden where he was a POW  Amazing  I just love Vonnegut s writing  It s so entertaining and insightful  I could barely put this book and was forced to buy it when I lost my library copy because I just couldn t wait for it again  Can t wait to read more of Vonnegut s work  Hopefully  I ll write a better review later  I love Kurt Vonnegut s style  and in this book it gets applied to telling the story of a major moment in World War II that Vonnegut was there to witness  I love the fact that the protagonist is unstuck in time  It s a brilliant concept that is brilliantly employed to tell the story  Fascinating and moving  Another great book I was  forced  to read in college for a class  I found the  supernatural  elements of the novel fitting  considering that part of it  at least  takes place during the war  and the  time traveling  was not difficult to read or understand  Slaughterhouse Five is a very special book to me  What can I say  It s amazing and different to anything I have ever read  The blend of historical fiction and science fiction goes hand in hand perfectly  I love this book and I think everyone should read it  It s wonderfully written  Great book about a man who flashes back and forth between war and being abducted by aliens  who give perspective to the novel   Heard on NPR that a friend  when told by Vonegut that he was writing an anit war book responded   you may as well write an anti glacial book   That s the truth  Vonnegut has a very particular style of humor  tone  and story telling that does not agree with everyone  However  this is a very good book and makes a great argument for looking at our world with different eyes  It is a quick read  so I suggest reading a set of his books at once  Beautiful  if not slightly overrated  Excellent job of capturing the Dresden firebombings during WWII and equally excellent job of making this not a war book  Vonnegut is a good writer  but perhaps the pop culture popularity of this book is what makes it feel somewhat overdone  10 4 07 Time travel AND carpet bombing  Fucking yes 10 29 07 Just started  about a hundred pages in  and I love the casual narrative and  comically pathetic  characters 11 12 07 Done   the shortest review of this book I can give right now is probably  flat out awesome   stark  beautiful  ridiculous  captivating  hilarious  distressing  vonnegut is one of the few who can take a piece of heart wrenching sadness and inject some folly into the heart of it  the result is guilty laughter and a catharsis we all need  with a heavy dose of mindfuck on the side   Loved it again   Saughterhouse  Five is an amazing book that takes you back ad fourth through history and time  It s a psychological read that deals with the concept of war and what it does to people  A stunning read that made me rethink about war and the places you personally put yourself in   Will defo check more Vonnegut soon  Really dug this book  This book is excellent  I personally love war stories  but I d never quite read something like this  The mundane way war and life are described  the concept of time  it just awed me  This book literally changed my life  I see things now under a different light  A MUST read  My new favorite book  Never has any book ever resonated with me on such a line by line basis  Over and over throughout the book  I found moments that had me nodding along  or pausing in thought  or marking for later musing  5 stars  and I can t wait to find more Vonnegut  There s really no way for me to review Kurt Vonnegut  you either get him or you don t  His writings came to me at the perfect time of life and his words have meant more to me than almost any others  Enough to tattoo them on myself  So  I may not be the most objective reviewer   My second reading of this  The first was when I was in my twenties and my perspective on war and many things was different  Amazing how 40 years of  maturity  provided me with a more compassionate view especially for the soldiers  Loved how Vonnegut told this story  A must read  Soooo good   My favorite Vonnegut  I liked the autobiographical bent and enjoyed reading Kurt s account of the Allied atrocity at Dresden  I know  I know the Nazis were bad but the poor people of Dreseden only made bombs and other munitions  and great porcelain   Deutschland Ubber Alles  I didn t want to put this book down  I was in awe of Vonnegut s skill of weaving time and place and smashing them together in such a way that the reader only cares for the character  It must have taken great skill to manage all the threads he weaved together with out a computer  I once heard a professor of literature say that in 100 years  Vonnegut will be taught in colleges as widely as Shakespeare is  I fully believe him It is a strange story that a darkly humorous and somewhat silly tale can send the most effective anti war message possible   An important book  Strange  sometimes perverted  but an important book nonetheless  I did enjoy reading of Billy Pilgrim s adventures  One of my favorite quotes comes from this book  but that s between me and my husband  inside joke   I definitely recommend reading this book  I have my father to thank for introducing me to Vonnegut  and Ray Bradbury too   and this one is classic  I truly miss this author  always straight with his audience and entertaining  If you ve never read any of his books  go out  right now  and buy some today  I mean that  GO  What a wonderfully insane book  It breaks every rule and manages to create an amazing environment while telling an important story of the futility and illogic of war  Modern and ancient at the same time  Vonnegut forces us to see reality through unbelievable fiction  a gem  loved this book  now i see why vonnegut is such an esteemed american literary figure  slaughterhouse 5 is both funny   sad   expresses anti war beliefs without vilifying the people who make it happen  i m excited to read more by vonnegut  i should have started long ago  Third  maybe fifth reading and the book doesn t get old  Perhaps one of the wisest characters in fiction  Eliot Rosewater  makes this book partciularly memorable  His comment on Kilgore Trout  his ideas are brilliant  if only he could write   stings  provokes  and inspires This is an American clasic and there are much better places to go to get a review than here  I highly recommend this book to anyone with an open mind  It is a deceptively easy read but with plenty of spots where you will just have to stop to evaluate what you just read   2nd read  Still brilliant  And disturbing  Wish I would have gone to see Vonnegut before we lost him  I ve been seeing things about the making of a movie which is why I picked it up again  I just really don t see how a movie of this book would make any sense  LOL  We ll see  I listened to the audiobook  narrated by ethan hawke  Excellent choice for narrator  Of course I read it in high school but it was a delight to re discover this book in audio format  Or maybe I m just a sucker for Ethan Hawke reading me an interesting bedtime story    Kurt Vonnegut acabou de se tornar um dos meus autores preferidos Um dos melhores livros que li ate hoje   Slaughterhouse Five   e uma obra literaria hilariante  comovente  e muitissimo dramatica  que se mantem empolgante da primeira a ultima pagina  Absolutamente imperdivel   All these Vonnegut novels seem the same after a while  but I read this one first  Its probably the best because the whole Dresden firebombing scene is so vivid and concrete compared to a lot of the surreal absurdity Vonnegut s known for  I still can t pronounce  Ttralfamador   If this was the only novel Vonnegut wrote that would have been enough  This absurdist time travel memoir shows human beings for what we are and it is a breathtaking moral statement about our species  If you find yourself in Cody Wyoming just ask for Wild Bob  Poo tee weet  I think this book was really amazing  It had a lot less about the actual bombing than I had thaught there would be  and it was not gory or scary at all  The only parts that made me cringe was when they were describing the horses at the end and the revenge on the dog   Absolutely brilliant writing  The kind of stuff that every war lover    raised on the pop culture heroism from hollywood and the likes    should read  And everyone else  too  Narration is top notch  I listened to audiobook read by Ethan Hawke who has done a marvelous job   This is easily my favorite  war  novel ever  It s deceptively simple  I marvel that some seem to miss it entirely  The absurdist flourishes contrast perfectly with the grim realities of war  until you wish you could withdraw to a distant planet with Pilgrim to escape   Awesomely intriguing throughout  The only awkwardness I brought upon myself by having read S K  s Hearts in Atlantis before reading this  It just seems as though something is out of order in my brain  But the Tralfamadorians would probably disagree on that point  I absolutely loved Vonnegut s writing   She was a dull person  but a sensational invitation to make babies  Men looked at her and wanted to fill her up with babies right away  She hadn t had even one baby yet  She used birth control   I can t wait to read more by vonnegut  Slaughterhouse is my first Vonnegut book  and I thoroughly enjoyed it  There are no standard story or character arcs  but it works well with the themes of the novel  Despite a lack of climactic events  I found myself very involved in the story and wanting to read more  I  like many Americans  had never heard of the fire bombing of Dresden  Germany  Though I found the style to be difficult at first  I found this book to be an eye opener about the US role in WW2  We are not always the heroes our historians want us to think we are  War is ugly  This book is an absolutely hilarious satire  Not only does Vonnegut detail the story of a man who explained Einstein s greatest theories decades before they exists  but he places them in laymans terms  with lots of entertaining doodles and endearing characters A MUST READ   Listen  Billy Pilgrim has become unstuck in time   What a great opening line  I think Time Traveler s Wife tried this concept of weaving past  present and future into a narrative but  in my opinion  never succeeded  Vonnegut s book is raw and real  I loved every page   How nice  to feel nothing  and still get full credit for being alive  This book was read aloud to me  over the phone  It was like actually beingeverywhere the character was  his mind  his location  his  reality  Excellent read  or in my case  listen  So it goes  I love  love  love this book  It s both science fiction and historical fiction with a hint of everything I adore in a book  It s a true page turner and a quick and easy read  I so highly recommend it to anyone and everyone  over a certain age of course  there is some profanity   Vonnegut s a surprisingly easy read  A great book for someone who isn t necessarily literary  but wants to explore classics a little more  He s funny  and sad  and dark  but still manages to make it seem like there s hope left  even after the horrors of WW2  We all miss him  I read this in high school and enjoyed the unorthodox plot  Vonnegut is one of my favorite authors  if just for all of the weirdness he creates in his novels  I have been meaning to re read it  but with so much new material on my list  I m not sure when I ll get around to it  Is it because I ve been thinking about the late Vonnegut recentley that I decided to put this book on my list  Maybe  but either way  it s a great read  probably just because he s a great writer  Keen observations on our absurdities  Need to read more of him  So it goes     I don t know why I never read any Vonnegut before  Slaughterhouse provides an account of WW II  the bombing of Dresden and life in the U S  in the 50s and 60s  It is a great book  The writing is so fresh  the war scenes are so vivid  It left me with a lot to think about   There are no characters in this story and almost no dramatic confrontations  because most of the people in it are so sick and so much the listless playthings of enormous forces  One of the main effects of war  after all  is that people are discouraged from being characters   Fatal  historical  satirical  and well written    Allison  Collection DevelopmentReserve a library copy  Matadouro 5 e um aula de ironia  uma ficcao cientifica despirocada e inteligente e um tratado pacifista tao acido quanto eficaz Merece ser conhecido  estudado e adorado  Vonnegut e sarcastico fazendo voce rir das desgracas e chorar com as alegrias Simplesmente imperdivel  I just re read this for the first time since undergrad circa 1999  It s really good  Water still wet  We read it for book club though so I had to spend a lot of time talking about why Vonnegut is important and how he was adopted by my generation as a spokesman way past his due  rmny st bHth brngyz bh shywh y pst

tthyr gdhr khwd r drd This book was my first introduction to Vonnegut  I chose to read it in high school for my final paper in my AP English class  It also happened to be my teacher s favorite book  No pressure  Turned out I got an  A  on the paper and thus began my love affair with Kurt  My first impression of this book was luke warm  However  after a few months of reflection on it has led me to conclude that it truly is a great book  I will have to pick this up again to see if I can wrap my mind around the tastier nuggets that I only licked prior  m This was my first Vonnegut  and it convinced me to read as many of his books as I could get my hands on  He s great   so weird  and he doesn t ask anyone s permission to do anything  He just owns it Now I like to call him  Kurtie  because I have a little crush on him  I love the concept of time traveling and this book proposed more idea to me  For example  the possibility of the 4th dimension and the inability for humans to grasp that  Also  loved the example of placing a mirror under a dog   and how perhaps  that earth is our mirror    My name is Yon Yonson I work in Wisconsin    And so on into infinity  VonnegutBeautifully written heart breaking tale of Billy Pilgrim and how he becomes unstuck in time  This book could kick Siddartha s ass in a fight  A postmodern classic  Read it  Immediately  Vonnegut has an amazing ability to communicate the tragedy of war in an atypical way  Along with Catch 22  I enjoy this kind of  not your average war book  literature  Would recommend to those who like quirky  often sarcastic  and sometimes saddening stories   I love this book  The first time I read it I was blown away by how imaginative it all ways and how the absurd just sort of made sense to me  This is his most known  and it was the first I d read of Vonnegut  It was so funny that I went back and read it again    Slaughterhouse Five  by Kurt Vonnegut encouraged me to think about death in a positive manner  His wry hopefulness in bleak times helped me put things into an interesting perspective  Plus I really liked how he threw sci fi time travel in with wartime stories  Presumably like many people  Slaughterhouse Five was my introduction to Vonnegut  More importantly though  this book was my reintroduction to reading and the joys that come with it  I ve read Slaughterhouse Five several times now  and love it more with each read  Is he mental or can he time travel  Suppose both can be asked of not only Billy Pilgrim but of Kurt Vonnegut too  Brilliant book  my favourite of all time  Must have read it a dozen times  Brilliantly written with enough heart  action and humour to cover all bases   I tend to be skeptical about giving a book 5 stars  But Slaughterhouse Five is up there with Joseph Heller s Catch 22  I especially enjoyed   So it goes  and  Anti war novel  Why don t you just write an anti glacier novel   Oh  Vonnegut  You re the king of satire  Having read this again much later after my college years  it was astonishing for me to see just how much interesting details I had missed out on  The more you read this book  the more you get out of it  Or  perhaps  the older you get  the better you pick up on things   Of of the greatest and most original books ever written   a modern masterpiece Stand out scene of the bombing raid in reverse and Kurt s style in describing it It s only problem is it s too short  But hey  so it goes  To me  this was the best of the bunch that I was  forced  to read in high school  I wanted to rip the skin off my face during the  Ethan Frome  month    so much so that I ve read it a couple of times since  Sure  Billy Valentine is a bit fatalistic   so it goes  This book changed my entire perspective on the world  I read it in an english class and surprisingly enjoyed it  I love how the books skips through time and the tiny connections between everything  I hope to read more books by Kurt Vonnegut in the future  So it goes  I think this was the first book that made me realize prose could be so wonderful  Before  I d thought poetry was required for beautiful language   Vonnegut s gorgeous phrasing proved that wrong  Despite having an absolute b tch for an English teacher  I loved this one  I ll admit I was a bit hesitant when I picked this book up  I wasn t fond of Cat s Cradle so I didn t know how I d feel about Slaughterhouse Five but the story was fantastic  I had difficulty putting the book down once I started it  Definite must read for everyone  I m not normally a reader of war books  but I am a reader of Kurt Vonneut  What a dude  I think  although I wouldn t know  this book portrays war in a more accuate light than a lot of war literature  Human behavior is not so neatly heroic as it is often advertised  I really enjoyed this story   thick with imagery and nonlinear storytelling  I can see how Jonathan Safran Foer was influenced by Vonnegut  Foer even mentions Dresden in Extremely Loud   Incredibly Close  which is really the only other time I ve read about Dresden  Vonnegut was a pacifist because he was wise and more human than any other writer I can think of  It is important to read Vonnegut in the face of nationalism to remember how we can get swept up in a national interest and forget about the interest of the human race  I think 3 94 star consensus rating for this book underlines one of the serious problems with Goodreads  Slaughterhouse Five is considered one of the greatest English language novels of the 20th century and it rates an above average on Goodreads  And so it goes   My favorite Kurt Vonnegut  Honestly  even though I ve read it more than once  it s been decades since the last time  Don t remember specifics  just that I liked it a lot  Vonnegut is not for everyone  Don t feel bad if you fall into that category  Hi ho     Mind blowing  I listened to this as an audio book read by Ethan Hawke  The time warps and recollections of his past  absurd fantasy and present circumstance were brilliant  Made one feel some of Billy s mental anguish and slips in and out of reality  Loved it  Sci fi and historical  with a dry wit and twisted sense of humor  I love Kurt Vonnegut  and this book especially because it tuned me in to the heartbreak of World War II from a practical and unassuming viewpoint  This book transcends categories  an awesome read  I was first introduced to Kurt Vonnegut in High School  to say I didn t appreciate his style would be an understatement  Over twenty years later  I am very happy that I returned to Vonnegut  His writing style is unique and the characters brilliant  So it goes
