I m going to keep this brief since there isn t much to say that hasn t already been said   clears throat I think the reason I waited so long to read this series is because I just couldn t imagine myself enjoying reading about an eleven year old boy and his adventures at a school of wizardry  I thought it would be too juvenile for my taste  I was wrong  of course I can honestly say that I loved every minute of this  It s a spectacular little romp with funny  courageous  and endearing characters that you can t help but love It has talking chess pieces  singing hats  a giant three headed dog named Fluffy  a hilarious giant with a dragon fetish  a master wizard that s just a little bit crazy  mail carrier owls  goblins running a bank  unicorns  centaurs     trolls       and probably much more that I m forgetting  And then there s the lead characters  Hermione  the young scholar who starts out prim and up tight but soon becomes a true friend  Ron  the boy who has little money but who has an abundance of family and loyalty to his friends to make up for it  and then there s Harry  the boy who starts out sleeping in a closet and ends up being a hero  Harry is kind to those that deserve it  fearless when it counts the most  and wonderfully intelligent  What s not to love  In regards to the ending   view spoiler  I feel silly saying this about a middle grade novel  but I didn t suspect Quirrell a bit  If there were hints that he was the true culprit and not Snape  I obviously missed them   hide spoiler  FAVORITE QUOTE   But from that moment on  Hermione Granger became their friend  There are some things you can t share without ending up liking each other  and knocking out a twelve foot mountain troll is one of them  Now  if you ll excuse me  I m off to start Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets                                                        My reviews of other titles in this series Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets  I love your YouTube channel     Originally my review was a comparison of Harry Potter and Twilight  However  this is so stupid as the two are incomparable  Twilight does not even come close  To quote Samuel L  Jackson in Pulp Fiction   It ain t the same fuckin  ballpark  it ain t the same league  it ain t even the same fuckin  sport   There was a day when I thought I needed to defend Harry Potter  in the midst of the now dead Twilight craze  and you can see that just below A note in regard to the on going Potter vs Twilight debate  Go ahed  tell me Twilight is better  Tell me that James is scarier than Voldemort  That the Cullens are a better family than the Weasly s That Edward is cooler than Harry  and Bella is smarter than Hermione  Tell me that Stephenie Meyer is more talented than J K  Rowling  Go ahead  I dare you  Those who think the topic of Harry Potter or Twilight is worth debating and arguing over  are utterly stupid  Quite frankly this book is amazing   Review for Illustrated EditionPerfect  Duh   Re Read in December 2014 for Harry Christmas To YouOH LORDY  Every time I read this book it brings back so many memories  and also gets me excited to read the rest of the series again as well because there is so much foreshadowing   For example  Sirius Black is casually mentioned in the first chapter Mrs  Figg is talked about a bit  as she looks after Harry from time to time  or all the time  ayyyy   it always cracks me up when Hagrid says you d have to be mad to try and rob Gringotts    Damn crazy kids Also here was a line in Dumbledore s chocolate frog card bio that said AND I QUOTE   Professor Dumbledore enjoys chamber music and tenpin bowling   HAHAHAHA WHAT EVEN  NOW I M IMAGINING HIM BOWLING DRAMATICALLY TO CHAMBER MUSIC Rowling is the queen forever and always Re Read in July 2012GINNY S FANGIRLING IN THIS BOOK IS JUST TOO GOOD Also  the Dursleys aren t as bad as people think they are  because after all  they DID pick Harry up at the end of the year rather than just abandoning him  So THAT S worth something mmmm  this book smells so good  It s good to be back  Rereading for the 3rd time for the group read Once upon a time  there was a 10th grader named Khanh who didn t get along with people very well  She wasn t an outcast in school  and all the bullying and teasing stopped with the commencement of high school  but she had always been a bookworm and has generally preferred the company of her own thoughts Lunchtime had always been dedicated not to eating  but to sitting in the library  browsing through books  Not to worry  she got her nutrition in 5th period in the form of a giant 6 inch M M studded cookie and a package of Sour Patch Kids and or a package of Reese s Pieces  Ah  the effortless metabolism of youth  One day  there were shiny new books on her school library s  New Releases  shelf  Harry Potter  books 1 through 3  She had heard of the books before  of course  since they were a constant presence on the NYT bestsellers list  but she had always avoided them  thinking of them as children s novels At the grand age of 14  surely she was too old for a little kid s fantasy novel  She had read the Outlander series earlier that year  after all  And it had sex in it  SEX  She didn t really quite understand everything in the book  but the point is  she had read them  Surely  at 14  Khanh was ready for more mature novels And that did not include Harry Potter  Harry Potter is 11  Khanh is 14  There is a vast difference in their ages  Khanh was a teenager  dammit But the Harry Potter books were new  Brand new  They were shiny  they had never been touched by another reader  And Khanh was tempted She picked up the first book in the series  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone The end Or rather  the beginning  Well said Navessa  JK Rowling has created such an amazing world  I get shivers when I think of Headless Nick  So many wonderful  creative details  Unsurpassed  Enjoy the rest of the series   As wonderful and magical as promised  Because I didn t remember the movie  the third act of the book was a delightful surprise to me I wish I d had this book when I was a kid  because the idea that someone could be special without knowing it  and then get to visit a special world where the things that made him different were the same things that made him awesome would have been really inspiring to me Anne s finishing this  too  and I have to wait for her before I start in on the second book     HURRY UP ANNE  Reviewed by  Rabid ReadsI wasn t going to review this for Rabid Reads  but then I was reminded of the multitudes of unfortunates who haven t read HARRY POTTER yet       I ask myself Me  How can this be Self   shrugs awkwardly Me  The HARRY POTTER books breathed new life into readers of all ages  They re amazing  wonderful  fantastic  addicting  SUPERLATIVE  Self    nods emphatic agreement So what s the deal people Boiled down to its most basic elements  HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER S STONE is urban fantasy  For kids  Absolutely For adults  ALSO absolutely Rowling creates a wondrous world of magic that exists alongside the normal  the  muggle  world In this magic world  the objects and PEOPLE in pictures move  chess pieces are both sentient and opinionated about your game playing strategy  Jelly beans come in EVERY flavor  so part of the fun is never knowing whether the funny yellow one is going to be toffee       or earwax  Creatures of legend  centaurs  hippogriffs  dragons  goblins  etc   are part of everyday life  If you re a wizard But all of the world building is secondary to Harry himself  The boy who lived Harry was only a year old when he was given over to his only living relatives  The Dursleys of 4 Privot Drive are happy in their normalcy  their mediocrity  They think things properly account for the worth of a person  they indulge their already horrible son  and they more than neglect Harry       They re dismissive of him  They humiliate him  They stifle him  And they do all of these things thoughtlessly  As if he s not a real person       B c he s other  Their abuse is so offhand  you have to be an adult  or least a mature reader to recognize it for what it is  Younger readers just see a hateful villain  A hateful villain who does such ostentatiously self centered things to poor Harry that they can alternately  Yayyyyyy   and  Booooooo   with enthusiasm  I ve heard similar comparisons made about Robin Williams  Genie in Disney s  Aladdin   the character was complex enough for adults to enjoy while being thoroughly entertaining to children So that s my sale  Harry Potter isn t just for children  it s for EVERYONE  In my humble opinion  what Rowling has done with these books makes Disney s Genie look like amateur hour  and I quite like Aladdin  FYI  And as the recent popularity of coloring books for adults has proven  people of all ages like pretty things  and that is why this new illustrated version is spectacular SO  We have an engaging premise  a child mysteriously defeats the most powerful dark wizard in memory  becoming instantly famous in one world  a world full of wonder and magic  is raised ignorant of his past by negligent relatives  only to be reintroduced to the magical world when he comes of age to attend the equivalent of middle school We have the earlier referenced fantastical world building  We have well developed  often hilarious or reprehensible characters  depending on whether they re meant to be Good or Bad   And we have addictive individual story plots that build into the best Good vs  Evil story arc since LOTR  And children LOVE it  So will you  More than highly recommended  1 2 16  Getting starting one day late on the HARRY POTTER BR over at  BB B    shrugs  Harry Potter is good today  yesterday  and tomorrow  My other reviews for this series  Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets  Harry Potter  2   I will never ever rate this lower than 5 stars  BEAUTIFUL   I love the personal stories that go along with this wonderful series  so here s my hand at it  Bare with me When I was a kid  I actually didn t really like reading  I struggled with it and it didn t seem all that pleasing  I was an explorer after all  I collected acorns for the squirrels  stalked the ducks in our pond  pulled together forts with a bunch of branches  and created mudpies and dirtstews  So many good times to be had without wasting time on books  I was no Matilda Then  I met Mr  Sutherland  Y know those teachers that you have in elementary school  The one that you distinctly remember more than all the others  There s always that one teacher that leaves a mark  He was mine  That third grade class was my home away from home I talked all the time and I never listened in class  quite the troublemaker actually  But there was one period where I was absolutely quiet  Reading time  Because Mr  Sutherland picked out a book that I found utterly fascinating  A book that captured my heart and sparked a sense of magic within my soul  I had to keep quiet  I had to listen to Harry s tale  He wasn t that much older than me  I was 8 and he was 11  I ve never felt so connected to a character and story in my entire life  I wanted to know more  I wanted to know what I ve been missing out on all this time  I started to read A book  A place that was better than real life  Better than my own adventures  Who knew that I would rather have my nose stuck in a book  With my imagination as my world and the words were my guide to it The thing about Harry is that he connects with so many people  There are no bounds  Race  It doesn t matter  Age  It doesn t matter  Sexes  IT DOESN T MATTER  There is no separation when it comes to the love of literature And what s the ultimate power in this series  Love  This doesn t really need a review  does it This series is brilliant and it will live on forever in our hearts and minds   It s Always Great  Coming back Home   There is a reason us  the Fans  feel like we re connected  no matter where we from  different culture  ethics  ages  we re all like graduated from there    Hogwarts  we re even been like in the same class  We re classmates  no matter which edition we read    Cause Harry Potter is not just a story  it s a Life  One of the most important novels in the modern history  Sorry  it s The Most Important ONE This Review also for those who hate the series  nfs lmql bl rby Without it most of the Book stores and publishers may have the same fate of the Video stores Blockbuster LLC  which despite being super popular in the 90s  closed all the stores by 2013  shutting down forever Yes  without this novel  and with the rapid change in technology  the ease of making e books and reading it in PCs  Smartphones Tablets  etc  the publishing and trade of new paper books may decrease rapidly  It d be limited for religious or some educating books  classic and small novels   even these kinds of books goes just electronic     and the books be just like an old Video Tape A Dystopia  right  very gloomy idea to the world without This novel  The One Well  in the case you think I m exaggerate  Let s haveA Brief     History of Literature in the 90s                                          Well  let s back to the early 90s   where TV is in every house even in every room  Video sets are there too  rental video stores everywhere and satellite receivers and cable channels growing fast  with many channels for kids and teenagers making them attached more and more into screens  not to mention Video Games  Game boy and Nintendo    Those from this new generation who read are  weirdos  or  nerds  to the rest of their peers And for those  few who read  book stores mostly got for them just comics and graphic novels  which most of them created early this century The classic novels they read just for schools and education  otherwise they merely know the movies that based on The new novels that make a best seller are the ones which made  or will be made  into movies for Julia Roberts  Tom Cruse or any of the 90s Hollywood celebrity   or the ones by Stephen King because  of course  will be made into movies too Even these novels didn t live up the selling numbers of Tolkien  Charles Dickens  Agatha Christie  what s with the British authors and selling numbers      also in Russia no more Dostoevsky and Tolstoy   no more Hugo in France Also in Egypt no more like Naguib Mahfouz and the great authors of the 50s to 70s   No new big hit for novels  most of the selling books are those of Speculation about strange and mysterious things in the world or in religion Dreams explications   cocking books or just celebrities rumors While in US and UK it selling books mostly the self help books  or those which teach how to make Computers programs or even web sites  this brand new huge technology leap back then No new novels to attract the new generation of kids and teenagers  just some few successful highlights like R L Stine s Goosepumbs in 1992 which make a very good success  and translated in many countries including Egypt And in Egypt there s also a very successful project made by The Modern Arabic Institution for Publishing   Distribution which made  Pocket Novels  for youth   by brilliant Egyptian writers who presented excellent variety of novels of many genres  Sci Fi  Action Thriller  comics  Romance  etc There s also  Reading for All  project by the first lady  Susan Mubarak  which printed a huge verity of important books and novels from all over the world in very cheap prices But all these effort didn t attract  more and more  of new youth readers  it just made more and more books for those few who already reads The vast numbers of those who don t just read will increase if there isn t a big new attractive reading experience to get them into reading  specially with the more channels  more movies But the BIGGEST Obstacle for them to read came out in 1994and became a real phenomenon by 1995   it s the Playstation   the giant Japanese gaming leap  Football  Crash   Pepsi man  and the comics heroes also have their games   so why reading Superman   Batman s comics when you can play them                                                                                                      So by 1996 with this growing leap in Gaming  as also the Computer 3D games getting even much improves  Books get replaced bit by bit by a gaming controls So do you think it s wise for publishers to publish a book for new writer Of course not  it may even cover it s publishing cost So it was very normal when in this year  1996  when Joanne  a 31 years old lady from England   handed the manuscript for her first novel to 12 publishing houses  all of them rejected it   A manuscript of over 200 pages of a novel  that she had hard times in her personal and professional life while writing it  and for children    Seriously is there still any who still read  it s 1996  the era of Playstation and Video Games But then  the Modest  Bloomsbury  agreed to publish it  with 2 advises for her  first that she d get a day job  since it s a little chance of making money in children s books    later she received a grant from the Scottish Arts Council to help her continuing writing  But the significant advice was to change her pen name cause young boys might not want to read a book written by a woman  so with her name and her grandmother s  Kathleen  come the 2 initial of her pen name   J   k   Rowling And in 26th June 1997  with 1 000 copies  500 of which were distributed to libraries  come out in UK  to our world The Greatest Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone And Baam   everything happened so fast  Before the end of this year the novel awarded many important litural awards in the UK  an American important publisher   Scholastic   won the rights to publish the novel in US  with a huge check Rowling would never dreams of Just with small change  The title changes from Philosopher s Stone to the Sorcerer s Stone   as the American publisher saw that Philosopher s may not be that attractive to young readers  And Thanks to Harry Potter  now Every young readers know much more about Philosopher s Stone from their other reads In 1998 Book 2 released in UK  1999 in US  winning more literary prizes  Becoming a Top Selling books in UK  US and many other countries which start to publish the translation for the first book   And on 8 July 1999  The First Breaking Record made when Book 3 sold 68 000 copies in just three days after its release in the United Kingdom  and more copies when it released late 1999 in US  With the fast growing popularity of Harry Potter among readers   more records had been broken both in UK and US     The 3 books takeover the top spot in the charts of best selling books for weeks and months  and it was still the hardcover editions This conquer made some literary magazines and newspapers separate the Harry Potter books selling records from the rest of the top selling books  splitting its lists into children Books and adult books sections under pressure from other publishers who were eager to see their books given higher ranking  And then it was year 2000   where everything is about to change      forever  The Playstation 2 is out there  and even higher leap in Computer Games  But even with this much of temptations  thousands of children  teens and parents gathered in the midnight of 8 July 2000 in UK and US at the same day in front of stores  not electronic stores or Apple stores  as theses days    it was Bookstores  for may be the first time in the Book Stores History   to buy a copy of     Harry Potter and the Goblet of FireAnd They didn t mind to find out that the book is over 700 page  it was even for their pleasure  more than double the size of any of the first 3 novels  double the thriller  double the fun  Over 3 million copies sold at that day only in the US   a new world record   a totally unexpected one huge story  bigger plot   mysterious and very well written  more literate prizes for Rowling    more translated editions to more than 40 language  And huge budget for the upcoming first movie of the series  which beautifully visualize the magic of the novel by the faithful producers and the director   and it also made some records   but that s not our subject now                                                                                      By the announcement of pushing the publishing date of book 5 to mid 2003   and even by 2 movies out so far  the hunger for reading Harry Potter kept on   Also   as more readers start to increase into this generation  Publishers and book stores start to promote for more books for those readers who are hungry for more  Older fantasy books   like Lord of the Rings  which was a super successful movie by then too  Narnia   Golden Compass and many other novels which finally getting more reprinted editions   and so Book stores to get more and more readers More countries welcomed the Harry Potter phenomenon   The English edition AND the local translated ones  both been sold everywhere worldwide  Even in Egypt English edition sold at many books stores and hopefully some new book stores specialized in English novels start to open in Cairo and Alexandria by 2002 2003  and finally in summer 2002  Nahdet Masr for publishing and distribution got the rights and published the Arabic edition  although it cut some of the lines for the length issues  fearing it may won t attract more readers   but the edition still hold the magic of it  making a very good sales                 The good news is the literary movement didn t stop there  more new books come out for the increasing demand from the readers  Life of Pi   the 2002 man Booker winner make very good sales numbers by And in April 2003 Dan Brown  previously published 3 novels  making good sales  released a novel that made huge fuss around and making a new sales records   The Da Vinci Code   The funny thing that there s a reference in this novel that Harry Potter is the second most selling book in history after the Bible     a speculation that happens to be true in less than 5 years after that  A month later May 2003  Khaled Hosseini released his first novel  do you think publishers would agree if there s no Harry Potter before   He d may be rejected by 12 publishers like you know who       The Kate Runner which also made a very good records too And that s didn t affect the main reason for this new  literal renaissance  All that didn t affect the Records Breaker to break records one month later  On 20 June 2003 book 5  Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix  comes out   ten thousands of all ages conquer the book stores in UK  US

expectations of being full of action   but it get a twist that blow minds about one of the most interesting characters  Professor Snape That made many fans and even big authors like Stephen King and Salman Rushdie talk about for months                  The pre final book followed by a massive variety of new novels  new authors    Twilight series  Percy Jackson series  and more new novels  more books sales not only in US  UK but worldwide   But still Potter is the Records Big Breaker    At the midnight before 21 June 2007  everywhere around the globe the scene of thousands of people lining

be famous  There won t be a child in our world who doesn t know his name   That s what Rowling wrote at the very early pages of her first book  The one that rejected by 12 Publishing Houses in 1996   Well  what about now God  Talked too much in the  Brief  introduction   didn t I Well  that s it for this review    I guess some still think it s just the Propaganda that made that all    Well I ll try to prove them worng by the upcoming next 6 reviews at the other 6 Books of the series  Links will be here as soon as it d done    wllmqlt l rby  yD Now I ll be back to go around Hogwarts     For the Zillionth time I guess  Hope to see you there too  come on and try first year   From HogwartsMohammed ArabeyRe reading the new edition  Guess I m addicted to new editions BUT this one really rocks   Bloomsbury 2014 from 12 Sep  2014till 23 Sep  2014 Obviously 5 5 stars  especially because DANG the illustrations in this are on point  They were breathtaking  I can not recommend this illustrated edition enough  Even if you ve read the book a million times  reading this version is like seeing it with new eyes  I absolutely LOVED it   Beyond amazing  Way to start the new year    I ve read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone way back in High School but I wasn t able to finish it because sad to say  my book was lost     And now  thanks to my lovely friend Allie who gave me a copy of this book  I became interested to read it once again and bring back the old times  feels  And WOW  Just WOW  Thank goodness I decided to read it again because it felt so magical and magnificent and totally breathtaking     exactly what I ve felt the first time I ve read this Harry Potter is such a great  well fleshed out character  Despite being parentless and being bullied both in the Muggle world and Hogwarts by some kids  he still stood up and even became a great friend to Ron  Hermione  Neville  and the others  This story had lots of exciting adventures and I really enjoyed everything that happened in this book  It was just so awesome  The secondary characters are also perfect  I especially love Hermione and her genius mind  Ron s loyalty towards Harry is also awe inspiring  as well as Neville s adorable clumsiness  When it comes to its plotline  it s amazingly done  The twist was unpredictable and there was humor in every page that made me laugh  What s even great are the lessons and the message that are instilled to every reader  fantasy and magic aside    It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies  but just as much to stand up to our friends    I loved all the chapters and my favorites are The Boy Who Lived  The Vanishing Glass  Diagon Alley  The Journey from Platform Nine and Three Quarters  The Sorting Hat  and Quidditch No wonder why this book and the whole series continues to be a real sensation  J K  Rowling is so brilliant she bewitched me with her world  So excited to find out more about this series and to see what s in store for Harry in the next books    Rating     Rating  All the stars   3There once was a boy named Harry destined to be a star His parents were killed by Voldemort who gave him a lightning scar Harry goes to Hogwarts  he meets Ron and Hermione McGonagall requires he play for Gryffindor Draco is his daddy s boy Quirrell becomes unemployed the Sorcerer s Stone is destroyed by Dumbledore REVIEWI don t really know what to say about the Harry Potter series  except if you haven t read it  drop everything and go do so I m gonna try and write a civilized  and non rambling review  but it s gonna be tough First off  I really think wizards witches need better education  Voldemort is such an idiot  He could ve just killed Harry by tossing him out of the window  Instead  he did his fancy  Avada Kedavra  shit  which not to mention  failed miserably Also  this book made me fall in love with Neville all over again  I ve forgotten how much I like his character  Same goes for many others I believe it s my 5th or 6th time rereading book 1  but the ending still makes my heart race everytime  although I ve almost memorized it by heart    One of the most hilarious quotes is   Devil s Snare  Devil s Snare    What did Professor Sprout say  It likes the dark and the damp   So light a fire   Harry choked  Yes   of course   but there s no wood   Hermione cried  wringing her hands  HAVE YOU GONE MAD   Ron bellowed   ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT      Lucky you pay attention in Herbology  Hermione   said Harry as he joined her by the wall  wiping sweat from his face  Yeah   said Ron   and lucky Harry doesn t lose his head in a crisis    there s no wood   honestly   I also love the part when Harry  Hermione  and Ron meet on the Hogwarts Express      CONTAINING MY INNER FANGIRL     hahaha that s not what it actually says but hahaha Also Dumbledore being the wise guy he is  So many amazing quotes from him     It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live   BTW this is the inscription on the mirror of erised  Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi  Read it backwards with different spacing  If you can t tell what it say s just ask    To the well organized mind  death is but the next great adventure   The truth is a beautiful and terrible thing  and should therefore be treated with great caution   Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself    There s so more but I wont keep you here until Christmas  It s probably evident I m a huge Harry Potter fan  which I am  I love these books like they re my children  Hope you liked review mess of gifs and words   And it took a really long time to put together  might I add  But HP is always worth it  Rereading the series throughout the month of December with these lovely peeps 1  Myself  D2  Evelyn3  Elizabeth4  Brea5  Amanda6  Sarah7  Dana8  Gabriel9  Veronica10  Lily11  Rachael12  Kristin13  AnneIf you want to join us  let me know in the comments     Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone is one of the most celebrated books of all time for one simple reason   because it deserves to be I ll write a full review when I have time  but for now here s my    Book  you have the right to a speedy trial  review THE DEFENSE    Rowling s prose is absolutely magical   Story is not only exciting but often sweet as well   Lead characters are all captivating   Comic relief  mostly from Ron  is blended perfectly with the more dramatic events   Never a dull moment THE PROSECUTION    Rowling is occasionally too over the top for her own good  especially during Harry s time with the Dursleys    After reading this  anything else you do may seem like a waste of time that you could have used to read Harry Potter again  THE VERDICT Some books are worth reading once  this one is worthy reading many times  A brilliant adventure that anyone can enjoy  I m not the biggest fan of this series  I liked the first three books well enough  but after that things kind of went downhill  I think I actually gave the last book one star   The length of the books may have something to do with my opinions about this series  The first three books were fairly short  after that  they got really long  The lack of editing showed   The Translation of the 2011 Hardcover edition is amazing and faithfulMerged review suy lt mw khr  ly ljwdrydz  n kthr lktb t thyran fy tkwyn shkhSytkwknt  jbty km knt dy m   jbt b tSwyt  Gyr mtwq ljb   n lsbb s  lnh Glb fy

wish this book had come out when I was young  I wish that someone had convinced me to read them when they first came out  and I wish I had read this series before I watched the movies   I wish  I wish  I wish   I wish I wasn t a Muggle The day started off the same as any other day for Vernon Dursley  he picked out his clothes for work  got dressed  listened to his wife  Petunia  as she struggled with their son  Dudley  during one of his tantrums  grabbed his briefcase  kissed them both good bye  got into his car and drove away from number four Privet drive  That is where the day took a strange turn   Vernon just chose to ignore it He ignored the cat reading a map on the street corner outside his home  He ignored the people dressed in cloaks   He ignored the owls flying outside his window at work  and after some careful consideration  he decided to also ignore the whispers on the streets outside at lunch  mentioning the name Harry Potter  and the strange man that hugged him for no reason   If Vernon had been a different sort of man  he would have known life was about to change for his  happy  little family The street lights on Privet drive flicker off one by one  and a group of four gather just outside the Dursley residence  Dumbledore  Professor McGonagall and Hargrid  set baby Harry and a letter on the doorstep  For Harry Potter isn t just any child and must be kept safe  One day he will know who he is  and one day they will come back for him First off I would like to thank my friend Stepheny  for finally being the one to give me that extra push I needed to give in and read this wonderful book  and I do mean PUSH  She was relentless  and now I know why  Anything I say will pale in comparison to her review of HARRY POTTER AND THE PHILOSOPHER S STONE  so I am going to link her review and let her words take over from here   https   www goodreads com review show   Thanks Stepheny   D Rereading Harry Potter always feels like coming home  It was so nice to start at the beginning with Harry before he knew he was a wizard  The wonder and amazement he felt as he arrived at Hogwarts  The friendship that formed among Harry  Ron  and Hermione  Also seeing the little things when I know now how everything ends and ties together  It s just the coziest  most beautiful feeling to be back at Hogwarts and I cannot wait to continue my reread of the series                                                       Reread  Dec 2015 for  HarryXmasToYou Reread  Aug 2013Originally Read  a LOOOOONG time ago lol aka i can t remember  THE REVIEWIt is so sad to say that this was my first time reading this series  so please do not criticize me  lol  the reason is not that the books looked boring to me  not at all  I really like the covers but the only excuse I have is that I never picked them up because I was waiting for the right time to read the adventures of Harry Potter    I remember I said this already  but I ll say it again  this is a series you should definitely read at least once in your life  you don t know what you re missing my friend  I think it s great to see how the movie is the book itself  I love the fact that they executed it in the best way possible and I m still waiting for my Hogwarts letter to arrive   The characters  oh my God  they actually reminded me of my friends and normal people  but I still find them pretty creative  I feel very bad for Harry and how he lost his parents and the way he had to live with the Dursleys  but what I love the most about him is that he never thought he was special  When he discovers a world full of magic that always existed  I just wanted to live in that world  I personally know that I ll never get tired of reading about him  when I think about Harry Potter the only thing that comes to my mind is that I would love to have him as my friend  talking about the word  friend  I have to mention Ron and Hermione because duh  they are Ron and Hermione  the 3 of them together are the best group of friends  despite being different in some things  I think that they represent very well the true meaning of friendship and loyalty Finally  I want to say that these books have an amazing plot and also great things and elements  whether it s the Diagon Alley  the Kings Cross Station  the deadly battles with Voldemort  the awesome and magic Quidditch  the typical teachers who annoy you  the representative houses of Hogwarts  the conversations with Hagrid and Professor Dumbledore  etc   but what I really like is the relationship you have with the story and its characters  Thank you so much Jo q I swear every time I read this book I fall even more in love with it  Releido Enero 2016Siempre sera maravilloso volver a Hogwarts  ljz l wl mn hry bwtr HSy y hw  kthr lktb qr   lmy  l  ljwd

Reading with a few other Potter heads at Buddies Books and Baubles  Let the magic commence  There are a bazzilion reviews for Harry Potter so I ll make this short and sweet This is the story of a little boy who grew up thinking he was unremarkable and without any family that really cared for him Until he finds out that he is special and begins a magical journey that will change the course of his life forever Going to the best and most magical school in any universe Hogwarts No matter how many times I read this I m always transported into this great world all over again and get so lost in it  This book and series is really fantastic no matter how old you are  It is really amazing how much magic J K  Rowling packed into this story  On this my 4th or 5th reread I found so many little things I didn t see before  There always seems to be something knew I pick up every time  Like the dreams Harry has of a Quirrel s turban talking to him telling him he is supposed to be in Slytherin  Albus Dumbledore liking 10 pin bowling and wanting wool socks more than anything else but people always give him books I get so nostalgic every single time I read this and I love Olivander s wand shop  the beginning of the friendship between Harry  Ron and Hermione and how could we ever forget the crazy twin and all their hilarious antics  So many wonderful things in this world that I d say even if you aren t an avid reader it is one series everyone should read  Me encanto la historia  el mundo que creo la autora  los personajes  todo  Es un libro tan tierno  tan divertido que te llena de amor y magia el corazon Amo profundamente a Hermione  con todos sus libros y su animo para aprender  Y Harry  que les puedo decir  siento un profundo amor por este personaje  un amor muy diferente al que siempre he sentido por los personajes masculinos de los libros  Resena Completa  http   bastvilard blogspot com 2015 0    Since I m incredibly late to the party  I don t feel there is much I can say that hasn t already been said  That in mind  I thoroughly enjoyed this beginning to a wonderful  magical journey  I can t wait to continue on with these new friends   MY BLOG  Melissa Martin s Reading ListI M GOING TO ADD MY BIG OLE SPOILER THING FOR THOSE THAT HAVEN T READ THESE BOOKS YET  I M ALSO GOING TO ADD A FEW PICTURES THAT ARE IN THE BOOK SO YOU CAN SEE HOW BEAUTIFUL IT IS AND RUN OUT AND BUY IT  IF YOU HAVEN T ALREADY LET US BEGIN Poor Harry s parents were killed by VOLDEMORT  Yep  I said it     So Dumbledore  the head honcho  and the gang decide to leave Harry with his mother s sister  Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon and their brat of a son  Dudley  This was a huge mistake because they were so mean to him growing up  He had to live in a cupboard under the stairs and wear Dudley s hand me downs  They didn t get him gifts or do anything nice for him      They didn t even tell him what really happened to his parents  what they were and what he was    until one day   on his eleventh birthday he started getting all of these letters in the mail inviting him to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry  But his stupid family tried to keep the letters from Harry  this didn t go over well and we get to meet sweet  wonderful Hagrid     Hagrid is stunned that Harry doesn t know anything about anything and begins to fill him in  he also brings him a cake for his bday    Moving on   so Harry finds out about all the things he needs to find out about and Hagrid carts him off to the bank to get all of this money his parents left for him so he can buy supplies for school  I just loved in the movies and the books when they went shopping at Diagon Alley  I want to go there  After Harry gets to school he gets into Gryffindor with his new friends  Ron  Hermione  my heroine   all of the Weasley s  and Neville  There are a lot of sweet people in their house  He has an arch nemesis named Malfoy that get into Slytherin  the house Voldemort was in at one time  Soooooo     I m not going to tell every little thing about the book as most have read it and some that haven t just might take a little peek     Let s sum this up to say that Harry gets on the Quidditch team  read to find out what that is   there are trolls with nasty snot  a secret the group are trying to figure out  great times spent with Hagrid  many magical moments and an appearance of sorts by someone that will not be named      I m going to leave you with some pictures from the book  I had no idea that Jim Kay who is the illustrator is the same man who illustrated   A Monster Calls   by Patrick Ness and he also has a rescued greyhound like me     Yay     OH and there will be no captions to the pictures  you can figure out most yourself or just look at the pretty pictures  just know that there are many more pictures in the book and all of the pages have something cool on them  I highly recommend this edition of the book I will say again to go out and buy this illustrated edition  it s so wonderful and I can t wait to get the rest of them in the illustrated editions         Like yesterday       Kudos to J K  Rowling for writing the series and to Jim Kay for his wonderful illustrations  Professor McGonagall approves    I LOVED TAKING THIS TRIP BACK DOWN MEMORY LANE WITH THE GROUP AND THE MAGIC  Review updated on 7 1 2016There is nothing I say about this book or the series in general which has not been said before and probably better  I will still give a brief summary of the plot in case you lived under a rock   a rock in a very remote location  A young orphan living with his aunt s family which does not care much about him learns he came from a family of wizards  He also has an opportunity to go to a wizard school which he jumps at without a second thought  He makes some friends enemies and learns some details about his parents  death Make no mistake here  this is a children book  This is also a book which brought a lot of children to reading for which it gets major bonus points from me  Do not think the series remain this way  the books become more and more mature as Harry Potter and his friends grow up As far as the story goes  it is highly entertaining and remains so throughout the whole series  This book in particular is notable for really showing a sense of wonder when we  and Harry  finally get to see the wizard s world  The movie based on this novel does an excellent job in this as well  succeeding at something almost every other ones based on fantasy books fail  it also nailed the casting  I also really need to point out something else  It is not a secret anymore  was it ever   what J K  Rowling is a woman  Two of her major characters and countless number of minor ones are boys  She does write them as real life boys which takes talent and some experience which I suppose comes from her having a son  I do not even need to mention that her main female character grows up to be strong and caring young woman This book is suitable for both children and adults alike  Do not be deceived by its seemingly childish beginning  In my gradual return to books after my harrowing experience with Mockingjay  I ve built myself up to Harry Potter Five stars to a book that is what it is and isn t what it s not  Make sense  This is a middle school children s book and when it s read as such it s great  I see people giving this one or two stars and I scratch my head in wonderment  Do they compare it to Shakespeare or Hemmingway  Do they read it as it was meant to be read or are they bringing snooty  intellectual baggage to the table  You are smart  We get it  You are all a bunch of geniuses  now try having some fun     It was agony to touch a person marked by something so good    To give you an overview of the story   As if I was gonna do that  I wouldn t want to be pelted with rotten tomatoes  mind you  Lol    As for my review  I politely refer you to all other great five star reviews of this book and think of every little thing good you can think of  every beautiful word that comes to mind  every amazing feeling you remember  those are what I will say of this book  of the characters  of the writing and of everything about the book  The only challenge I encountered reading this was this little voice speaking in perfect British accent that was manipulating my entire reading  That stubborn voice prolonged the entire process because it wanted to be heard and so many times that voice managed its way through my mouth making me read the words aloud in this foreign voice that s definitely not my own  Lol    I know I m not making sense anymore so I ll stop but before that let me just say that I loved all the characters  of course except the despicable ones  but that who made the strongest impression upon me is    surprise  surprise  That quote above belongs to him  He amuses and surprises me all the time despite his little but hugely significant roles in the entire story  I was laughing out loud at his mention of eating a vomit flavored bean and then trying another only to taste the earwax flavored one  But except from his hilarity  everything he says is a precious gem     After all  to the well organized mind  death is but the next great adventure    I know it sounds too much  but I was laughing and crying at the book s perfect ending  Everything is just perfect  Thank you  Hayat for this reading challenge and thank you Isabelle for providing me the book  You guys are the best   3  3  3 Wow  Watching the movie was one thing  but reading it is completely something else  I wish I didn t watch the movies first  __  Or should I say  I wished I read the books first My first impressions 1  I didn t realize how humorous some parts of the book were  Albus Dumbledore  you re definitely off your rocker  but I LOVE IT 2  The friendships  and interaction between all the characters are great  I love the love hate relationship going on between Ron and Hermione 3  Harry is a spunky kid isn t he  For a 11 year old he really knows how to hold his own  Well done sir 4  Neville Longbottom  What can I say  He s the true hero  isn t he    5  Love The Mirror of Erised chapter 6  Quidditch is amazing  Can I be a Beater 7  Excellent writing  Great setup for the rest of the books Check out my full review here  http   thereadables tumblr com post 2    I was in eighth grade when my mom brought me home a paperback copy of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone  I immediately gave her the most outraged look possible and couldn t believe that she would be handing me something as ridiculous as Harry Potter   But Mom   I said   I read Stephen King  This book is for kids   Well  if there is one thing my mom knows  it is her children  So she said back to me   Stepheny  they are talking about  banning this book from the schools   Well  that was all it took  She knew me well enough and knew my feelings on book banning  I waited until she walked out of the room before cautiously picking the book up  not wanting to give her the satisfaction of knowing she hit the right button  I skimmed the back cover and had an internal conflict as to whether or not I was actually going to read Harry Potter  Sure  people were talking about this book everywhere  but come on   it s a children s book  After a few minutes of going back and forth inside my own head I decided I would at the very least give it a shot  I mean  why not  right  I told myself that if I didn t like it I could put it down and move on with my life  I finished that book that same day  I picked it up  became so immersed that I couldn t put it down and it was over before I knew what had just happened  Later that evening  I asked my mom if she could pick me up the other 2 books of the series that were already out  When she gave me the next two I finished those and had to wait for a whole year before I could get my hands on the fourth one    I was hooked  There is a reason that I encourage people to read this series  It is life changing  For me anyway  I would re read the first books before the new one was coming out  would wait in the endless lines at midnight to get my copy  and stay up the rest of the night reading until my eyes forced themselves shut against my insistence that they stay open  I am a part of the Harry Potter generation  even if I got a late start  I have continued the tradition of re reading the series every year and I am telling you  it never gets old  In fact  it makes me feel young again  It takes me back to my young  carefree days when life was easy and made sense  I read this series because I love every word of it  The characters are unforgettable  the storyline is an adventure and the series itself is perfection  This book has seen me through my worst days  It saw me through my awkward teenage years  my insecure post high school years and the uncomfortable years where you are trying to define who you are and where you stand in the world  And when my father was first diagnosed with cancer  I turned to this book to help me out  It has never once let me down  I tell people to read the first few books to get a feel for the story  but know they are definitely children s books   That  by no means  lowers the level of enjoyment   But as the story progresses  the storyline matures  as do the characters  I see a piece of myself in nearly every character and I think that is what helps make Harry Potter such an incredible experience  Even if the situations are a little extreme  you can relate to the characters  The world is so real  you just know it actually exists and that JKR has been granted access which is why she was able to write about it  DUH  I am thankful I was able to convince my GR buddy  Delee  to pick these books up  and even more thrilled that she loved it  So far  every person I have persuaded has enjoyed the books  and that is an incredible feat  if not only for the reason that every person I have persuaded has had very different tastes in books  These books are truly something special  With as many times as I have read these books  this is the first time I have tried to write a review   How do you even write a review for HP    I guess I can sum it up with this  I will continue to re read these books until I am dead and hope to one day share it with the children I don t have yet  This is more than just a book it is a part of who I am   Meine Leseeindrucke  https   youtu be 2lGlcrcM04o   It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live   Is there a person in the entire planet that has never in their lives read at least a Harry Potter novel  No  I don t think so  Is there a person who s never heard of Harry Potter  No  I don t think so  even my grandma knows of him  We all love us some Harry Potter  It s a favorite of mine and I m sure every bookworm who s out there can appreciate and understand the reason why I was one of those little kids that run around dressed up like Harry  For the record  I really did  I would wear those round glasses and swish and flick my wand around and I took so pride in doing so It took me some time to read the books because I didn t use to be a bookworm  I only started appreciating the magic of books  like two years ago  I read this last year and after seeing the movie countless times I still didn t feel like reading something forcefully or something I knew what its story was going to be  although I did J K  Rowling created a world that is so genuine  so detailed  so real  She took a word  magic  and she gave new meaning to it  creating spells  traditions to follow magic throughout this magnificent journey  She created these three real  passionate  and amazing characters that we all love and in a way we grew together  This is my childhood  No  not the books  But I was fan of the movies ever since the first one and maybe I wasn t one of the lucky ones to read the book from the beginning I still have a word at saying that we were lucky to grow up into the Harry Potter generation This  as you all know  is the first novel in the series and it s an introduction mostly  Its size is not so big but trust me it s a wondrous book that makes every little kid s fantasy  and why not kid grown ups  run wild  I love this and how juvenile it is  Harry  Ron  Hermione  they re all so cute and small  they re just little kids  chasing down the adventure We all know who Harry and his sidekicks are  We all know about his lightning shaped scar  We all know what he s been through when he was just a little boy So  I dare you  if you re my age  19 that is  and you re a fan of the movies but have never given this book the chance it deserves  read the hell out of it  It s never to late Thanks for reading my review   3 Harry Potter has and always will have a special place in my heart  so my rating comes as no surprise  However  my rereading of the first book this time around was quite special because I read the recently published illustrated version  I must say that the illustrations very much enhanced the story and made it even more magical  They are unique because they don t look like what we see in the movies  but at the same time they were exactly as I would ve pictured them to be  I imagine that any child who has a hard time imagining this fantasy world would only find help and guidance in this illustrated version  I know I loved it  and I can t wait till the second edition comes out    I think we must expect great things from you  Mr Potter    After all  He Who Must Not Be Names did great things   terrible  yes  but great  The feels and memories this read has brought back is unreal  Can t say more than this is  From beginning to end   Everything was  Harry Harry my dearest Harry this book was you finding out who you are and that you were not just any ordinary boy  Harry Potter   Harry Potter changed my life  If I hadn t read Harry Potter when I did I would not be the same person today  What I am today  in a part is due to Harry  I cannot really say enough to make you understand how much Harry Potter means to me   I am not going to review Harry Potter  that is just an impossible task  However  after reading many people s personal stories linked to Harry Potter I got inspired to share mine as well  It ll be a long and boring reminiscing    My childhood was not exposed to  J K Rowling  In fact  Harry Potter remained untouched until I was 12 years old I was an avid inhaler reader of spooky books  Many children at that age were probably attending Hogwarts already  Harry Potter was booming back then  but I was stuck in another planet where your worst nightmares can come to life  Other times  I ll be battling off angry ghosts from lighthouses  zapping aliens with laser guns  dodging dungeon trolls  wrestling off demonic doppelgangers  getting haunted by talking dummies and going back and forth from one dimension to the next  Sometimes  I was scouring places for clues to solve puzzling mysteries I suppose you can say that my childhood was still just as adventurous minus witches   wizards   magical schools Finally  I was burnt out from all my usual  preferable book series  I have completed all the  Spooksville adventures  Christopher Pike had offered  I ve read  The Book of Nightmares by  John Peel countless times already that I made myself sick of it  I was dead tired of  R L Stine s repetitions in his  Goosebumps books  and I didn t own enough copies of  The Secret Five series by  Enid Blyton  I had nothing else to read aside from childish picture books   Then come one day when my sister came home with a bulging plastic bag from Times bookstore  When we spilled out the content together  there were 4 books and  Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets was among them You see  when I was first introduced to Harry Potter  I did not start with The Sorcerer s Stone as I should have but instead  the starter book for me was The Chamber of Secrets  My sister was a bit of a noob at book buying  She didn t realize she bought the second book instead of the first    I remembered thinking how VERY ODD and UNIQUE this world of witchcraft   wizardry was  And believe me  I ve read some strange stuffs before Harry Potter came into the picture I knew I had missed out on a few details from the first book but I ve watched the movies and they were enough to provide me the information I needed to know Here s where the plot twist come to play   right after I was done with The Chamber of Secrets  I extinguished Harry Potter out of my mind  My sister and I did not want to own the rest of the books either  Plus  I simply wasn t that interested to continue reading and thought it was quite pointless to read the books when the movies were at my reach   You are more than welcomed to kick the old me in the shins  I can t believe I was so unimaginative  It was 4 years later  at 16  when I re returned to this series  I was quite late to jump into bandwagon  I know but damn it  the last movie ended quite a while ago and I ve rewatched and rewinded them all so many times than I can count  I fucking missed Harry Potter  Well  I was still side eyeing the books mistrustfully but one day  when I was feeling rebellious  I bought the entire box set  my old copy of The Chamber of Secrets was long lost  and here I am  doing my 5th reread of the series Stories are even more magical to read than to watch onscreen  That much I realized  I feel like kicking myself even as I write this for thinking  once  that the Harry Potter movies are better than the books  I didn t truly or fully apprecite the written words before but   J K Rowling had given me a WAKE UP  call and I have her to thank for that This being my fifth reread  I was worried the analytical reader in me will shred the book apart and nitpick every single details but to my surprise  I did not  I still love every single moment as much as I had the first time around  I still found The Dursleys reaction to magic hilariously comical  Hermione s and Ron s banters are adorable and rip roaringly funny at times  oh  they were so meant to be  and I enjoyed J K Rowling s ability to weave up an entire new bizarre world with its own set systems and good lord  her food description is absolutely fantastic  My mouth waters even at the thought of Chocolate Frogs  Pumpkin Juice  Butterbeer and every single meals the house elves at Hogwarts have to offer  I d even try a taste at Bertie Bott s Every Flavour beans In a nutshell  this entire series is utterly magical  Need I say more   and I won t ever forget this anytime soon  How could I not give this book 5 stars  I would live in fear of being strung up the nearest Muggle tree  Thankfully  it was a great book and well deserving of high praise Not to mention Harry Potter gives way to this famous Office scene Michael Scott  We are going to choose team names  Dwight Dwight Schrute  We will be called Gryffindor Jim Halpert  Really  Not Slytherin Dwight Schrute  Slytherin are the bad guys  Jim Jim Halpert  I know  Okay  we will be Voldemort Dwight Schrute   fearfully   He Who Must Not Be Named  I wouldn t do that Jim Halpert   starts chant  everyone joins in   Voldemort  Voldemort  Voldemort  Voldemort  Voldemort Dwight Schrute   looks around  scared   Okay  seriously  you really shouldn t be saying that Now that s funny   There is really no way to do this book justice  I felt years younger in spirit just from reading it  This is all   always good for a comfort read i think i just bettered my time on reading this  Es una relectura  pero  y que  El universo de Rowling es tan rico en detalles y esta tan lleno de magia que es imposible no enamorarse  No importa cuantas veces lo lea  siempre habra cosas que me sorprenderan  Leyendo la novela con perspectiva  sabiendo que ocurrira en libros venideros  te das cuenta de la cantidad de referencias y pistas que Rowling deja como si nada  PERO ES QUE ESTA TODO PENSADO Ahora ya en serio  siendo objetivo  Harry Potter y la piedra filosofal es una novela llena de valores  magia y con una historia que nos abre las puertas a un mundo perfectamente explicado y planteado  He de decir que todo lo que se nos presenta  tanto conflictos como magia  leyes o incluso personajes  se hace de un modo bastante plano  pero a la vez  lleno de detalles  Da la sensacion de que conocemos el universo y a la gente de este  pero realmente estamos viendo pequenas caracteristicas que se nota que van a ir evolucionando  Y eso es grande  Rowling  Es grande GRACIAS  This is the hardest review I ve had to write all year     Sometimes you read a book that s so magnificent  so completely perfect you literally don t have words to describe it and no matter how hard you try  no matter how hard you dig inside yourself  you can t find the right ones  I adore the entire series and love the educational value and positive messages as well in the book  I could read it over and over again  my childhood was amazing I grew up watching harry potter s movies as an adult I m still so amazed by this series it s my first time reading JK Rowling s books and I m loving it   I can t wait to read the rest of the series    It s time for a little confession  I have survived eighteen years without ever having read any Harry Potter book or having watched any Harry Potter movie  I remember seeing glimpses of the third or fourth movie in my childhood on a friend s birthday  but that s about everything which connected me with the world of Harry Potter  More recently  a friend of mine forced me to finally watch the movies  not understanding how I could still have had a relatively enjoyable childhood without the presence of Harry Potter in it  So here I am  having read the first book approximately ten years too late  and regretting to never have read it before The novel actually has a lot of flaws which I could start to criticize right now  But apart from the assumption that it would gain me some enemies  what would be the point of it  This book is magical exactly the way it has been written  Even its flaws made me laugh or at least chuckle  and during every other page of the book  I wanted to be a part of Hogwarts  I always thought of the HP series as being set in a world designed for children  but now I understand how wrong my thinking was  Furthermore  I can t stop comparing it to the Chronicles of Narnia  which are set in another magical world   yet the writing seems so much more childish  Rowling s style addresses children  teens and adults alike  and that s what I admire most about her writing I m only 57 days older than the first book of the Harry Potter series as of its publication date  yet it has needed 6746 days before I finally entered the world of Hogwarts along with Harry Potter  Ron Weasley  Hermione Granger  Neville Longbottom and all the other well known characters connected with the series  and two more days before I finished the first year in Hogwarts  The only possible way for me to make good for avoiding Rowling s book for such a long time is to read all the six following novels  Soon And to await the arrival of my own Hogwarts letter   It was agony to touch a person marked by something so good   I m not going to attempt to review this book  but I ll leave you all with this  We all need a hug sometimes  especially after rereading Harry Potter  I used to hate Harry Potter Now before you hoist your pitchforks and torches  allow me to explain When I was a wee child of six  my dad decided it d be a good idea to introduce me to the series  starting from the Goblet of Fire  Back then  I was a vivacious reader  but mainly of chapter books  like Junie B  Jones or Bailey School Kids  The thickest book I d read was Charlie and the Chocolate Factory So when my dad plunked this gigantic doorstopper of a book in front of me  I quickly lost interest and deemed Harry Potter boring and overhyped  I carried this opinion through my teenage years  rolling my eyes at the people who d pillaged bookstores at midnight and refusing my uncle s generous offer to purchase me the entire series because he knew I liked to read Fast forward to 2009  when I was deep in the clutches of Twilight and desperate for something to fill the power vacuum Breaking Dawn had left  Then I stumbled across Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone in my school library  What the hell   I d thought   There s nothing else to read anyway  I d settled on a cushy couch  flicked to the first page and laid eyes on this   Mr and Mrs Dursley  of number four  Privet Drive  were proud to say that they were perfectly normal  thank you very much   It was all over for me  I read past the tardy bell  begged the librarian to let me keep it  even though we weren t allowed to check out books that early on in the school year  I zoomed through it in class and snuck the Chamber of Secrets and the Prisoner of Azaban home under my coat  I even pleaded my mother to haul The Goblet of Fire  Order of the Phoenix  Half Blood Prince  those thick  heavy hardbacks  home from her school s library  my mom s a teacher   so I wouldn t be left Potter less during the weekend  Having come across them long overdue  I knew major spoilers  including who would die in the end  yet it still broke my heart when I read The Deathly Hallows There are no words to describe how much I love Harry Potter  and how much I want to smack my 14 year old for obsessing over a controlling  douchebag vampire when I could have been laughing and swooning at Fred and George Weasley s antics I am not part of the Potter generation  But I wish I had been  Mis casas fav son Sly   Raven  pero es que amo a Snape y si es es Slytherine entonces yo lo seguire  fiel por siempre  Ademas me gusta que sea la casa mamona XD it s even better with the drop dead gorgeous illustrations  and i didn t think that was possible  i only wish it had come out when i was a child because i probably would have loved it even more     Obviously 5 star  Again  The illustrations in this edition were absolutely stunning and I can t wait for the rest of them to be out  Obviously Reread this book for  HarryXmasToYou  I should have read this book AGES ago  So magical    La de veces que yo he releido Harry Potter y me sigue gustando tanto como la primera vez  Ahora  el haber releido el libro en ingles  cosa que nunca habia hecho  y en su version ilustrada me tiene alucinando  de verdad  Cosas tan pequenas como los acentos de los personajes y algunas palabras escritas en su version britanica y no americana me enamoraron  3  Sigo pensando que nunca es tarde para leer Harry Potter  o incluso para releerlo  Esta historia me trajo muchisimos recuerdos de la epoca en la que me sabia el nombre de cada capitulo  de cada personaje y de cada punto y cada coma que aparecia en sus paginas    Recorde como esperabamos super impacientes cada nuevo libro  cada pelicula  porque queriamos saber mas de las aventuras de Harry  queriamos volver a ese mundo magico lejos de los Muggles  queriamos volver a Hogwarts  Releyendo este libro entiendo por que Harry logro crearse un espacio en mi corazon y por que nunca se va a ir de alli tenga la edad que tenga  Hogwarts will always be there to welcome you home  Desde que me llego el viernes era inevitable que en cuanto que tuviera un minimo de tiempo una relectura iba a caer  y ha sido mas pronto que tarde  acompanandome en este domingo  La historia como en cada ocasion que la he leido  me atrapa  me hace sonar y revivir aquellos de los momentos mas felices de toda mi infancia  La edicion es simplemente un verdadero lujo para cualquier fan de la saga  Un volumen rocoso  que pesa lo suyo   con unas buenas tapas duras y de gran tamano  Las ilustraciones son una gozada  Jim Kay ha hecho un buen trabajo durante todo el volumen  y hay alguna como la de Malfoy a pagina completa que me maravilla y quiero enmarcar  Al principio no me encandilaba el texto a doble columna  pero he terminado acostumbrandome  Un lujo volver asi a la infancia  la pena es que solo saldra un volumen al ano  pero las ganas de tener todos son enormes  This will always be a favorite and I ll never get tired of rereading it  AMAZING                               Just ordered this one from Book Depository  I WANT TO READ IT NOW  I ve always loved Harry Potter  but I was never as in love with it as I am right now  I just NEVER want to leave this world  This series deserves more than lousy 5 stars  I wasn t sure if I was going to write a review of these books  but I try to write a review of all of the books that I read  and it s been kind of nagging at me that I didn t write one for this  It s hard to write a review for a book that is so dang popular and well known  What is there to say that s new  I dunno  I think pretty much everything s been said  but still I wanted to write a review for this  and to talk about these books  even if I m just rehashing everything that s already been done  I remember when these first came out  I never really wanted to read them  I thought of them as  kid s books  and even though I read YA  my overly critical half just kept saying that these weren t for me  I don t know if it was the cover  or the insta popularity of the books or what  but I didn t read them  I avoided them like the plague  Until a friend of mine was reading the 5th book  and was so engrossed in it that he would do the     yes  yes  I m paying attention     nod while his eyes remained glued to the page  And as a reader myself  I know that look  So I asked to borrow the book he was reading  and he refused  He told me that if I was going to read it  I d have to READ it  starting with the first book  So the next day  he lent me the first and second books  both of which I finished in record time  and then I understood  And I never looked back  There s something about these books that is just    magical  Yeah  yeah  cliche  I know  But it s true  Yes  they are about magic  but they are about so much more than that  They are about love  and friendship and loyalty and trust and betrayal and commitment and all the things that we aspire to have and to be as humans  They are about understanding and forgiveness and learning who we are when it really matters  And all of these things are buried in this shell of fun and adventure and mystery that makes them irresistible  I decided to read these again in the original UK editions  because I know that the US editions were  Americanized   and I wanted to re experience them in their true form  I dislike when things are changed from their original format  I hate abridgments and condensed versions etc  I want to experience the story how the author wrote it  how it was meant to be experienced without some guy in a suit somewhere trying to make it  accessible  to me  I like the feeling that I get of learning something of another culture through the words they use  and the meaning that they give the words  This is why they taught us reading comprehension in third grade  so that we can read and LEARN  Learning doesn t have to be boring and tedious  it can be fun if we allow it to be  But it seems that we ve lost that ability  Sad  Anyway  I re read the first book  now appropriately titled  Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone   and I was surprised at how emotional I felt reading it  especially after knowing where it all ends  It was like seeing friends that you ve missed for years again  and while it makes you happy to see them  it s also sad because you know they ll have to go again too soon  That s how I felt  like I was seeing friends and that my time with them is short  That s kind of a silly way to feel  because they are forever  and I can visit anytime I want to  but I felt that way anyway  Especially meeting Ron again  He s my favorite character for an absolute reason  which is because he is so loyal and funny and true  and he gives his whole heart when he gives it at all  I wish that there were more people like Ron  I can t wait to re read the rest of the series and see if this feeling remains  I love discovering the hidden gems that Rowling has left for us to find  in mythology and history and legend and word play and in life  Who wouldn t love these books   Reread 19 04 15So glad I decided to reread this  it was just what I needed to get me out of this weird slump I was in  Just as amazing as the first time I read it   J K Rowling is queen   There are all kinds of courage   said Dumbledore  smiling  It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies  but just as much to stand up to our friends  I love this book  with all my heart  That s why this review is so hard to write  Who has never heard about Harry Potter  the guy who lived  I always say that the The book thief was the first book I have ever read  but then  there s this one  That I read sooo long ago  that I didn t remember a single thing about it  I know all almost all lines by head because I ve watched the movie thousands of times  but there s nothing like reading the book  It s like myself talking to my brother after I finished it Me  Gu   his name is Gustavo   when we went to the USA  nobody understood his name  Is that an unusual name   did you know that after Ron plays chess  there was another test  A potion one  My brother  REALLY  Why wouldn t they show that at the movie  I bet it was amazing  potions and all  Hermione solve it  right  Imagine if I guessed it correctly like her  Me  Don t know  Gus  Would you read the book  then  There are thousands of things you will only know about HP if you read itMy brother  Nah  I hate reading  My point is  like myself before I reread this  my brother and other people who never read this book and only watched the movie will never know the things that also happened  LIKE HOW MANY TIMES NEVILLE IS PRESENT ON THE SCENES  How Hermione is way geekier  Ginny is SO young  the way Hagrid speaks  And still  there are things that never seizes to amaze me about these books  friendship  loyalty  love  magic  They are present in every page of this  every scene  every line  The way Hermione becomes their friend was always one of the things I liked the most  She s so different from Harry and Ron  and still  she fits  She learns  she takes risks  she goes with Ron and Harry in their adventures because she is brave  in her own way  She has a heart of gold  like my mom used to say  just like Harry   There are some things you can t share without ending up liking each other  and knocking out a twelve foot mountain troll is one of them  I have to talk about Harry  as well  He is just    oh my  He is this eleven year old kid who lived with his mean aunt and uncle for his entire existence to discover that he is   actually  a wizard  So he goes to this school  finds out is famous and that his parents were killed for one of the best bad wizards out there  He doesn t know how to do magic  it s his first time making friends  in an entire new school in a total different environment  and still  he does good  Because he s kind  courageous  strong minded  smart  He s an excellent friend  an excellent student   unless when he s not sneaking around lol but still  he does it for the greater good   Harry Potter is not only one of these books you love  it speaks to you  It makes you care about people who are not real  and still  you love them  You have all the dvds  all the books  You watched every movie in the movie theater as soon as they were released  It was a tradition  something you waited the whole year for  And no  you didn t cry like a baby in the last one  Not in Leville s speech  because how has he grown   Not in Snape s scene  not when Harry  dies   And you definitely didn t cry when the movie ended  It s just    it s a love for a series that will never die  you know  I loved every aspect of this  I loved how the movie was as faithful as possible  loved the authors playing these characters so well  loved how different and important each one of them is  Snape  Dumbledore  Hermione  Ron  Neville Longbottom  George and Fred  Harry  of course  I just can t wait to read the next one and be mesmerized all over again  After all  to the well organized mind  death is but the next great adventure   Edit  December 5  2015  First re read I ve ever done in my life  I must say  this book isn t quite the best thing in the world  It has many tropes I really hate  speshul snowflake  villain that only wants to take over the world for no reason  etc   but there s something magical about it and all those aspects for some reason make me smile It s amusing how innocent everything was when it all started  It could fool you into thinking this is just some kid s adventure when really is a journey that will eat our hearts  Harry Potter is not my favourite series ever  or the one that has affected me the most  that place is saved for The Monstrumologist by Rick Yancey   but certainly it s one of the best and it kind of made my childhood  I grew up with the movies  actually  not with the books  but I was  in any case  attached to the story since a kid   J K   I m sorry for saying you re not a goddess in my The Cuckoo s Calling review ______________________There s no way to properly review this thing  so I m just gonna tell you how I met the Harry Potter series   There was a little girl named Vanessa who always wanted to do the contrary to what people wanted her to do  If she had a chore to do  she would do it as long as they let her alone  If mom or dad or one of her brothers or her sister or anyone in her family told her to do it  she would immediately refuse  because she takes no orders  She s her own boss As she was like that  then if something was popular  she would not do read watch whatever it  Well  there was this particular little series that everyone had read  It had movies and everyone loved them Do you know what she did  She promised herself she would never read them  She had already watched the movies  the ones that were out  and she rather liked them  but she would not touch the books  because doing so would mean she was just like everyone else  and she was special  yeah  I was that arrogant  Some years later October 15th  2011 It was a gray day and it was her brother s birthday  Mother wanted to gift his son something that he would enjoy  but not videogames or stuff like that  She wanted something with more educational value   say  a book Mother knew Vanessa s brother liked the HP movies  up until the sixth one   and as there was a book fair at his school  which was mine too   and the books upon which the movies were based were there  She bought the first and gave it to his son for his birthday Some of her mother s friend had also given Vanessa s brother several of the other boks in the series  It seemed as if they had planned the whole thing Of course Vanessa thought there was a hidden purpose there  She thought her mother had bought the books so she wouldn t resist on picking them  I told you I was arrogant  didn t I   She was wrong  That was not her mother s purpose  but in the end  Vanessa couldn t resist the pull  She wanted and didn t want to read the books Wanted them for some reasons   She had always been intrigued by them   She was the reader in the house  She couldn t stand the fact that her brother  who hated   and still hates   reading  was going to read more books than her  don t even tell me    A  friend  of hers was bragging she had read the HP books in less than one week and she wanted to prove her she could do the same Didn t want them for some reasons   Reading them would mean she was a common girl  I was an insufferable 13 year old girl   don t blame me    She would break her promise if she read them   If she read them  she would do what everyone else wanted her to do  and as you know  she hates being told what to do After a long time of deep philosophizing  aka one day   she decided she would read them  What could be the worst thing to happen It turns out she loved the first book  Her reaction upon starting it was something like this After that  she wanted the next ones  She borrowed the books from his brother and read them all up to the 5th one  those were the ones we had  in one week  She felt sorry for not doing it any sooner    Yeah  I was and still am like that  I m really glad I decided to read the books  They all have amazing plots  fantastic character development  writing that improves over the books  great story and world building  etc  What else can I need  Rereading this was a good choice  I think I m going to reread this every year to be honest  My advice to anyone who hasn t read this  READ IT   Absolutely amazing  I don t know why it took me so long to start this series but I m so glad I finally did  There are so many scenes in the book that were left out of the movie completely that I m glad I got to experience by reading the book  I can t wait to jump into the second book of Potter s journey  Ton Khari ton diabasa sta 15

time now  This isn t a review on your journey  this is simply my feelings and words I wish I could tell you  I still remember the first time I bought your first book   I had to buy it again from another publication that actually continued with your books   I had been without any interesting books to read for months and your book caught my attention since I had read about your popularity in Britain so I got all excited and bought the book immediately  People barely knew you where I lived and I can claim I was among the first who gave you a chance  At the time  your books weren t found easily anyway and weren t published all over the country  I read your book and I really liked it but I wasn t really in love  I did look forward to your second book and I was disappointed to find out that there were no copies available where I lived and your third book wasn t even out yet  I waited and waited and slowly word spread about you and the second copy appeared  I read it and   something changed  I was falling in love There was a girl in my class that I barely knew  I recommended you to her  she read it and something changed between us too  More than 10 years later  she is still one of my closest friends  Just like that  you helped to connect us I am not a genius but I found school days very boring  I was fine getting good grades without paying any real attention at the classroom and certain days were almost unbearable but then   you became a part of my life and I finally had you and your world to think about  I could think and fantasize about you  your journey  your future and I finally had a book to look forward to year after year  Time passed and my teenage years were spent with you  When I think back  you gave me some of my best memories from that time  Then came a time that almost anyone that read books  knew about you  I stumbled upon a new site that had been created by kids in my country and I started to talk with one of the admins  She was both a Harry Potter fan and a Lord of the Rings fan and we clicked immediately  I will never forget how she kept calling me by mobile phone when my family moved into a new house and I didn t have access to phones or Internet  She would talk to me for hours and helped me to keep my sanity  She moved to Japan a few years ago and I have very little contact with her now  but I will always remember her and what she did for me Years later  as a university student  I met a pair of twin sisters  They were very very shy at the time  or should I say at first contact  and I didn t know how to connect with them or whether I even wanted to  Then we realized we all love you  we started talking about you and then found other things we all liked    and today  they are my best friends  they always try to be there for me and I always try to be there for them  We have our differences but we also have our similarities and our love for you is one of them Harry  thank you for letting me into your world  Thank you for becoming a part of my world  Thank you for being there when I needed you  Thank you for giving me these fun and treasured memories  Thank you for helping me find people like me  Thank you for everything  I will always cherish you You live forever in my mind and my heart Yours sincerely  Happiness can be found in the darkest of times  if only one remembers to turn on the light  Since 1997  the Harry Potter series has enchanted readers  both young and old  Legendary British author  J K  Rowling s debut novel has gained international acclaim since its initial publication  winning a total of seven awards  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone is the thrilling first installment of the series where all of the magic began  The novel begins at the small  quiet house on Number Four Privet Drive  Little Whinging  Surrey where the book s eleven year old protagonist  Harry Potter  lives in the cupboard under the stairs  He was orphaned at a young age after his parents were killed in a tragic accident and was sent to live with the Dursleys  Aunt Petunia  Uncle Vernon  and their son  Dudley  His only living relatives treat him poorly  making Harry s childhood miserable Harry s unhappy demeanor is replaced by one of elation when he receives a letter inviting him to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry  the finest school for witches and wizards in all of Britain  As the novel unfolds  Harry begins his first year at Hogwarts where he is introduced to the wizarding world  befriends other students  and comes face to face with adversity  The twists and turns  mounting suspense  and thrilling perils that Harry encounters render this book life changning and unforgettable Rowling has a rare talent for creating believable  realistic characters that gradually change as the story progresses  These characters  as some people would say  possess a certain amount of depth  Their unique personalities and traits distinguish them from the characters in similar novels  Harry embodies all of the characteristics of a true hero  courage  tenacity  and an inclination to protect others  Harry is willing to sacrifice everything  including his own life  to ensure the safety of others  Rowling accurately captures his desire to protect those he loves  whatever the cost I must admit  Rowling s imagination is extraordinary  Her original vision of a young boy sporting a lighting scar who attended boarding school was transformed into a seven book series teeming with the unimaginable  Rowling s creative prowess enabled her to establish an entirely new world filled with realistic people  magical creatures  and thrilling enchantments  The wizarding world was crafted so thoroughly that it is flawless  No minor detail of this alternate world was excluded  allowing readers to fully immerse themselves in the book As the plot unfolded  readers received a glimpse of the growing complexity of the series  Rowling introduced specific details throughout the novel which the majority of readers overlook  These seemingly insignificant details  however  have a large impact upon later events within the book  My predictions of the events to come were quite far from the actual events that transpired  The shocking conclusion left me stunned and begging my mother to drive me to Barnes and Noble to purchase the second book While Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone falls under the  Fantasy  genre  Rowling discretely incorporated many mythological and historical references into the novel  especially those pertaining to the works of Ancient Rome  First and foremost among these allusions is Hagrid s three headed dog  Fluffy  The concept of such a creature is taken from Greek Mythology  according to legend  Cerberus  a three headed dog  ferociously guarded the entrance to the Underworld  The only means of subduing Cerberus  and Fluffy  consequently  is the playing of a lyre  Additionally  the Hogwarts motto   Draco Dormiens Nunquam Titillandus   is Latin for  Never tickle a sleeping dragon   Rowling relies heavily on her knowledge of Latin to create incantations and character names throughout the series I am most impressed not with the books themselves  but with the author whose rags to riches life story has inspired countless people worldwide  J K  Rowling was born Joanne Kathleen Rowling into a poor family living in Gloucestershire  England  She was accepted at the University of Exeter  where she studied Classics  She was devastated when her mother died shortly after her graduation  having suffered from multiple sclerosis  Several years later  Rowling married Jorge Arantes and gave birth to their daughter  Jessica  The unhappy couple separated 13 months after their marriage  Homeless  penniless  and caring for a newborn  Rowling struggled with depression and contemplated suicide  We almost lost the brilliant  talented mind who is solely responsible for the series that has now become a worldwide phenomenon  Her rags to riches story inspires millions of people in similar situations  Despite her challenges  Rowling s perseverance and determination brought the world of Harry Potter to life Overall  this series is the most memorable from my childhood  I was originally introduced to the series in third grade and immediately fell in love with the realistic characters  suspenseful plot  and flawless writing style  I was the diehard fan who watched each movie a dozen times at the same movie theater  eventually coming to know the employees at the concessions stand on a first name basis  For Halloween last year  in fact  I dressed up in an old pair of robes  pulled on a wig  and drew a scar on my forehead  And to this day  I find myself reciting quotes from the series  I was crushed after the release of the final book  feeling that part of my childhood had ended with the series  Looking back  I have never once regretted the time I have spent reading and rereading the series  committing it to memory  The Harry Potter series has served as more than a way to pass the time  it has helped to shape the person I am today  I started reading this for the Nth time 3 days before the death of Alan Rickman  who played Snape in the adaptations  in my opinion the best thing about them  It was sad  heartbreaking really  to think of his character just beginning his journey again for me through this reading  while the man who played him so excellently had just passed away  I love the adventure and magic of these books  but I especially love the journey we take with Snape s character  He is everything  So hard to love  but I love him for it I adore these books  That is all  Rather than write a review of this book  I will instead share memories I have about the series  Making fun of my high school girlfriend for reading the books  borrowing this one from her  sitting in a chair in my parents  office and reading the first few pages  and apologizing for ever making fun of her  I was hooked  Working at a bookstore when Order of the Phoenix was released and dressing up like Harry Potter  I danced around in the middle of the mall with a copy of the book to remind everyone that it was finally out  and also to embarrass myself  Visiting Universal Studios as an adult and riding all the Harry Potter rides  drinking butterbeer  and taking a picture outside the Hogwarts Express Receiving a Gryffindor scarf as a Christmas gift from my grandparents in lawObviously  this book and series are amazing and giving it anything less than five stars is ridiculous   It s official   my oldest child   my daughter  8 years old   has started reading the Harry Potter series    the series that officially made me love reading beyond almost anything else  Hearing her gush about it makes me think I need to re read this series  very soon   NOW WHERE IS MY LETTER FOR HOGWARTS   I WANT IT     After two years of ESL my english teacher decided to assign me a book to read  and every day for a couple of hours she would stay with me and I d have to read  circle all the words I didn t know and so much more    the book assigned was Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone  After reading that book I started hating Harry Potter so much that I didn t want to see another book of his    after a couple of months the first movie was out and the school brought us to movie theater to watch it and I actually fell in love with the movie  So I ve watched almost all the movies and then at a certain point I stopped and I promised myself that I wouldn t watch the last three movies  not until I would have read the series    Well after 14 years I ve finally had the courage to start this Saga and I m so ashamed that I ve waited so long    This book is adorable  perfect  I loved it    And I ve already started the second one    Have to make up for all the years I ve lost  D  But I ve chosen to read it in my language  italian       It s funny how a bad memory can influence you   Stupid Me    I almost risked never reading this wonderful saga                HARRY POTTER   3  3  3            Even though I knew exactly what was going to happen and who the bad guy was  I was still surprised  Rowling has a way of capturing you completely  She has bewitched me completely      Me after reading Harry Potter       Dopo quattordici anni sono finalmente riuscita a trovare il  coraggio  per iniziare questa saga  Eh si  coraggio  Dopo il trauma subito da piccola avevo paura di riprendere questo testo  Ogni volta che pensavo alla saga di Harry Potter mi rivedevo piccola  seduta accanto alla mia professoressa d inglese che mi invitava a leggere e cerchiare tutte le parole che non comprendevo  che erano tantissime  considerando che ero appena uscita da ESL   classe per alunni stranieri nelle scuole americane   da pochissimo   E quindi successivamente non ho mai piu voluto saperne di HARRY POTTER  Dannazione         quanto mi pento di non aver trovato il coraggio prima    per fortuna Harry Potter e in grado di stupire non solo i bambini    Dopo un paio di mesi dalla lettura del testo la scuola ci porto a vedere il nuovo film di Harry Potter al cinema  ma che dire    il film mi rapi completamente  Non vi era nessuno che mi osservava  solo io ed Harry  Ed iniziai a vedere anche i film successivi  Ma poi dopo il quarto mi imposi di fermarmi  Dovevo leggere la Saga di Harry Potter      beh dopo tanti anni eccomi qui     Harry forgive me    But I m all yours now    ready to fly to Hogwarts with you Questo libro e dolcissimo    Harry  Ron  Hermione    ohhh can t wait to see how the love between the two grows     3  3  3 3 Una vera e propria fiaba che non stanca mai  che ti tiene incollata alle pagine  Un testo davvero unico  con protagonisti straordinari    e sto solo all inizio  Non vedo l ora di continuare    beh in realta gia sto leggendo il secondo  Misteri  magia  amici  nemici  incanti  scope volanti  pozioni  intrighi  lotte   tanti ingredienti squisiti che non possono non suscitare una forte emozione  Amore   STUPENDO   I need more     Reread  September 2012  Every time I read this book  it delights me all over again  There s nothing like it  accept no substitutes  Rowling has given the world a tremendous gift January 2016  Read the kids the illustrated edition aloud  They loved it  Boy had read it before  of course  but it was Baby Girl s first time  and she was hooked  The one drawback to reading it aloud is bawling through Hagrid giving Harry the album of pictures of his parents  and through Neville getting 10 points for Gryffindor    3  re read August 2015  I won t write a full review  since pretty much everyone knows how this book goes  I m just amazed by the amount of foreshadowing  JK Rowling must have exactly known how the story would evolve  I don t mind that this book is short  when I think of OOTP for example  I find the beginning  before they go to Hogwarts  too long and often boring     Es muy dificil escribir una resena sobre una saga que me ha acompanado en tantos momentos diferentes de mi vida  Todavia recuerdo cuando mis padres me regalaron  Harry Potter y el prisionero de Azkaban  y alucine en colores con el mundo que me encontre entre sus paginas  Tendria 11 o 12 anos y creo que fue perfecto cruzarme con esta historia por aquel entonces  Inmediatamente me entere de que lo que acababa de leer era la tercera entrega de una serie y fui corriendo a hacerme con los dos anteriores  que lei en cuestion de dias  Entiendo perfectamente que supusiera el acercamiento a la literatura para miles de ninos que no habian mostrado antes ningun interes por los libros  Aunque en mi caso yo ya era una lectora regular  no consigo recordar ningun otro libro o saga que me hubiera tenido leyendo tantas horas seguidas y en un estado tal de ensimismamiento Resena completa y mi version de la portada en http   sidumbledorefueralibrero com 2    This is such a wonderful read   I always love rereading Harry Potter but with the illustrations it just added so much to the story that you get new surprises through the images while reading  This is just fantastic   I m not the usual Harry Potter fan  I don t think  To the well organized mind death is but the next great adventure     Albus Dumbledore I don t wanna die  Who cares  My favorite Dumbledore is Aberforth  Y know  the one who performed an experimental charm on goats and got sent to appear before the ministry for it  Albus isn t even sure he can read  for that matter  I m more Aberforth on the wisdom scale  fo  sho    I once asked JK Rowling what the charm was  She said my guess was as good as hers  She also laughed evilly  I have my answer   Wake up and smell the flowers  Huh  The goats are eating all the flowers and they sure smell experimental pretty  It wasn t as fun after Order of the Phoenix and the bitching commenced  Yeah  there were problems  But I m not organized  I don t wanna die  and I never really cared how it ended as much as I cared about focusing on the cool little stuff I got into the series after Prisoner of Azkaban came out and before Goblet of Fire   So it wasn t the movies or that Daniel Radcliffe was  then  Elijah Wood before he was uglier   What made me want to read them  The Dursleys  I thought they sounded wonderfully delicious  they are hilarious  I love it when Vernon tells everyone that Harry attends  St  Brutus  Center for Incurably Criminal Boys   His Japanese golfer joke  When playing trivia games with friends I d piss myself with excitement if I got a muggle question   Vernon s drill company is called Grunnings  Yes  I m more amazing than all of you put together   Wonder why no one plays reindeer games with me anymore     I love muggles I loved the stupid shit  No  not the mythology references  Yaaay she read Shakespeare  My Uncle Remus did too  Not even that she listened to The Smiths and The Beatles while coming up with the series  I do love that   I loved the Aberforth goat stuff  I loved the names of Lockhart s books  Gadding with Ghouls  Year with the Yeti  etc   and the little humor stuff she slips in  I can still quote asshole y things that Draco Malfoy taunted them with  Potter stinks   and can t remember the basic plot twists  I was a card carrying Potterite  laminated    Sigh  I do miss wondering what was going to happen next  I miss having that place to retreat to in my mind  I d go on my favorite Harry forum and have fun making up theories  I was right about EVERYYTHING  coughs    I m jealous of JK Rowling for having that place in her mind  Yeah  I ve got my own stories  But I don t think I have as much fun with mine  probably because I m not a sadistic murderer like she is   I liked the books better before they grew up  Rowling couldn t write a love story for anything  I hated it whenever Ron was mad at Harry  My favorite Buffy seasons to watch when depressed are the first three because the core group are still together  I love the togetherness   Aberforth was eventually important in the last book  That almost ruined it  P s  In case I didn t look dorky enough    I used to get into rabid debates about the English to American changes with the transatlantic fans  They were all like   Americans are so dumb that you don t understand what Philosopher means   I delivered eighteen shots to their stomach with my comebacks about Lee not being black in their versions  JK Rowlings name being JK in the first place  it doesn t mean Just Kidding  The publishers thought boys wouldn t read a female author   and their effing ugly covers  English kids lose so often  No Edward Gorey for Joan Aiken s books    I did know that jumper meant sweater  It s not just a Hayden Christensen vehicle  So this is the first time I read Harry Potter  yeah I know WHY     and now I can officially say it is AMAZING  I d love to describe how this book made me feel but I just can t find a word to do it so let s say   you know that feeling when you didn t know a part of your heart was missing until you feel like something starts to fill it  Well  it was kind of like that   starts crying   Anyway  I recommend it to everyone who hasn t read it yet  I can asure you it s never too late to start reading Harry Potter  I never thought it was possible to make Harry Potter BETTER  but Jim Kay has definitely managed it  I absolutely adore this new edition of Harry Potter and I hope that they will make illustrated versions of all of the books  although they might get quite big     Getting to experience this story once again  after not having read the book for a long time and this time with beautiful illustrations to complement the story was a truly magnificent experience  J K  Rowling is the queen  Harry Potter is and will always be one of my all time favorite series  3  First book down for readalong  Doesn t matter how many times I read these books  they re always just as amazing as the first time around   This won t be a proper review  just me reminiscing and some fangirling via gifs    you have been warned   PBuddyread of the first three with Melissa   Melissa s review here     The first time I had heard of Harry Potter was when my brother brought home the movie for  Sorcerer s Stone      he wasn t a reader but the movie had appealed to him  It looked interesting to me to so we had a movie night and watched it together  Michael  my brother  didn t think much of the movie himself    I think he gave it to me afterwards and said nothing else about it  As for me  the movie didn t blow me away  at first  It did get me curious enough to pick up the first book  I remember falling love with everything about it  finishing the book quicker than I had finished one before and immediately hungry for the next one At the time  I didn t know popular the series was    I just knew I loved it and had to read them as quickly as possible  By the time I discovered these beautiful books  the first four were already out and OoTP was released not long after    needless to say  I caught on quickly as to how big the fandom was  I loved the it all though  it felt like a big family    I loved to hear people swap theories while waiting in line  and soak the whole atmosphere as we all eagerly waited for the bookstore to open  ours never had midnight release parties but they did open extra early  This is part of my book family     3    As always  this story feels like coming home A noteworthy development  This is the first time I ve cried reading book one  I m always prepared to cry while reading five and seven  but this was unexpected to say the least  especially given the countless number of times I ve read this book  The Mirror of Erised scene just really hit me this time around  And I really appreciate Chris Columbus and Steve Kloves for making such a faithful film adaptation  This book remains pure magic update  HAHA I just finished this only to have Doc pick it up  1 6 16He s only 8 pages in but he already hates the Dursleys more than he already did from watching the films  and lemme tell you  he despised them to begin with   He especially detests Uncle Vernon  He also says he never got the vibe from the films of how utterly paranoid they are regarding magic and the Potters 1 13 16He still loves the zoo boa constrictor s  Thankssss  amigo  Also   YER A WIZARD  HARRY  1 21 16He really gets a kick out of the way Hagrid speaks  he says it sounds like he s from Appalachia    coming off reading Spencer s Mountain  it seems to be a good grounding point  And he picked up on Fantastic Beasts in the list of course books  and liked that I have the little copy of that one downstairs too    Oh and he says he must not have paid much attention to the movie before  because the twin cores thing between Harry s and Voldy s wands really got his attention  Also  George s line   We ll send you a Hogwarts toilet seat   to which I had to respond  George     Only joking  Mum   And then he just stared at me with the face of Who even are you I am LOVING this  I m a huge fantasy reader          I remember the first time when I got this book I was 9 growing up on this series until today I still get excited like the first time I did read it this shows how amazing is J K Rowling writing is  she s just takes us to a world we never been to  There is not good and evil  there is only power and those too weak to seek it  There once was a boy named Harry who constantly conquered death But in one final duel between good and badhe may take his final breath The story begins with Harry living with his uncle Dursley after Hogwarts send thousands of messages for Harry  Hagrid finally comes to take Harry with him to Hogwarts and Harry got to know about how he s parents really died and they re stories oh and he got to know he s a wizard too     It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live   I ve sat at my desk for over an hour and I still  after all these years  do not think I can review this book properly  All I can say is that Harry Potter feels like home  and every page of this book feels like magic  and not the magic that has to do with wizards or Hogwarts  but magic that has to do with love that is all encompassing  This book was published nearly twenty years ago  but when I opened this book to the first page it felt like not a day had passed  I really don t have any amount of words that I can string together to tell you how this book makes me feel  J K  Rowling will always set the bar for how a series should be written  because Harry Potter is written with love  and it makes all the difference  Always If you d like to participate in  HARRYXMASTOYOU here is the official Twitter and YouTube Video for more information  Extra Harry Potter things that make me happy and probably will make you happy as well  1   James And Lily Comics2   New Things J K  Rowling Taught Us About Harry Potter In 20153   A fortnightly podcast about the Harry Potter worldBlog   Twitter   Tumblr   Instagram   Youtube   Twitch    You haven t got a letter on yours   George observed   I suppose she thinks you don t forget your name  But we re not stupid we know we re called Gred and Forge    Originally posted on Stellar Scrutiny Book Blog Well  it turns out all those Muggles were right    I didn t enjoy reading until a few years ago  Having suffered through so many years of school required reading  I couldn t look at a book without thinking of essays  Not to mention my distaste for writing at the time  All that changed however  with one book that was so magnificent  it must have been a gift from God  It completely altered my view of books  What was this holy novel  you might be asking     It wasn t Harry Potter  It was The Hunger Games  As my eyes were opened to the Young Adult genre  my love of reading began  Shortly after reading The Hunger Games  I made a deal with my friend  who passionately loved the Harry Potter books and had been trying to get me to read them for quite some time  If she read the first Hunger Games book  I d read the first Harry Potter book  Flash forward a few months  and wouldn t you know it  my friend read the whole trilogy  Did I breeze through all seven Harry Potter books in a week  HAHAHAHAHA  NO You want to know the best part  That was 3 years ago   I had been hearing about Harry Potter since I knew how to read  but really disliked the concept of it  It s just about some stupid boy who goes to a school for wizards  Also  I ve heard it rips off Lord of the Rings  so I m going to stay as far away from it as possible    See  the funny thing about this is  I actually knew nothing about Harry Potter  Nothing  Zip  Nada  I hadn t even seen more than 5 minutes of the movies   gasps  After having a hundred or so people threatening me to read it  out of fear for my life  I complied  I certainly am glad I did  It was incredible  Absolutely stupendous   The Characters     So light a fire   Harry choked   Yes   of course   but there s no wood   HAVE YOU GONE MAD   Ron bellowed   ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT   Harry Undoubtedly  my favorite part of this beautiful book was its beautiful characters  Harry  Hermione  Ron  Fred  George   I love them all  Ironically  Harry was my least favorite of the trio  Not that I didn t like him  but he just didn t have as distinct of a personality as Hermione and Ron  However  I still admired his loyalty and selflessness  I m really excited to see how his character develops throughout the series Hermione Is it bad if I see a lot of myself in Hermione  Haha  I can be the occasional smart alec who gets all up in your business   so  naturally  I love Hermione Granger  She wasn t a Mary Sue  She was intelligent  loyal  and feisty  There really should be more heroines like her  I also have brown hair  brown eyes  and am Muggle born   We re practically the same person Ron He was pretty great too  Having four siblings  two of which  are twins   I can relate to him  Ron and Hermione s bickering was positively priceless  and he had more than a few memorable remarks  He was the comedy relief of the whole book  and it wouldn t be the same without him Malfoy  I was really hoping this little git would get devoured by Fluffy Other characters  Hagrid  was hilarious  and is it strange if I am particularly fond of Hedwig  Dumbledore didn t really have that much screen time  so I don t really know what to think of him   yet  My favorite  or should I say favorites  are definitely Gred and Froge   wink  I swear  I was cracking up over every dialogue they had  As a matter of fact  I loved all the Weasleys     Now  you two   this year  you behave yourselves  If I get one more owl telling me you ve   you ve blown up a toilet or    Blown up a toilet  We ve never blown up a toilet   Great idea though  thanks  Mum      The World Building  I finally see why everyone admires J K  Rowling  Hogwarts and the wizard world she creates is whimsically ingenious  Honestly  why can t Quidditch be a real sport  It s fantastic  I want to ride a broom stick and hit flying balls into peoples  faces  All flavor jelly beans  How awesome is that  Apparently  you can buy them from Amazon   including earwax flavor  Eww  wasn t licorice bad enough    I m not kidding  look it up  Rowling did a marvelous job of luring me into Potter s world  The only aspect of the universe that puzzles me  is where exactly is Hogwarts  Is it in a different universe from our reality  If so  how are Harry and Ron  I started a wee bit on Chamber of Secrets   as soon as I finished this one  able to fly a car there    What I Loved      The protagonist and side characters  Lovely  lovely  lovely characters  Rowling did a spectacular job of creating such a hilarious and realistic cast     The plot was highly entertaining  Though a little short  Harry and his friends  adventure was incredibly entertaining and I am especially curious about what other secrets Hogwarts holds       Rowling s writing was pleasant and engaging  A little simple  yes  but short and sweet  What else should I expect from a Middle Grade novel     The plot twist in the end  I m not going to lie  I felt quite childish that I didn t see it coming  It was so obvious  yet I was too busy laughing over Harry swallowing Quidditch balls to notice what was right in front of me     The villains   claps  Well done  Rowling  Well done   What I Didn t Love      The pacing  A short novel  Understandable  An abrupt ending  Inexcusable   Final Thoughts  I hope all you Muggles are happy now   I finally did it Harry Potter was so wonderful   I really should ve read it all those years ago   The characters were exceptional  story incredible  writing amiable   honestly  what else can I say  other than it truly was a magical book   I ll absolutely be finishing this series     Harry Potter is the most amazing series that I have ever read in my whole life  I will never love any books as much as I love these  I don t think I have to tell you guys about how good this book is because most of you have already read it anyway I haven t written a review so far because I just did not feel the need to put this obvious opinion into words  I don t think anything I write here hasn t been said already  But I ve just read the illustrated edition by Jim Kay and if it is possible  it makes this book even more outstanding than it already is  Jim Kay is awesome  Maybe you have read  A Monster Calls  and already know him  If not  you should definitley reconsider your life choices I am certainly going to buy an edition of this  it s so pretty I could die  I hope they re going to illustrate the sequels as well 1000 5 stars  Well  this book was released when I was only 3 years old  and the final one came out when I was 7  Obviously  I was unable to read them then  I wasn t interested in the movies until last year  2014  when I watched them all when I was sick  I never had interest in the books until watching the movie  but I always assumed I would read them at some point  I AM SO GLAD I FINALLY STARTED READING THEM  I LOVE THESE BOOKS SO MUCH  I also can t believe I deprived myself of the amazingness that is Harry Potter for so many years   So amazing  Video review soon  Wow   nggak kerasa sudah 15 tahun sejak saya kenalan sama Harry Potter dan terpesona pada dunia buatan Madame Rowling ini  Saya tahu kalo saya mestinya bikin review  tapi sebelum itu  rasanya pengen nostalgia saat pertama kenalan sama bocah dengan luka berbentuk petir ini Saya pertama ketemu Harry Potter di Bras Basah  sekitar akhir 1997  Saat itu saya sedang asyik memilih milih buku bekas ketika shopkeeper nya menawari saya buku ini  Dia berpromosi kalo ini buku bagus banget dan sayang banget kalo ampe gak saya beli  Dia juga bilang kalo Harry Potter ini lagi happening banget di Inggris sana Waktu itu saya kenal internet cuma sebatas email dan chatting doang  gak pernah browsing  Saya pun bukan tipe yang langganan majalah ato koran  jadi saya benar benar gak tahu kalo ada buku berjudul Harry Potter yang lagi booming  Saya malah curiga kalo buku ini adalah buku jelek yang gak laku  Ya logikanya aja  kalo emang tuh buku buagus banget kok udah ada yang jual second nya di Bras Basah  Dan kalo emang laris buanget  kenapa juga si shopkeeper maksa maksa saya buat beli  Tebakan saya sih ini buku gak laku dan si shopkeeper mo nepu saya  Oh   how stupid I was  Akhirnya buku Harry Potter 1 itu saya beli juga karena sang shopkeeper menjamin saya boleh tukar dengan buku lain kalo nggak puas  Dan begitulah awalnya saya kenal sama Harry Potter Rasanya saya gak perlu menulis sinopsis buku ini ato bahkan memberi tahu buku ini termasuk dalam genre apa  I mean  seriously  Sudah 15 tahun lebih sejak demam Harry Potter melanda dunia  it s been all over the news  Kalo bahkan ampe detik ini Anda nggak tahu garis besar cerita Harry Potter  berarti Anda emang gak berminat sama buku ini  Then why bothers now    Jadi lebih baik saya membahas apa yang saya rasakan sewaktu membaca kembali buku ini setelah 15 tahun berlalu Yang pertama saya rasa sih  aura nya yang beda  Sewaktu pertama baca Harry Potter dulu  teman teman saya gak ada yang ngeh sama buku ini  yah sebenernya ampe sekarang temen saya yang baca buku ini juga sedikit sih       Jadi saya heboh sendiri  bahas buku ini sendirian  dan dapat tatapan loe ngomong apa sih dari teman teman  bahkan fangirling pun sendirian  kasian  Sekarang ini  berkat GR dan BBI  saya jadi kenal banyak orang yang juga ngefans sama Harry Potter bahkan ampe baca bareng  Jelas vibe nya beda banget  Dan itu menyenangkan  Horeeeee    saya masuk golongan mainstream  hehe Yang kedua  saya mengubah pandangan saya tentang Harry di buku pertama  Awal baca dulu  saya beranggapan Harry ini kepo banget   Kenapa sih pusing banget sama kemungkinan Sorcerer Stone dicuri sama Voldemort  Kenapa gak kirim Hedwig aja ke Dumbledore sih buat warning     itu adalah pertanyaan saya dulu Sekarang saya ngerti kenapa Seperti yang dibilang Harry  Dumbledore tahu bahwa Harry butuh untuk mencoba melawan karena pertarungan dengan Voldemort itu personal untuk Harry  Gimana pun  Voldemort lah yang membunuh orangtua Harry  Dan Harry sadar kalo Voldemort bisa kembali menyerang dia Tapi terutama  karena Harry sadar bahwa kembalinya Voldemort dapat membuat dia kehilangan dunia sihir He was nothing in the muggle world  Gak punya siapa pun dan apa pun  Lalu dia menemukan semuanya di dunia sihir   sahabat  kebahagiaan dan terutama   penerimaan  Penerimaan yang tak pernah dia dapatkan sebelumnya  Gak heran kalo Harry berkeras mempertahankannya  I d do the same if I were him  I d fight the nastiest wizard if I have to in order not to let something most precious being taken from me  So I could understand Harry s determination to fight Voldemort even when he s still a kid Ketiga  ternyata saya sudah suka Ron dari buku ke 1 X  Jangan salah  dari trio itu Ron memang favorit saya kok  Saya suka Ron karena kalimatnya yang witty dan rada sarkastis  belum lagi sindirannya yang tajam  Tapi kualitas itu baru keliatan di buku kedua  ato malah ketiga    Yang pasti bukan di buku pertama Dulu saya gak ngerti apa yang bikin saya bersimpati sama Ron sejak awal  Sekarang saya tahu  Karena Ron orang pertama yang  menerima  Harry  Dia gak meremehkan Harry seperti yang dilakukan Malfoy  tapi dia juga gak memujanya secara berlebihan  Dia menganggap Harry sama normalnya dengan dia  and that s enough Keempat  saya makin kagum dengan persahabatan Ron dan Hermione  They re true bestfriends Tanpa ragu Ron dan Hermione menemani Harry untuk melawan Voldemort walopun mereka tahu resikonya  I mean  saya ngerti kesetiaan Ron dan Hermione pada Harry di buku ke 7  They ve come a long way  Tapi di buku 1  Saat mereka baru kenal 1 tahun kurang serta belum ngeh seberapa parah kondisinya kalo Voldemort kembali berkuasa  That s great Kelima  perubahan karakter Neville kerasa banget ya  Neville yang penakut dan gak berani membela dirinya sungguh berbeda dengan Neville di buku ke 7  I forgot how awkward  clumsy and shy Neville was  But let s talk about him on the later book Keenam  wow   penerjemah Harry Potter ini keren sekali ya Saya sudah pernah sih baca versi Inggris dan terjemahan buku ini  untuk reread yang ini  saya baca versi Inggrisnya lagi   dan dari dulu memang saya tahu penerjemahnya emang canggih  Tapi baru sekarang saya benar benar ngeh  Mirror of Erised diterjemahkan Cermin Tarsah  Erised yang merupakan anagram dari desire  diterjemahkan jadi tarsah yang anagram dari hasrat  Wow  Dan setelah saya googling  saya dapat info kalo sebenarnya ide Tarsah ini baru kepikir belakangan  menjelang bukunya turun cetak  Karena sang penerjemah berkeras mesti ada padanan yang tepat untuk  erised   Dan iya  beliau emang bener karena erised dan tarsah adalah padanan yang cocok Ketujuh  hmm    saya tetap gak ngerti kenapa Professor Quirrell gak bisa menyentuh Harry hanya di bagian akhir buku ini  Waktu awal cerita  Harry bertemu Prof  Quirrell di Diagon Alley dan saat itu mereka sudah berjabat tangan  Kok saat itu tangan si Quirrell gak melepuh ya  Padahal sudah jelas kalo Voldemort telah  nebeng  di tubuh Quirrell saat itu Kedelapan  saya makin kagum deh sama JK Rowling Oke   saya tahu kalo JKR emang banyak menggunakan bantuan mitos  legenda ato apalah itu dalam ceritanya  So it s not really original  Tapi toh emang gak ada formula yang benar benar baru  Yang penting sih gimana Rowling bisa meramu bahan yang ada  And she s really good at it Tapi yang sebenarnya keren dari Rowling adalah   dia benar benar paham karakter pembacanya I guess in some points of our life  even if it s just for one time  we ever felt like Harry  who s a misfit and wishing to go to some place new where we could start everything from the scratch or becoming a different people  But not everyone could do that  Apparently Harry is one of those lucky people Reading Harry s journey gave me happiness  Happiness that comes from knowing that at least there s one person in this world who could fulfill his dreams  It also gave me some hopes that in the end everything will be fine for me too  If this boy whose life was much more miserable than me finally found what he always wanted  how could I not    Dan Rowling juga dengan cerdasnya memilih setting di Inggris  suatu tempat yang masih bisa terjangkau dan karenanya masih terasa  dekat   Bukannya tempat jauh antah berantah seperti di Middle Earth sana  atau dunia magic namun tak terjangkau seperti Abarat  Terlibatnya kaum manusia non sihir  aka muggle  juga tempat tempat di Inggris seperti stasiun King s Cross membuat cerita ini makin terasa dekat di hati  membuat kita  oke   sebenernya sih saya  berani berharap bahwa suatu saat nanti saya juga bisa dapat  ehem   surat saya sendiri  Seorang teman saya bahkan sampe mencoba menekan pilar di tempat yang semestinya jadi peron 9 3 4 waktu dia lagi ada di King s Cross dan waktu salah seorang petugas di sana melihat kelakuan teman saya  si petugas bilang    You re not the first person who tried looking for that platform   Bhahak    ternyata banyak yang bermimpi ke Hogwarts eh    Dan alasan kenapa saya kasih 5 bintang walopun saya mengakui kalo cerita di buku ini masih kalah spekta dibanding buku buku berikutnya Karena ini adalah buku pertama  The one that started it all  Buku ini juga yang bikin saya kenal dan jadi langganan  sampe sekarang  sama sebuah toko di Bras Basah itu  It s always nice to find a new friend because of one certain book Lastly  just wanna say this   for you all who feel like you don t fit in  who wished for a magical school  or secret garden or magical cupboard that could open secret passage to magical land and still secretly keeping those wish alive   keep on wishing  Keep on hoping  Who knows  maybe your  letter  is on its way now    I LOVE Harry Potter  fantastic start to the series Reread December 2014 for  HarryXmasToYouThere are SO MANY foreshadowing things I never noticed before  Like the centaurs talking about the innocent being the first to die  And just so many things just mentioned that come up later  the dragon in Gringotts  Dittany  Sirius Black  Etc There s also a lot of things I ve forgotten weren t in the movie  which is crazy  But so good  I love it just as much IF NOT EVEN MORE  cchamiihnangsuue sakkiielmthiiemuue ewlaaphaanaipepnsib pii ph y nklabmaa aanaihmaelwkhwaamsnukyangethaaedim hruue

  hide spoiler   There is no way I could EVER write a review for this book  so I m just going to say a few words and leave it at that        Uploaded with ImageShack usMy neverending thanks to Litchick for organizing this colossal group read  I can t believe it s been 15 years since I last touched these pages   It was the best  re read of my  life  better than winning at Quidditch  or Christmas  or knocking out mountain trolls        I will  never  ever forget   I read this years ago   my kids were still young Did it bother anyone else that the publishers assumed Americans were too ignorant to know what the  philosopher s stone  was yeah  me to Well anyway  I ve read and listened to this  these  and gone back to them several times since  Even though my children are grown I still enjoy this series of books  As originally written the series  considering the time between publication of each volume  actually grew with the first generation of kids who read them  They do get gradually darker as they go on  but  originally  the children who d started were growing to  So  they actually matured with the story   My only caveat is that parents should be sure their children are mature enough now to move to each volume  Now a ten year old could conceivably buy the set and read them one after the other  so  parents need to be proactive and be sure their  youths  are ready  mature enough for each book  I m amazed at how much I still  feel  I know these characters and care about them even though they are fictional in a fantasy world  It s an accomplishment that s seen in the best of novels  Congratulations Ms Rowling  While they have their flaws these are wonderful books  I had started to give them 4 stars  I give very few 5 star ratings  BUT upon consideration  I realized I d read them several times and still enjoyed them greatly  These are wonderfully written novels  I rate it 5 stars This novel opens the story of Harry Potter  the boy who lived  We get to meet Harry  his aunt  uncle and cousin  We are introduced to the  wizarding world  and we go to Hogworts  And of course  we meet Ron and Hermione  I d say if you re not charmed by this book and don t find yourself caring about Harry and his friends   maybe you should check for Grinch blood    Enjoy  First of all  this book ought to be the Philosopher s stone  dang it  We Americans are NOT STUPID Second of all this is the book that started it all  It s classic  I first read it in college and I enjoyed it so much  the funny candy names  the characters  the reader is taken along with Harry on a magical adventure they will never forget I have read this book  this series many times  The enjoyment of it usually doesn t wane  There s maybe a few minor inconsistencies  but all and all it s just too enjoyable  It s earl grey tea  It s eating a delicious sundae  It s sprawling in your bed on a weekend just enjoying a good book that doesn t nag you  but it entertains you  It s a great book and you can see why JK Rowling went from being a struggling single mother to a kajillionaire because she is just that good Not perfect  no writer is  but great enough It s still very good  But dang it  I hate that Hagrid got everyone in trouble   dkhtrm nkhst wlyn jld   hry ptr   r khwnd  sps bry brdrnsh qSh r bz nmwd w anh khwndnd  hr rwz dr khnh SHbt z hry bwd w jdw  b khwd gftm bkhwnm w khwndm

Stone and I am very excited to read the rest of the series   _   Hogwarts  Hogwarts  Hoggy Warty Hogwarts Teach us something please Whether we be old and bald Or young with scabby knees Our heads could do with fillingWith some interesting stuff For now they re bare and full of air Dead flies and bits of fluff So teach us something worth knowing Bring us back what we ve forgot Just do your best  we ll do the rest And learn until our brains all rot    No review can do justice to the magic that is Harry Potter  Thus  I say only  take a bow Joanne Kathleen Rowling  for you have given the world something remarkable    I do an annual re reading of this series around winter time  December is the ideal time to start because Harry Potter has always seemed like a winter type series to me  I don t know why or how I started this tradition but I always attempt to follow it  This is the first year I ll be writing a review for my rereading because I realized I never did a proper one for the books  I think the reason is that I don t think I can find the words to describe just how much I love and adore this series  J K  Rowling created a world that I can sink into  that I can immerse myself into at any point in my life  I grew up with Harry  I remember reading GoF when I was 14  knowing that I couldn t have done what Harry did even though we were the same age  I remember realizing I was 18  that eighteen year olds didn t attend Hogwarts anymore  As Harry grew  I grew  I grew as a person  I grew as a fan of this series  I went from standing in line to see GoF with my mom when I was 9 to repurchasing the entire set so that I would have copies in my first apartment  It s always a relief to remember that Harry  Ron  and Hermione have  and never will  change  They have stayed constant during my life  It may sound so cliche but Hogwarts  and these series  will always be there  They are one of my childhood homes that I can visit again and again with just a flip of the cover   I ve honestly read this book so many times I find it kind of boring   She did not say that   I think I need to start skipping this when I do my re reads for awhile because I have this memorized   Please be aware that for many of my formative years in middle school and high school I only had access to books 1 4 as J K  was still tormenting her audience working on finishing her series  So I have read this particular book no less than 100 times   no hyperbole in that statement I swear  This is my review of the illustrated version which I found to be an absolute gem and a must own for all Harry Potter fanatics  such as myself  Before I share some photos of my favorite illustrations here are some thoughts about the overall book  This may be one of those things that is more of a collectors item versus an essential book for reading  It was fun and offered me a whole different experience to reading the book in general  but I m not so sure I would be so quick to pick it up again for pure reading purposes  It is very large and heavy  It is awkward to hold and can be difficult to read if you do your reading in bed  guilty   Like I mentioned  it enhances the reading experience but not completely essential to enjoying the book  Now  I don t have kids and the last picture book I read was Berenstein Bears  I did personally find the images to be on the darker side and more wacky and whimsical instead of soft and child like  whatever that means   I feel like these illustrations may appeal to more adults than kids but I don t read to kids before bed or even know what kids like  I don t even have the faintest idea who Jim Kay illustrates for so take that tidbit with a grain of salt  Here are some of my favorite illustrations so enjoy  The house in the middle of the ocean  Harry and Hagrid  Diagon Alley  Hogwarts Express   full version of the cover  Some insanely cool ghosts   Prob my fav of the book   not sure why I abbreviated those words  The potions master   view spoiler  Also affectionately referred to as the Half Blood Prince   hide spoiler   I loved Hagrid s hut in this book  I would visit this place every weekend too if I could    So there s that for you  I really just posted all of these for Sean so I hope he enjoys them  What can I say about this book that hasn t already been said  I can only tell you my experience in reading it for the very first time in the form of the illustrated version  I had such a great time reading this book  I had only watched a handful of the films prior to picking it up and had forgotten many of the scenes  so this story had some surprises for me  But just as wonderful in the surprise department were the amazing illustrations which never intruded upon the story and only enhanced it  Other than viewing some of them online  I purposefully didn t peek ahead in the book  but waited until the illustrations were revealed as the story unfolded  never knowing what I d find as I turned each page  Would there be this scene or that one next  And from which perspective would I get to view something  from above  from below  or from straight on  Which character would I get to see next  How much color or detail would there be  How much emotion would be conveyed  Not every page had an official illustration on it  but every page had a little something extra included that made it a treat to look at  whether the page looked marbled or had mysterious looking splotches on it  But even when there were full color illustrations on a page  I was able to use my imagination just as well as if there hadn t been any at all  Mr  Kay really did this book credit  I m very happy for him since he was so worried that he wouldn t  http   www telegraph co uk books what   But getting back to the story  which I haven t even talked about yet  what I liked best about it were the growing bonds between the characters  the slippery lines between good and evil  the many forms in which bravery appeared  the hope and optimism stirring in the hearts and minds of the characters  even when all seemed lost  and finally  the magic woven within this book which had nothing to do with the spells cast  I don t know why I waited so long to begin this series  but in a way I m glad I did  just so I could kick off reading it with this very special edition  I wish I could wait to read all the books in this form  but no way  I m sure I ll have read the entire series before the next illustrated book comes out  Then I guess I ll just have to read them again in the illustrated form  I will have no problem at all doing that   LEAH S RATING  age 4   5 STARSRAEF S RATING  age 6   4 STARSMEG S RATING  age  none of your business   5 STARSLEAH S REVIEW I liked the book and I liked the movie  It was exciting when they destroyed the troll LEAH S FAVORITE QUOTE  Welcome    Dumbledore  said   Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts  Before we begin our banquet  I would like to say a few words  And here they are  Nitwit  Blubber  Oddment  Tweak  Thank you  RAEF S REVIEW They should have figured out the answers faster and had better questions  The part I liked was the part when they were trying to get the Sorcerer s Stone at the end  The ending was a surprise RAEF S FAVORITE QUOTE  And what if I wave my wand and nothing happens   Throw it away and punch him on the nose   Ron suggested MEG S REVIEW I get it  I finally get Harry Potter  I know it s not exactly rocket science  but I didn t fully understand the obsessive fascination with this series until I read the first book to my kids  They were absolutely RIVETED the entire time  Every magical enchantment was rewarded with an  ooohhh  and  ahhh   every one of Ron s jokes met with hysterical laughter  and I could actually watch my son and daughter grow stronger with each impossible obstacle or horrific monster Harry overcame  In one early scene  Leah literally started crying when Harry thought he would be thrown out of school and sent back to the Dursley s  Now THAT is a sure sign of someone who is LIVING a book  not reading it So that s why my kids loved it  Here s why  I  loved it  Harry is strong  He stands up for what is right regardless of who stands against him  friend  enemy  authority figure  incorporeal undead wizard of darkness  etc    which makes him a powerful hero for my 4  and 6 year old  He s brave  self sacrificing  and honorable  I think Harry proves his own character  and addresses the book s central theme itself  in a scene he shares with Malfoy near the beginning of his time at Hogwarts  In this particular scene  Malfoy gives a snotty little spiel on how he can introduce Harry to the best wizarding families and help him stay away from the  wrong sort   Harry then refuses to shake Malfoy s hand and responds   I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself  thanks   And isn t that the essence of growing up  Moving away from simply doing what others tell us to do and learning to discern right and wrong for ourselves  Then  as soon as we know what s right  we can work on growing strong enough to stand up for it regardless of who stands against us  Harry is brilliant  Almost as brilliant as his author  who s created a story that is both wonderful and wonderfully told  Bravo MEG S FAVORITE QUOTES  and  of course  Dumbledore says most of them  Scars can come in handy Harry wished he had about eight more eyes  The very dust and silence seemed to tingle with some secret magic From that moment on  Hermione Granger became their friend  There are some things you can t share without ending up liking each other  and knocking out a twelve foot mountain troll is one of them It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live  remember that One can never have enough socks Death is but the next great adventure Humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them The truth    is a beautiful and terrible thing  and should therefore be treated with great caution To have been loved so deeply  even though the person who loved us is gone  will give us some protection forever  It is in your very skin There are all kinds of courage  It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies  but just as much to stand up to our friends  Wer liebt es nicht     I m a 22 year old woman and this is my first time ever reading Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone  It was everything that people said it was going to be  The world is beyond magical  I feel like a got a better feel of the characters  Neville Longbottom is my fave    MugglesReadAlong one book down    This book is one of my favs in the series The magic never withers and I m always able to find feel something different no matter how many times I ve read it  A true classic   Had a bad week so I decided to re read Harry Potter  this time in english   D   You don t like this series  Well  fuck off then  You and I are N E V E R going to get along   the illistrations in this book are beautiful THIS WAS SO GOOD    Oh shit    Porfin comence esta saga  era hora    Pense que esta lectura no me iba a sorprender tanto y a gustar tanto ya que habia visto la pelicula  pero todo lo contrario  A medida que iba leyendo el libro parecia que no habia visto al pelicula  El hecho de que hace un monton que no la veia de nuevo ayudo un monton tambien  Ademas de que obviamente un monton de escenas no estan en la pelicula  o le cambiaron cosas pequenas  porque las peliculas de hp son bastante fieles  i think  En cuanto a personajes  Harry es uno que a pesar que no haya amado  me encanta esa personalidad de todo a la mierda  yo lo hago igual  Y pensar que es super chico igual ajaja  Hermione es bastante infumable a veces  pero se nota que como amiga es excelente  amo sus ironias y su sentido del humor  me encanta    Ron es otro personaje que me gusta muchisimo  es como un gran amigo fiel  Hagrid es como un padre con mentalidad de nino ajajaj  me encanta  su personalidad  su sentido del humor  sus bromas  lo fiel que es  etc  Draco es el tipico nino malvado  que de vez en cuando se manda de las suyas  pero al final de todo  termina perdiendo   Toma Draco  por gilipollas  Le di 5 estrellas porque en este libro se introduce todo lo que es el mundo magico de Hogwarts y de todo este mundo  Es increible la imaginacion de esta mujer  Cada cosa que hay en este mundo es increible  a no ser los muggles  los muggles son mierda   Me sorprendi MUCHO en el final  porque sinceramente yo creia  view spoiler  que Gryffindor ganaba el trofeo de las casas  y estaba terminando el libro y todo declaraba que ganaba Slytherin y como como whaaat  y cuando gano Gryffindor al final fue como YO SABIA BITCHES   TOMEN GILES  hide spoiler    La parte final  en la que Ron  Hermione y Harry van en busca de la piedra filosofal  es super intensa y emocionante  Voldemort  hate u En fin  imposible no amar esta perfeccion de libro  espero seguir con el resto pronto     Reread November 2014Obviously this isn t my first time reading Sorcerer s Stone  I think this is the 3rd reading for me  And as every time before  I loved it immensely  I really am just reminded of how incredible J K  Rowling is at crafting a story  a whole world  and setting up the rest of the series  while still writing a smart  entertaining children s book  Because in reality  this first book is very young feeling  but it s never dumbed down  Since most people have read this or know the plot  I thought I would instead share some fun thoughts I had or noticed upon rereading this book  What do you think the sorting hat said to Hermione  Ron  or any of the other characters when they tried it on  Dumbledore s Chocolate Frog card mentions his defeat of Grindewald  a fact that doesn t come to be important until book 6 or 7  The Weasley twins are hilarious as always  and they know the secret passages already  probably thanks to the Marauder s Map  that shows up in book 3  I wonder why Hermione wasn t in Ravenclaw   I m sure there is some sort of answer for this one  I had just never thought of it before   I want Mrs  Weasley to knit me a sweater  The Mirror of Erised s inscription backwards says   I show not your face but your heart s desire   In the book  when Harry first finds the Mirror of Erised  he sees a reflection of his mom  dad  and the rest of his family  But in the film it only shows Lily and James  That would ve been cool to see in the film  Apparently  chess is the only thing that Hermione ever lost at  p 217   If she is so smart  don t you think she d be really good at the strategy of chess  After seeing Quirrell Voldemort in the Forbidden Forest  Harry starts to have nightmares about the face dripping unicorn blood  I wonder if this is Voldemort already using Occlumancy on Harry  In the film  the protections that Harry  Ron  and Hermione have to get through to find the Sorcerer s Stone leave out the troll  placed by Quirrel  and the potions challenge  Snape s   Would ve been fun to see Hermione tackle that one  Voldemort s face on the back of Quirrell s head is described as pale with red  slit eyes like a snake  like movie Voldemort   Why isn t that how they portrayed him in the first film   Also  Neville s best exam grade was in Herbology  Aww  Overall  I just thought it was remarkable to note how many things Rowling references already  It makes me even more excited to jump right into Chamber of Secrets next  I think I don t have to say anything except that I would give this book 1000000000 5 stars if I could   5 MAGICAL STARS  Ob vious ly    Jim Dale s narration is perfection  cannot WAIT to listen to Chamber of Secrets   Rosa  really wrote   Oh my gawd  Meep  I would LOVE to listen to the Fry version  You gotta tell me how it is  And yay for the studio tour  You lucky beotch  It s available on audibles now  I had a code for three months at 99p each  so one down two more two get    then I ll have to pay full monthly but still saving heaps Only listened to a bit but he s really good  highly recommend them I m so excited to go on the tour supposed to be good been trying to arrange it for ages  Auch auf englisch ist der erste Teil von Harry Potter einfach nur toll  Ich liebe die Welt  die J  K  Rowling erschaffen hat  Die Protagonisten  ob gut oder bose  sind genial und einmalig  Eine Reihe  die ich jedes Jahr wieder lesen kann und muss  I fought the Harry Potter phenom for so long that when I finally did succumb to it  I was blown away at why I resisted for so freaking long    WHAT a great series  But as I am very Type A  I am going to review each book individually as they all have interesting aspects to them This is the first book in the series  You meet Harry  You learn a tiny bit about who he is and why he is with his Aunt and Uncle at the very beginning of the book  You learn quickly to DESPISE his Aunt and Uncle and lovely cousin Dudley  ICK And then you go to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry  What an awesome place  I know that there has to be other people other than myself that wish that this was a real place and that we could all go there  Ghosts  pictures that move from one frame to another and 3 headed dogs named Fluffy You also learn about Voldemort  who is the reason Harry has to live with the Dursley s in the first place  Voldemort killed Harry s parents  and tried to kill Harry  but the spell backfired  So Voldemort is wandering around out in the world just biding his time when he can come back and finish Harry off   There is so much going on in this book  that I feel you have to read it more than once to get it all  Fantastic read    I simply adored this book  3  It was such a fast and funny read  Also  it brought childhood memories back  because I saw the first Harry Potter movie when I was 10 years old  and I was so nostalgic remembering it all  3 I m not used to read books after I watched the movies  but it ll be that way with my Harry Potter books  because I m a huge fan of the movies and I ve already saw them all  The good thing is that I don t really remember anything at all  haha  just the  big  parts  Oh  and also the deaths  cries    Sooo  I loved this book and I m impressed by that  I mean  I knew I was going to like it  But it was so much more  Since the first page it had me hooked  J K  Rowling has such a fluid writing style  I never got bored and I was gasping in some parts even when I knew what was going to happen Can t wait to read the next books      Azkaban Tutsagi ve Ates Kadehi kitaplarinin illustrasyonlu hallerini gormek icin sabirsizlaniyorum  Cizimler muhtesemdi  c mon  it s Harry Potter  whadya think     I found the idea of this series of books wonderful  When they were released there were not a lot of children s books that were set in the world of magic  I think for me the greatest thing about this book is  it teaches children and adults alike that  you can achieve anything you wish even when you think that it is impossible  I also think the theme of friendship is important  people can be friends whether you agree with everything about them or not  Hermione is a great example of that throughout the book  she is more of a straight laced student but she befriends Ron and Harry  She tells them it is to keep them out of trouble  but I believe deep down she is actually happy that she has found people that like a bit of adventure  it is something new to her  One aspect of the story that there has been a lot of discussion about is  why Harry was left with the Dursley s after the death of his parents  Although it is clear that Harry is not treated very well at all  I think this was the best place for Harry to grow up  Although he cannot understand why they do not like him because of his magical ability  they teach Harry a very valuable lesson   kindness  when he comes across all different kinds of people at Hogwarts  he is more prone to showing kindness to them after the way he has been treated by the Dursley s  They also have taught him how to stand up for himself when he is taunted by Draco Malfoy Rowling has the ability to create a world that every reader of these books wishes to enter and never leave  With owls that deliver the mail  a magical school where anything is possible and lets not forget the moving pictures  Hogwarts is a place that will live in the hearts of fans for years to come  All and all a great start to what looks like a fantastic series  If you are a fan of all things magical and have not delved into the world of Harry Potter yet  I would highly recommend you give this series a chance  This is the book that made me love reading  When I was younger I used to hate reading  I couldn t do it and I had no interest in learning it  but I could memorize  So in kindergarten reading groups that was exactly what I did  I memorized  I memorized the reading group books and passed through them all without ever learning how to read  It was my first grade teacher that figured me out and spent four weeks teaching me to read  I owe a lot to that woman  Still  I didn t really like to do it  It wasn t until second or third grade my mom brought this home and handed it to me and told me to give it a shot  Chapter one I handed it back and said I didn t like it  she handed it back and told me to try again  Rinse and repeat for a few chapters until something amazing happened  I didn t want to give the book back  I didn t want to put it down to go eat dinner and I certainly didn t want to put it down and go to bed  I stayed up until I was falling asleep on the pages and then I took it to school and started my bad habit of reading in class  Then I read through lunch and recess and silent reading time until I finished this book  I devoured all the others when I could get my hands on them but between Harry Potter books I didn t know what to do with myself  So my parents did a little digging around and found me another book I liked and then another and another until I became the family bookworm  I started borrowing books from my older sister  I started reading books to my younger brother  I read just about everything and anything I could find and I loved every minute of it  It s really hard to rate a book that I grew up on  but if any book deserves five stars  it s this one because it helped turn me into the person I am  The series itself got me through a lot of hard times and I love going back to it and re reading it because it feels like coming home   I highly doubted that I would ever write a review for any of the Harry Potter books  Instead  I created a shelf called  seven greatest books ever  and threw them all in there  hoping that would be enough to display my immense love for them  After seeing Part 1 of the Deathly Hallows movie  I decided that I would kick start the re reading process before the release of Part 2  so I picked up Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone for probably the 15th time  and began to read  I realized part way through  that even if I didn t want to review it for its literary merit  I still had much to say about the book solely regarding how it makes me feel At twenty three years of age  the book is still everything that it was for me when I was only twelve  I remember seeing it in a book order  remember those   in the sixth grade and putting a star next to it to take home to my mom  My mom  not wanting to buy me a book I d never read  denied me my request  adding that it looked pretty silly anyway  the joke was on her though  she came to love them too   Anyway  the next year  my cool uncle  don t we all have one   decided he was going to buy them for my cousin and she was going to have to let me borrow them  So I began the Harry Potter books  and suddenly being twelve  awkward and unpopular  wasn t quite so lonely as it had always been  I dreamed myself right into Harry Potter s world  not in a dangerous  psychotic way  but in a starry eyed  childlike way  Harry  Ron  and Hermione were better friends to me than anyone I met throughout my junior high and high school years  which in a way is a bit sad  but I have no regrets This was the first time that I ve read Sorcerer s Stone since Deathly Hallows came out  and it inevitably made for a far more emotional experience than the first time around  What was once just good  innocent  fun can t exactly be viewed as such when you ve seen the big picture  I literally burst into tears at the end of the chapter in which Harry and Ron finally take Hermione as their friend  Oh  what the heck  I ll go ahead and post the paragraph  in case anyone else is wanting to ride the high of that emotional wave But from that moment on  Hermione Granger became their friend  There are some things you can t share without ending up liking each other  and knocking out a twelve foot mountain troll is one of them Ah  Knowing what they were in store for  years of utter devotion to one another made this moment so much bigger now than it had seemed at first  Either way though  it s a very moving moment  I love this book  I will always love this book  And I full intend to disown any future children of mine who can t appreciate it with me  I haven t decided as to whether or not that s a joke yet   I was expecting my return trip to Hogwarts to be something of a dampener  I had finished the series and after all  how many more surprises could the first book reveal  The magic must have faded over time and the characters must surely have achieved the status of house guests who had overstayed their welcome  Predictably enough  I was wrong  Returning to the first book in what I can now proudly say is my most favourite series EVER was nothing short of magical  It was enchanting to see how the complex and multifaceted characters of the later books started off as nervous  unsure ickle firsties  It was a time for firsts  a  Ill treated  neglected 11 year old orphan Harry Potter discovers that he is a wizard   an actual  honest to goodness  wand swishing wizard b  There is a magical school called Hogwarts for young witches and wizards like him and at Hogwarts  Harry Potter is a legend and so much more than a small boy who lives in a cupboard under the stairs b  He discovers that he had brave parents who loved him dearly and lost their lives to the most powerful dark wizard in existence in a misguided attempt to save their tiny son c  It will be the first time that he will meet his soon to be best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger  not knowing that it would be the start of many unforeseen and memorable adventures for the trio For me  the charm lay in reacquainting myself with my favourite cast of characters  the great and twinkly eyed Headmaster Albus Dumbledore  stern Prof  McGonagall with a staunchly hidden soft center  quivering Neville Longbottom who is brave enough to stand up to his friends  nasty Draco Malfoy  lovable Hagrid  the irrepressible Fred and George and of course  delightfully detestable Severus Snape  I also liked the fact that  J K Rowling  carved out a story that was a blend of fantasy and realism  She refused to patronize her young readers  She spoke about death in a manner that doesn t usually finds it s way into a children s book  With minimal sugar coating  she created a world that was rife with pain  loss and love In this book  Harry Potter faces his vile enemy for the very first time with nerve and bravery  He gets his first opportunity to prove that he is more than just a legendary kid with a mysterious past The book sets an adequate pace  lays the foundation for future awesomeness and needless to say    the rest is history  Naturally this was a phenomenal because it s Harry Potter and I have always loved these books since I first read them  but this edition is the brand new illustrated edition and I have to say that Jim Kay was BY FAR a wonderful choice to illustrate these because he s represented the wonder  quirk and magic of the world and characters beautifully  I had so many pages within this that I adored  the colour palette is beautiful and has such a great vibe  and the style is free  flowing and fabulous The story was like coming home to friends of course  and I am so excited to keep reading the next few soon   5 s of course  although Harry Potter defies all rating systems  I am short on words  so I ll keep it simple  I started Harry Potter late  and I kept telling myself better late than never  Yes  that does work to an extent  And then I think of my younger version  reading all the crap our school teachers used to give us  And then I think how much fun would have been to read Harry Potter at that age  Why didn t anyone tell me about the book back then  Why didn t my parents buy it for my birthday  Or Christmas  Of course I blame my parents  Parents are responsible for everything  Well  almost everything  So mum  if you re reading this  shame on you  You took away from me the privilege of growing up with Harry Potter  That is a crime  A crime I say But seriously you guys  Harry Potter is epic  I can t wait to get my hands on Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets  Omg I ve finally read this book and I understand the hype  Wow this was amazing  I loved it so much  Especially with all the magic and the adventures    I need the next book now  o Estasiata come dopo la prima lettura Un breve commento sull edizione perche per me parlare di Harry Potter e impossibile  mi ha segnato  come posso essere minimamente oggettiva Questa edizione e quella definitiva  Le illustrazioi   ispirate alle descrizioni del libro  non ai film    sono splendide  Le pagine non illustrate sembrano essere scritte sul pattern di una pergamena  La qualita della carta patinata e ottima  La rilegatura non ha problemi  nonostante il peso  Perfetto    Amazing  I m still waiting for my letter    Ein Lebenstraum ist wahr geworden  Meine Schwester hat das Buch mit mir zusammen gelesen  Allein dafur wurde ich dem Buch schon 5 Sterne geben   D Danke J K  Rowling  fur diese Geschichte  danke Jim Kay  fur die wunderschonen Bilder  und jedem anderen  der daran beteiligt ist  dass es uberhaupt dazu kam  Ich werde meine Schwester die Tage noch befragen und dann berichten  wie sie es fand     I ve been putting off to start this series for so long  and I have no idea why  It was just as amazing as I expected Can t wait to continue with it  I did it backwards  I began with the movies and now I finished my first book  I loved every word of it  Up to the next   Rating  5  5A venit in sfarsit momentul cand pot face si eu o recenzie pentru una dintre seriile mele preferate  Harry Potter  Primul volum al acestei serii scrise de J K  Rowling se numeste Harry Potter si Piatra Filosofala si a aparut recent la Editura Arthur sub o noua traducere care ii apartine lui Florin Bican Nu am mai citit cap coada seria Harry Potter in traducerea veche a Ioanei Iepureanu de cativa ani buni  dar aceea este traducerea cu care eu am crescut si care m a atras  in ciuda parerilor negative  Ajunsa acum la o varsta  si trecuta prin mai multe carti  pot spune intr adevar ca traducerea unor nume proprii dintr o limba in alta  fara a se face referire la numele originale  nu este un lucru bun intrucat se pierde din farmecul creat de autor Florin Bican revine cu o traducere mult mai buna din punctul acesta de vedere  numele proprii sunt la fel ca cele din engleza  Malfoy si nu Reacredinta  Quidditch si nu Vajhat  Gryffindor si nu Cercetasi  etc   Am auzit o serie de discutii despre cum traducerea de la Egmont nu era una corecta cu privire la ce am mentionat mai sus  dar si deoarece existau pasaje din cartea originala care nu au fost traduse in intregime  Eu nu am apucat sa citesc seria HP in limba engleza  este in proces acest amanunt   asa ca nu pot spune cu certitudine acest lucru  dar adevarul este ca am avut senzatia ca traducerea veche era un pic cam simplista  ca si cand lipsea ceva pe alocuri Noua traducere de la editura Arthur este incantatoare  si pot spune ca dupa ce am facut o comparatie cu editia de la Egmont  aceasta noua editie este mult mai recomandata fiind una completa si corecta  sensul ideilor din engleza nepierzandu si originalitatea Intalnim si aici o serie de traduceri de care sunt sigura ca sunteti curiosi  Salcia Plesnitoare  nope  Severus Plesneala nu mai exista  in cazul in care va intrebati  Severus Snape a ramas si in traducere   Whomping Willow  Salcia Batausa in traducerea veche   Mageamii  Muggles  sau Incuiati dupa traducerea veche   Nick Cel Decapitat Un Pic  Nearly Headless Nick  Nick Aproape Far de Cap in traducerea veche   Baronul Bai de Sange  Bloody Baron  Baronul Sangeros in traducerea veche   Nimbus Doua Mii  Nimbus Two Thousand  Nimbus 2000 in traducerea veche   Trantorul  Scabbers  Pungasul in traducerea veche   etc Aceasta a fost o selectie de denumiri care mie mi au sarit in atentie mai mult  Unele dintre ele imi plac cum suna si in noua traducere  multe imi plac si in traducerea veche  Cu toate ca majoritatea numelor proprii nu au fost traduse  am observat si mici exceptii Revenind la povestea cartii  pentru ca nu am apucat sa va zic nimic inca  Aceasta prima carte a seriei este una absolut magica  Lumea Harry Potter este una dintre lumile care m a fascinat in copilarie  cartile si filmele fiind prietenele mele care ma amuzau si ma linisteau de fiecare data Povestea baiatului care a reusit sa supravietuiasca atacului celui mai mare vrajitor intunecat va dainui probabil inca multa vreme de acum in colo  L am urmarit cu drag pe Harry in primul lui an in care se inscrie la scoala de magie Hogwarts  acolo unde au fost si parintii sai pe care nu a apucat sa ii cunoasca Vrajile  fantomele plutitoare din castelul Hogwarts  bucuria rezolvarii de mistere a lui Harry alaturi de prietenii sai Ron si Hermioane  m au facut sa indragesc fiecare capitol al acestei carti  si sa ma bucur de un univers unde fantasticul abia isi deschide aripile  urmand ca urmatoarele carti sa ma dea pe spate din ce in ce mai mult Daca nu ati citit aceasta carte  serie  pana acum  eu cred ca aveti acum ocazia sa va apucati de o calatorie fantastica de care va veti aminti multa vreme  Ca sa fiti si mai atrasi de aceasta carte  la inceput veti gasi si o harta interesanta a locurilor de care veti auzi in lumea magica Harry Potter Ca aspect  noua editie este partial multumitoare  Imi place foarte mult ca are o coperta cartonata care are aproape acelasi aspect ca si supracoperta  aceasta din urma avand in plus un titlu lucios auriu   calitatea paginilor este ok  scrisul este potrivit ca marime  avem parte si de o harta minunata la inceputul cartii  insa imaginea de pe coperta mi as fi dorit sa fie in intregime ca cea originala  Exista numeroase editii pentru coperta primului volum  si cred ca se putea lucra mai mult la acest detaliu care uneori este cel mai atractiv pentru multi cititori  Citate  Tocmai ridicase bagheta  cand usa compartimentului se deschise din nou  Baiatul cu broasca se intoarse  de asta data insotit de o fata  Fata purta deja mantia de la Hogwarts   A vazut cineva o broasca  A pierdut o Neville Vorbea pe un ton autoritat  Avea o claie de par saten  iar dintii din fata ii erau cam mari   Deja i am spus ca nu i am vazut broasca  o informa Ron  dar fata nu parea sa asculte ce zice Se uita la bagheta din mana lui   A  faceai o vraja  Ia sa vedem Fata se aseza pe bancheta  Ron parea luat prin surprindere   Aaa  Bine Isi drese glasul Margarete  margarina  raze aurii de soare Sobolanul asta gras  sa fie galben la culoare Agita bagheta  dar nu se intampla nimic  Trantorul ramase cenusiu si adormit    p 123 124  Era deosebit de greu  Harry si Seamus roteau bagheta si sfichiuiau aerul cu ea din rasputeri  dar pana pe care li se ceruse s o trimita in slavi ramanea in fata lor nemiscata  Seamus isi pierduse rabdarea in asemenea masura  incat ii dadu bietei pene un ghiont ajutator cu bagheta si i dadu foc  Harry trebui sa stinga cu palaria flacarile izbucnite ca urmare a acestei manevre Nici Ron  la masa alaturata  nu parea sa aiba mai mult noroc   Wingardium Leviosa  striga el cat il tinea gura  rotindu si bratele lungi de parca era o moara de vant   Nu pronunti corect  o auzi Harry pe Hermione repezindu l  Se spune Wing gar dium Levi o sa  pronunta frumos silava   gar     cu   a   lung   De ce n o pronunti tu  daca esti asa desteapta  marai Ron Hermione isi sufleca manecile robei  sfichiui aerul cu bagheta si zise   Wingardium Leviosa Pana decola de pe pupitru si incepu sa graviteze pe deasupra lor  la o inaltime apreciabila   Bravo  excelent  aplauda profesorul Flitwick  Atentie  toata lumea  Domnisoara Granger a reusit La sfarsitul orei  Ron era un pachet de nervi    p 197    Uitati va colo  spuse Hagrid  Vedeti ceva care straluceste pe pamant  Ceva argintiu  Ala i sange de unicorn  In Padure e un unicorn pe care l a ranit ceva  nu se stie ce  Da  rau de tot    E a doua oara saptamana asta cand se intampla asa ceva  Miercurea trecuta am gasit un unicorn mort  De data asta  o sa incercam sa gasim bietu  animal ranit  S ar putea sa trebuiasca sa l omoram  ca sa nu se mai chinuie   Si ce se intampla daca  inainte sa gasim noi unicornul  ne gaseste fiara care l a ranit  intreba Malfoy  incapabil sa si ascunda frica din glas   Nimic din padurea asta nu va poate face vreun rau atata vreme cat sunteti cu mine sau Fang  spuse Hagrid  Si sa nu va abateti de la poteca  Gata   acu  ne mpartim in doua echipe si urmam poteca in directii opuse  E sange peste tot   tre  sa se fi tarat de colo colo cel putin noaptea trecuta   Il vreau pe Fang  se repez Malfoy  privind la coltii lungi ai cainelui   N ai decat  da  te previn  e un fricos  spuse Hagrid  Io  Harry si Hermione o s o luam intr o parte si Malfoy  Neville si Fang   in cealalta  Si cine gaseste unicornu   lanseaza in sus scantei verzi  Ne am inteles  Scoateti va baghetele si exersati putin chiar acum  Asa    Iar daca cineva are probleme  lansati scantei rosii si o sa venim toti sa va gasim  Fiti cu bagare de seama  Sa mergem    p 283 284  Reread  December 7  2015 This time I used an audiobook narrated by stephen fry and although I found some voices weird  I like most of it and will continue listening to it until I finish all of the 7 books  Aaaaaand I still like it                Oh good lord  all my love for harry potter  I got from the movies  I am so happy that I finally  finally get to read them  I am so so so so happy  The plot was amazing  and there were no boring moments  and I think I loved the characters even more  Ron was so funny  harry was sassy and hermione was so witty  I just love this so much omfg But I ve only got 6 books to read and I m dreading the moment where I finish this series  I can t Someone please perform memory charms on me so i can read it again Can you believe I ve never read the Harry Potter books before  and I ve never seen any of the movies   I don t know why the heck I was so against reading these when I was younger but I m definitely kicking my judgmental teenage ass right now haha  This book was just so awesome and I m actually really happy that I have no idea what to expect even though it s also killing me not knowing  This is the kind of book that anyone at any age could read and connect with and love so much  I m finally starting to understand the hype surrounding this series    Como siempre  fantastico  From time to time I play a  What if   game with my sister  view spoiler  Yes  we re both adults  view spoiler  Sort of  Shut up  P  hide spoiler    hide spoiler   and at some point we ll ask ourselves    What if your house was burning down and you could save take only one book on your way out    JUST ONE   view spoiler  Why we find this entertaining is beyond me  I ve stopped trying to understand my own weirdness by now  Just go with it   hide spoiler  This is obviously not a decision I take lightly  The mere thought of all my beautiful books burning     shudders   takes a deep breath As of today     Can I get a drum roll  please   THIS beautiful edition of Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone is THE ONE  The one I d chose to save above all others   gasp  The illustrations are simply stunning   J Kay made me fall in love with JKR s story all over again I actually hugged the book when I turned the last page   view spoiler  Again  just go with it   hide spoiler     Quite simply  this is a book I ll treasure forever                                                b Jan  14th  2016  Before reading This beauty arrived in the mail today  It was a reaaally late Christmas present My first reaction  I cried because I d just heard the news about Alan Rickman  and how twisted is it that 3 weeks after this was ordered it would arrive TODAY of all days Now a few hours have passed and I finally opened it and it is so GORGEOUS and PERFECT and I m starting to get really excited to do a slow re read of this book  and admire all the absolutely STUNNING illustrations  SOON  This series influenced my whole life and I m so thankful for every book  Loved it the second time around  too    This my first time rereading this book in four years and it is just as magical and brilliant as I remembered The artwork by Jim Kay is absolutely beautiful and it s so exciting to see the world we know and love re imagined  I can t wait to see the rest of the series illustrated  This time reading it I found myself feeling a lot more emotional about Harry and his life  He is so young  I feel so sorry for him and angry that he was left to have an awful upbringing by the magical world  Whereas when I read it multiple times as a child I was mainly just excited about the magic The world building in this book is absolutely phenomenal and it s just amazing the way that JK Rowling manages to create such a believable and detailed magical system that fits in with the world we know  This time reading it I was happy to notice more of the references to the real world that went completely over my head when I was younger I love reading about the blossoming friendship between Harry  Ron and Hermione and it s so great to read about Harry finally finding a place he can call home I can t help but see Dumbeldore as being very manipulative from the start  so it s interesting to read about him with a new perspective  I also just can t bring myself to like Snape  nothing excuses someone being so horrible to wee children This isn t the best review because this book is just perfect and I can hardly even put into world everything I love about this book  Yes  I realise I already own two copies of this book BUT this one is illustrated   that makes all the difference surely  It can t possibly be wrong to buy a book that looks this beautiful can it As soon as I saw images of Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone  Illustrated Edition I knew I had to have it  as a huge fan of the series and someone who already owns several print versions as well as the ebook of each Harry Potter story there was no way I could miss out on this beautiful new edition  There is absolutely no point in me writing another review of the story  you can read my original one HERE  because I m pretty sure that most of the people who are going to be looking at buying this book are already going to be Harry Potter fans so instead I m going to focus on the quality of the book and the illustrations To put it simply this book is STUNNING  I had high expectations but was totally blown away by how beautiful this book is  it brings back the magical feeling of reading Harry Potter for the first time and I think it s definitely a perfect edition to read with children  Jim Kay has done a fantastic job of giving new life to the characters  he s managed to make them his own  which must have been quite hard to do considering how well everyone knows the actors from the movies  while still making them instantly recognisable The book itself is a lot larger than I expected and has me wondering if they ll have to publish the later books in more than one edition  The quality is brilliant with lovely glossy pages and gorgeous illustrated end pages  This is the kind of book that you want to treasure and it would make a perfect gift for any Harry Potter fan  I can t wait to see the illustrated editions of the rest of the series and will definitely be purchasing them as soon as they re published I m going to finish this review with a couple of pictures so you can see just how beautiful some of the illustrations are   Harry in the cupboard under the stairs   An owl delivery   The Sorting Hat   Beautiful end pages  EDIT 9 18 13  Rereading  again  with Litchick and Tandie and a while bunch of other lovelies starting November 18  JOIN US I must have reread this series about 5 times  but I still remember the way it felt to experience it for the first time  I was introduced to the world of Harry Potter at the age of eight when I watched the first Harry Potter movie  I was enthralled  When I turned nine  I noticed that many of my classmates were carrying around these huge books  so I decided to pick up Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone  I can honestly say it changed my life  Before HP I did like to read  but it wasn t really all that big of a deal to me  When I finished the first Harry Potter book  it was like a spell was cast on me  hehe   I went out and got the rest of the books immediately and I flew through each one  When there were no more HP books to read  I went into a sort of withdrawal  counting down the days until the next installment became available  I went and watched all the movies on opening weekend  I was utterly obsessed  The thing that I am most grateful for is the love of reading that was instilled in me as a result of JK Rowling s books  Once I got a taste of the excitement of reading  I couldn t stop  And that  my friends  is why reading is now my favorite thing to do  That is why I began to write my own stories  plays  and poems  and am currently working on a novel that I hope to publish one day  I owe all this to JK Rowling  I can t thank her enough for what her books have done for me  The story of Harry Potter  an eleven year old boy horribly abused and neglected by his  family   if you can even call the Dursleys a family  was one that saddened me when I first read of it  It still saddens me to this day  Still  as a little kid  whenever I went through some hard times  I always told myself that Harry had it worse than me and he endured  I aspired to be like Harry  If he could deal with the Dursleys  then I could deal with whatever life threw at me  Harry Potter is the kind of kid I would love to have as a friend  He s brave  humble  and loyal  I find myself forgetting that he s a fictional character as I read  but at the same time wishing with all my heart that I could meet someone like him  And then we have Ron  Ron was hilarious  what with his dry humor and sarcasm that never came across as bitter or like he was trying too hard  While I noticed that he was self conscious about his family s financial situation  he wasn t all  woe is me  about it  He was a good and loyal friend to Harry As for Hermione  I adored her  I found myself connecting with her on such a personal level  I could relate to almost everything she went through  I also happen to have a mane of bushy brown hair  brown eyes  buck teeth  before I got braces   and a love of books and libraries  I too am a huge goody two shoes that many people would consider smart  But most of all  I have a habit of shooting my hand up in the air every time a teacher asks a question  Snape would probably despise me  Hermione was practical  smart  responsible  and a great friend  Her amazing cleverness and skill in magic is even more commendable because of the fact that she s Muggle born  She d had no prior experience with magic of any kind before coming to Hogwarts  and still she came out top of her class in her first year  Take that  Draco  Speaking of Draco  allow me to rant about the obnoxious git  He was the most contemptible  pompous  jealous  spoiled little brat I ve ever encountered in a book  He seemed to have absolutely nothing better to do than follow Harry and his friends around and ruin their lives in any way possible  Ugh  Someone needs to hit this kid  Still  there s a part of me that feels bad for Draco too  I think all of his hatred for Harry and his friends is really jealousy  Think about it this way  Harry had great friends  Draco has dumb  mean cronies  Harry is famous  Draco doesn t get any attention  Harry s great at quidditch  Draco s not really good at anything  though he does excel in douchebaggery   While the bad still outweighs the good  we have to remember that he s just a lonely  jealous kid that needs to lash out at someone Now lets talk about one of my favorite characters  Severus Snape  I love him  Is that so wrong  I adore that man  My opinion of him has never changed  Sure  I knew he was a jerk in all the books and I got so angry at him at those times  At the same time  though  I was thoroughly amused by his sarcastic  caustic wit  You have to admit  he s funny  mysterious  complex  and even sexy  in his own weird way  As I continued with the series  I grew stronger feelings for him  Stronger annoyance at his bouts of meanness  stronger understanding of why he did what he did  and finally  in the last book  a stronger love and respect of his character  The first time I read Sorcerer s Stone  I was so confused  Did he hate Harry or didn t he  Was he trying to kill Harry or save him  This is what I love most about Snape  The inner machinations of his mind are an enigma  if you know where that line is from  go buy yourself an ice cream   Then we have Hagrid  the sweetest  cutest giant of them all  I love his adorable accent  his love of deadly animals  and how much of a great father figure he is for Harry  Ron  and Hermione  I think his ludicrous belief that deadly creatures are actually harmless stems from his own personal experience  At first Hagrid seems threatening and hostile because of his size and wild appearance  when really he is a huge sweetheart  In this way  he feels he can relate to the dangerous creatures that he loves  Except the majority of these creatures don t turn out to be sweethearts like Hagrid As for the Dursleys  I cannot deal with them  I despise these people  Can t stand them for the life of me  Somehow  I almost find myself hating them more than I hate Voldemort  especially Petunia  God damn it woman  this kid is your BLOOD relative  He is your sister s son  and you treat him like a prisoner  You wouldn t even treat strangers that way  As much as I despised this family  I found them funny as well  particularly Vernon s angry explosions  And last  but most certainly not least  there is Albus Dumbledore  I love him for his cute craziness  as well as his wisdom  I ve never seen a better combination of the two  He is a wonderful father figure for Harry  Still  the mystery surrounding him frustrates me  What did he see in the Mirror of Erised  dammit   The world will never know All in all  this series remains my favorite of all time  Thank you  JK Rowling  for all you ve done for me and for millions of other people all over the world  It was interesting how I ended reading finally the books of Harry Potter  I d heard some comment here and there even before of the first film from some acquaintances and I had the general knowledge that it was becoming a phenomenon  but still I didn t feel compelled to read the books  I ve been reader all my life but I don t know  I was kinda undecided about it  Then  the films came out  and I started to watch them  and still I wasn t eager to read the books  since I thought  hey  I am watching the films  so what may I am losing about the story  oh boy  how wrong I was    I had some good surprises because I wasn t reading the books like in the third movie  When I watched the fourth film  Goblet of Fire  I was commenting it with a friend that he was reading the books on Spanish and he told me enough stuff that was in the fourth book BUT it was missed on the fourth film that I decided then to read the books  Oddly enough while my friend was been reading the books on Spanish  he had an edition on English of the first book  this one  and since by then I already was reading on English  he lent me the book  Usually I am quite reluctant to borrow books or that people lent me books  I had some bad experiences borrowing books and while I am dependable and careful about stuff that it s not mine  still I don t want to have books  etc    that are not mine under my care  Still  my friend insisted and he told me that he was glad that somebody read the book since he bought it in an impulse thinking that he would read it but he aborted the mission and he prefer to read on Spanish  Since I wasn t SO convinced to read the books  I ended accepting the offer of that he lent me the book  I started to reading it    OH MY GOODNESS    Right in the first pages  when Hagrid mentioned WHO lent him out the flying motorcycle    OH MY GOODNESS    Keep on mind that I already watched 4 films by then  so reading the identity of the real owner of the motorcycle  mentioned in so casual way and right in the beginning of the saga  OH MY GOODNESS    Then  I knew that J K  Rowling was a wicked genius    And this first book kept me surprising me even when I was already reading the fifth book  since certain character that appears in the first book  then I said  Oh  boy  what a boring chapter  why did J K  bothered to create such unimportant character   and I was starting to read the fifth book and     Mmh    where I heard about this character before   where    mmmh   OH MY GOODNESS    NO    IT CAN T BE      By then  I had returned the borrowed book but I had bought my own copy for the collection and I consulted it and POW  Yes  it was the same character    Right in the first book    So  re confirmed like for the umpteenth time    J K  Rowling is a wicked genius    I enjoyed a lot reading the first book  J K  Rowling has a very interesting style of writing  Also  the first book is very good combining the magical world with the normal things that people has to do when kids are beginning school  Going to buy the school supplies  Having to deal different kind of teachers  Some good  some strict  some both  The forming of friendships with schoolmates  Indeed a wonderful and magical book  Highly recommended  Update 2  30th October 2014  Oh my God  Sex for the ears  if anything Update 1  13th October 2014  Re started the series in audio book form  Needless to say  the hour s drive to university has become so much less painful  Coincidentally  as with my first real page experience  this book has now earned the trophy of my first real audio book experience as well  Stephen Fry version highly recommended  My first real read at the tender age of 10  Thank you  Aunty Nasrin  who brought me a copy from London when it was first released and gave meaning to my childhood  AHHH SO MANY EMOTIONS PACKED IN ONE TINY BOOK This is my first time ever re reading the HP books and I m so happy I did it  I listened to the audiobook this time around because I didn t have much time and it was my first time ever listening to an audiobook and I absolutely loved the experience  I think there are only a few select books that audiobooks are appropriate for and Harry Potter is definitely one of them  It took me back to the days where my dad would read to me and my sister before putting us to bed  I absolutely loved reading the books after the movie has been released because it allowed us to envision the scenes more vividly with every detail  One thing JK Rowling did a fantastic job at with the books is that she had planned and prepared and imagined the wizarding world down to every detail to the point that she made it a point to list all the textbooks with their authors  the different candies and chocolates  the history of the wizarding world  and DESCRIPTION OF THE FOOD OH MY GOODNESS This book was written so well and is suitable for all ages and for that and other reasons  I cannot give this book any less than 5 stars  3SPOILER ALERT  though  if you still don t know the storyline of the books  you REALLLY need to read the books or even watch the movies And rereading it after fully understanding the story has made me realized that Dumbledore had probably known all along and was pushing for Harry to come face to face with Voldy and I mean  for an 11 year old that s a BIG responsibility  Poor kid  To credit Harry  Ron and Hermione  they HAD tried seeking for an adult s help but they all ignored them so what choice did they have  AND HAHA Dumbledore just does whatever the heck he wants man  I mean at the end when they were announcing the winner of the house cup he was just like  Nah  yknw what I don t want Slytherin to win  lemme just let them THINK they won but then give extra points to Gryffindor for breaking all the school rules weeee  I think the movies didn t quite portray alot of the characters properly For one  Harry is sassy okay  SASSY2  Dumbledore is supposed to be a little more loopy and weird3  Hagrid is supposed to be more protective of everything he believes in like Harry  Dumbledore  etcand finally  WHY THE HECK DIDN T FRED AND GEORGE MAKE MORE APPEARANCES IN THE MOVIE    The audio book was a whole new experience     I loved this so much  I don t know why I haven t read this before now  I m so excited to continue on with this series  Amo questo libro  amo questa saga  amo zia Rowling  3  Tornare ad Hogwarts e sempre un toccasana    The hype of Harry Potter passed me by when I was small  so it s only now  at age nineteen  that I borrowed the famed  and very tattered  novel from the library and immersed myself in the world of Hogwarts  It was strictly for  research   okay  I can t call myself a children s author and yet have skipped the most impacting and controversial children s novel of all time  So first of all  I loved it  I m not fan of the  classics  style  but the clean prose of Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone  the quirky description and the subtle humour could very well convert me  It s written in omnipresent narrative  again  not my  thing    with POV everywhere and by anyone  Once Harry turned eleven  we delved more into his viewing of the world  but at the beginning  we see out of everyone  eyes  Even that cat s  The character  Oh  the characters  My personal taste requires a book to be well written and have gripping characters   Everything else is open for negotiation   I loved Hagrid  And Dumbledore  And Snape  urgh   And Harry  Ron and the Weasley twins were instant favourites of course  the latter s antics keeping me smiling the whole way through   But  I ll go right ahead and say that Hermoine is my utter favourite  I loved her from the beginning and every aspect of her character was so well written  not to mention hilariously brought across  Ron and Harry s understandable disgust of her is epic  The only character I said   Meh   at was Voldemort  He had so much hype around him from chapter one that I didn t think he could possibly be that scary  He wasn t  Any villain who doesn t kill his victims straight away is going to end up defeated   probably by a preteen and his little gang of snivelly nosed adventure seekers  Being over ten years old  the style of children s books as changed since Harry Potter first hit the shelves  Does that affect this novel  No  It stands in a classy light of it s own  It can t be accused of being  cliche   because it started everything  It s well written and well plotted and I think my only complaint is Harry having to spend his summer holidays back with the Dursely family  As to the controversial aspect  Witchcraft  Wizardry  Is JK Rowling promoting children to immerse themselves in the occult  Should we be scared of this book and ban and burn it  Well  apart from my personal conviction that a book should never be burned  I can t see much difference to reading about dragons and fairies  to frolicking through Harry s adventures in Hogwarts  JK Rowling presents a side for evil and a side for good  It can be argued  how is magic ever good  And it can also be argued  is there such a thing as magic   Or fairies  for that matter  And I still believe in them   Harry Potter is a fairy tale  Take it or leave it at that  If I had a small child  which I don t  being   well  a teen and all  I would probably not let them read Harry Potter until they were ten or so  Then we could discuss it  It is an epic classic  still standing after decades  and still inspiring children to imagine  have adventures  and write  Or find their letter to Hogwarts  That option might outweigh the others   First Read  Summer 2009 Last Read  January 2016Five stars  of course There is no greater home than the Harry Potter books  I adore these books more than I can ever express in words  The first major series I ever read  the books that got me into reading  my favorite series  It was so nice to read this book again and the pictures were an added bonus  Jim Kay is a wonderful artist  J K  Rowling s words are so great  Being back with Harry  Ron  Hermione  Neville  Fred and George  Hagrid  and everyone else made me so happy  There are some things that I had forgotten like how much I dislike the Dursley s  the purple and black fire walls scene at the end  and how much I love Dumbledore  So those were great to revisit  If you haven t already  pick up these books  They are so worth it  I ll keep waiting on my Hogwarts letter  even though it almost feels like I ve already been   Whether you come back by page or by the big screen  Hogwarts will always be there to welcome you home     J K RowlingDaaaaang  this book still makes me laugh and smile and get fustrated and uglycry tears of pure happiness  It still got it s magic even though its my x times rereading this series  Plus It makes me wanna rewatch the movie now  Thank you J K Rowling for allowing us to step into this amazing and awe inspiring world of yours  Thank you for truly making my childhood magical when reality was ugly  Thank you for a world I could quietly sneak onto the Hogwarts Express and simply  be  there  Thank you for the memories   3  First reread  2nd time reading overall  28 10 14   30 10 14 Do I really need to write a review  Harry Potter will forever and always be my favourite series  I literally cannot think of any series that could come close  Every single page is just perfection  I have not one bad thing to say about the entire series  I cannot wait to reread the rest in this series  Second reread  3rd time reading overall  5 08 15   6 08 15 Ugh  Once again  just perfect  Second time reading this in less than a year  No regrets  Harry Potter is perfection  Ahh this book brings me so much happiness  It says a lot when a story is just as good the 5th time around  I always forget how much dialogue they took directly from the book when making the first movie  it just proves how amazing J K  Rowling is as a writer  Anyways  not much else I can say about this masterpiece   I always cry when Neville gets house points at the end   Honest to god I don t know why I put off reading Harry Potter for so long  You all know it s fantastic  the whole world knows it s fantastic and now   YEEEESSSS finally  so do I  I have only seen the Harry Potter movies up to now  but I thoroughly enjoyed reading this first book in the series  I actually liked reading this more than seeing the movie of it  There s no words     I think I love this book more every time I read it  HP is my number one book series for a reread  Reading Harry Potter and Philosopher s Stone is like meeting an old friend  It never gets old and I ll never get tired of reading it  There are some things you can t share without ending up liking each other  and knocking out a twelve foot mountain troll is one of them   You can t help falling in love with reading after discovering the Harry Potter series as a young reader  This is the magical place where book worms are born  HP turns reluctant readers into series bookworms and devourers of book series  and this is true for my eleven year old daughter  I began reading the Harry Potter series to her two years ago and she quickly fell in love with the HP world and characters  She laughed  cried  celebrated with and cheered for HP and his friends  She can even remember the names of each of the characters in the whole series  Reading Harry Potter has opened up a world of books for her and now she s reading Gail carriger s Waistcoats   Weaponry book three in the Finishing School series and she has already finished reading The Naughtiest Girl in the School series  a few YA  middle grade  paranormal books  The Hunger Games Trilogy Boxset and my YA horror book Warm Bodies  and she loved it  I think my little bookworm is about to raid my stash of books and I better move my romance grown up books out of the way until she s a bit older Once again  I finished reading Harry Potter and Philosopher s Stone but this time I read it with my nine year old son  He s a reluctant reader who loves the outdoors and computer games so I decided to use HP to improve his reading skills and perhaps help him discover love of books He loves watching the HP movies  only the first three  but this is the first time he has read Harry Potter and Philosopher s Stone and he tells me the book is better than the movie  I m so proud of him  He s upset the movies left out Peeves the Poltergeist  the prankster ghost and his new favourite character  He s already quoting The Philosopher s Stone  and he s adding a few twists of his own  and it s pretty funny and adorable  We ve already started Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets  It s going to take us a long time to finish the HP series but it ll all be worth it in the end  Already a new generation is discovering the phenomenal  magical and beautiful series that is Harry Potter and I m so happy to play a small part in this discovery  J K  Rowling s  humour  incredible  imaginative and easily accessible writing skills makes reading HP is as easy as    Swish and flick    5 magic starsReading this made me happy  It was like going back to my childhood  when I first heard  and read  about Harry Potter  I was am one of the lucky ones from the  Potter generation   and I have nothing but good things to say about the story  the world  the characters that J  K  Rowling created This is exactly the type of book children and young teens should read  Nowadays  mainly girls  are reading stuff that are marketed for older and more mature readers  focused on topics they know nothing about yet and probably shouldn t read about due to not being ready to get the grasp of it and a whole  objective vision of their own after reading said stories  for example   BDSM  stuff that in reality is not BDSM but a  how to be abused by a bastard  guide    You know which book I m talking about  And that one is not the only book with abuse being glamorized   This book  even though it s not the very best written book ever  focuses on the value of friendship  family and team work  It portrays flawed  yet strong characters  And not only male characters  but also female  which is currently hard to find nowadays  Women  girls  are normally being depicted as weak and needy  whose only purpose is to serve love a man in order to find their lives complete  and whose happiness depends solely and exclusively in said man  And to get him  in many books friendship is torn apart just for the sake of getting their love interest  In my opinion  we re sending the wrong message to young girls  Many do believe that  indeed  they need a boyfriend to be happy  That if they don t have one  their worth is less or there s something wrong with them  Society itself promotes the message that if you re a woman and you don t get a man  you failed at life  All I can ask myself is why In the other hand  Harry Potter shows brave characters  all in its own particular way  Characters that through each book continue to grow and develop  That s why I recommend anyone  young or not  to read these books  At least for the happy old times PS  Proud Ravenclaw here   D This is less a review  and more a sort of miniature memoir of my Harry Potter experience  Gushy emotions and etc follow  so feel free to skip this review with no more than my recommendation that if you have not read this series you should do so immediately Every so often when I m sick in bed  a little depressed  or just generally cold and want nothing more than to snuggle up with blankets and forget the world for a few days  I go on a Harry Potter marathon  I read every single one of the books   in order   over the course of around two days  I ve read them so often that I can devour them in almost a single go now  followed by as many of the films as I can fit into the time I have left  before I m forced back into reality  I am one of the Harry Potter generation  I was four when this first book was published  fourteen when the series concluded  and around the same age as the characters in the films when they eventually came out  I still remember my mother insisting that I was too young to read this  at the age of 5  and hiding it under the sofa cushions so I could read in secret anyway It s a series that I grew up with  and as such  cannot comment on its literary merits without bias  All I know is that these books are a comfort  and feel almost like family  They may not technically be the best books I have ever read  but for a reading experience they are truly unparalleled 30 Day Book Challenge  Day 3  Favourite series   It has to be  there is no other series of books I ve read this many times  and will read again another hundred  I can  and sometimes do  read the entire series in three days or less now  as I am so familiar with the words I can simply slip through them for the comfort of the story     Aunque al libro en si le daria 4 estrellas  la edicion ilustrada se merece sin duda alguna un 5  Si quereis leer mi fotorresena  donde enseno muchas de las ilustraciones y comento la edicion  podeis hacer clic aqui  http   www alaspapel com 2015 10 harr    Es un gusto saber que hay libros que te arrancan de una sola vez varias emociones y le agradezco al cielo haber caido en esta epoca cuando este libro aparecio  Aun recuerdo la primera vez que lo lei y no deje de leerlo hasta el final  Busque el siguiente y cuando salio me quede prendada de la historia  tan real y a la vez tan magica donde todos nos gustaria vivir y estar con nuestros amigos y familiares  El peligro y la sensacion de que puedes hacer miles de cosas  es lo mas grandioso  Gracias a la autora  a sus experiencias  a todo lo que ella aprendio y al gran personaje que es Harry Potter   What can I possibly say about Harry Potter  The boy who made everyone  whether child or adult  fall in love with him  Everything has been said   I just want one of those   So I can   And then I will   Because    I m just going to be honest here  It is impossible for me to write an unbiased review of Harry Potter I know Harry Potter has it s flaws  I know J K  Rowling makes mistakes  But Harry Potter is one of those series where you could give me a list naming all its faults       and I honestly couldn t care less I grew up with Harry  and it will always be my favourite book series  No matter if I m happy or sad  I will always pick it up again eventually  So  now that you ve been warned  let s review this book  or  rather  this edition  The Story I don t really need to go into much detail  I think everyone knows what the first book is about  Harry s first year at Hogwarts and his first encounter with Voldemort and magic  I love Rowling s writing and the pace of the plot  There really is not a single dull page in this one  The Edition I wanted to re read Philosopher s Stone for a while now  but with all the TBR books in my shelf  I never really allowed myself to  So I was more than happy when I got this beautiful book for christmas  I don t need to tell you that the illustration in this are amazing  because if you took one look at the cover you know that Jim Kay can draw  Now  what might be more interesting  Is it worth buying For every Potterhead  YES DEFINITELYFor everyone that just liked Harry Potter  Mhh  if you own a copy of the normal edition  it might not be necessary to buy this one  because the text inside is exactly the same  the only bonus are the illustrations  Even if you don t already own a copy  I don t know if it would be wise to buy this  because this book really is huge  Alas  hard to transport  No taking this book to work or school to read during break  But  If you don t plan to bring it with you wherever you go  why not  For me  this book is definitely worth the money and if I ever were to have kids  this is the book I m going to read them   5 0   Mi lectura prometida  ano tras ano retrasandola para evitar decepcionarme y al final me he decepcionado de mi mismo por ser tan tonto y no haberla leido antes  Y me pregunto   Por que no antes   simple  No era el momento indicado   Harry Potter Y la Piedra Filosofal  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone  por la britanica J K Rowling es una obra espectacular que combina diversos topicos del mundo de la fantasia y nos da un universo plagado de magia  Pocas veces e nos permite ver sucesos historicos  algunas veces los vivimos pero nunca los apreciamos pero en este caso estoy seguro de que estamos frente a un libro que es historia en si mismo y que seguramente se convertira en un clasico para las generaciones futuras  Uno de los mejores libros  jamas escritos  Excelente Opinion PersonalSenti como si fuese llegado a casa luego de un largo dia de trabajo  como si lo conociera de toda la vida pero ahora lo disfrutara mas  Me senti tan YO en este libro  quizas por los personajes  quizas porque estoy algo loco o tal vez por la propia situacion en si  Hace 5 dias comence el libro y hace 5 dias comence la universidad  Si  si ya se que para Harry Hogwarts representa el bachillerato pero saben que  no importa porque la sensacion de los primeros dias siempre es igual  Y este libro son mis primeros dia en Hogwarts asi que doy por iniciado mi viaje por el universo de Harry Potter La verdad es imposible ser objetivo con este libro  tampoco creo que deba serlo  Creo que lo mejor de este libro son los personajes  reales  creibles y carismaticos hacen de este universo una especie de Tierra Media  Tolkien  para ninos  Y todo esto salido de la mente de una maravillosa mujer  Lo unico que saco en claro de todo esto es que la verdadera maga es Rowling  Mira que combinar temas es dificil pero combinar la alquimia con la magia  unicornios  vampiros  hombres lobos y una larga lista de etc    Esta mujer debe tener la mejor imaginacion del mundo  La adoro  Ahora la pregunta es   Cuando leere el siguiente libro  No lo se  pero cuanto antes mejor  Supongo que me dejare llevar y terminare leyendolo cuando sea el momento indicado   YES  JUST A BIG FAT YES    4 5  Gryffindor Witches   Wizards Rule   Stars  I m a little late to this fantasy children s classic  but boy am I glad I finally did take the time to read this imaginative tale  What a fantastic family joint read with my 10 and 8 year old    A story that is equally appealing to parents and kids  we had a splendid time taking turns reading Harry s adventures out loud  We even experimented making different voices to match the characters that my children first got to experience in the movies  Perhaps my most satisfying moment was when my daughter and son finally agreed with me that it is much more satisfying to read a story versus watching the much more necessarily limited movie rendition  Of course the best of both worlds is getting to do both  preferably with the book preceding the movie  Now I can t wait to continue this journey with my kids in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets  Source  Personally purchased paperback copy  Going to be honest with you all  I didn t read every word in this book  I just looked at all the illustrations and read a few paragraphs  I don t feel like rereading HP   the Philosopher s Stone at the moment but I did want this one off of my TBR because  0by17   Every now and then Uncle Vernon would take a sharp turn and drive in the opposite direction for a while   Shake em off    shake  em off   he would mutter whenever he did this  Oh yaass  better shake it off like Tay tay  Uncle Vernon  This was my first ever read of Harry Potter  I know  I am behind on the times  BUT  I understand the hype and I truly really did love it  I cannot wait to read the rest of the series   First read  2001Re read  2010  2012Readalong   MYPotteheadsReadathon on August  2015 Actual Rating  5 5 MAGICAL    100   It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies  but just as much to stand up to our friends  It is very interesting to reread the first book of a series after so long  You read with an entirely different perspective  You are more keenly aware of minute details that  at first seem unimportant  but take on an entirely different scope when seen in a new light  I believe this is why I am enjoying the reread so much  it s because I have a whole new outlook on it all  It s an entirely new discovery process  we have come full circle  It s a real treat I have been wanting to re read these books for ages now  It has been some years since I last read the Harry Potter books  And I am thrilled that I decided to finally re read them now  Because I adored reading this first book again  It is so awesome  I had a few issues  but mostly loved it a whole lot  The wand chooses the wizard  remember   I think we must expect great things from you  Mr  Potter    After all  He Who Must Not Be Named did great things    terrible  yes  but great  One thing that I noticed straight away about Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone is that Harry  himself is quite saucy and really funny  I don t remember it having this impression on me when I was younger  There were so many moments when I couldn t believe how funny the book is  It s a really different tone from the films    which I see as having a much darker and more serious undertone    and really makes the story come alive in a lighthearted and fun way Hogwarts is a truly magical place  not only in the most obvious way but also in all the detail that the author has gone to describe it so vibrantly  It is the place that everybody wishes they could of gone to when they where eleven  And there many adventures befall the trio  Harry  Ron and Hermione  and the stone in the book s title is centred to all that happens  The story builds towards and exciting conclusion that has the ultimate feel good factor I don t know how many readers out there have not had the chance  or the inclination  to begin their journey to Hogwarts  I envy you this chance to step on board the Hogwarts Express for the first time  to discover a world that will certainly suck you in and leave you gasping at its vivid richness  There s nothing quite like embarking on a new series  and Harry Potter is definitely not one you should miss  To those who are old hands at Hogwarts  I can only say there s nothing wrong with a re read  These books are like fine wine  they only get better with age  Welcome back to Hogwarts Review updated on August 12th  2015 Visit my website HERE for full fangirling   detailed review  It was great to read this again  and I will be doing a review on it on YouTube    My love for this series is infinite  3 That was magical  There s a decent chance you won t like this book  Let s be honest here  If you re reading my reviews and haven t read this series  you re probably an adult  which means two things  One is that you have lived through this series releasing 7 novels  8 movies  and becoming a cultural phenomenon  If you re here  you felt that societal pressure to read this  or one of your friends won t shut up until you do  probably   There is little chance the hype can withstand reality  And that is partly because    you aren t eleven years old  This book is written for children  Yes  the books get darker and more mature  and much better  later on  but this one is for middle school aged kids This is my first time rereading book 1 in at least 6 years  This book commits sins I would never forgive if they occurred in a different book  The MCs are dumb  the authority figures should all be fired for child endangerment  and in order for some events to make any sense  one has to create their own head canon  Typically at such points  I stop  remind myself that this is a children s book  and get a glass of Maker s 46 But forgive them I do  Rowling creates a fantastic world  characters  and story over these seven books that makes it all worth it  If I were reading this for the first time today  I honestly do not know if I would DNF this due to the above sins or it simply being for a much different audience than adult me  But I do know that having read the rest of the series  it didn t even cross my mind not to finish this reread  despite seeing all of the problems  The writing is designed so the target audience ages with Harry  so while we never get adult novels  we do get much  better  writing in later books  If you read this book or even the first two and the writing is much of what turned you off  I encourage you to keep going for another couple of books As a final note  my rating for this book is for the series  I can t honestly rate this book by itself at this point  I feel like everyone has a Harry Potter story  and yes  I am going to bore you with mine  The first Harry Potter book I got was not The Sorcerer s Stone  not even The Chamber of Secrets  The first book I got was The Goblet of Fire for my birthday from my dad  I hated it  Not the book  but I got the book before I loved books  Mom gave it to me in the car and I remember being so upset that I was given a stupid book for my birthday  Mom said  He really thinks you ll like it  It s supposed to be good  I read the first chapter  didn t understand anything  and then put the book down  It wasn t until later that I actually decided to read the books  I was sitting on my couch and a commercial came on for Harry Potter school supplies  Yup  I decided to read a book because of a commercial  I then proceeded to find out that I had the fourth book and not the first  My dad went out with me that same weekend day to buy me the first and second  We couldn t find the third  I read the first two in one day  Dad found me the third by the next weekend  and I had finished all four in two weeks  getting trouble in school for reading during class  I had to wait for the fifth to be published  and proceeded to reread the books like no one s business  My copy of The Goblet of Fire is broken in the spine in two spots  mold on the first page from when my sister spilled something on it  and I have no idea where the dust cover is  I love that copy of that book more than anything else in the world  I love it because I had a head injury at the age of 14  after all this had happened  After I fell in love with Harry Potter  Because of that head injury  I can t remember much of me before the age of 14  It s lead to quite a bit of problem and some existential shit that I won t get into today  Even with that head injury  I can clearly remember my mom apologizing for my dad s gift in the car  I can remember my dad s face light up when I asked to go get the first two books  after I was such a brat for him getting me the fourth  I can remember sitting beneath my Aladdin comforter  flashlight in hand  reading The Chamber of Secrets and being terrified of something petrifying me  I remember dragging my sister  who knew nothing of Harry Potter  to pretend that we had magical classes together  We have the binders to prove it  That s why Harry Potter means so much to me  It s the bridge between the two different Marys  I may not remember our trip to Disneyland at all  but I remember everything about discovering this series So I can t read this series like a normal person  an unbiased person  because to me this series is my entire childhood and it comes with all the rosy hued glasses that remembering childhood comes with   When this book was new I had a friend who read it  She wasn t really known for reading books  so I immediately judged that this book and every subsequent Harry Potter book was not worth my time  I was such an asshole It s probably age that s helped me wise up and warm up to this series  First it was my dear husband  then boyfriend  who made me watch the movie  It was better than I had expected  and then I began to look forward to seeing it every time we d go out of town   somehow it was always playing on ABC or something every time we stayed in a rented room  My secret wishes to catch it on TV gave way to me actually suggesting we watch one of the movies over other choices we had in the house  And  inevitably  I started to look forward to the new movie releases  Now it s  well  now  And I saw the seventh movie  I had questions  Dear husband refused to give me answers  so I said   If you won t tell me I ll just read all of them before the next movie   I somehow thought  just for a moment  that I was getting back at him for keeping these secrets from me  Then I realized that all I d done was please him   I never win  Hagrid is so endearing  He s my favorite thing about this book  And while it is something that young people can really get wrapped up in  I got wrapped up in it  too  It isn t written down to dumb little children  but it can t really go over any heads  either  How can that be possible  Sometimes I laughed  Sometimes I thought  Wow  that Harry can be a smug little asshole   All the time I was engaged  And all of these things left me feeling very surprised at all the ways I d been proven wrong  Being snobby about what I read didn t make me better  it only made me read less because I didn t enjoy what I was trying to read  Meanwhile  my non reading friend discovered the joy of reading because of this series  I say that makes it pretty great  What stands out in book one   Harry s first trip to the zoo with the Dursleys  when a boa constrictor winks at him    When the Dursleys  house is suddenly besieged by letters for Harry from Hogwarts  Readers learn how much the Dursleys have been keeping from Harry  Rowling does a wonderful job in displaying the lengths to which Uncle Vernon will go to deny that magic exists    Harry s first visit to Diagon Alley with Hagrid  Full of curiosities and rich with magic and marvel  Harry s first trip includes a trip to Gringotts and Ollivanders  where Harry gets his wand  holly and phoenix feather  and discovers yet another connection to He Who Must No Be Named  This moment is the reader s first full introduction to Rowling s world of witchcraft and wizards   Harry s experience with the Sorting Hat  Amazon Review Say you ve spent the first 10 years of your life sleeping under the stairs of a family who loathes you  Then  in an absurd  magical twist of fate you find yourself surrounded by wizards  a caged snowy owl  a phoenix feather wand  and jellybeans that come in every flavor  including strawberry  curry  grass  and sardine  Not only that  but you discover that you are a wizard yourself  This is exactly what happens to young Harry Potter in J K  Rowling s enchanting  funny debut novel  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone  In the nonmagic human world  the world of  Muggles   Harry is a nobody  treated like dirt by the aunt and uncle who begrudgingly inherited him when his parents were killed by the evil Voldemort  But in the world of wizards  small  skinny Harry is famous as a survivor of the wizard who tried to kill him  He is left only with a lightning bolt scar on his forehead  curiously refined sensibilities  and a host of mysterious powers to remind him that he s quite  yes  altogether different from his aunt  uncle  and spoiled  piglike cousin Dudley  A mysterious letter  delivered by the friendly giant Hagrid  wrenches Harry from his dreary  Muggle ridden existence   We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry   Of course  Uncle Vernon yells most unpleasantly   I AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL TO TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS   Soon enough  however  Harry finds himself at Hogwarts with his owl Hedwig    and that s where the real adventure  humorous  haunting  and suspenseful  begins   I was hooked from the first chapter  a whole new world and Rowling drew me in  had me believing this strange underground magical society  The book holds the winning formula for a great children s story  good writing  a likable relatable protagonist  an evil antagonist  several actually   the funny side kick  sadly I did not appreciate the full comic relief of Ron until Rupert Grint s excellent interpretation on film   the brain  the ignorant rival  the complications of relationships  even intriguing minor ones  the quest  and of course good conquering in the end  I admire Rowling s appreciation of her position of role model  She encourages education  morality  good will and humanity  and fairly clean vocabulary  and only mild swearing by the 17 year olds  instead of resulting to cheap trips to sell books  In light of the entire series  it amazes me how complex even the first book is without you even realizing it  I have never come across such a detailed imagination and coupled with an ability to write and draw the reader in  it is no wonder the series has been so explosive and returned children to the passion of reading  JK Rowling is my idol If for some reason you live under a rock or are resisting the mass media appeal of this book  please give it a try  Don t judge us Harry Potter fanatics by the first book  And never judge us by the movies  Having said that  I don t know how I would read this book if I picked it up post fandom  It come with huge expectations so you almost want it to fail  In book one  you can hardly see why it has become so well loved  When I read this book  I liked the story enough to continue  was a moderate fan by four  but didn t consider myself a die hard Harry Potter fan until I completed book six and caught a glimpse of her vision  Some of the best fiction I have ever read  it s worth the read  In this book you are reading the carefree story of an ordinary boy about to embark on an amazing adventure in an undiscovered world  It is fun  enjoyable  and every boy s dream  Although this book is intended for eleven year olds  it has way more adult appeal than any other juvenile fiction I ve ever read  But that s not what the story is really about  When you get to the end of the series  come back and read it again  Now it is the story of a loving headmaster with the difficult task of preparing an innocent boy for every level of sorrow until he must make the ultimate act of bravery  Now you can read it as an adult  How a simple story can be two completely different novels is impressive and shows the depth of the story  Here begins the story of The Boy Who Lived  I had forgotten how awesome JKR s writing is  This book always makes me feel nostalgic about something that never existed  I feel I have missed out on a great childhood because the letter from Hogwarts never arrived  Sigh    Book review originally posted on my book blog   https   afrolicthroughfiction wordpre    Like most people in the reading community  Harry Potter is my all time favourite series  Partly for the magic  partly for the characters  partly for the nostalgia  So how excited was I when I found out NEW BEAUTIFUL ILLUSTRATED EDITIONS ARE BEING RELEASED EVERY YEAR FOR THE NEXT SEVEN YEARS   Very    And that s an understatement Rereading this series is always one of my favourite things to do  but reading it with new additional drawings was just incredible  I can t get over the art  The detail in every single drawing was unbelievable  and I spent ages just staring and drinking in every small bit of it I loved how the art varied too  Sometimes there would be simple backgrounds with ink splotches dotted around so make it look like parchment  Sometimes small diagrams would be between the text to back up a description  And then there were full page drawings  some of them being double page spreads  There was even some small added snippets through these drawings  diagrams taken from the books they studied  The art really did just add to the magic of the story The actual story was just as amazing as ever  No matter how many times I reread this story  I ll never get bored of it  Since this is the first book in the series there s plenty of world building involved  now enhanced through the art too  The adventures are fun and fast paced  and the characters just as lovable as ever I know that this book will be a prized possession of mine  I ll still be flicking through the pages in many years to come  dqyq nmydnm yn chndmyn br hst khh hry ptr khwny r z sr grfthm  Hsbsh Hsby z dstm dr rfth  mn m mwl dr mwrd khtbhyy khh khyly zyd dwstshn

favorite  reading the books is a completely different and unique experience  The illustrated edition is perfection   2013 Group ReadNov 18   Nov 24 Well shit  I read that far too quickly  Now I have to wait how long  again giving this 5 stars  I m really struggling to not read the rest of the series  I always love J K Rowling s writing  Her writing is full of imagination where it never fail to pleased its reader no matter adult or children  Its a shame tho that I can t read it as fast as I can  But what can I do  Been busy lately especially with the enrollment of my college Harry is the boy who lived after Voldermort had killed his parents  Voldermort can t kill Harry and his power has ceased Harry have to live with his Aunt  Petunia and his Uncle  Vernon which being too dreadful to him  Petunia and Vernon has a son named Dudley who is the same age as Harry  Dudley is being spoil by his parents  When Harry almost reach 11 years old  Harry got a letter from Hogwart telling that he had been accepted into Hogwart  I hate Vernon and Petunia so much because they lied to Harry that his parents died in a car crash and that they hid the letter and the truth about his parents from Harry  Harry soon discover who he was and he is a hero  He have help Dumbledore to prevent Voldermort from taking the Philosopher s Stone   This was my first ever experience with Harry Potter  I ve never read a Harry Potter book before  nor have I ever seen a Harry Potter movie  In this review you ll find out about what my first experience was like  I knew what it was about    a boy named Harry Potter enrolls into a school for wizards    everyone knows that  even if they ve never read it before  I m a lover of fantasy  especially magic and wizards  So I knew Harry Potter was going to be right up my Diagon Alley  please laugh   To put it in three simple words  I loved it  I can only describe this series with one word  magical  Yes  I m serious  As I experienced Harry s world of magic for the first time I felt warmth  joy  and wonder  The world of Harry Potter just felt like home to me  So natural  nothing seemed out of place  This was one of those rare times where a book was hard for me to put down  I wanted to see what kind of magical craziness Harry and his friends ran into after every page  Everything was just so unpredictable  adding to the fun of the story  The story really is interesting  to the point where I don t want to give any of it away  The characters are oh  so lovable  You ll definitely finish this book with a favorite character or two  Or three  Actually  you might want to keep a list  There is nothing about books that I love more than great characters  Even the side characters are so enjoyable to the point where I treat them as main characters  I am nineteen years old  I didn t experience the hype of this series like everyone else when I was younger  So let me tell you  you are NEVER too old to read Harry Potter  Read it  then share it  This is a story I d like to share with my whole family  I m already excited to introduce this series to my future children  It feels great to know why everyone loves Harry Potter so much  This series is going to have a very special place in my heart  I ve never felt so happy about a book I was reading  There is still plenty left to discover in Harry s world  so you can bet I ll be reading more  I know there are a lot of die hard Harry Potter fans that would do anything to experience this wonderful story for the first time again  so I m going to cherish every page as I read the rest of Harry Potter Special Thanks to Goodreads Author  Elise Kova  for introducing me to Harry Potter  This book inspired me not only as an aspiring author  but as a person  This is my third time reading the book  but my first time reading it in English  I love the book but I don t know why I never read it in its own language before  I also love the Indonesian edition  I think the translation was superb  But now  reading it in English gives me different feeling and perspective than when I read it in Indonesian  At the same time  I feel like this is my first time reading the book  despite that I ve already known the story The first thing that gets my attention between the Indonesian edition and the original one is the way Hagrid speaks  Indonesian edition doesn t contain Hagrid s accent  To be honest  it s quite hard for me to understand Hagrid s speaking at the beginning  because of his accent  I have to guess what he actually means  But at the same time I think it also shows Hagrid s position in the witchcraft and wizardry world and also in Hogwarts  describes who he is and where he comes from  I have better understanding about him now  As much as I love Ms  Listiana Srisanti works  the translator of Indonesian edition  I think there are things that feel better when I read it in English  This book is funnier than I ever remember  I just love Ron s witty and sarcastic conversation and the twins that always can make me laugh  And rereading it now  a couple years from my last read gives me clearer perspective of the story and the characters  The characters development is awesome  I never realize how different Harry and Neville in the beginning of the book and the end of the story  and looking back now  they are even much more different and grow in the last book  How I love the way Harry and Ron befriend with Hermione  Just like the characters development  their friendship also grows throughout the story  I also more appreciate the way Rowling writes  It feels magical  just like the story  I guess I much more love it now  if it s even possible  That being said  I add my rating now into 5 perfect stars  This won t be my last rereading the book  though  If I can reread it in Indonesian edition  I m sure I can reread it in English  Warning  this review has spoilers for this book and the entire series Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone is a brilliant book and the start of a world changing series  The Harry Potter series is a big part of my life and influenced my childhood  I probably will not be able to add anything that has not been said before  I also won t describe the story as almost everyone must know it by now and if not where have you been hiding the past 15 years  While the writing is not bad  you can tell the Rowling has improved as the series went on One pet peeve I have with this book is that it is not called The Sorcerer s Stone but The Philosopher s Stone  that s because philosopher s stone has lots of lore and myth surrounding it and I am not sure why they changed it for America  One thing I discovered  and probably only British people will get this  but when reading this book did anyone else have Stephen Fry s voice narrating it to them Harry is a kind and brave person and I like that even after years of abuse and neglect by the Dursley s he has not turned out bitter and emotionally scarred  Ron is one of my favourite characters of the series as he is normal  and does not feel he is good enough  Hermione is annoying in this book as she is a know it all and just too perfect I love this book and the entire series and I cannot recommend it highly enough This and my other reviews can be found at Amethyst Bookwyrm I was 7 when this book came out but I actually never heard of it until I was in middle school  I remember kids reading and loving this book but when I read a little of it I was bored  I have no idea what was wrong with me  I m reading this now as a 24 year old and I was laughing and cheering on this 11 year old boy and his friends  I LOVED this book  Loved  It  All those years of people talking about this series and telling me read them were right all you hp fans were right   but I m sure you all already know this  I am super excited to continue on with this series     I did a little dance when I saw you were reading these  More like a wiggle  Once in a lifetime thing  Wish you could ve seen it I hope you love the rest of the series  Despues de tantos anos ya era hora que leyera los libros de HP que mejor tarde que nunca no  jaja las peliculas si las vi pero los libros ya tocaba y aqui comienzo mi aventura y me ha gustado mucho era como si ya fuera alguien mas y estuviera viviendolo todo otra vez con ellos y estoy deseando vivir todas sus aventuras Pero desde aquel momento Hermione Granger se convirtio en su amiga  Hay algunas cosas que no se pueden compartir sin terminar unidos  y derrumbar un trol de tres metros y medio es una de esas cosas  So eine wundervolle Ausgabe  Die Illustrationen sind zauberhaft   Su knihy a knihy  S Harrym Potterom som vyrastal  bola to pravdopodobne prva kniha  ktoru som cital dokolecka    Mam v zivej pamati tie Vianoce  ked rodicia kupili ten diel bratovi  a on to odmietal citat  tak ja som si knihu vzal a hned pekne polovicku pod stromcekom precital  Tento xty rereading som si uzival este viac  A uz to nebolo o deji  o dobrodruzstve  ale akosi som sa sustredil na ich priatelstvo  je to uplne krasne popisane   Och  Hermiona je uzasna    I have always avoided this series because I thought it would be too childish  when I finally got round to reading the first book I was thankfully mistaken  My only regret is that I didn t read this sooner This is a great book and regardless of what people think this is suitable for those of all ages  The story is every eleven year olds dream and is told in a humorous yet suspense filled way  I am looking forward to reading the rest of the series     Re read  4  What a bloody brilliant ride does J K  Rowling take you on with Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone  This was my fourth re read of this book and she never ceases to amaze me  I absolutely love discovering things I missed the other times around and just being able to fall in love with this world again feels so magical  I loved being introduced to some of my favorite characters all over again  Neville  Hermoine  Ron  Dumbledore  Fred   George  Mrs  Weasley  McGonagall s sass and even Severus Snape  Harry Potter is one of the most humble characters I have ever read about growing up in such a horrible home has made him value the little he s always had for instance when he meets Ron for the first time   Go on  have a pasty    Harry  who had never had anything to share before or  indeed  anyone to share it with  It was nice feeling  sitting there with Ron  eating their way through all Harry s pasties  cakes and candies  Talk about friendship at first sight   3  sigh  I had almost forgotten that Hermoine wasn t always in with them from the beginning  but alas when they became our favorite trio it was beautiful   tears  But from that moment on  Hermoine Granger became their friend  There are some things you can t share without ending up liking each other  and knocking out a twelve foot mountain troll is one of them I enjoyed the character   world building and you can tell right away the J K  Rowling had all of these characters well thought out in her head way before she wrote all seven books  The way she drops little clues I had completely missed makes me so giddy for the next ones  All in all  always and forever will I give five bloody magical stars for this one because it introduced me to a place that I can always call  home   Thank you Rowling   Purely and utterly MAGICAL I can t wait for the next illustrated editions of the following books  specially The Prisoner of Azkaban  my fav   But from that moment on  Hermione Granger became their friend  There are some things you can t share without ending up liking each other  and knocking out a twelve foot mountain troll is one of them  It really is amazing how JK Rowling managed to create this fantastic world  Reading Harry Potter does always feel like going home  Jim Kay s gorgeous illustrations really capture the whimsy and detail of Jo s writing  and are worth a look through the book just on their own  The first Harry Potter book will always be my favorite  Many books have a protagonist who doesn t fit in  Usually these characters are ugly ducklings who become swans  Harry Potter is one such ugly duckling  He has unruly hair  he is  weird   but there is something more  Harry Potter has an Imagination  The first half of this book is really about people with an Imagination Vs people who  don t approve of an imagination    didn t like things behaving the way they shouldn t  even if it s in a cartoon    people dressed in peculiar clothes    It s so unsettling for the Dursleys to accept anything unusual or out of the ordinary  because they re Muggles  It s hard to fit into the world of Muggles   Sometimes I wonder if all grown ups are Muggles   I mean  there s a bit of Harry Potter in every child  Kids have a rather curious and imaginative mind that makes them go out of my way to seek the unusual  the extraordinary  to push the boundaries of the world as we know it   Sadly  they encounter grown ups  muggles  at every turn  telling them  the way things should be done   they way they should behave  the way they should dress  talk  think    So is this story really about Kids  Wizards  vs Grown ups  Muggles      Sadly  whether we like it or not  we all have to grow up and do muggle things  Not Harry Potter  though  He gets to go to the school for Wizards  to battle with the monsters from his past  to stop the forces of evil from taking over  Through all her books  JK Rowling tells us what evil really is  Fear  Fear of death  fear of illness  fear of poverty  And what do these fearful people want most  Why  the Philosopher s stone  of course  Because to the brave   death is but the next great adventure   Professor Nicolas Flamel rises above his fears by giving up the Philosopher s Stone  Professor Dumbledore  Hagrid  Harry Potter  Hermione  Ron   All are put to the test and they all prove themselves by putting friendship and loyalty above the stone   And in doing so they prove themselves to be true Gryffindors  In hindsight  it s fear that turns us into Muggles  Fear of the Unknown  If we could only embrace the unknown  we could all be Wizards  Dear JK Rowling  thank you for this beautiful  brave book  THIS IS JUST AS PERFECT THE 9TH TIME AROUND      Obviously  Voor de Nederlandse recensie klik  hier Harry Potter is a completely normal orphan with the meanest uncle  aunt and nephew  But when he receives a letter from Hogwarts everything is going to change  Harry discovers he s a wizard and will go to the most prestigious school for wizards  He experiences all kinds of adventures and with his new friends he discovers there is a huge secret in the basement of Hogwarts  Harry is determined to find out what  BREAKING NEWS  Saskia has read the first book of the Harry Potter series  This is unheard of  So special  Wow Okay sorry  I went a bit crazy there    In December I won this book at StoriesbyBente  I also had the luck that this was the exact version I wanted already  the covers are so cute  I m a bit scared to give my opinion about such a popular book that I actually already kinda now the story of thanks to movies and spoilers  But here it comes I totally understand the magic of the Harry Potter books  I was almost immediately captured by the story and was also oh so motivated to start the series  Before I knew it I was laughing at the Dursleys and felt sorry for Harry  Even though I knew a few things beforehand I wanted to pull out my phone and start googling everything  I managed to contain myself and now I only know old spoilers and the things I ve read  I m definitely not going to call myself a big fan  I really liked The Philosopher s Stone but I won t be buying the rest of the books in a hurry  Now I think about it  I m actually considering it     I am however motivated to finish the whole series and watch the movies afterwards J K Rowling s writing style is perfect and extremely creative  I can t believe how smart an author must be to come up with a world like this  I don t think I ve ever read a book with a world I loved so much like this  It s not my favorite book but I can totally understand how it s the favorite book of many avid readers and is one of the most sold books ever  How crazy is it that I ve only started the series in 2015 while the book was published nearly 19 years ago  6 months before I was born  I gave Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone 4 stars at first but that was mainly because I knew the story more or less and the element of surprise wasn t there anymore  I realized that this wasn t fair so I looked at what I really thought about it and well  5 stars for Harry Potter and the Philosopher s stone Yer a wizard Harry    4 75 Es muy dificil hacer una resena ordenada de este libro porque  que voy a decir yo que ya no se haya dicho de los libros de Harry Potter  Iba a ponerle una estrella menos  lo admito  por todo este cuento nada epico al principio a mi parecer  pero claro  muggles al fin  pero a medida que todo fue tomando forma cambie de opinion porque hasta el ultimo parrafo no dejo de gustarme  Me encarine tanto con los personajes  Harry  Hermione  los Weasley  los profesores  incluso Draco Malfoy y su pandilla  Y esa imaginacion tan desbordante que posee J  K  Rowling  por Dios  Esa mujer sabe como crear   Se merece cada uno de esos fans y seguidores de esta saga  Impresionante   Hay que tener un gran coraje para oponerse a nuestros enemigos  pero hace falta el mismo valor para hacerlo con los amigos  No tengo mucho mas que agregar  porque como dije  las palabras quedan cortas  Seguire leyendo esta saga por supuesto y recuerden  nunca es tarde para empezar Harry Potter  Llego mi hora  y os esta esperando pacientemente a cada uno de quienes aun no se adentran en este magico y fantastico mundo  Das Merkwurdige bei diesem Buch ist  dass ich mir beim ersten Durchblattern vorgestellt habe  wie ich dieses Buch meinen Kindern vorlese  Fur viele klingt das vielleicht gar nicht so komisch  Das  Problem  ist dabei nur  dass ich gar keine Kinder habe    aber naja Tatsachlich ist der Stil in dem die Illustrationen gezeichnet sind  ebenso wie die Geschichte selbst  fur Kinder wie Erwachsene geeignet  Diese sind lustig und niedlich  teilweise aber eben auch manchmal duster und gespenstisch Die Illustrationen sind in einem Wort wunderschon Sie sind so detailreich und was mich total fasziniert hat  Kay hat es geschafft  die Stimmung der dargestellten Szene absolut authentisch einzufangen  Die Farbgestaltung der einzelnen Zeichnungen und Bilder sind absolut an die Stimmung angepasst  Es wird nicht nur dargestellt was gerade in der Story passiert  viel mehr wurde die Handlung hundertprozentig umgesetzt Erstaunlich fand ich auch  wie nahe die Zeichnungen meinen eigenen Vorstellungen dabei kommen  Als ich zum ersten Mal von dem Projekt  Illustrierte Harry Potter  Ausgabe  horte  hatte ich neben ganz viel Aufregung und Vorfreude auch den leisen Gedanke  ob das wohl sehr wie die Verfilmung aussieht   Und ich kann euch sagen  Nein  gar nicht  Es ist eine wahrhaftige Neuinterpretation  Und das obwohl die Filme  meiner Meinung nach  doch schon so gut waren  Da konnt ihr mal sehen  wie toll diese Schmuckausgabe ist    DUnd so kann ich es kaum erwarten  auch die anderen Bande in dieser Aufmachung zu erleben  The very best part about this edition is not only being handed the opportunity to go back to my reading roots and relive the magic that IS Harry Potter  but to be able to be surprised every single time you turn the page by a new rendering of our most holy of places    no words  No damn fucking words  I was in awe from beginning to end and I swear that if they did this for every book and made the books  50 a pop I would save my damn money so I could buy them all  It is a magical experience  and to think kids these days are going to have the opportunity to read it this way  No words There are also the little things you start noticing now that you are an adult and you are re reading HP  Like Dumbledore evading Mcgonagall s questions at the beginning and feigning ignorance as to how Harry survived  Sirius Black s name thrown into the fray at the very beginning by Hagrid  Ginny being all excited over meeting Harry  Ron being extremely annoyed at Hermione  Neville being a complete and utter doofus  the twins    All very bitter sweet and totally magical  I can t believe I waited so long to read this story  At first  I put it off because I thought  I missed the train   it s okay  and felt like 27 was just a little too old for the story  I didn t want to read it and be bored with it because I couldn t connect with the characters  I figured it was best to not read it and miss out on it instead of reading it and hating it  I m super happy to know I was wrong    Instead of making me feel  too old   it made me travel back in time to when I was just a kid  I went into this series having only seen the first 2 movies  once each   but I couldn t remember much of the storyline or the characters  Basically  I just kne there was a group of 3 friends that were attending a school for wizards  Going into the books so blindly was a huge plus  I couldn t wait to see what happened next My favorite thing about kid s books is that the focus isn t on who will end up with who  It s more of good vs evil and protecting the ones you love  There s an innocence to kids that s just incredible  Reading this story at bedtime was the best  It made me take longer to finish the book  but I was able to enjoy it more and have awesome dreams    Can t wait to start book two  Ihana  Siis aivan ihana  Olisikohan ollut kahdeksas tai yhdeksas kertani taman ensimmaisen osan parissa ja edelleen se jaksaa viihdyttaa  naurattaa  ihastuttaa  rakastuttaa ja tutustuttaa kuin ensimmaista kertaa tahan mahtavaan maailmaan  joka oli suuressa roolissa rakentamassa jo lapsuudessa syntynytta suunnatonta rakkauttani

voinemme lienee antaa talle osalle hieman anteeksi sita  lapsekkuutta   mita kohderyhmalle kirjoitettu teos tarjoaa  eiksjeh Kerta kaikkiaan ihana ja rakastettava teos  Sarja on yksi kaikkien aikojen suosikkejani enka voisi koskaan kyllastya  huolimatta montako kertaa nama kirjat luen  Salaisuuksien kammio  taalta tullaan Viisi rakkaudentayteista tahtea Bloggaukseni  Even though I m a contributor to a comics media outlet  I have to sheepishly admit  I don t get all obsessive with details about comic book storylines    I reserve all that fervor for Harry Potter  Even though this is my 4th reread of the series  there s always some kind of new detail I notice every time       If you have not read this book yet there are spoilers below      1  The huge separation  segregation   between the Muggle community and the Wizarding community  For example  Ron  in reference to his roommate s soccer poster hanging on the wall  was surprised that the players in the poster don t move  This leads me to assume that Ron did not have any Muggle friends growing up    otherwise he would have seen framed photos and photo albums in his Muggle friends  houses and already known that Muggle photos are static  Likewise  when Oliver Wood  Captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team  is talking to Potter about the rules of the game  Potter compares Quidditch to basketball and Wood has no idea what basketball is  page 167   I just find it interesting how little each community knows about the other  2  The Hogwarts Acceptance Letter  Hermione mentions that she had NO IDEA she was a witch because no one in her family is magic at all  The letter from Hogwarts was a complete surprise but she was pleased  105   But yet  I can t help wondering how other Muggle students react to their letters    and also how their families react too  Are any scared  angry  in denial  I assume this news could really be quite shocking  especially  if like Hermione  he she had never accidentally done any magic    especially when scared or angry  page 58  As a side note  how many Muggles have owls so they can send confirmation back to Hogwarts to reserve their spot in the first year class    page 51  3  Along the same lines  I wonder how much of a CULTURE SHOCK the Muggle students experience once they enter Hogwarts  The castle is FULL of magic    talking portraits  moving staircases  food that suddenly appears on plates  just to name a few things  Oh and let s not forget the castle GHOSTS and Peeves the POLTERGEIST It s never mentioned but I wonder if there is a  first year seminar  that provides Muggle students an environment where they can learn explore their feelings about their  new identity   learn more about the Wizarding Community  and also catch up on the 11 years of Wizarding World pop culture they missed It s been mentioned  in one    maybe more    of the latter books that there is a Muggle Studies class  Even though Hermione is a Muggle and obviously knows how Muggles live  she enrolled in the class anyway    she wanted to see how the Wizarding Community views the Muggle Community  Again  if there s a Muggle Studies class  it would make sense for there to be a class for Muggles to welcome them to the Wizarding Community  It would definitely lessen the culture shock  4  And speaking of CULTURE SHOCK  how do incoming Muggle students and their families feel when they visit Diagon Alley for the first time to purchase their school supplies  Do Diagon Alley vendors accept Muggle money or do Muggles have to somehow exchange their Muggle currency for Wizarding currency  5  Hagrid does magic in the presence of Muggles    a big no no  This time Harry does NOT get a warning from the Ministry of Magic because he is underage and does not have a wand yet nor has he begun his official magic education  I get it  But Hagrid gives Dudley a pig tail  page 59     later Mr Dursley says the family  minus Harry  is going to London to see a doctor to get Dudley s tail removed  page 90   What on earth does Mr Dusley tell the Muggle doctor   Obviously in the context of the story  a Muggle doctor can do this  but I would have thought Dudley would have needed to go to St Mungo s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries to get it removed    yet St Mungo s seems to be a hospital exclusively for the Wizarding community As a side note  I wonder who MADE Hagrid s pink umbrella  page 56   Maybe Dumbledore did  6  As always  I still wonder why  out of all the Hogwarts incoming students  Ron is permitted to bring his pet rat Scabbers  page 104   when the Hogwarts Welcome Letter clearly states that students may bring an owl or a cat or a toad  page 67   Of course since I ve read the series before  I know what the deal is with Scabbers  but I still think about this discrepancy      a creative liberty     a bit Sigh  Even though this is my 4th time reading the book  I still love it  It s still full of FEELS all my reviews can be found at www isniffbooks wordpress comre read from July 17  2015   July 22  2015   I am not the creator of this image  No copyright infringement intended    Special thanks to Rachmi for buddy reading this with me    Wow  rereading a book with the knowledge of what s going to happen is really awesome  I got to catch on things in the beginning that I never did before  I am not sure if this is my first or second reread  but when I first read this  I was still in grade school and I didn t think the same way that I do now  But I must say  Harry Potter is definitely amazing no matter how many times I read it Yes  it s a bit juvenile  but it s written for kids anyway  And even now that I am reading this one as a teen  I cannot disregard that this book is a work of art  Yes  art   bringing readers into a vivid  magical mystery that is filled with colors and easy to imagine  I definitely loved J K  Rowling s writing style with this one I must say  J K  Rowling is good at throwing people off haha  Of course I knew how things were going to work out in the end  but I can imagine how those who haven t read the book yet can be misguided  My favorite scene from this book is when Nevile finally stood up to someone  which just happened to be Harry  Ron and Hermione  It cracked me up when Ron told Neville   Yeah  but not to us   My second favorite is when the trio each had a certain  job  to complete in the end  so that each of them was useful  and it wasn t just centered on Harry Harry Potter is definitely a must read for kids and adults alike On a side note  imagine the whole book in Hermione s perspectives  I bet there would be no chapter without mention of how stupid the boys are  Haha     My goal was to try and review this as impartially as possible  re reading the series over a decade after I fell in love That impartiality lasted a chapter  Perhaps two I can t do it  and I don t care  Harry Potter was so important to me growing up  and I m happy to say that a re read only strengthened my memories instead of dashing them We read this with our Goodreads book club  so check that out for more detailed discussion  and join us for future reads    A few of my thoughts I am amazed at how much is packed into less than 300 pages  Think of everything that happens in this book  and how short it is  Coming from someone who usually reads fat fantasies  the shock is even greater I ve yet to see a YA that even comes close to the same level of writing and story skill Actually  even some of the genre novels I read have something to learn  J K  Rowling provides a tiny seed of world building  and lets your imagination fill in the rest  My impression of Hogwarts is exponentially more than what was actually written in the book I also seriously wonder how much Rowling had planned  and what is actually foreshadowed  We picked up on a lot of hints throughout that we definitely missed as kids Harry Potter  you were a constant companion in my formative years  and it s good to have you back  Here s how stupid I am  I hated the idea of The Lord of the Rings movies when they were being made because  being a huge Star Wars fan  I was afraid LOTR would supplant Star Wars as people s most beloved  fantasy  movie series Then I watched LOTR and fell in love with the movies  Now I m a huge fan of both the books and the films  But while my love for LOTR was growing  I grew to hate Harry Potter  Not for any real reason  but simply because there were people who preferred Harry to Frodo and Dumbledore to Gandalf  That made me gnash my teeth and secretly curse J K  Rowling for daring to vie with the amazing inhabitants of Middle Earth  See  I told you I was stupid  Mainly  this comes down to my competitiveness  but that s neither here nor there  What is both here and there is that my son and I began to read the first Harry Potter book a year and a half ago  And I ve been in love ever since  I ll write more about the Harry Potter series soon  we re immersed in the wonderful fifth book right now   so for now I ll just say that these novels are gifts  I cherish them  I love the characters  and I feel nothing but warmth toward everything about the stories  As an author  I m astonished at J K  Rowling s storytelling skills  She really is a marvelous writer  So I hereby apologize for all my silly mental competitive negativity toward the Harry Potter books  When my son and I finish the last book  I vow to read the entire series again with my middle child  a lovely daughter  and my youngest child  another lovely daughter   If you ve been waffling about reading this series  waffle no more  It is amazing  It is spellbinding  It is what reading is all about   There s nothing like re reading absolute favourites  is there  This is only my third reading of Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone  and it s amazing how many little things seemed new to me  The first time I read it was in I think 2000  or whenever The Goblet of Fire came out   when I was at uni   a friend had recommended them but it wasn t until the fourth book was released and the hordes of small children queuing for a copy made news headlines that I really took notice  So I guess I jumped on the bandwagon  I don t regret it for a second though   sometimes the hype is perfectly justified  and sometimes kids really do know a good thing  I remember reading this one  and then as soon as I was done going straight out to the bookshop and getting the second one  and then the third   I think by the fourth I d run out of money and had to borrow from my flatmate  It was like an addiction But this is where the story starts  Harry Potter is an orphan being reluctantly raised by his aunt  Petunia  and his uncle  Vernon  a horridly normal couple who know the secret of Petunia s sister Lily and intend to  stamp out the nonsense  in their nephew  Harry  They have a boy of their own  a repulsively fat and spoilt bully called Dudley  who s the same age as Harry  Harry sleeps in the cupboard under the stairs  gets all Dudley s cast off clothing  which are way too big for him   and knows not one ounce of love in the Dursley household Then  just before his eleventh birthday  he gets mail  He has a place at Hogwart s School of Witchcraft and Wizardry  but his uncle is having none of it  It takes a visit from Hogwart s gamekeeper  a half giant called Hagrid  to fill Harry in on who he really is and get him prepared for his new school  For Harry  his eleventh birthday is a day of many shocks and surprises  not least is learning that he s a wizard born  The bigger shock is learning that  in the wizarding world  he s famous  he is  the boy who lived   a baby who seemed to somehow defeat an evil wizard called Voldemort Harry s life has changed forever  but the adventure has only just begun There are so many things to love about Harry and this series  it s hard to know where to begin  From the moment I first read the opening sentence ten or so years ago  I was in love  The sardonic irony of the opening sentence reminded me so warmly of other British favourites of mine   Roald Dahl especially   that I felt like I was home  The characters are a genius of comic humour  caricatures of themselves  funny just for being who they are before they even open their mouths  Rowling describes them with a few sure  concise brushstrokes  and they leap to vivid life in your head I ve always found Rowling to be an excellent writer   she laboured long and hard over these books and the effort was worth it  a far cry from the lazy writing of so many Young Adult authors  churning out the latest whatever story to fit the latest popular fad before it gets too old  The early Harry Potter books are clearly written for children   older children  but pre teen  as Harry ages  so did the audience  and the later books are more YA yet without alienating younger children just starting on them  Not to mention all the adults who ve loved the series just as much  and you can understand why the books are so successful  There s something here for everyone  the humour reaching both children and adults  the adventures and mysteries suspenseful and exciting  the characters wonderful  the imaginative world a nice balance of traditional and original  The books still have the power to make me laugh  or bring tears to my eyes  and keep me on the edge of my seat It s curious  when you re re reading a book  how you can find yourself reading a passage or even a whole chapter that feels utterly new to you  For me  it s the first chapter of this book  As familiar as I was with the opening sentence  the rest of the chapter up until the end when Dumbledore  McGonagall and Hagrid leave baby Harry on the Dursley s doorstep seemed new to me  Isn t that weird  I couldn t remember reading before about Vernon Dursley panicking at all the weird looking people suddenly popping up  though I know I had to have read that before  So it felt like reading it for the first time This is actually my second copy of the book  a Canadian edition   my first  Bloomsbury  was ruined by mould  that s what comes of letting your brother store boxes of your books under his house while you re overseas   yes  on bare earth under a house on the side of a hill  It wasn t the only book to grow black mould and have to be thrown out  It s very painful  throwing out damaged books  but at least this one was easily replaceable   It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live  Maravilloso  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone es esa clase de libro que cuando lo abres y comienzas a leer no puedes parar ni un segundo  Esta tan lleno de amistad  juegos  risas  secretos y sobre todo magia  Los personajes que estan en este  cada uno de ellos son muy divertidos  A su manera lo son  Al leer este libro te sientes como en casa  con grandes amigos  lleno de felicidad  tan vivo y una infinidad de emociones que las palabras no pueden llegar a explicar  Rowling supo hacerlo bien  creo este nuevo mundo tan magico y fantastico que ha maravillado a infinidades de personas  Los personajes estan muy bien hechos  la trama  TODO  Rowling sin duda es una diosa  This book doesn t really need a review so all I want to say is that      Este primer libro lo significo todo  y aun lo sigue significando  Tras ese misterioso titulo quien iba a pensar que se esconderia la historia mas grande jamas contada  si  lo se  no hablo con mucha objetividad xD  P  Y es mas     quien no ha sonado con recibir una de las cartas de Hogwarts  o atravesar el anden 9 3 4  Yo cumpli el sueno de cruzarlo  metaforica y fisicamente en Londres para la ultima premiere  __   Y aqui sigo hoy    y siempre  con Harry Potter  until the very end  So this was my very first time reading Harry Potter I know  I know  I have no idea how I ve managed to go this long without ever reading it  I grew up watching and loving the movies  but this was better  I was a little hesitant to pick this up  afraid I wasn t going to love it as much as I was hoping to  I m so glad I read this now  I really  really loved it  And I can t wait to read the rest of the series very soon  Siendo 100  honesta  antes de leerlo tenia miedo de que me aburriera  Despues de haber visto todas las peliculas creia que no habia mucho mas que saber Tengo que decir que el libro me sorprendio muchisimo  es interesante  y atrapante  desde la pagina uno Harry Potter es mucho mas que ocho peliculas  Los libros muestran un lado de la historia que no conocemos  y me alegra poder adentrarme en su mundo cada dia mas  Why have I never read this soon   This was absolutely incredible  So magical and its own world completely  I m a major fantasy fan and this tops the mark for magical fantasy  Of course it was fast paced  Extremely interesting  And from seeing the movie first ages ago  THIS was WAY better than the damn movie  I can t wait to see where the next books adventure because this one blew me away   Review also posted at My Bookshelf is ReadyThere are no other words  If you  like me  also wore glasses  have green eyes  or found out you were a wizard as a child  you will identify with Harry  Auf den letzten Seiten habe ich nochmal sieben Vokabeln nachschlagen  Insgesamt macht das 35 Vokabeln     Ich denke das ist ganz okay Wie konnte es anders sein  naturlich bekommt Harry Potter 5 Sterne von mir   DWas mich gestort hat  Hagrids Ausdrucksweise im englischen  Ich denke er spricht mit Akzent  Jedenfalls wars echt nervig    you   yer yeh to   ter and   an   _   OMG  OMG  OMG  This was so good   I don t know why I waited so long to read Harry Potter  I think i m crazy  I m really happy that I started this series and I can t wait to see what s going to happen next  I loved everything  I cried too  and I never thought a middle grade book would make me cry  Leave it to Harry Potter to make me cry  Amazing   qdsh knt mGfl ywm bsbb nh fkrt n lfylm ykfy llmt     m   dd mrt mshhd  flm hry   kthr mn 10 mrt lm twq  lmt

I liked it even more than the first time when I ve read it in German I m really late to read this series  but better late than never  DAnd I think I don t need to write anything else about Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone  it s just flawless  Me encanto  porque no lo habia leido antes  porque      Ame la historia  el mundo que creo esta autora Voy a leer los otros  y ya se volvio una de mis sagas favoritas This edition was so pretty  it was like reading the story for the first time  so abermals hab ich das Buch auch endlich mal beendet wieder  D keske daha onceden okuma firsatim olsaydi   this is not a review  because i m too insignificant to review such a marvelous work of a book this is the first time for me reading harry potter  yes i know i m so late  and yes i m older then the perfect age to experience the majestic world of harry potter  however i can t imagine that somehow i would ve enjoyed it more  harry potter easily is one of the top 3 books i ve ever read in my entire life  everything about it from the writing to the very well structured world building is way more than perfect  Rowling paid attention to the smallest details ever to create the most vivid fantasy world i ve ever seen  there s a lot of qualities that made the world of harry potter so fascinating  the owls that sent mails the magical candies  she even created an EPIC      fantasy sport  how cool is that  overall that is simply just a flawless book  for all ages not only for young readers  Harry Potter is such a timeless legacy that will remain forever   I may or may not be crying right now  For some reason this took me way too long to read  WHY  HOW  WHAT This is my first time ever reading Harry Potter and it took four months to read it    well it didn t really  I just read half of it  and put it down for four months before finally picking it up in January to finish it off with the Audiobooks that have come out  I really love audible  it s my absolute favorite  especially when i m too tired to read It s no secret that i m a fan of the Harry Potter movies and know majority of what will happen  i ve seen them a countless amount of times and thought I would join in on being a fan of the books too  what started it all  I feel sad that it took me so long to read the book  like i ve missed out on so much  especially in my childhood  I always envy the people who read the series as kids  when they came out  and growing up with Hogwarts and J K  Rowling  Which  I did grow up watching the movies  my uncle was a big Harry Potter fan and read them all and even had the figurines  which I loved  I secretly envied him too I loved getting back into the Wizard world of Hogwarts with the trio  and how their journeys first began  I also listened to the audiobook while reading along with the Harry Potter  The Sorcerers Stone Illustrated Edition  FYI  THE ILLUSTRATIONS ARE INCREDIBLE Definitely a 5 out of 5 stars for this read  I love this story  and I m glad i m finally giving the books a chance   An overdue task  I should ve read this book once it came out   Now  18 years later  I can picture my 10 year old self back then fascinated and completely blown away by it  and so does my current self today  I won t allow myself to be picky  get into technicalities  or try to analyze whether things made any sense whatsoever  simply because I chose to enjoy this book from a kid s perspective  J K  Rowling is such a brilliant  capable writer  She created such a  magical  world  like literally  What can I add to what s already been told by tens of thousands of other reviewers  Perhaps nothing  but I ll try to voice my opinion and list some of the main features that made me fall in love with this book   Charming and interesting story    Dazzling and enchanted setting   Innovative and authentic ideas    Hilarious and entertaining situations    Lovable and brave lead character    Awesome and awkward sidekicks   Despicable and mean villains  If I can sum everything up in two words  they d be  genuine magnificence  For those of you who have been living under a rock for the past two decades and are not caught up with the Harry Potter phenomenon  here is a synopsis of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone  the first installment of the HP series  A couple dies and leaves a son behind  The boy who lived is constantly bullied  He gets more than what he d ever wished for on his 11th bday  A hairy giant is like a fairy godmother and things get real magical  Non magical folks are called  Muggles   Anyway  in that magical world  people keep their money in Gringotts  an underground bank run by goblins   Kids are considered lucky if they received an acceptance letter to study magic in Hogwarts  the best school of witchcraft and wizardry out there   Real action starts then   Talk about spells and potions  trolls and goblins  dragons and unicorns  ghost teachers  screaming books  talking moving pictures and chess pieces  and much more   Recommendations  Highly recommended to whoever has a taste for fiction  no matter how old s he is  A shout out to the totally awesome guys behind  A Very Potter Musical   You can find the parody in YouTube  click here for Act 1 Part 1  Being the movie fanatic that I am  I already watched all the HP movies quite sometime before  As far as I can remember  the first movie was a very good adaptation but I think the book will always be better  __________ All my HP reviews  1  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone 2  Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets 3  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban 4  Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire 5  Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix 6  Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince 7  Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows __________I ll conclude with this beautiful quote by Albus Dumbledore   I m speechless  This was so FANTASTIC  I can t even describe my feelings towards this book  really  It was extraordinary  I loved it     One of my favorite books  FOR SURE I was waiting for this happen    I knew I would love it very much  but I don t know    it s still a little bit surprising  It s such an amazing story and the characters    OMG    THE CHARACTERS ARE STUPENDOUS  Every single character was so well written  although I ve only read the first book   I LOVED ALL THE ADVENTURES   EVERYTHING  While I was reading the book  I was on page 147 or something  and I was starting to wonder when they would mention The Sorcerer s Stone and when they did it I was like  FINALLY  Anyways    what about that plot twist at the end   Daaaaaaam  I had a feeling it wouldn t be Snape  but    QUIRRELL   WHAT   That was strange  I  actually  want to know more about Snape  though  Why couldn t he and Harry s father get along  I ve heard some things about this  however  I m not sure if they re true It was really great  I m soooooooooo excited to read the next ones   I just don t know when I ll be able to buy them   Now  one last question    WHY DIDN T I GET MY LETTER FROM HOGWARTS  HUH     I THINK THEY FORGOT ABOUT ME  THEY MUST HAVE FORGOTTEN  It s almost impossible for me to write an objective review of this book  but I will try  The first thing that s really obvious when you start reading this book is how stereotypical the characters are  Particularly the physical characterization  The bad guys are fat  beady eyed or have greasy hair and hooked noses  Dumbledore is the usual wise old wizard with a long white beard  When I first read this  the image I had of him was Merlin from Disney s The Sword in the Stone  awesome movie by the way  you should watch it  And if you think about it  there are other parallelisms between the movie and book  The fat  red headed  mustached uncle  Check The mean  stupid cousin  Check The orphan who s the chosen one  Check  Why the parallelism  Because it s a formula  and one that works  And because using stereotypes frees Rowling into having more time for other things  like introducing you to a whole new world and an insane amount of characters  Think about it  This book is only 300 pages long  and in it you get back story  a complete new fantasy world with a new currency  a school of magic with its own set of rules and amazing description  who can ever forget the stairs that move and go to a different place on Fridays   a plot  and a LOT of characters  And I don t mean the usual one dimensional supporting characters  Rowling supporting characters are in a complete different level  And I m not talking about the golden trio I m talking about all the others  Hagrid  Neville  Snape  Fred and George  The last two particularly are so beloved they have almost as much fandom as Harry himself  Can you think of other series where a set of side characters is so well developed I guess my conclusion is  this is an amazing book  Well researched  well developed  written with care  I loved it when I was 13  I ve loved it over the years and I love it now  And now  off to read the second book   DImage credits Screenshots from The Sword in the Stone are property of Disney of course  Just studying by Faith92The last image is uncredited  Still looking for the source   I ve read all the Harry Potter books twice  some three times  I remember years ago when I mailed the first three books to my new nephew  Quinton  My brother in law  Terry  and his wife  Libby  had decided to raise Q  her grandson  Libby said the books were a little  old  for him and would have to be read aloud  but if I really wanted to send them  I could go ahead  Unfortunately  my sister in law  Libby  got a terrible flu about the time the books arrived on their doorstep To appreciate the rest of the story  you need to realize my brother in law s favorite hero is  The Duke   As in  John Wayne   Terry is nothing  if he s not a man s man  and when we play the  lines from a movie  car riding game  all his are from JW s movies Due to Lib s infirmity  Terry decided to take on the duty of nightly story time  and graciously agreed to read this first book until Libby got well enough to take on this  woman s  responsibility  After almost a week  Libby emerged from her sick bed and  when bedtime came  asked Q where they were in the story  My big  strong  manly brother in law said   Ah   that s alright  I ve got this one   And he proceeded to read all the rest of the books in the series too  My sister in law said it came as no surprise to her when the books became a nationally best selling phenomena  she knew something was up way before then  Update  Re read via audio while traveling the week of February 21   23  2012  I loved Jim Dale s narration of this delightful book and was happy I finally got to listen to his rendition  His inflections and tones are pitch perfect  elevating an already engaging book that is a wonderful listen for any age  Rowling s Harry Potter series  which begins with this book  is one of the greatest works of modern literature  in any genre  and one of the best reading experiences I ve ever had in any genre  The characterizations  especially of Harry  bring the characters to life and make you care about them  the intricate  carefully dovetailed plotting  very skillfully incorporating mystery elements  Rowling could have gone to the top of the mystery genre  too   is worthy of Dickens  and the imaginative details with which the author constructs her wizard s world are breathtaking  Most importantly  the book  and the whole series  has a solid moral grounding  from which it presents a serious tale of the struggle of good and evil  The whole thing is leavened with an adorable sense of humor and fun  and the author deftly weaves in elements drawn from an obviously wide acquaintance with a variety of actual arcane lore   Of course  the titular  sorcerer s stone  of the American edition is the philosopher s stone of medieval alchemy   which the editors thought American readers would be too ignorant to recognize by its proper name  Ironically  Rowling  a practicing member of the Church of Scotland  who lists C  S  Lewis and Tolkien among her major literary influences  was pilloried by many Christians as having written a work that glorifies satanism   with which they equate ANY mention of magic in literature  Invocational magic  which calls on dark powers  or seeks to coerce God  to produce its effects  is certainly condemned in Scripture  But magic of the incantational variety   what early modern scholars called  natural magic    which draws on morally neutral  inanimate forces created as part of the universe  analogous to magnetism or electricity  which were both viewed as  natural magic  at one time  presents no theological problem for Christians  All of the  magic  in this series is strictly of the incantational sort   Of course  that distinction is lost on those who condemn the series without reading any of it    wlyn khtb hry ptr khh shm rw b chyzhy jdwyy zydy ashn mykhnh rwnd dstn khwb w

hasn t been said before except maybe that I wish I hadn t read it  I wanted to leave this unread as long as I could so one day when I was old and wrinkly I could have experienced it for the very first time  I ve watched all the movies and they re fantastic but there is nothing like the book My favorite part was at the very end when Neville gets those ten points  Makes my heart happy Also  I DID NOT KNOW HARRY HAD GREEN EYES    Whaaaa   And it took my by surprise how mean Harry   Ron were towards Hermione  I knew that Ron   Hermione were always bickering in the movies but dang  I thought Harry was the nicer one and he wasn t  Talking about Harry  book Harry was so feisty and in the movies he came across more of a shy boy  Was that just Daniel s portrayal of the character  I don t know  Either way  I love both book and movie  D  Always a solid read  and rereading it 18 years later doesn t change a thing  except now I see more than I did when I was a kid reading it for the first time  and the layers and foreshadowing of events in later books just proves how brilliant J K  Rowling really is  I also didn t realize how many details I d forgotten  or that had been altered in my memory with the events of the movie  After all this time  Yes  Always  Forever and ever  Buddy reading this series  or at least the first few  with TL   This is the 4th time I ve read this series  and it is just as amazing as the first time round  these books make me all warm and fuzzy and i cried at the end like always  Absolutely loved it  Fantastic book   Review here Ahh  this book was amazing of course  This was my second time reading Sorcerer s Stone and it was so much better the second time  I loved going back and reading my favorite characters when they were younger  it was so cute  The illustrations were gorgeous  it made the experience even better  This series is one of my new favorites and everyone needs to read this series  I regret not reading it when I was younger  I can t wait to continue on and read Half Blood Prince for the first time  Goblet of Fire is still my favorite    Wow  This was my first time reading any Harry Potter book and it was everything I hoped it be  It was simply amazing  I can t believe I didn t read this series before  It was satisfying to finish this book and can t wait to finish the series   This is where it all began  where we were introduced to Harry Potter  Rowling s magical world  a series of exciting adventures and the excellent characters and environments she has given to English literature  It set the standard for contemporary fantasy  Rowling make full use of classic literary and mythological references  freeing herself from the confines of the merely topical  while giving it all a daring sense of newness  This series will live forever  I have read the series twice already  but I certainly don t mind reading them again My mum read these when they first came out  so she is the one who recommended them to me  And of course I love them  The Philosopher s Stone is a great introduction to the magical world and I would advise everyone to read it Also  I got the illustrated edition for Christmas and it s wonderful  If you re a fan of Harry Potter  it s worth getting Stars 5 5 Originally read  2003Reread  2005  2006  2007  2008  2009  2010  July 2011   December 2011  July 2012   December 2012  August 2013  July

of year feast  Dick move  Dumbledore  Dick move   I don t know why I never started this series before but I m glad I have   I loved the magical aspect and just everything about it  It made me laugh and smile all the time  I m so glad I started reading this wonderful series    I re read this series once a year or so  usually during winter  This year I decided to give the audio books a try and I m so glad I did  Stephen Fry s narration is just perfect  it made an already amazing book just so much more enjoyable  Si ya este archiconocido 1deg libro es toda una preciosidad magica  imaginad ahora esta edicion plagada de ilustraciones coloridas y con un toque de caos y magia que completan perfectamente la historia  Even better than I remembered  Now that I know what s going to happen throughout the story  I m seeing so many minute details that are important in the series  I can t wait to start book 2   Es la mejor relectura que he hecho en mi vida  La edicion ilustrada merece muchisimo la pena  He disfrutado mas que cuando lo lei por primera vez con 11 anos  Genial  Re read this again  loved it again  It s incredible how little details escape you and can be looked at again as if for the first time  Harry Potter is timeless  It was so nice to get back into this world for the 2015 read a long  It s so incredible that I still love these books as much as the first time I read them  It s officially Harry Potter Month so what better way to celebrate than to begin a LONG OVERDUE reread of the series  SO MUCH EXCITE   really wish I wanted to read this when I was younger       I really  really liked it  im surprised that I liked it as much as I did       This took me back to my childhood    at first I saw the movie and I LOVED IT  then I read the book and WOW loved it more then the movie  I first read this book at the age of 10 and re reading it now 6 years later  the nostalgia was kind of crushing As I read this at such an early age  I most certainly didn t appreciate the skill that goes into writing a world of such complexity in so few pages  And I definitely didn t realise how middle grade this book truly is  I have no problem with it whatsoever but the writing style really caught me off guard Having now lived on the films religiously for so log seeing how these characters  personalities differ in the book is fascinating  JK Rowling I applaud you on your wit 5 stars of course  First read  1997First time in English  January 20151st re read in English  October 2015 I loved reading my favorite series in this new format  Loved the illustrations    Not even sure how many times I ve read this at this point   but it never disappoints  2015 reading challenge   a book published the year you were bornIt s surprisingly difficult for me to write this review  I have so much to say  but I don t know how Years after the initial reading  this book still hasn t decreased in its greatness  I have so much love for the series and for the characters  I always like to revisit them  especially in Christmas time for some reason  Everyone is so young and innocent in Philosopher s Stone  I look forward to rereading the series again  I love all the hints I found in the book  for example Snape s ability to  read minds   as muggles like to say  Love love love it   Such a big fan of harry potter    A year in Hogwarts goes by way too fast    Is this even written by a human    Reread for The Booktubeathon  Perfection  I don t think it is surprising to anyone to see my 5 star rating  The illustrations are very  very  very beautiful  I just want to buy another copy so I can cut out the illustrations and frame them      but I won t  Because I won t assault a book as brilliant as Harry Potter  also  ain t nobody got money for that Rereading Harry Potter made me very happy  I loved being in the magical world of witchcraft and wizardry again  And I loved seeing all the little clues I missed the first time around  It is the first time I ve reread Harry Potter it  For those of you who don t know  I didn t grow up with HP  I only read it for the very first time in the summer of 2014  My parents have this weird thing with magic  they re like the Dursleys in that way  They dislike it and don t want to hear about it  nor see movies about it nor read books  When I was young my mom never read stories to me with wizards or witches in them  It wouldn t be good for my health      or something like that   eyeroll  They re awesome people though  unlike the Dursleys  pMy First Review of the Philosopher s Stone  I wrote it after reading it for the First Time EVER  I bought Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone right when it came out  way back in  97 or 98  I m embarrassed to admit it now  but after reading the first chapter  I was bored and put it back on my shelf where it sat unread and gathering dust for three long years Goblet of Fire came out in 2000  and I happened to be in a book store while the book release party was going on  Pottermania hadn t reached it s peak quite yet    and back then people still pronounced her character  Her mee own   not having the internet or movies to tell them otherwise    but you could already feel that this was something that was going to be huge  I rolled my eyes a little at my friends who were obsessed with it  confused since I d been so bored by this book when I d tried reading it several years before  But  I went home from the bookstore that day  determined to retry this book I d dismissed  curious about exactly what all this hype was for I remember finishing the first book in a day  and making my mother take me to the bookstore to get the next one the very next day  and again the following day for the third and fourth  I d finished all the books that d been released within 4 days  and just like that I was hooked just like everyone else  desperate for the fifth book to be released So while I was a later fan to Harry Potter than I often like to admit  this book still defined my teenage years  I ve read this countless times and every re read is a chance to discover some part of Rowling s world that I hadn t noticed the previous time  I haven t revisited the first book yet as an adult  but it s something I d like to do soon  Mostly  Harry Potter taught me to never dismiss something just because it s popular  and to always give a book a chance by reading at least a few chapters before throwing it in the abandoned pile  I can still remember the first time I held a Harry Potter book in my hands  In fact  the cover of my paperback copy of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone has a small crease on it from the time I flipped it open in too much of a rush to read it  It has my favorite quotes underlined  witty passages starred  and is covered with post it notes on nearly every page from the amount of times I ve re read it  Now  reading it again so many years later  I am taken back to all that magic  all that wonder  and all that amazement that I first had when I laid my eyes on these books  In all honesty  this is a series that needs no review   avid fans will re read it without hesitation  new book lovers will pick it up without even consulting a friend for approval  and it will live on in our world as a classic  Yet  as one for whom Harry Potter was a life changing experience  I feel the need to justify  or at least explain  what this book has done for me and why it stands the test of time as a remarkable story  even today  I am not the first one to begin analyzing the Harry Potter Series  Since the release of Deathly Hallows  there have been numerous authors who have attempted to make sense of a greater meaning within Rowling s work  Some have even claimed that there are Biblical references of Christianity within her pages  but not being a Christian  I have never found them  Still others  like me  prefer to keep this book out of the scope for analytical reading and simply enjoy the story within its pages  I  by no means  think that J K  Rowling is a brilliant writer  If anything  I think her writing is slow in some parts  lacks figurative language  and contains a dearth of descriptive passages  To me  good writers are people like Jane Austen  Charles Dickens  Charlotte Bronte  J R R  Tolkien   or even more recently   Laini Taylor  Megan Whalen Turner  Cath Crowley  Melina Marchetta  and John Green  These are people whose ever word  every phrase  and every sentence is a beauty to behold and read  Rowling s work is not like that  but what makes her stand out from all others is her imagination  creativity  and her art of storytelling  No one else can quite tell a story like Rowling can and she does a splendid job tying up all the loose ends and fitting together every small clue to make a bigger puzzle piece  In fact  I was astonished yet again while reading The Sorcerer s Stone this past weekend for seeing names such as  Sirius Black   Peter Pettigrew  and  Grindlewald  come up even in the first installment of this series  It is clear that Rowling not only puts forth a lot of thought into her writing and plot outlining  but her manner of telling a story and uncovering the small pieces is unrivaled  Rowling s talent aside  what strikes me the most about the series is the fact that I am able to glean something new from it every time  When I was younger and first read this  I learned that it is okay to be smart and intelligent and a know it all  but it is even better to be brave and courageous and strong  The second time I re read this while waiting for Order of the Phoenix to release I took strength from the fact that if Harry could survive without his parents for so long  even I could spend a summer without them in India  Much later while waiting for Deathly Hallows to release I began to realize how truly dark and forbidding even this first installment of the series was  I was struck by the horror of the Forbidden Forest and found myself thinking long and deep about what it meant to live a cursed life  I also finally found myself appreciating Dumbledore s cleverness in using the Mirror of Erised to ensure that only one who wishes to find the stone and not possess it would be the one to come in possession of it Over the years  my parents have become resigned to the fact that this is a series that I will eventually be forced to re buy at some point in my life because eventually  the spine will break from over use  Yet  while they have become resigned to this fact  I have come to marvel at the magic within its pages even more for every time I re read this series  not only am I transported into happiness  joy  and the feelings of wonder I felt when I first read this  I am also able to glean something new from it every single time  That  in my opinion  is the true reason that the Harry Potter Series will live on forever  It isn t something you can ever get tired of reading  of living  of breathing  Furthermore  Rowling is able to integrate larger themes within younger novels with such ease that even the wisest of us can have it in ourselves to learn something from her books  her characters  and their experiences  Thus  having read this book again this year for what seems to be the umpteenth time  I find myself once again stumped by the great and wise Albus Dumbledore  What I took from the series this time around is that Dumbledore is a liar  Now knowing about Dumbledore s less than honorable past  it is safe to say that Dumbledore most certainly did not see himself holding a pair of socks in the Mirror of Erised  If anything  he saw his family  just like Harry did  So  despite being ten years older  ten years wiser  and ten years more mature than when I first started these books  I have learned once again that even the noblest amongst us lie and although falsehood is not condoned  sometimes it is necessary in our lives  It is times like now that I find myself in awe of Rowling and wish to thank her for all she has ever given me  because no matter what is taken away from the world in war  famine  and poverty  magic and imagination are two things that can never be taken away from us  You can find this review and more on my blog  Ivy Book Bindings I mean  I didn t really have any doubts that I would absolutely love this  I read one chapter every day from January 1 to today  January 17   It was the absolute perfect way to start my day   a cup of coffee and a chapter from a book that means so much to me illustrated by one of my favorite illustrators  PERFECT  Que se puede decir que no haya sido dicho ya Sin duda aunque es relativamente simple este primer libro de la saga mas famosa escrita en la historia del mundo  y digo relativamente porque se desarrollo como un mundo muy basto y complejo   es sin duda un libro que le hace bien al corazon y al alma Ansio enormemente leer muyyyy pronto los proximos libros   Pronto resena completa en el Blog y video especial en el canal    Wow  I never imagined I could enjoy Harry Potter more than I already do  BUT it happened while I was reading this edition The illustrations in this book are absolutely gorgeous  They make the story even better  which I never thought I would say This book was beautiful and perfect and I m soooo happy to have read it   It never gets old to read the first book of Harry Potter  It s always magical like the very first time  However this time  it was a million times more fantastic because I can t even begin to explain how gorgeous the illustrations are and how more magical they make the story be   What a nice blast to the past  I filled my childhood reading the Harry Potter series  Despite not being an avid Potterhead  it is still nice to endulge in the magical world of Hogwarts     Wow  What an awesome read  I ve heard about the Harry Potter series for years but was never really interested in reading it until my big sis picked it up a few months back and recommended the first one to me  I didn t really think I d like it but as soon as I picked it up I just couldn t put it down  I ve heard that J K  Rowling went to several different publishers before one would publish this awesome book  all I have to say to that is the publishers that turned this fantastic read down where insane  And I bet they re kicking themselves for not grabbing hold of one of the most popular series in this score  Terrific whimsical and fantastical read  Harry Potter has of course become an icon in literature and pop culture today and it was very intriguing to see how it all began  J K  Rowling creates an environment that is sinister yet charming and manages to enrapture the reader with her peculiar descriptions and plethora of sorcery which leaves us as readers with a fervent  unequivocal desire to explore hogwarts and all its inhabitants  Mesmerizing and astonishing novel  In summation  a bloody fun read  Five stars  of course    It s so great to be in this world once again  I love that even though I ve read these books so many times  I still am amazed and I fall in love with these books a bit more after each reread  I will ALWAYS be a Potterhead                           Hurry up November 1st  SOON No puedo creer que tarde tanto en leer este libro  Vamos a ver que me espera el segundo  Ahora vamos al tercer libro del read a Long  Relectura  Obviamente las 5 estrellas son solo por el carino  si nos vamos a lo profundo  el libro tiene muchas falencias  sobretodo en los detalles que sientan las bases del mundo magico  y en partes de las tramas posteriores  Fue emocionante leer el libro despues de chorromil anos despues de la primera lectura que le di  Ademas  leerselo a otra persona tambien fue super entretenido  ya que ibamos comentando los recuerdos que teniamos del libro y los comparabamos  Es increible las diferencias que tiene con la pelicula  que tampoco son tantas en este libro como sera con los otros  y ver las diferencias de interpretacion que han hecho las peliculas con respecto a los libros en los lectores  en plan  sobre como son ciertos personajes y escenas  etc Supongo que iremos releyendo los siguientes libros durante estos otros meses    I love this series    it s crazy how emotional it makes me just reading the first line  knowing what s in store    I ve read these dozens of times  and since I wasn t re reading last year I missed my annual re read  almost physically  I am so happy to be able to go back to Hogwarts  finally   Favorite Quote    The truth   Dumbledore sighed   It is a beautiful and terrible thing  and should therefore be treated with great caution  This will forever be one of the best books eveerrrrr  Forever tattooed in my heart  mind and soul   I listened to the audiobook by Stephen Fry I don t think this book requires a review  DI loved this book like

  01 01 16 01 03 16 Reread 2016 Buddy Read with BBB  First read book of 2016  Happy New Year ya muggles   AND THE NEW ILLUSTRATED EDITION    Oh my word  Well  five stars  Again  And six if I could give it for this illustrated version  The artwork is astounding and beautiful and so much fun and sets the tone so wonderfully This is  hands down  just the most creative series I think I ve ever read  I remember being blown away when I finally started reading them  Which was when book three came out and I finally stopped listening to that annoying adult voice in my head that told me I was too old now to read children s books Rubbish  I m rereading them all this year  which I think will make the third time I ve read this series  In its entirety  Great way to start my 2016 reading year  It feels a bit like coming home  And don t the best books always feel that way  I was so  so excited when my Bibliomaniacs book group decided to do a Harry Potter readathon  I haven t read the series in seven years  and i deeply miss reading the books  I ve heard that reading the books as an adult gives a different experience compared to reading it as a child  and so i wanted to see how that was  In this review i ll mostly review my experience rereading the book  I m actually quite shocked to discover that a lot of people out there still have not read the Harry Potter series  I m sure most have at least watched the movies  but i honestly think they are still missing out  For the last seven years  i ve only been watching the movies because i ve read all the books a few times before that  So when i started reading the first book again  i realised that there s so much depth in the books that is difficult to be displayed in the movies  It compliments the story perfectly when you have experienced both adaptations Being a much older and a much more matured reader  it was easier to appreciate every detail of the book  As a child  the details didn t seem too important to pay attention to  Sometimes i didn t even understand what i was reading  maybe because the language was a little difficult for me at that age  Now  it s as easy as reading any other book  In fact  it s even easier  because i ve watched the movies  I loved the characters and the concept of the wizarding world the most when i was a kid  But rereading it now  I m able to empathize the characters a lot differently  I noticed the emotional descriptions more  which was absolutely fantastic  My favourite character in this book is Harry  It s always been Hermione  but after the reread i realised how great Harry actually is  The way that he was so used to being treated so horribly  to the point where he always braced himself for the worst every time something might have gone wrong  The way he appreciated every wonderful moment  all the magical things  How mature and humble he was for an eleven year old boy  There were some understandably kiddish moments too  which were really fun to read about  I felt like a kid again myself I also loved Ron and Neville These characters are just so great  and so entertaining to read about  There was a paragraph where Ron told Harry about where he stood in his family  He was the fifth child  and so all his brothers have achieved everything already  so it was difficult to get much attention from his family  I couldn t relate to him  but i could empathize  I love that there were a lot of different kinds of characters being introduced even from the first book  I think it was hard to remember all the characters when i read it for the first time long ago  but now it s great to know who everyone was  and what role they would be playing in the other books I can finally appreciate how brilliant JK Rowling s writing is  From the very first page  I could see her own identity in the way she writes  There was humour and character in it  I don t think i ve read that kind of writing except in Harry Potter  I loved it  I could hear this voice narrating in my head  in a very amusing tone  And because i ve watched the movie countless of times  the actors  voices automatically played in my mind when i read the dialogues  I was amazed at how the movie had kept true to the book  I would say that 90  of the movie was similar to the book  which i truly appreciated Weirdly enough  the book was only about 220 pages thick  I was a little blown away when i realised that Rowling had fit that entire story in such a thin book  She had built an entire wizarding world  and this thin children s book had been a life changing story for millions of people  I don t think it s as complex as the last few books  but it definitely is strategic because of that  As the readers keep reading more  they grow with the characters as well  and mature along with them This is a rather short review  i think it s because it s a reread so i m mostly writing about my experience and thoughts after rereading it again  rather than for the first time  Read this in one sitting   well  except the first 30 pages from yesterday  I m not reviewing this on my blog because I have nothing new to add to the conversation  I totally understand the intense love for this series  I m drinking the Koolaid  As my husband said  there is no other book with quite the sense of place of Hogwarts  And Hagrid  I love you  You re my fave  Sometimes I feel the need to defend why I haven t read the series  I wanted to read it when I felt I would be the most receptive to it  since I tried about ten years ago and wasn t jiving with the story  So many people have nostalgia for this series since they grew up with the books  I had decided to hold off until Natalie  my oldest daughter  gets gets to an appropriate age  However  I m participating in an annual readathon on YouTube called The Booktubeathon  and one of the challenges was  read someone else s favorite book    I took this in a collective sense and chose this one  and the fact that it s a great length  clocking in at just a little over 300 pages   I think the timing was perfect  especially since I have embraced fantasy and magic in my reading the last couple of years  Now I can understand all the references   FINALLY   Happy Dance   It is no doubt if the Harry Potter series are famous and become a phenomenon  You can find everything in the book  adventure  action  magic  humor  breathtaking  evil  dark art     Magnificent   The story started in England  where professor Dumbledore  McGonagall and Hagrid took an orphan baby with a scar that looked like a lightning bolt and left it in front of the door  Of course  I don t understand what was going on  10 years later  Harry Potter grew up and lived with a terrible  dreadful family  his uncle Vernon and aunt Petunia  who was really despised Harry  and forced him to sleep in a cupboard  They had a child  Dudley  a bully  who always bully Harry  However  things started when Harry accidentally let a snake at the zoo crawl out of the cage  He realized he could talk to snake  and didn t know why he could make the glass door disappeared  The next day  there was a strange letter send for him and he was really surprised   cause he never had friends or any relatives  But he couldn t read the letters   cause his uncle burned it and tore it  There were more and more letters were send to him  until one day  letters were appeared everywhere  The family  except Harry  was so scared that they decided to move to a lonely island  At night  a big man named Hagrid  lol I like him   bursts through the door and gave him a birthday cake  and told that he is a wizard  and gave him a letter told that he will go to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry  He learned the truth about his parents were killed by a Dark  Powerful Wizard named Voldemort   who tried to kill him but couldn t and instead left a scar on his forehead and died  There were people who still think that Voldemort was somewhere and tried to have his life back normal  Harry went to the Diagon Alley and Gringotts Wizarding Bank to inherit a lot of gold coins from his parents  He then went on a magical train  that will lead to Hogwarts and soon made friends with the Weasleys   another wizard family  especially Ron  a red hair boy  Hermione   a smart girl who came from a Muggle  those who don t have magic  family  He also made his first enemy  Draco Malfoy   arrogant and prejudice and rich with his sidekick   Crabbe and Goyle  When the train arrived  and the new students are allocated to House by the Sorting Hat  There are 4 houses  Gryffindor   brave  courage  Ravenclaw   creative  intelligent  smart  Hufflepuff   hard work  loyalty  fair play  and Slytherin   ambition  cunning  Harry  Ron  and Hermione were sorted in Gryffindor  while Malfoy and his friends were sorted in Slytherin   only for pure blood  He studied at Hogwarts and discovered a lot of things  First   there was a monster at school and unfortunately  it was released in Halloween  Second  his DADA teacher is a traitor Third  Voldemort is trying to get his life back by stealing the Philosopher s Stone Is Harry going to win  Yes  of course  if not there will be no sequel The rest you should read  I m not going to spoiler  HARRY HAD TO FACE HIS WORST ENEMY   VOLDEMORT                                                Harry with his owl   Hedwig  Ron with his mouse   Scabbers on the Hogwarts Train  Hermione raised her hand in the class  Harry  Ron and Hermione EVERYBODY   EVEN ADULTS SHOULD READ THE SERIES    Harry Potter and the sorcerers stone is the first of seven books in the Harry potter series  It is a tale of an eleven year old boy named Harry who since he was just a year old has lived with the Dursley s  the only family he has left  due to his parents tragic death  The Dursley s had always treated Harry terribly  like he was something they d scraped off their shoes  ever since he had been dropped off on their front doorstep  Ten years later in the same home harry starts receiving letters from no one  in which he receives punishment from uncle Vernon  later on after finding their whole house swimming in letters the Dursleys pack their car and travel to the shore where they sleep in a cabin until the giant called Hagrid busted down the door to see why harry wasn t getting his letters  He becomes outraged when he finds that the Dursleys were the reason of harry not knowing  When Hagrid finishes yelling at Vernon  Harry asks what his uncle hasn t been telling him  After composing himself  Hagrid tells him he s a wizard  famous one at that  and that he has been accepted at Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry  Appalled  Harry says this must be a mistake  him a wizard  Hagrid just chuckles and says goodnight The next day Hagrid takes harry to diagon ally where he is completely amazed by all the magical shops and stores  after buying all his school supplies  Hagrid takes Harry to the Leaky Cauldron  the local pub  where the subject of harry s mysterious past is brought up and why he s so famous  Grudgingly Hagrid tells him that not all wizards are good  some of them go bad  and about twenty years ago one went as bad as you can go  he tells harry that  you know who  as he called him  started looking for followers to join him  but his parents fought against him  so he killed him and tried to kill Harry too  but he couldn t  He disappeared after not being able to kill a little boy  and no one knows why after their discussion Hagrid gives him his ticket for the school train  Platform nine and three quarters and part their separate ways About a month later Harry arrives at Kings Cross Station where he can t find Platform nine and three quarters until and friendly family of gingers called the Weaslys who turn out to be wizards themselves  help him onto the platform  soon befriending the youngest boy Ron  On the train they meet a number of new first year students  They met a clumsy boy named Neville who lost his toad boarding  a bushy haired know it  all named Hermione  and an unpleasant bully named Draco whom reminded Harry much of his cousin Dudley Finally arriving at the school all the first years are sorted into their school houses  Harry  Ron  Hermione and many others are all sorted into Gryffindor houseFinally arriving at the school all the first years are sorted into their school houses  Harry  Ron  Hermione and many others are all sorted into Gryffindor house  soon after a few words from the headmaster along with a warning about the third floor corridor on the right side  they all feasted until bed  Harry and Ron  who decided they were now best friends  had a terrible first week of classes  they got lost twice  and got on the bad side of the caretaker  but none of that even compared to how terrible their first potions lesson  as it turned out their greasy haired hooked nosed potions teacher hated Harry on Halloween at the feast they were all having a good time until about the middle when the nervous trembling defense against the dark arts professor comes running in screaming  TROLL   TROLL IN THE DUNGEON     then fainted which resulted in the panic of the students and some of the staff  professor Dumbledore then calms everyone then tells everyone to go to their dormitories as the staff head to the dungeons to fight off the troll  well the troll turned out was in the girls bathroom  where Hermione was  when Harry remembers this  he and Ron rescue Hermione and they become quick friends  Later They all ask Hagrid What was in the third Floor corridor on the right hand side  Not thinking Hagrid told them it was none of their business and that information was strictly between professor Dumbledore and Nicholas Flamel Realizing that he said too much the trio ran off to look up Nicholas Flamel  With no luck they give up until Hermione stumbles across his name in a book  in which they find out that the thing he is famous for is the sorcerers stone  a magical substance in which can turn any object into pure gold or if in a liquid state is the elixir of life which sustains life and allows the drinker to become immortal  which is what they believe to be the object hidden

after getting past fluffy  the charmed keys  and the enchanted giant chess board  Harry leaves Ron and Hermione due to Rons injuries and goes to face snape through the last door  as he enters he finds not snape  but Quirrel where he finds that voldemort shares a body with Quirrel and that it was he who let the troll in on halloween  he who tried to kill harry at the quidditch match  not snape  And in the end Harry defeats Quirrel and voldemort eventually killing Quirrel then passing out  he woke up three days later in the hospital wing and had a chat with dumbledore about what had happened  Before Dumbledore leaves harry asks him why quirrel couldnt touch him  then Dumbledore explains that when Voldemort fell the night he attempted to kill him his mothers love was so powerful that when she died saving him it left a mark  a mark that could not be seen  that lives in his very skin  so voldemort could not touch him  then finally leaving dumbledore wishes harry a good summer and the trio leave for home looking forward to their next year at hogwarts  Where to start with this book Where to start with this little wizard who was the greatest hero of my childhood Where to start with this great story who was filling my imagination with great and powerful images of love and friendship Where to start with this story that was entirely woven by magic Well I think I m gonna start from the beginning  I was a young boy when I first came upon the first Harry Potter movie Yes I first saw the first movie and then began reading the series I was in love with the movie But when I first read this book the feelings were so new I had read so many books till that time  I was a real bookworm before Potter   but none seriously none could apply that much to my childhood dreams full of magic I was a child that loved magic and fantasy I was really fond of great stories like the ones we watched in Disney movies But no book had given me such pleasure and excitement and such a great story to keep believing I remember reading the Philosopher s Stone and actually wondering and thinking if this world could actually be real Harry Potter gave me strength to believe in fantasy To realize that if fairy tale worlds are real adventure is always a part of them It made me hope and dream and just live a magical childhood It was a place to go after difficult times It was a way to escape the cruel reality I strongly believe that children have to keep in touch with fantasy worlds because they help them dream and believe Not on the kind of magic wizards do but in the kind of magic the whole universe releases Harry Potter is a book series that helps young people dream and hope for a better world It helps them understand that all dreams need a lot of hard work and courage to fulfill but it also takes a little bit of magic too That s what Harry Potter meant to me those days That s why I just disappeared behind it s pages And I still do  Now for the book itself First of all Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone has a great plot It keeps you entertained amazed bewitched and excited all the time You laugh you smile you think you cry you hope you fear you pray you love you wonder In other world you feel Some of the worlds written in the book are so powerful and so full of wisdom You just admire the way the whole book is written You laugh with Ron you are proud of Hermione and you just live the adventure with Harry The whole story is like a detective story with young wizards as the protagonists The scenery for the story is a great magical and enchanted castle The characters are so rich in details you just can t stop thinking how real they are  So wherever you see it from Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone is a great book for every age to read It will keep you amazed it will enrich your imagination and it will teach you amazing life lessons Just let yourself dive in Harry Potter s world and live the adventure The story will be rewarding Just let the magic guide you  So yes  I m sifting through the series     again  And as always  I come away with happy  sniffly  covered in goose fleshy memories                                                             MOMENT  1  Mr and Mrs Dursley  of number four  Privet Drive  were proud to say that they were perfectly normal  thank you very much                                                              MOMENT  2  Nothing like this man had ever been seen in Privet Drive  He was tall  thin and very old  judging by the silver of his hair and beard  which were both long enough to tuck into his belt  He was wearing long robes  a purple cloak which swept the ground and high heeled  buckled boots  His blue eyes were light  bright and sparkling behind half moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked  as though it had been broken atleast twice  This man s name was Albus Dumbledore                                                              MOMENT  3   Really  Dumbledore  you think you can explain all this in a letter  These people will never understand him  He ll be famous   a legend   I wouldn t be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter Day in future   there will be books written about Harry   every child in our world will know his name                                                               MOMENT  4     and a huge motorbike fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them                                                              MOMENT  5  He couldn t know that at this very moment  people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices   To Harry Potter   the boy who lived                                                               MOMENT  6  Harry was used to spiders  because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them  and that was where he slept                                                              Moment  7  Yet here it was  a letter  addressed so plainly there could be no mistake                                                              MOMENT  8  Next moment  thirty or forty letters came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets  The Dursleys ducked  but Harry leapt into the air trying to catch one                                                              MOMENT  9   Harry   yer a wizard                                                               MOMENT  10  DIAGON ALLEY                                                             MOMENT  11    holly and phoenix feather  eleven inches  nice and supple Harry took the wand  He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers  He raised the wand above his head  brought it swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold spark shot from the end like a firework  throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls                                                              MOMENT  12   I m not Fred  I m George   said the boy   Honestly  woman  call yourself our mother  Can t you tell I m George                                                               MOMENT  13   All you have to do is walk straight at the barrier between platforms nine and ten  Don t stop and don t be scared you ll crash into it  that s very important                                                               MOMENT  14  The door of the compartment slipped open and the youngest red headed boy came in  Anyone sitting there   he asked  pointing at the seat opposite Harry  Everywhere else is full  Harry shook his head and the boy sat down                                                              MOMENT  15  She had a bossy sort of voice  lots of bushy brown hair and rather large front teeth                                                              MOMENT  16  The narrow path had opened suddenly on to the edge of a great black lake  Perched atop a high mountain on the other side  it s windows sparkling in the starry sky  was a vast castle with many turrets and towers                                                             MOMENT  17   Not Slytherin  not Slytherin                                                               MOMENT  18   Wood   I ve found you a Seeker                                                               MOMENT  19   I hope you re pleased with yourselves  We could all have been killed   or worse  expelled                                                               MOMENT  20                                                             MOMENT  21   Troll   in the dungeons   thought you ought to know                                                               MOMENT  22  But from that moment on  Hermione Granger became their friend                                                               MOMENT  23   he hit the pitch on all fours   coughed   and something gold fell into his hand  I ve got the Snitch   he shouted                                                              MOMENT  24  The Mirror of Erised                                                             MOMENT  25                                                             MOMENT  26   Bless him  look  he knows his mummy   said Hagrid                                                              MOMENT  27  The cloaked figure reached the unicorn  it lowered its head over the wound in the animal s side  and began to drink its blood                                                              MOMENT  28   I don t think you should be breaking any more rules  And you were the one who told me to stand up to people   Yes  but not to us   Said Ron in exasperation                                                              MOMENT  29   So light a fire   Harry choked   Yes   of course   but there s no wood   Hermione cried  wringing her hands  HAVE YOU GONE MAD   Ron bellowed   ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT                                                               MOMENT  30   Yes     said Ron softly   it s the only way   I ve got to be taken                                                               MOMENT  31   Me   Books  And cleverness  There are more important things   friendship and bravery and   oh Harry   be careful                                                               MOMENT  32  Harry would have screamed but he couldn t make a sound  Where there should have been a back to Quirrell s head  there was a face  the most terrible face Harry had ever seen  It was chalk white with glaring red eyes and slits for nostrils  like a snake                                                                MOMENT  33   After all  to the well organized mind  death is but the next great adventure                                                               MOMENT  34   Your mother died to save you  If there is one thing Voldemort cannot understand  it is love  He didn t realize that love as powerful as your mother s for you leaves it s own mark  Not a scar  no visible sign    to have been loved so deeply  even though the person who loved us is gone  will give us some protection for ever  It is in your very skin  Quirrell  full of hatred  greed and ambition  sharing his soul with Voldemort  could not touch you for this reason  It was agony to touch a person marked by something so good                                                               MOMENT  35   Only one who wanted to find the stone   find it  but not use it   would be able to get it                                                               MOMENT  36   There are all kinds of courage   said Dumbledore  smiling   It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies  but just as much to stand up to our friends  I therefore award ten points to Mr Neville Longbottom                                                               For

DIOSSSS  porque no lei esto antes    D Lo lei fluidisimo  me atrapo desde la primera pagina  y no me solto  Los personajes son geniales y que decirles  ES HARRY POTTER Ahora me doy cuenta que la adaptacion cinematografica es muuuuuuy buena comparada con el libro  creo que es la mejor adaptacion a un libro que vi por ahora Y mas que obvio que voy a seguir con la saga  3 No hay manera de resenar Harry Potter  simplemente    no hay  A fines del 2015 decidi que queria empezar a releer la saga pero para eso me compre las ediciones britanicas y  no se ustedes  pero la diferencia se nota y demasiado  O quizas es la experiencia de volver a leerlo  no se  Pero estoy flipando a lo grande y estoy tratando de releerlo lo mas lento posible porque no quiero terminarlos a todos muy rapido  Quizas lea uno por mes   Harry Potter y la piedra filosofal es una novela facil de leer que te transporta a un mundo construido con mucho detalle  lleno de personajes muy reales  muy diversos y muy muy numerosos  Leer resena completa    June 30  2015 update  There is only one time in your life you can say that you read the first Harry Potter book aloud  for the first time  with your child  Admittedly  too few people will probably ever say this    Today I can say that my daughter and I did just that  It was magical  After this  my umpteenth re read of the title  I can still say that the Harry Potter books are popular for a reason  I am just as drawn in today as I was  I choose to not say how long ago  nor how old I was  when I first was introduced to the series  Only now I am able to appreciate the subtleties of the world and pick out things I had never noticed before   I d forgotten how very light hearted this first book is Long live Harry Potter  OK  I was amazed  I loved the movies so I decided to wait until I saw all the movies to begin reading the books  What amazed me the most was how the movie remained very true to the book  Naturally there s a lot more that you can put in the book like what a person is thinking but as I read through the book I could see the characters from the movie actually saying the lines  see the visual of Hogwarts  etc  I ve already gone out an bought the next two chapters in the Harry Potter saga  Nice read  good plot  good pace  I don t care if you have seen the movies  the book lends itself to some more details about the characters and their thought processes  Buy it  read it  love it     Both me and my son loved this   The illustrations were fantastic and just made a brilliant book better  What to say about a book like Harry Potter  beloved  praised and many a time re read by all  that you simply missed out to read as a child  I suppose it was a slightly different experience to read this as a grown up  but it did not lack to enchant me at all  I might not be 11 anymore  but connecting to the characters and the story in this charmed world wasn t difficult at all  I started loving them instantly and I can t wait to return to Hogwarts for the second school year with them  My magical journey has definitely begun   Do I really need to elaborate   5  para a edicao ilustrada 3  para a edicao normal It was such a joy to re read this book I realized again that one of the things that makes this book so special is the way that Rowling doesn t  explain  things  but lets the reader wonder and discover the meaning of it later in the book  One small example  the first time the term  Muggles  is mentioned  in the very first chapter  during the conversation between Dumbledore and McConagall   no explanation given  Another thing Rowling does better than most is the way she plants her clues  You don t even realize it s a clue until much much later  Not  over explaining things is especially rare in fantasy novels where the reader encounters a strange  unknown world and in many books a lot of explaining is done which makes for bad reading  especially in dialogue    Rowling  however  can manage without it   And mind you  her book was originally written for children and YA   And I ve read so many books  not only crime fiction  in which you could see that something is an important clue right from the start Rowling  however  rightly trusts the reader s willingness to go along for the ride  In other words  she takes the reader seriously  Sometimes I wish more authors  of all genres  would read Harry Potter  just to see how it s done    I am reading Harry Potter series for the first time ever  When I was a kid  I watched the movies and I didn t like it at all mostly because my sister keep wanting to watch it  But then this year  I re watch all the movies and damn I got really addicted  So I bought the books  These are my thoughts after reading this first book  I really love it  no doubt    Harry not knowing he s a wizard and discovering the magical world for the first time is really exciting  It feels like we are on the same boat as him because well we are reading from his point of view  Even after watching the movie and knowing all the plots and stuff it doesn t really take the joy out of reading this book  Of course when reading this book  I always picture them as the actors and how cute and young they were Although I find Draco more obnoxious in the book rather than in the movie  But that s just my opinion  bottom line is I love everything about this book  No matter how old you are  you are never too old to read Harry Potter series  So if you haven t read this series please do because IT IS AMAZING     Amazingly stunning edition  I had a strict rule not to peak ahead at the illustrations but to experience each for the first time as I read it  I am so thankful I stuck to it as I got to experience the drawings intertwined with the story and its was like reading this book  which I have re read over 100 times  for the very first time  I really hope they relese the rest of the series in this format   The illustrations are just so beautiful  I spent a great time fawning over every little detail and I loved flipping a page to find yet another gorgeous artwork adorning the page  My favourite illustration is the one of Harry at the Mirror of Erised  that one pulled on my heartstrings  This is a great book for a child to get started on the Harry Potter series  But for now  it s my most prized book   So now I know why everybody loves Harry Potter so much  I ve put off this series for far too long  and how stupid of me to do that  I adored Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone  and I m excited to start the next book ASAP  Does anybody else ship Harry and Ron  Anyone  I do  It s probably not going to happen  but we need more LGBT aspects in our middle grade novels       Finally finished the illustrated edition of HP and the Philosopher s Stone and I looooved it    Jim Kay s illustrations are incredibly beautiful  very detailed and absolutely magical    it was a whole new reading experience for me re reading HP and the Philosopher s Stone with these awesome illustrations    This is probably my fifth or sixth time reading The Sorcerer s Stone  I ve been feeling a bit slumpy about my reading lately and I thought picking up this old favorite might help me out a bit  I was right  I feel ready to jump back into reading  The only question now is  do I pick up a different book or do I continue on and read The Chamber of Secrets  For the Illustrated Edition  This book completely re imagines characters we re familiar with in a beautiful and insightful way  It features double page layout drawings  small inset illustrations and full page images  I loved all the detail and care put into the story the world now knows and loves  This is a must have Harry Potter collector s item  I absolutely adore this book  It s my favorite series of all time and I m pretty sure it will be my favorite for at least next few decades  I have  as lot of people  bound my childhood with this series  Incredible writing  incredible story  incredible illustrations and I ll say just one thing    Harry Potter will always be in my heart   3 I have never read nor seen the movies  I know that s hard to believe  I was never interested in the story to be quite honest  I was a typical muggle  I didn t believe in all this magical hullabaloo  I thought I was too old to enjoy middle grade fiction  All everyone raves about is Harry Potter this and Harry Potter that  I mean really  how could so many people fall in love with a story about a boy who didn t know he was a Wizard  lived under the stairs of his mean Aunt and Uncles house and eventually go to a school for Witchcraft and Wizardry Fast forward 19 years and guess what  I ve never had so much fun reading a book before  I loved how it made me laugh and at the same time made me think  I adored the friendship between Harry  Ron and Hermione  I have a soft spot for Hagrid and I loved Dumbledore s wisdom  I now want to own an owl named Hedwig and I even want a 3 headed dog named Fluffy  I am now a proud Gryffindor and I cannot wait to jump into the second book  I know I am going to have the ride of my life and I want it to be on a Nimbus 2000  01 01 2016 Buddy Read with my friends over at BB B   Call him Voldemort  Harry  Always use the proper name for things  Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself    When I think of J K  Rowling or Harry Potter  I think of magic  The magic of words  the magic of imagination  Harry Potter was my first introduction to fantasy  and what an awesome one it was  There is nothing better than reading about good vs evil  and the journey good has to take to defeat evil  It confounds me that this book was submitted to twelve  TWELVE  publishing houses  which rejected it  And now this author is a millionaire  and the Harry Potter series famous  I m not going to go into detail about this book or this series  as I really can t think of anyone who doesn t know of it   If you don t  climb out from under that rock you live  and go get yourself a copy of this book      What I will say though is this book is a must read for everyone who loves reading  doesn t matter what genre you usually prefer  or what age you are  It will take you on a magical journey  one you won t want to come back from  Reread  August 2015 THIS IS THE BEST SKGJHSJLGHALKDFD DIAGON ALLEY ANDTHE MIRROR AND THE CLOAK THE DRAGON THE UNICORN AND THAT THIRD FLOOR I LOVE IT I ve seen some clips of the movies when I was little and I grew up thinking Harry Potter wasn t my cup of tea      what the hell was wrong with me  Wie konnte ich nur vergessen wie gut Harry Potter ist  Vor allem das erste Buch hatte ich nicht so gut in Erinnerung    zum Gluck hab ich die Collection Box geschenkt bekommen und kann alle Bucher lesen so oft ich will  Und die Cover sind der Hammer die sehen super gut aus im Regal  First read  2003There s not a lot to say about how brilliant this book is  but I am so happy to be back into this world   Looking forward to re reading the whole series  this time in English instead of Spanish     This book blows me away each and every time I read it  I love how it takes me to a new world and quickly takes me back to my childhood  This will forever be my favorite series   No se porque espere tanto para leer esta serie  Me encanta como escribe la autora y me rei muchismo mientras leia Preciosa historia y los personajes son bellisimos   It was so fun finally getting to read Harry Potter   Relido em Julho 2015 Relido em Outubro 2012  Re reading Potter never gets old   3   It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live   Da igual que hayan pasado muchos anos desde que entre por primera vez en Hogwarts  Harry Potter sigue siendo igual de especial que entonces  Me ha encantado dejarme llevar de nuevo por este mundo tan magico y maravilloso que marco una etapa de mi vida  Mi yo del pasado habria llorado y guardado como un tesoro esta edicion ilustrada  No puedo explicaros lo que he sentido al pasar cada pagina y vivir lo que estaba leyendo a traves de estas preciosas ilustraciones  Ha sido doblemente especial porque nunca los habia leido en ingles y realmente parecia que les iba conociendo a todos por primera vez  Harry descubriendo que no esta tan solo en el mundo como pensaba  Ron sacando la cabecita y no siendo uno mas como hasta ahora  Germione dandose cuenta que la vida es mucho mas que seguir reglas y recitar libros de memoria  Es una de las amistades mas especiales que recuerdo y estoy deseando volver a vivir esta aventura con ellos    From that moment on  Hermione Granger became their friend  There are some things you can t share without ending up liking each other  and knocking out a twelve foot mountain troll is one of them   Casi me siento como la nina aquella que fui  esperando impaciente al proximo libro  y al otro  y al otro    To Harry Potter  the boy who lived  El libro que inicio todo  Hasta podria decirse que es el libro que sobrevivio  ya que fue rechazado por varias editoriales antes de ser publicado Entre ayer y hoy relei este libro  La ultima vez que lo lei  hace unos cinco anos  me habia parecido infantil  pero esta vez me parecio adulto y quizas esa sea la magia de Harry Potter  el haber atravesado varias etapas de mi vida y  en las ultimas veces que lo volvi a leer lo encontre diferente o  creo que seria mejor decir  el diferente soy yo y el libro me acompanaba en todo ese trayecto  porque fue el primer amor y porque siempre deseo volver a el La historia esta demas contarla  quien mas y quien menos  conoce algo de la historia  mas alla de que no haya leido los libros ni visto la pelicula  como esa frase casi premonitoria que la profesora McGonagall le dice a Dumbledore al principio de la historia    Sera famoso    una leyenda    no me sorprenderia que hoy sea conocido en el futuro como el dia de Harry Potter    escribiran libros sobre Harry    cada nino en el mundo conocera su nombre  Me encanto volver a la magia  a los partidos de quidditch y sobretodo  a las ensenanzas de amistad y valor  a la superacion de obstaculos y a la eterna lucha entre el bien y mal  y  tambien  como la vida no es color de rosas  hacer el bien muchas veces consiste en tener que pagar un precio Si de algo estoy seguro sobre este libro  es que en el futuro volvere a el  como alguien distinto  con mas anos  con otros problemas y que no solo yo habre cambiado  sino que el libro habra cambiando conmigo  Oh man I can t even express how much I love this book It s you know the legendary beging of an amazing journey that I ve been a part of since I was eight years old I still remember the day my mom and I bought the first four parts in the series 10 years ago fun fact the first book was published for the first time just ten days after I was born   And I have to admit that it s just as magical the fifth time around The storyline the sassiness of Harry freakin  Potter his character is so much better and more likeable than in the movies in my opinion   pretty much everything related to the Weasley twins Hagrid aka the best man that ever existed are just some of the things I adore in this book Another fun fact  My mom came into my room while I was reading this saw that I was reading Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone even though I was supposed to study Geography and left the room without saying a word  Favourite quotes you already know it s going to be a 1001 quote by the Weasley twins    You haven t got a letter on yours   George observed   I suppose she thinks you don t forget your name  But we re not stupid we know we re called Gred and Forge   Now  you two   this year  you behave yourselves  If I get one more owl telling me you ve   you ve blown up a toilet or    Blown up a toilet  We ve never blown up a toilet   Great idea though  thanks  Mum    What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret  so  naturally the whole school knows    Don t play   said Hermione at once  Say you re ill   said Ron  Pretend to break your leg   Hermione suggested  Really break your leg   said Ron    Curious indeed how these things happen  The wand chooses the wizard  remember   I think we must expect great things from you  Mr  Potter    After all  He Who Must Not Be Named did great things    terrible  yes  but great    Don t worry  the Weasleys are more than a match for the Bludgers    I mean  they re like a pair of human Bludgers themselves    Reread  January 2015The latest re read of the whole series  and I thought that it was about time that I wrote a review for this book  books   Harry Potter is what got me into reading  period  That s how special this books is to me  and it s been a while since I ve been re reading the whole series  because the last time I re read it  it was only the sixth and the seventh book  so the events in this first book seem like coming back to a wonderful dream I don t think there s anyone out there who doesn t know what Harry Potter is about  it s about magic  and good vs evil vs whatever that s in between  it s about twisted families and good ones  changing your whole perspective on wizardry  and dare I say  that it started as a middle grade series evolving into a YA one  and eventually becoming an adult book  I don t know  but I like to think that  It s always nice going back to the little things that made me happy  Harry knowing for the first time he s a wizard  exploring Diagon Alley and Hogwarts with him and being awe struck as he was  Meeting Ron and Hermione and the Weasleys  and re establishing my huge crush n Dumbledore  and hating Snape  at least till the seventh book   also getting back at the Durselys never gets old Of course  reading it the first time I was a child  and one might think he d outgrow these books  but that never happened and I m thankful for that  The first encounter with Voldemort sent chills down my spines the same way it did many years ago  and I feel wonderful I ll watch all these wonderful characters grow  I just love the idea of marathoning Harry Potter again  I ve been meaning to reread this for so long  and I m super glad I picked this up now  It felt like a whole new experience finally reading a Harry Potter book in English  and I freaking loved it   I really want to reread the rest of the books sometime through the summer  What I first had a little difficulty understanding at first  was understanding Hagrid s dialog  Like I understood what was written  and I could picture him talking but I don t know    It was just weird  but once I understood it quickly became easy to understand Now  I have so many things to say about this book  but I feel like it s useless because almost everyone already read these books  and knows how perfect they are  And if you haven t read them  I have no idea what you re doing with your life  because you need Harry Potter in your life  right now  Even if you don t think you do  I know you are wrong  Everyone needs to read Harry Potter  I only read the first 5 books last year  and you have no idea how I regret it  So please  stop what you are doing and  re read Harry Potter you won t regret it Just a small summary of my thoughts on the first book  I specially love the first one  because it s where we get to learn about the magic world alongside Harry  And I freaking love  Vising Diagon Alley for the first time  Hogwarts  the Train  the Forest  even Privet Drive  It s just fabulous seeing everything starting  I often found myself with tears in my eyes when certain characters appeared for the first time  or when the trio really got together  and when they saved each other  Well almost the whole book  There s one thing I d give anything for  and that s reading this books  for the first time again  before watching the movies  and unspoiled  I d pay for that  I really would  I regret not reading this books earlier in my life Anyway  now I m gonna watch the first movie  and then read the second book and so on  Wish me luck  I m gonna need it  because  feels  I read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone for the first time right before the movie adaptation was released  I was a bit behind the already numerous series fans  but still managed to experience Harry before he took the remaining non reading  but movie loving world by storm  I read the books  I saw the movies  A lot  And as I patiently  yet sadly  await the release of the final part of the final movie I finally sat down to re read the series in its entirely I could rave maniacally over the utter perfection that is Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone  but I won t  That s been done  To death  Over 4 700 5 star reviews on Amazon com alone  What I will do is point out the things that became very obvious to me during this re reading of the book  So many things became clear years later  that I never noticed or appreciated at the time of the first reading  As much as I d like to take credit for being older and therefore wiser  the real truth of it was I became so enamored with the book from the first chapter that I devoured it as quickly as possible  Needing to know what happened  needing to experience this new and fantastical world  I read as fast as I could   totally glossing over things I wish I d took the time to notice the first time around We all know Harry Potter is a wonderful story  Arguably the best of its generation  But I never noticed how wonderful the writing was until this re read  This new world  complete in every minute detail  is world building at its finest  Never is the reader confused as to how the world is supposed to work or appear  Never do we stumble over the many invented words  The story flows so smoothly that you never realize how huge an endeavor this must have been for the author As the first book in a series  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone lays the groundwork for everything to come  Harry s relationship with the Dursley s  Harry s friendship with Ron and Hermoine  Harry s rivalry with Malfoy  The tone is set for Harry s future interactions with Dumbledore  Hagrid  and Snape  So much character interaction  coupled with the introduction of both Hogwarts and the magical community as a whole  in such a small book  We know Rowling can write a doorstopper  so fitting all of these important things into barely 300 pages is nothing short of miraculous More than just magical adventure  Rowling weaves some charming humor into the Harry Potter world from the get go  Naming Filch s mean  old cat Mrs  Norris   genius  And the school song  How did I miss that  It s ridiculous and wonderful all at the same time  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone is often dismissed in favor of the later  darker books in the series  but I think that s a mistake  The entire series hinges on what is contained in this one book  The magnificence this series reaches by the end is only possible by the limitless imagination Rowling puts forth in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone   October 31  2015  After reading J K  Rowling s writing as Robert Galbraith I was inspired to start a re read of this series  IDK  Go with it  This re read was marked by how much humor and wit I found in little one off lines  Plus  my appreciating for Harry grew by leaps and bounds  Main characters often get rather shafted when it comes to fan love  When you ask people who their favorite HP character is  they ll probably say someone other than Harry  Probably because they either think he s a given  or think that some of the other more novel characters steal the spotlight  I have some of those favorites too  My point is only that Harry stood out to me on this re read  He really is such a brave  good hearted person  Even when we meet him at the Dursley s  the attitude he assumes living in really crappy conditions is admirable  I love him to bits and pieces  I think I love this book with a special love because while there is a big show down with Voldemort  there is something incredibly light hearted about this book compared to the other ones  My re reading always stalls as we get further into the series because of all the heartbreak  but here  it s all meeting friends and discovering secrets and establishing relationships Good fun  Onward  October 7  2013  Marking for re read  This is only my second time through the series  After the first time  my impression of The Sorcerer s Stone was that it was markedly  kiddie  compared to the rest of the series  and that the story overall seemed slow  It s amazing how much love for the series as a whole has recolored my view  I sped right through the book  this time  and enjoyed every moment of it  I didn t have that same impression of the story being young  but rather now  I was reading about these characters I love at the beginning of the journey  This book contains some of the most memorable lines of the series  and it was especially great to see Harry  Ron and Hermione at the onset of their friendship   3a lectura  15 08 20094a lectura  15 08 20125a lectura  24 07 2015Sobresaliente Descubri los libros de Harry Potter siendo ya mayorcita  y no por eso me gustaron menos Como comente mas arriba es la quinta vez que me leo  al completo  esta primera parte de la saga de J  K  Rowling Adentrarse en este mundo va mas alla de la magia  del carino a los personajes  de la aventura pura y dura    es dificil de explicar  tanto como facil disfrutarlo Fascina todo  hasta los pequenos detalles  Las descripciones de esas cenas de gala en el gran comedor que te hacen desear con todas tus fuerzas estar alli  para maravillarse con ese techo que deja ver las estrellas  disfrutando de la presencia de esos fantasmas que se pasean entre los alumnos  No se  Suena muy nono  Lo es  Harry Potter me pone nona  Tierna y blandita Adoro cruzar la frontera que separa la pagina de papel de ese pequeno gran mundo en el que existen personajes como Hagrid y lugares como Hogwarts  The story of Harry Potter and his adventures begins with a black cat  a normal street  and a mysterious atmosphere  From the first page  you are drawn into J K Rowling s world  beckoned deeper into a place of witches  wizards  and muggles The story is an outstanding mystery  with details slowly revealed until some wonderful twists and turns round out the tale  At no stage does the book drag  and the pace towards the end means it s hard to put the book down  It s light reading  easily accessible to anyone with an interest in reading fantasy  or anyone who loves a good story  It s certainly not just a book for children The fact is that the world of Harry Potter should not be approached with caution  You should throw yourself into it headfirst  read as if you ve never devoured a book before  And once you ve finished the series  you ll find yourself wishing that there was one more tale yet to come  ReRead 01 27 2016  Reread 01 22 2015  This book is just as amazing  if not more so  than the first time I read it  I think some of it is just the amount of time I ve spent absolutely in love with this series  and these characters  and these stories  It was wonderful to revisit it  and I loved how many small quirky things I got to read again  some of which I m ashamed to say I totally forgot    I was just planning on reading the first one for my ReRead challenge  what better book to remind you why you started to love reading in the first place   Buuuutttt now that I ve reread this one  I think it s really quite clear there s no way I m going to be able to not read all of them again this year   Just saying First read  15 years ago  in 2000   MIND  BLOWN   Oh this is just a lovely start to a truly wonderful escape where magic is real  witches and wizards attend secondary school and all kinds of ghosties and ghoulies prowl the school halls  I ve had the pleasure of reading this series serval times over but not in many years so it s been a real joy to talk a walk back to Hogwarts  Not to mention this ginormous group read  being sorted into Ravenclaw and meeting a ton of readers wanting to nerd out for a little slice of time  I must also say the additional layer of understanding makes it all that much more fun to uncover the hidden foreshadowing to events no one really could have anticipated  I have one complaint really  a little aggravation I suppose  why the heck is none of the houses purple  Ravenclaw should have been purple and bronze  That just really annoys me  I think that s it  everything else is better than I remember   I don t have much to say about this book due to the fact that it doesn t have many flaws and it is truly entertaining from beginning to end  however  I will share one thing that I thoroughly enjoyed while reading  Throughout most of the story  I didn t quite know where it was going and how different events pertained to the main plot line as some of the little conflicts in the story seemed as though they could be short stories  That to me was the beauty of it  You never know how the small events intertwine with the main events  and that is just one way in which Rowling s writing is genius  The words just seem to glide across the page and in the end the small entertaining stories collide into one brilliant book  I will forever love this series  I haven t read this in years  I found that this was a fabby book  BUT everything seemed to happen so briefly  There was no space for any description  it was all action  That s not a bad thing  but I found that if I accidentally skipped like  one sentence  then I was lost  Mentally face palmed myself because I have not read the series earlier  But wow  I can see why EVERYONE absolutely LOVES this series  Now excuse me while I pick up the next book     Epic start to an epic series Nuff  said   Do I even have to review this  Harry Potter is something I grew up with and every time I reread  it seems to get better  All of the intricacies and details that are important in later books become more apparent and I love these books more with every read I m not going to review this in the usual way  I m more going to review this specific edition  9781408855898  the 2014 edition   I actually really like the cover  I think the characters more suit their descriptions on this compared to the original UK edition that I grew up with  The hardback itself is beautifully decorated and the text size isn t too large  So everyone was all hyped about these Harry Potter books and I simply refused to read them because of all those people going crazy over them  But at some point even I got one in my hand and started reading it  good for me  Absolutely awesome  was my first thought when I finished the first book  I loved Hermoine  and Harry and Ron were also okay  I started wishing I could go to Hogwarts  I asked my grandparents if I could get the second book for a certain holiday here in The Netherlands the moment I finished this book and lucky me I got it  cause after finishing this book I just wanted more  Haven t re read these books in so long  Time to start  Even better the second time    Fantastic  magical extraordinary  beautiful epic  I have to confess that i m not big fan of the fantasy genre  but this book was wow  Everything at this book was so so good  the writing was wonderful  the premise  the plot twist  the story  the world bulding the characters  the mistery   This book deserves all the hype over it  I m glad because i read it  Harry Potter is happiness  Ich bin absolut begeistert   es hat so viel Spass gemacht es zu lesen  Band 2 wartet schon  I have ordered this  I will have it in my hands soon  I m trying really hard to contain my excitement  but I just    Cannot Contain Excitement        I LOVE IT    And i know im late to the party  but im so glad i decided to start this series  Hoping to finish the rest of the series by the end of this year   c   Tahle kniha  tenhle dil    Provazi me celym zivotem  _  I m kicking myself for not reading these AGES AGO  On to the next     No se porque no habia leido antes este libro    Simplemente perfecto  Aventuras  diversion     Y ademas  con la compania de la nueva pagina web Pottermore  leerlo ha sido como estar en el  Recomiendo mucho la lectura con la compania de la pagina web Pottermore  una experiencia que jamas olvidare  Ya tengo ganas de que este disponible el segundo libro en Pottermore para seguir con mi lectura tan extremadamente magica    DRACO DORMIENS NUNQUAM TITILLANDUS  I wish they kept the potions task or logic task in the movie as that is probably my favourite  it really shows how smart Hermione is  I love rereading this and I think around Christmas it is the best time   3 I think I liked it more than the first time  30 01 2016   Review up on my blog https   readingwithnatalia wordpress     I loved this book even more the second time  Im so glad i decided to reread it Its an amazing novel and definitely my favorite series  I loved to go with harry in his adventures all over again  bcs its so fun  I definitely recommend this book if you havent read it yet  which is kinda impossible  Yes  i will be rereading the second book in the series  i just dont know when  Hopefully next month  Absolutely the most beautiful book I own  It was a privilege to experience the world  characters  and story I have loved since I was little with the most extraordinary illustrations  Check out my full review here  http   idioticbookreviews blogspot ca    I finished my first audio book  Also  I m a horribly bad muggle because I haven t read Harry Potter before  I know what you re thinking     How are you JUST NOW reading this book   Well  it didn t really interest me before  but my kids are finally old enough to appreciate Harry s story and the adventures at Hogwarts  So  this was fun to experience together for the first time  The story held our attention and made a long road trip more bearable  We are already onto the second audio book  and they want to listen to it every time we are in the car  I am making them listen to the books before they can watch the movie  so that might have something to do with it  No review needed  the book speaks for itself  This was one of the most well crafted books I ve ever read  the  Harry Potter  universe and its characters are otherworldly and even though I love the movies since I was a child  this was the first time I read this book and it was wonderful  I m so excited to read the other books of the series  So you know how sometimes you had seen a movie of a book and didn t like it  Then  you read the book and you get blown away  that s what happened to me and this book  I read this series for the first time this past summer and it was so much better than the movie version of this book  I am so glad i read it  A true classic  Having not read any of the books before seeing the movies  reading this book filled my head with images from the movie  IMHO  books are always better than the movie  and this is not an exception  Character development was fantastic  Looking forward to reading the next book     First time  This is happening  I adore Jim Dale s narration  I remember this was the first audiobook I ever listened to  and on that first listen it took me awhile to get used to all his different voices  particularly for the female characters   but now it s so comforting to listen to him read this or any of the HP books  First read  sometime in the 1990s  not exactly sure when  but have read it probably 15  times since  I lost count before the last two books came out  and then it was at 10  and I know I ve read it at least 5 times since then  Current read  January 2016 on audiobook by Jim Dale   3 Nao ha palavras para descrever a boa sensacao que e acabar este livro depois de tantos anos  Acho que ainda gostei mais do que da primeira vez que li  mas sinceramente nem me lembro do que achei na altura  foi ha muito tempo   So posso dizer que e mesmo tudo aquilo que dizem que e  Koko kirja oli vain niin taydellinen  3 En lainkaan muistanut tamankin osan olevan nain viihdyttava  Voisin melkein maratoonata kaikki osat nyt heti  mutta pitaa varmaan lukea jotain muuta tahan valiin etten kuluta koko loppu kuukautta Harry Potterien parissa   I honestly don t know why I kept delaying this series so damn much    ITS AMAZING  I loved the ending of this book even though I was already suspecting it  I will definitely continue on with the rest of the books  I have  of course  SUCH high hopes for these books  OMGOSH  I have another series to read Harry Potter is a magical and fun filled adventure  for all ages  with a really cool mail delivery service and so much more  but you already know all that  Don t know why I waited so long to dip into this one  I could probably read this series over and over and not get tired of it  This one isn t my favorite of the series  but I still like it because it s the one that started it all  I still remember reading them for the first time  Such a wonderful series   5 5 Uh  DUHHHH  How can I review this book  I don t think I can Harry Potter holds a forever place in my heart  His story is one of my favorites ever  This re read just reinforced that thought   5   DUH  A trillion stars from me  This story will always make me happy and the illustrations only added to the experience  This series will forever and always be my ultimate favourite  I did it  After growing up on Harry Potter movies  I am delving into the novels  and am thoroughly impressed with Rowling s storytelling techniques  The feels are strong  Duh  it s Harry Potter Re read on 11 11 15  First re read as an  adult  woooo  I listened to the Stephen Fry audiobook  It was brilliant   highly recommend   These books are perfect for all ages  They are entertaining  imaginative  and appropriate  The first one is an absolute classic  and will be read for years  J avais besoins de magie  alors je me suis replonger dans l univers d Harry Potter Meilleure decision depuis longtemps  YASSSSS     Can t wait to read the second book   I m definitely jumping onto this Harry potter roller coaster       I knew I would love this book from the first page  I mean how could you not    Bring on the rest of the series    Ennesima rilettura Quest anno ho intenzione di rileggere tutti i libri  uno al mese  e spero davvero di farcela  D I want the Weasley s to adopt me or marry into the family and run away to Hogwarts  Hufflepuff for the win  Wow what a series  Has there ever been or will there ever be anything like Harry Potter  I highly doubt it  La versione illustrata mi ha fatto amare ancora di piu Harry Potter   Ah  che soddisfazione  jz ynkhh yh sry jh yhw zwd mygdhsht chyz dygh sh dhytm nkhrd w dr khl khyly khwb bwd          shkh shwq  Als im Oktober 2015 der erste Harry Potter Roman Harry Potter und der Stein der Weisen von Joanne K  Rowling als illustrierte Schmuckausgabe in den Handel gekommen ist  war es fur mich eine mehr als einfache Entscheidung  mir dieses Buch anzuschaffen  Ich bin mit den Geschichten um den kleinen Zaubererjungen Harry Potter grossgeworden und ich liebe nach wie vor die Bucher und Filme sehr  Man kann fur Harry Potter  Hogwarts und Co  einfach niemals zu alt sein  So hatte ich das Buch also bereits kurz nach dem offiziellen Erscheinen tatsachlich in den Handen und war von Anfang an total uberwaltigt  Bereits das wundervoll illustrierte neue Cover von Jim Kay lasst erahnen  mit wie viel Liebe Harry Potter und der Stein der Weisen neu aufgelegt worden ist  Bevor man auch nur ein Wort gelesen hat  ist man uber beide Ohren in dieses Buch verliebt  wenn man es nicht ohnehin schon war   Die ersten Seiten beeinhalten eine Skizze von Hogwarts und zahlreiche wundervoll gezeichnete kleine Bildchen  So ist bspw  das Inhaltsverzeichnis mit den fliegenden Schlusseln  welche im weiteren Verlauf der Handlung eine kleine Rolle spielen werden  dekoriert und man ist fasziniert vom hohen Mass an Details  mit denen uns Jim Kay hier verwohnt Nun kann ich nach dem ersten Schwarmen auch endlich zur eigentlichen Geschichte kommen  Harry Potter und der Stein der Weisen handelt  so wie alle weiteren Romane  vom Zauberer Harry Potter  welcher zusammen mit seinen besten Freunden Hermine Granger und Ronald Weasley die magische Schule fur Hexerei und Zauberei Hogwarts besucht  Doch weiss Harry zunachst gar nicht  dass er ein Zauberer ist  Aufgewachsen ist er namlich bei seinen nachsten Verwandten  den Dursleys  weit ab von allem  was acuh nur ansatzweise magisch zu sein scheint  Harry Potter verlor in seiner fruhsten Kindheit seine Eltern bei einem Autounfall und musste aus diesem Grund bei den Dursleys aufwachsen  Diese konnten aber nie so richtig etwas mit Harry anfangen und behandelten ihn dementsprechend auch  Er wohnte in einem Schrank unter der Treppe  musste sich mit abgetragenen und alten Klamotten seines Neffen Dudley zufrieden geben und fuhrte ansonsten insgesamt auch ein sehr unscheinbares Leben  Doch das alles anderte sich schlagartig zu seinem 11 Geburtstag an welchem sich herausstellte  dass es tatsachlich so etwas wie Zauberei gibt und er an der Zaubererschule Hogwarts aufgenommen worden ist und er in der Zaubererwelt eine echte Beruhmtheit ist  In Hogwarts erlebt er letztendlich ein sehr spannendes Jahr  gewinnt neue Freunde und muss sich einer dunklen Bedrohung stellen  die ausgestorben geglaubt war  Eine packende Geschichte nimmt ihren Anfang In dieser illustrierten Schmuckausgabe von Harry Potter und der Stein der Weisen gelingt dabei eine einzigartig gelungene Kombination  Joanne K  Rowling kann auf ganzer Linie mit einem sehr mitreissenden Erzahlstil von Anfang an an die Seiten fesseln und entfuhrt uns durch ihren sehr bildlichen Erzahlstil in die magische Welt von Harry Potter  aus welcher man gar nicht mehr zuruck in die Realitat kehren mochte  Die tollen Beschreibungen und Handlungsstrange werden dabei insgesamt durchgehend wundervoll illustriert von Jim Kay dargestellt  wo ein absolut stimmiges Gesamtpacket entsteht  Eine einzigartige Geschichte  die bis heute ihres Gleichen sucht gepaart mit dem absolut genialen kunstlerischen Talent von Jim Kay  Ich habe selten so ein fantastisches Buch in Handen halten konnen und in Zukunft werde ich mit Sicherheit wieder einen Blick hinein werfen und die Geschichte von Harry Potter immer und immer wieder lesen  Grossartig Fazit Magisch  mitreissend  wundervoll erzahlt und toll illustriert  Hier stimmt von Anfang an alles Quirrell you sneaky bastard   I have never read a book like this in my whole life  Full of imagination  love  friendship  loyalty I didn t want to read it very fast because I wanted to enjoy every single moment of it  J K Rowling has me completely in love with this book and I m looking forward to reading her books It was filled with humor  it made me laugh most of the time  Friendship and love  Snape was trying to save me Of course  said Quirrel coolly  Why do you think he wanted to referee your next match  He was trying to make sure I didn t do it again  I loved Snape mostof all  and Hermione and Harry of course And then Dumbledore   Your mother died to save you  If there is one thing Voldemort cannot understand  it is love  He didn t realize that love as powerful as your mother s for you leaves its own dark  Not a scar  no visible sign      to have been loved so deeply   even though the person who loved us is gone  will give us some protection forever  It is in your very skin  Quirrel  full of hatred  greed  and ambition  sharing his soul with Voldemort  could not touch you for this reason  It was agony to touch a person marked by something so good   Albus DumbledoreAnd finally the best quote  To the well organized mind death is but the next adeventure   Pocas sagas hay en el mundo de la literatura tan conocidas como Harry Potter  Y yo sin leerla    tenia que poner remedio  Empece el libro algo esceptico  porque ni siquiera habia visto las peliculas   en serio  aunque parezca imposible es cierto    y la imagen que tenia de Harry en mi cabeza era algo mala   en parte por eso nunca le habia dado una oportunidad   pero tambien contrastaba con cantidad de gente que conozco  de multiples edades  para quienes tanto las sagas literarias como cinematograficas son de sus favoritas  Quiza el equivocado debia ser yo    y en efecto Este libro me ha traido multitud de emociones  todo el mundo sabemos  aunque sea por encima  de que tratan estos libros  pero si no los has leido no tienes ni idea de que sucede en realidad  como me pasaba a mi  Es un libro super entretenido  que te hace sentir de la peor forma posible cuando ves como tratan al pobre Harry   su familia    y que drasticamente tambien te saca sonrisas cuando  de forma directa o indirecta  el chaval puede cobrarse una especie de venganza que pone en evidencia a esos pequenos hijos de Satan que tuvo la mala suerte de tener como parientes mas proximos La moraleja que se puede sacar de este libro es muy importante y ayudara a muchos ninos a enfrentar sus problemas con grandes dosis de positivismo  y es que por muy mal que te encuentres en un sitio  aunque te sientas fuera de lugar y te haga sentir terriblemente mal  seguro que hay otro sitio donde puedes ir  probablemente con una gente totalmente diferente  donde no solo tendras cabida y te sentiras como uno mas  sino que quiza hasta puedas descubrir cualidades tuyas que hasta ese momento desconocias y podrias llegar a destacar sobre el resto  Por que no lo habre leido antes  It s been two and a half years since I last re read the entire series  the longest gap there s been by far  There isn t a thing I d forgotten though  However  each time I read the series I pick up on little tidbits of information that for some reason had escaped my notice  This time round was the wizard version of the christmas crackers  Damn they re awesome My love for HP will never die  The series has been with me for 14 years  and has brought me through and taught me so much  I d forgotten how much I missed this world  and I m glad I m immersed in it again  The interesting thing about this first book is that it s so obviously written for children whereas the later ones are not  I think that when JKR wrote this book  she didn t know in her head a lot of things that were still going to take place in the series  as I feel is evident by the small details mentioned only in the first one and then never again  But still  it s fascinating  Holla at me if you get it  If you love Harry Potter  we re practically already best friends  P It sure is good to be back at Hogwarts So  I m re reading this series now  and it s been so long since I last read this first book  probably about 6 years    Nonetheless  I was reminded of the countless hours spent during summer nights in my cool basement  wrapped comfortably underneath my bedsheets while reading and re reading this book  In other words  RELIVIN  THE GLORY DAYS    Here are a few thoughts as to why this book series is one of my favorites of all time 1  I don t know how she did it  but the world Jo created here is so  insert the best appropriate adjective here   It s nearly impossible to describe how good this story is  from the contrasts between the  muggle  and  wizarding  worlds  to the underlying themes of all kinds of relationships built on love  good vs evil  and even to the entire diction of the Harry Potter books  Seriously  I m not surprised why there is an entire WIKIPEDIA INDEX page solely devoted for Harry Potter  She makes the Bible look like a f cking children s picture book    Well  more or less    2  Looking back in hindsight  I never really realized how well planned  developed  and executed this entire series was until now  Seriously  Rowling had characters and backstories mentioned in this first book that would later on tie in to the rest of the story 4  5  or 6 books from now  For example  Sirius Black was mentioned in the first 5 pages of this book  Did ANYONE read P O A  and remember that he had a brief cameo in this book when Harry was a baby  Nope  But it was always there  and that s the beauty of these books  I read this book and knew certain things that would later unfold and be revealed to us and Harry when the time came 3  So many times I find myself thinking   What if Rowling had never written this book  and what if Harry Potter was nothing but an idea in her mind but not on paper   I can t help but to imagine that our literary world would not have been what it is today  and it is a crazy thing to imagine  as many of our most cherished and favorited authors of today have  in some way  shape  or form  been directly touched by these 7 books  But one thing is for certain  I  along with many kids  teens  adults  and readers of all ages  would sure as hell not be here if it weren t for HP  Harry Potter e e sera sempre um marco na minha vida  Desde a adolescencia que acompanho as aventuras do rapaz feiticeiro e claro  que esta edicao com ilustracoes de Jim Kay nao podia faltar na minha coleccao As ilustracoes fabulosas transportaram me outra vez para Hogwarts com uma facilidade tremenda  Tem um traco lindissimo e uma tri dimensionalidade genial para algo desenhado em apenas duas dimensoes As palavras de J K  Rowling continuam intemporais e agora  estao devidamente embelezadas  E uma edicao maravilhosa que faz com a leitura seja ainda mais agradavel  D  3 Gryffindor Pride  p  3 Stephen Fry  Stephen Fry  Stephen Fry   3 listened to the british version of the audiobook What did this book mean to me after 14 years of my first reading it   I had literally goose bumps when Harry first met Draco at Olivander s  LITERALLY  I had the feeling that after all these years I actually found the breaking point  the ultimate fate twister  the exact moment  when all our future ways were defined  Crazy  huh   At the train to Hogwarts when Harry could buy something with his own money for the first time in his life  he was happy because he had someone to share it with  SHARE   When Harry  Ron and Hermione became friends   it was actually the first time Hermione lied ever  Guess some people are worth lying for   especially when they saved you from the angry troll previously  It really is book of friendship and courage and love  love  love  insert the tune from the Love actually movie   Dopo anni e anni finalmente mi sono decisa anche io  E  ufficiale  E ora mi chiedo    Perche ho aspettato tanto  Ho visto i film un infinita di volte ma mai mi ero soffermata per leggere anche i libri  Trovo la Rowling fantastica  Il primo capitolo di questa saga e stupendo  scritto in modo che possa attrarre sia i bambini che gli adulto  Ogni personaggio ha una propria sfaccettatura che si evince immediatamente dalle prime pagine  Il maghetto piu famoso di tutti i tempi e sopravvissuto  Harry non e un supereroe ma e un bambino qualunque che scopre di essere famoso  e un mondo a lui completamente sconosciuto  la magia  Adoro come l autrice ha descritto i luoghi  i personaggi senza mai e poi mai cadere nel banale  Ma soprattutto adoro l impronta dell amicizia che viene data  Credo che sara un libro che rileggero ancora e ancora non appena finiro tutta la saga  Ora il secondo capitolo mi aspetta   I feel like I remembered very little about this book as it is a million times better than I could possibly have imagined it would be upon re read  Funny  imaginative and quite literally  magical  this has just cemented it s status as one of my all time favourite books I m so excited about reading the others  Neuveritelny pribeh 8  Tato kniha je zaciatok mojho knihomolstva  Je to pre mna srdcovka a som schopna citat to dokola stale znova  1  diel serie ma krasne vykresleny svet  tvory  vztahy  kuzla  skolu a celkove magicke prostredie  Nedokazala som sa od knihy odtrhnut a s

my reread  What if it wasn t as magical as I remembered it being  Well  I need not have worried  It was as incredible as I remember it being  And funnier too  Excited to keep on rereading the series  I finished this book last night  Just forgot to update    This  Was  AMAZING  what was I waiting for all these years     I totally missed out on A LOT of fun     can t wait to start the 2nd book     Begadang semaleman   Sensasinya masih sama  Masih takjub  Ditambah lagi ilustrasinya keren banget       Catatan  beli versi bahasa Indonesia nya karena lebih murah Harry Potter  What can I say I honestly don t want to open THAT door because I ll be bawling like crazyI miss Harry Potter  3 I need to get over this fear I have and reread the books I m afraid of that empty feeling I get when I

to reread it with this edition  At first I was hesitant about the illustrations when this book was first announced  but once I held the copy in my hands I realized just how much I actually loved and appreciated all the illustrations  Right now I just want to go back and reread the entire series all over again  I can t wait till next year when The Chamber of Secrets is released  D  h n dh     wd

lktb  wstshkrny ywm m  l  hdhh lnSyH    I never ever thought I would read Harry Potter but much to my surprise I did read and even enjoyed it immensely  I had my own reasons for not reading this book much sooner   Firstly  I thought this book is only for children   Secondly  the genre  fantasy  is something I haven t enjoyed reading even though I have tried some books before   Thirdly  always the much hyped book has turned out be sour in my experience   Yet I dared to read this book because it was written by J K Rowling I had previously enjoyed her writing in The Casual Vacancy and The Cuckoo s Calling though both were very different from each other still I had liked both   so I wanted to take a chance with Harry Potter as well and it turned out to be a great one  I ve enjoyed everything about this book be it the fantasy world  the story  the characterization and all those magic at Hogwarts  Above all what I loved the most is Rowlings s writing  I am really looking forward to continue with the series   Que puedo decir de Harry Potter que no haya dicho ya 9845793867394856394 veces y que otras personas no hayan dicho  MUCHO  Siempre tengo algo que decir  Siempre  Nunca me aburro  nunca pienso  bueno  tal vez deberia dejar de hablar tanto de Harry Potter   Nope  Tal vez aburro a la gente que me escucha o lee pero da igual porque  bueno  siempre puedo volver y vivir de nuevo mi historia favorita una y otra vez y otra y otra vez Esta relectura es especial para mi porque es la primera vez desde que lei los libros siendo nina adolescente que volvere a leer toda la saga completa y en orden  El ano pasado mi abuelita me regalo de nuevo el primer libro en espanol  ella me lo regalo cuando cumpli once anos pero lo preste y nunca me lo devolvieron   luego en Navidad una tia me regalo la edicion ilustrada y despues los Reyes Magos  aka mi mama o la persona mas cool del mundo  me trajeron el box set en ingles con unas nuevas portadas muy padres  Asi que de entre esas tres opciones decidi leerlo en ingles e ir haciendo anotaciones en una libreta Asi que esto no es una resena sobre el primer libro  son esas anotaciones sobre todas las cosas que pense recorde descubri al volver a leer el primer libro y por lo tanto hablare de cosas que pasan en el resto de la saga  Asi que hay SPOILERS  muchos Los Dursley y como Harry llega con ellos Lo primero que pense leyendo el primer capitulo fue     como pude enamorarme inmediatamente de una historia que comienza describiendo a gente taaaan aburrida  J K  se las ingenia para meter algunos elementos que te causan la suficiente curiosidad para seguir leyendo a pesar de que un senor que vende taladros  su esposa chismosa y su hijo malcriado son las primeras personas que conocemos  Un gato leyendo un mapa  gente vestida de forma rara  lechuzas volando por todo Londres    todos esos detalles son los que te hacen sguir  En esa misma parte descubri que J K  tiene algun problema con los gordos y feos porque en la descripcion que hace de los Dursley hace mucho hincapie en su fisico  pienso ahora en como describe a Hermione de la que solo se nombran el pelo y los dientes  o en Ron y su nariz larga sin que eso diga nada de su forma de ser  relacionando esas caracteristicas fisicas  desagradables  a cosas horribles de su personalidad  como el cuellote de Petunia para espiar a los vecinos  por ejemplo  Harry con los Dursley De nuevo  que horribles son los Dursley  Teniendo un cuarto extra tenian a su sobrino durmiendo bajo las escaleras  le daban puras cosas usadas  eran groseros  se reian de el  Dudley lo golpeaba  no le decian nada sobre sus padres  siempre que salian lo dejaban solo    Al leer de nuevo todo esto creo que deja de molestarme un poco que en Hogwarts Harry sea tan consentido No recordaba que a Harry le vuelve a crecer el pelo cuando se lo cortan ni el incidente de su escuela y el techo  De hecho me parece muy raro leer y recordar que durante diez anos no solo vivio con los Dursley sino que ademas fue a la escuela y conocio a otras personas y estudio matematicas  ingles  geografia  etc  Con el incidente de la serpiente pense que quiza en ese momento a J K  no se le habia ocurrido lo del parsel   o si  Porque  no se  nunca veo que una serpiente vuelva a ser tan amistosa o que vuelva a responderle  Creo que lo de hablar su idioma en los siguientes libros es mas como     controlarlas   y eso no es lo que pasa con esta  Pero igual puede ser porque fue criada en cautiverio y entonces era     buena  No se  pero creo que  si ya tenia la idea  no estaba muy clara  Como es que Dumbledore sabia que Harry vivia en la alacena bajo las escaleras y nunca hizo nada  La carta dice exactamente eso  de hecho las siguientes cartas dicen  el cuarto mas pequeno  cuando ya habian pasado a Harry al segundo cuarto de Dudley   Esta bien que no quisiera que supiera nada del mundo magico y que creciera lejos de la fama  pero una carta o una visita rapida a sus tios no hubiera estado mal  Creo que a veces  bueno  muchas veces  me da la impresion de que a Dumbledore no le importaba tanto Harry y que lo veia mas como un arma  justo como se da a entender despues de que muere y nos enteramos de muchos de sus secretos  Pero obvio tambien es porque J K  queria hacer mucho mas dramatico el maltrato de Harry y hacernos sentir mal por el y Dumbledore siempre fue misterioso y todo eso  Me gusta mas cuando Harry usa las palabras para dejar con cara de menso a Dudley sin que pensemos  pobrecito nino huerfano   y mas bien es el chico pequeno y tratado injustamente pero que tiene un gran sentido del humor  es listo y sabe defenderse de su primo abusivo   Hagrid aparece JJusto aqui empieza mi parte favorita  Hagrid aparece  le cuenta la verdad a Harry y LA MAGIA COMIENZA  Bueh  y de nuevo pasa algo que nos recuerda la gordofobia de J K   ya no es solo el narrador  ahora un personaje ADULTO el que insulta a un NINO haciendo mencion de su gordura y  para desquitarse de Vernon por decirle chiflado a Dumbledore  le pone una cola de cerdo  por gordo  a su hijo que habia estado callado todo el tiempo  en la pelicula Dudley se empieza a comer el pastel de Harry pero en el libro eso no pasa   Me sorprende la facilidad con la que Harry cree todo lo que Hagrid le esta diciendo  O sea  si  hace preguntas y piensa que no puede ser un mago  pero al final se va con el por la manana y ahora me parece que todo pasa muy rapido y facil  pero es un libro para ninos y obviamente a los once anos me parecia muy logico que si un gigante llega a decirte que tienes un lugar en una escuela de magia te vayas con el sin mayor problema  Mundo magico  yaaaay Soy muy feliz cuando Harry llega con Hagrid al Caldero Chorreante  muuuuy feliz  Ese lugar es una de mis cosas favoritas  Me encanta pensar que en alguna calle de cualquier ciudad puede haber un bar que sea la puerta de entrada a algo tan magico  Y pasa una cosa hermosa  Harry se da cuenta por primera vez de que hay personas que sienten admiracion y respeto por el  O por lo menos que todos conocen su nombre  Lloro un poco cuando le dicen  welcome back   porque si     por fin vuelve a casa  a su mundo  con gente que no lo tratara como si fuera la persona mas desagradable en el universo  El Callejon Diagon es como mi casa  despues de Hogwarts   Muchas veces he vuelto a releer esa parte solo para imaginarme ahi  comprando calderos  dulces  telescopios  uniforme  varita    pienso en las tiendas descritas en el libro y las imagenes que tengo de las peliculas  junto con la musica  y el corazon me late mas rapido por la emocion  Tambien me gusta que el primer encuentro de Harry y Draco sea ahi y que Draco parezca tan    no se  insoportable pero al mismo tiempo amistoso  como muy desesperado por tener un conocido en Hogwarts antes de llegar  Creo que Draco es uno de los personajes que mas me gustan porque aunque es muy desagradable tambien creo que es de los mas complejos  y como no con unos papas y una tia mortifagos que se creen superiores al resto del mundo  muggle y magico incluidos   Random fact  el senor Ollivander ademas de estar medio loco es la primera persona en decirle a Harry que tiene los ojos de Lily  Y no recordaba que Harry regresa a casa de los Dursley por un mes mas y que le tienen que quitar la cola de Dudley con un procedimiento quirurgico lo cual me parece increible y estupido   Magia  tipo malvado que asesina gente con rayos verdes  escuela de hechiceria  Lo creo   Llevar a un nino de once anos al hospital para que le quiten una colita de cerdo  WAAT Anden 9 y 3 4 y HOGWARTS  Amo a los gemelos  son lo maximo   3 Amo a Ron   3Amo a Neville   3Amo a Hermione porque es una sabelotodo pero me recuerda a mi en la primaria  o a mi en la actualidad    3 Amo todo  maestros  alumnos  clases  espacios  criaturas magicas  comida  salones  fantasmas  cuadros  En serio  amo cada cosa que pasa en la escuela aunque si lo analizo es muy extrano y no porque exista un hechizo para abrir puertas o porque una maestra se convierta en gato o porque los alumnos estudien las 12 propiedades de la sangre de dragon  por cierto   por que es tan horrible beber sangre de unicornio pero esta ok usar todas las partes de un dragon o tenerlos como esclavos cuidando un banco  J K    sino porque no puedo creer muchas de las cosas que pasan en la trama  como que los adultos sean taaaaaaan irresponsables  a veces peor que los tios de Harry  o que entre Harry y Draco surja una rivalidad propia de un par de ancianos que se han odiado durante cien anos  Por otro lado  otras cosas que en solitario parecen increibles tienen todo el sentido del mundo al releer el libro  como que Harry  Ron y Hermione se hayan visto involucrados en el asunto del trol  No fue que Harry pensara  yo salvare el mundo   como recordaba  fue algo mas bien accidental y casi un milagro que lograran deshacerse de ese monstruo enorme  Lo que si me parece increible siempre es que para un castillo tan grande y con tantos ninos y adolescentes solo exista una persona  y una gata  que estan pendientes por la noche de si alguien esta fuera de la cama  o que ningun adulto se de cuenta de que Hagrid tiene un dragon en su casa   Snape  McGonagall  alguien    o que decidan que un gran castigo para encontrar a alguien en los pasillos es ir al bosque PROHIBIDO lleno de criaturas que podrian matarte  En el bosque pasa algo que no recordaba para nada  algo con los centauros mucho mas detallado de lo que pasa en la pelicula  y que me hizo pensar en la profecia y la batalla final  Y eso es lo que pasa con esas situaciones casi absurdas  que primero piensas que es una tonteria pero al final te engancha y te parece que si tiene sentido y que estuvo muy padre y que bueno que Harry fue al bosque  Otra cosa padre de Hogwarts en el quidditch  me gusta mucho que le emocione tanto a todos  incluso a McGonagall que creo que nunca sonrie  hablando de ella  en algun momento Hagrid le da un beso en la mejilla y eso me dio mucha risa   Lo que me pone un poco de malas es que Harry resulte ser una estrella y que sin nunca haber tocado una escoba vuele como si lo hubiera hecho toda la vida  Lo entendi un poco mejor cuando Harry dice que por fin tiene algo de que sentirse orgulloso y creo que por eso pasa asi  pero me sigue pareciendo     no se  injusto  Hermione se esfuerza muchisimo  estudia dia y noche  los ayuda a ellos a estudiar  gracias a ella pasan de ano siempre   ademas de ir siempre a pelear contra Voldemort  y me molesta que a Harry todo le salga bien como por arte de   plop   magia  excepto la parte en que su familia fue asesinada por un mago malvado que tambien lo quiere asesinar a el  Dice MariaJose  que tambien esta releyendo la saga y tiene un blog dedicado a eso  que uno de sus problemas es que Harry no hace casi ninguna pregunta sobre su familia en este libro pero que de inmediato se obsesiona con la piedra filosofal y cree que el debe salvar a todos de Snape y Voldemort  y justo eso tambien es  o era  un problema para mi pero creo que al final mi teoria es que Harry no hace preguntas porque por primera vez es feliz y tiene amigos y cosas interesantes y quiza hacer preguntas sobre sus papas  al saber que fueron asesinados  seria algo muy doloroso  pero los tiene tan presentes que es a ellos a quienes ve en el espejo de Erised  y a otros familiares que nunca vuelven a aparecer como sus abuelos   En alguna parte Harry intenta ya no meterse en donde no lo llaman  pero claro   el no persigue a los problemas  los problemas lo persiguen a el   pero en la historia tiene mucho sentido porque el problema es siempre el tipo que lo quiere matar  El hombre con dos caras Por todo eso al final ya me parece obvio y hasta necesario que Harry  Ron y Hermione decidan ir a resolver el misterio del ladron de la piedra  porque los adultos irresponsables no piensan hacer nada   McGonagall habra llamado de alguna forma a Dumbledore y por eso el volvio    y el mas interesado es Harry porque no tiene familia por culpa de ese villano y tiene pesadillas y tiene una cicatriz que llevara de por vida  por supuesto no quiere que regrese  Me gusto mucho el trabajo en equipo de los tres amigos y recordar que desde el principio ganan las batallas estando juntos y cada uno haciendo algo importante  incluso Ron que siempre se sintio menos pero aqui es la estrella del ajedrez  Nomine mentalmente a Voldemort cabeza como el peor Voldemort de toda la saga y llore MUCHO con las cosas que Dumbledore le dice a Harry en la enfermeria  A pesar de todo  de su silencio y de dejar que unos ninos se enfrenten una y otra vez a un monton de peligros  Dumbledore sigue siendo una de mis personas favoritas y las cosas que dice siempre me llegan al corazon Fue increible volver a leer este libro sabiendo que leere los demas y si  volver a Harry Potter es como volver a casa despues de unas vacaciones largas o abrazar a un grupo de amigos que hace tiempo no veias  No importa que hagamos referencias o regresemos a algunas frases  leer los libros es una cosa muy distinta  Es    magia  amigos y recuerdos  Y eso siempre sera lo mejor de esta historia  Non so neanche da che parte cominciare  sull influenza che Harry Potter ha avuto su di me  Credo che siano state spese abbastanza parole  da cosi tanta gente che una mia recensione non possa servire piu di tanto  E so di non essere l unica a pensarla cosi  perche sono innumerevoli le recensione che iniziano esattamente come questa  Lascio che siano persone molto piu eloquenti a cercare di descrive cosa abbia significato e ancora significhi questa saga per me e per innumerevoli miei coetanei e non  Ma  So di voler dire almeno due cose 1  Questa edizione e superlativa  Non mi ricordo chi per primo ho sentito dire che leggere HP in questo nuovo formato e come rileggerlo per la prima volta  ma sono d accordo  Mi sono sentita di nuovo bambina a sfogliare le pagine senza considerare quello che so gia accadra nei prossimi libri 2  Altro motivo per cui mi sembra di avere di nuovo sei anni o giu di li  voglio il prossimo    Sul serio  li avro letti tutti quanti almeno tre volte  ma ora come ora non vedo l ora che esca il secondo  e so che sara cosi ogni volta che avro finito di leggere uno dei volumi E poi  c e un modo migliore di iniziare l anno che con la lettura di HP  Ovviamente no   First read  Jan 12  2013Reread  July 11  2014   and so it was that this amazing story began  Reread in August 2015I have to say it has been great to relive the journey once again  There are moments worth going through  The early days are filled with youth s decision making  innocence ness  p  the getting to know you  s   and every bit of events that contribute to the greater build up which awaits at the end  read 01 08 2016  The illustrations really added something to the book  Looking forward to the release of the other illustrated editions of the series read 07 20 2011  Lange her  dass ich es zum letzten Mal gelesen habe   ich hab anscheinend einiges vergessen  also gut  dass ich es nun mal wieder gelesen habe     After all these years  I finally did it  I read Harry Potter  I ignored all of the hype going into it  and loved it  Most definitely exceeded expectation  Marathoning this whole series  in between AP Literature required books  of course   Go Gryffindor  Can I just say I love the cover art for this edition  and the series as a whole  SO MUCH COVER LOVE  And it s nice to read the books the way JKR originally wrote them  with all the Britishisms and nevermind what we dumb Americans will or won t understand    What to say about something so popular and something that is loved by every one of all ages  This series and the characters are epic  No one in this world can dislike this book or this series  Re read and I fell in love with it even more     3 I just grow more and more in love with Harry Potter with every reread  I need to re read these books to give an accurate rating  I ll give it a five stars as default  since this is a beloved series of my childhood Edit  currently re reading    Edit  still awesome  I got warm fuzzies reading this  5th reread  still 5 star worthyReading the illustrated copy was such a magical experience  It almost felt like reading it for the first time  I can t wait for the rest of the books to become illustrated  This book is so special to me and I will never tire of it Real life thoughts  https   readsandramblings wordpress c    Releerlo en ingles ha sido la mejor experiencia del mundo y todo gana muchisimo en su idioma original  He salido aun mas enamorada de la historia  si es que eso era posible  Starting on November 18th  I ve been sorted into Gryffindor  Looking forward to discussing with my Gryff homies  This will be my fourth reread of this series  So I may have started a little early on Potter Month but this is my first time reading Harry Potter and I can say I love this book and I get how it began the whole    saga Harry is such a relatable character  This book really describes how much he was bullied as well as how brave he already was before he went to Hogwarts and that was a backstory I really connected too There were somethings in the bookI do wish to know more about but I believe it will be answered in the next book  For example Why did Voldemort come to kill Harry Potter when he was a baby  It seems peculiar that the only reason his parents died was simply to protect there baby when I thought it was because they simply fought against him  This is the disconnect from the movie and book With that said I look forward to rediscovering Harry Potter  It really is like a new story to me  I love reading this book with my daughter  Rowling s world masterfully matches the limitless imagination of a child  Although this was a reread  I found myself smiling at various moments because I HAVE MISSED HOGWARTS SO MUCH  I had so much fun re reading this and love the illustrated edition  beautiful and magical   Why did I wait so long to read this      I can t rate this book less than 5 stars  J K  Rowling is such a great storyteller   22 11 2015This is the first time I ve read the illustrated edition  obviously  but I m copying my review from the standard edition anyway because it s still relevant  First things first  the art in this is STUNNING  It shows the emotion and movement in so many of the scenes perfectly   Harry s joy when he and Hagrid are taking the boat back to the mainland and away from the Dursleys  the chaos of Platform 9 3 4  Harry s desperation and ecstasy over seeing his parents in the Mirror of Erised  Snape s loathing  the speed of Quidditch  That said  it makes me ever so slightly disappointed that Kay chose to make all three of the Golden Trio white  Because sure  Ron has to be white  He s ginger  and we re constantly told that he s stupidly pale or green or grey  But Harry and Hermione  There s nothing in there to say that either of them are white  And it actually makes more sense if they re not  given their hair  My headcanon says Harry s black and Hermione s Indian  So I would have LOVED to see an artist go  Guess what  Let s do something a little different here   ANYWAY  Because of the layout of this and wanting to savour the illustrations  this was a slower read than Philosopher s Stone usually is  And as a result  the book gave me a crapton of feels  Why  Because reading it slowly made it incredibly obvious just how abusive the Dursleys are towards Harry  and how fucked up Harry s childhood has been  I mean  he lives in a cupboard full of spiders  He s never been to the zoo  He has to do the cooking and the cleaning  He thinks it s generous that they give him 50p for Christmas  He s never gotten a birthday present or a Christmas present  and he doesn t have any friends until he goes to Hogwarts  He s never even seen a picture of his parents  UNCLE VERNON DRIVES HIM TO KINGS CROSS ON 1 SEPTEMBER  POINTS OUT THAT THERE S NO PLATFORM 9 3 4 AND FUCKING LEAVES HIM THERE  Obviously  I ve noticed all these things in the past  but something about the combination of the layout and the art really hammered it home for me and gave me seven million feelings and the desire to give this ELEVEN YEAR OLD KID a hug  It s no wonder Molly Weasley mothers him so much  Now if you ll excuse me  I m going to go and cry over a fictional kid  4 5 2014It staggers me that no matter how many times I read these books  I still find new things every time  Surely  after sixteen rereads  I shouldn t be surprised by anything  And yet  I am  This time around  Harry s nerves about being Sorted   He d never been more nervous  never  not even when he d had to take a school report home to the Dursleys saying that he d somehow turned his teacher s wig blue    p  86 26 11 2012I first read Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone on a plane from London to Singapore in 1998  My mum handed it and Chamber of Secrets to me as I was boarding the plane  and told me to read them and let me know what she thought when she got back to Australia the following week  I read both books straight through without stopping  I read through dinner  and I kept reading when they dimmed the lights so everyone could go to sleep  Fourteen years later  it still has the same power over me  I love every second of it  It may not be a perfect book from a critical point of view  But to me  as a reader  It s flawless  This book is so beautiful  it takes my breath away   I flew through this book  with a broomstick of course   First read  Early 2000s Reread  December 2015 Do I even have to say anything      I Love this book  JKRowling is awesome  J K  Rowlins  Harry Potter  Reihe ist wohl eines der besten und erfolgreichsten Fantasy Jugendbuch Reihen  die es auf dem Markt gibt  Mit ihrem Reihenauftakt  Harry Potter und der Stein der Weisen  hat J K  Rowling bereits nach wenigen Kapiteln gezeigt  dass in ihr eine wahre  brillante  grandiose Kunstlerin der Magie und der Worte steckt  Ich brauche euch wohl nicht mehr zu verraten  dass ein riesengrosser Harry Potter Fan bin  Fur mich gibt es einfach keine bessere Fantasy Reihe   Harry Potter  hat mich durch meine Kindheit begleitet  es war sogar das erste Buch  welches ich nach Kinderbuchern  verschlungen habe  Ich bin gleich Feuer und Flamme fur den jungen Helden  damals in meinem Alter  gewesen und bin es auch heute noch  Wer in die Abendteuer von Harry Potter noch nicht eingetaucht und verliebt ist  der sollte dies ganz schnell nach holen Mittlerweile gibt es einfach wahnsinnig viele Harry Potter Fanartikel  Merchandising  eben alles was das Herzchen der Fans hoher schlagen lasst  Und jetzt hat der Carlsen Verlag mit der illustrierten Ausgabe des ersten Harry Potter Teils      und der Stein der Weisen   aus der Zeichenfeder von Jim Kay  ein weitere Must Have fur alle Harry Potter Fans auf den Markt gebracht  Dieses wunderschone  fantastische  perfekte Buch MUSS man einfach erlebt haben  Die grandiosen Illustrationen unterstreichen die magischen Worte und die herzergreifenden Szenen  in die man sowieso bereits verliebt ist  noch mehr  Aber auch fur Nicht Harry Potter Leser ist dieses Buch der perfekte Einstieg in die Reihe  Die Zeichnungen sind einfach der Knaller und die Aufmachung ist grandios  Den Namen  Schmuckausgabe  hat sich Jim Kay mit seinem Zauberkunstwerk wahrhaftig verdient  Ich konnte nun noch stundenlang uber dieses Kunstwerk von Buch schwarmen  aber kauft es einfach selbst  lasst euch verzaubern und uberzeugen und verschlingt und liebt es genauso wie ich  Dieses Buch gehort einfach in jedes Buchregal  Anoche pase por mi estanteria buscando algo nuevo para leer y termine agarrando este libro otra vez  Re leer Harry Potter es como regresar a casa  Siempre me sorprende darme cuenta que no importa cuantas veces lo lea  el sentimiento es siempre el mismo  Ya que este es un comentario un tanto nostalgico empezare diciendo que lo que mas me gusto  como siempre  fue Ron  Jamas entendere porque las peliculas fueron tan despectivas con el porque es hilarante  tiene un ingenio tan agudo y una facilidad para aplacar la tension en el ambiente que logra sacarme sonrisas en cada aparicion  Por otro lado  Malfoy es tan despreciablemente maligno que me encanta  Harry Potter y la piedra filosofal es por mucho mi favorito de la saga por su dulzura  Hay una inocencia patente en sus personajes  asi como en las breves y temblorosas lineas que construyen la historia  Rowling es una de las pocas escritoras que puede llegarle al lector sin la necesidad de escribir excelente  sus personajes son todo lo que necesita el libro para brillar  Si hay un punto resaltante en este libro es el primer encuentro que tenemos de ellos porque instantaneamente se imprimen en el corazon  Gorgeous   Harry wished he had about eight more eyes  The first time I read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone  I was about twelve years old   at that time  I was pretty late to the game with the Harry Potter mania    but that didn t lessen my adoration for these books  Since then  I ve probably re read the entire series at least ten times  I know everyone says this  but I truly feel like I get something different from the series each time I read it Although I didn t read the series until I was a pre teen  I have been an avid reader since I was four years old  Even now  close to my twenty first birthday  I still get chills whenever I pick up a brand new book  Delving into a fictitious world sends me back to when I was a little kid  excited to be reading alongside her mother  Cozying up under a blanket with this new illustrated edition gave me that same sense of wonder that I had when I was younger  even the sheer size of this edition made me feel like I was a tiny girl again  curled up with a massive storybook   It made me forget that I m a college student now with responsibilities and tasks that need to get done  J K  Rowling s beautiful writing didn t really need a revamp  but Jim Kay s illustrations did an amazing job nonetheless Do you remember how excited you were when you first read Harry Potter  How for years you ve longed to experience that feeling again  You can now  with this new illustrated edition  Like the above quote  I felt like I  too  needed about eight more eyes  just to fully take in all of the beautiful artwork So thank you  Jim Kay  for letting me relive my childhood all over again   even for just a short while  I decided not to bother rating these books during my re read because everyone has either read or heard of Harry Potter and I don t think a review will make any difference  Instead  I decided to compare each book to the movie  because I feel like that ll be helpful to people who haven t read the books in a long time  or ever  and also helpful to me when watching the movies in the future  The Dursley s are blonde  Not that this makes any difference because the movies are SO well cast  but I did not remember this  I really liked reading about WHY Harry is going to the Zoo in the beginning  It s something in the movie that doesn t really make sense  Why would they invite the kid they hate to the zoo  Why does his cupboard lock in the movie  It doesn t lock in the book and locking it makes them seem barbaric  Another weird thing that isn t really necessary  In the movie there s a scene near the end where Harry says  Hagrid s always wanted a dragon  Told me so the first time I ever met him   I like that in the book Hagrid actually says that since in the movie it sounds like Harry s just making up stuff  I do like the changes they made near the end where they took out Ron s dragon bite and let Ron be in the detention scenes and stuff instead of Neville  I wish we got more of the centaur stuff in the movie though I liked their scenes in the forbidden forest  I liked that every time they lost track of the cloak we saw how they got it back  In the movie it just happens to randomly be where they need it  JK just does great world buiding  Why did they build up the Fluffy scene so much in the movie  It was really easy to get past Fluffy in the book  I wish they included Snape s poison test in the book  It showed how useful Hermione is  Like she was good with the Devil s Snare but Ron got an entire chess game to show how useful he was  Hermione needed that little extra step   I like that in the book it explains why Quirrel couldn t have Harry touch him in better detail  And they tell us that Dumbledore gave Harry the cloak  another thing I wish was in the movie  And another is that I wish we found out in the movies that James Potter saved Snape s life  I would have thought that important since it shows how pety Snape is in his reasoning for hating James  I wish we had scene Ron and Hermione meeting the Dursley s at the end of the movie Hopefully this little review reminds me in the future of the differences between the books and the movies  Now on to the next one  This is the first time I ve read Harry Potter and I thought it was a bit later and I wouldn t enjoy as much as everyone do but    I LOVE IT  Why I didn t pick it up before  The writing and the characters are beautiful  I didn t find bored moments and the story was very good  It was difficult to stop reading because I enjoy every single part and Hogwarts sounds like the coolest school ever  I cannot help to compare it with Percy Jackson bc they are not ya books and I think Harry Potter is not as childish as Percy and that s why I enjoyed it more  idk  I was reading and I was continuously forgetting that the characters were only eleven because I ve felt like they were older  I loved Harry s personality  Ron s friendship and Hermione s logic  I also loved Dumbledore  he is supposed to be strict but he is so kind and he cares about all of the students Christmas in Hogwarts was pretty amazing and very funny and I really enjoyed all the things that involved the Sorcerer s Stone  I was a bit sure that Voldemort was involved and the obstacles were fantastics and so originals  I m definitely going to continue with the series  no doubt   Cannot write a coherent review for this book so    Here are my reactions and thoughts throughout its chapters  Enjoy The boy who lived To Harry Potter   the boy who lived  The vanishing mirror Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel   Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig  The letters from no oneThe keeper of the keysDiagon AlleyThe journey from Platform Nine and Three QuartersThe sorting hat When Neville Longbottom  the boy who kept losing his toad  was called  he fell over on his way to the stool  The hat took a long time to decide with Neville  When it finally shouted   GRYFFINDOR   Neville ran off still wearing it  and had to jog back amid gales of laughter  The potions master Ah  yes  Harry Potter  Our new    celebrity    Severus Snape The Midnight duel And what if I wave my wand and nothing happens   Throw it away and punch him on the nose   Ron suggested Hallowe en But from that moment on  Hermione Granger became their friend  There are some things you can t share without ending up liking each other  and knocking out a twelve foot mountain troll is one of them  QuiddichThe Mirror of Erised The Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared hungrily back at them  his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall right through it and reach them  He had a powerful kind of ache inside him  half joy  half terrible sadness  Nicolas Flamel You know how I think they choose people for the Gryffindor team  said Malfoy a few minutes later  as Snape awarded Hufflepuff another penalty for no reason at all   It s people they feel sorry for  See  there s Potter  who s got no parents  then there s the Weasleys  who ve got no money   you should be on the team  Longbottom  you ve got no brains   Neville went bright red but turned in his seat to face Malfoy  I m worth twelve of you  Malfoy   he stammered Norbert the Norwegian RidgebackThe Forbidden ForestThrough the Trapdoor But if we get caught  you two will be expelled  too    Not if I can help it   said Hermione grimly   Flitwicktold me in secret that I got a hundred and twelve percent on hisexam  They re not throwing me out after that  The Man with Two Faces There is no good and evil  there is only power  and those too weak to seek it   They dont know we re not allowed to use magic at home  I m going to have a lot of fun with Dudley this summer    God  I love Harry Potter  Ay  No me ha gustado el libro   me ha encantando  Es la primera vez que leo Harry Potter  si he visto todas las peliculas pero no mas de dos veces  por lo que no recuerdo muy bien las cosas  por suerte  y eso me gusta ya que le da mucha mas emocion a la lectura  Ademas que me han venido muchisimos recuerdos de cuando comenzo el  boom Harry Potter    tendria unos 10 anos  Ay  una enana total  Sinceramente temia que no me gustara por ser demasiado juvenil para mi edad  pero estaba bien equivocada tanto que ahora estoy deseando seguir leyendo todos los libros para saber como sigue la historia  En este primer libro lo que mas me ha gustado es  ver  como se va creando la amistad de Harry  Ron y Hermione  Conocer Hogwarts  las clases y sus profesores  Sentir la emocion de saber que guarda Fluffy en la trampilla  Reir con las locuras de Hagrid  La adrenalina de los partidos de Quidditch  Sentir miedo con Snape  Los sabios consejos de Dumbledore que es por ahora uno de mis personajes favoritos  sin contar a Harry  Ron y Hermione  Admito que no he podido aguantar las lagrimas en el final cuando estan celebrando la fiesta de fin de curso y Dumbledore empieza hablar  ains  Lo dicho  muero de ganas por continuar leyendo   Os dejo con dos citas de Dumbledore que me han tocado el corazoncito   No es bueno dejarse arrastrar por los suenos y olvidarse de vivir  recuerdalo   Hay que tener un gran coraje para oponerse a nuestros enemigos  pero hace falta el mismo valor para hacerlo con los amigos      The boy who lived  Where s my Hogwarts letter Its so unfair harry had received a lot of letters  and i haven t received my letter yet   I love all these characters They are so freaking lovely and love getting into a lot of troubles  Hermione reminds me to Sydney Sage from Bloodlines  In a small and brilliant version  Haha  Ron Wesley  well  he s my soulmate   Haha  i love him  he s so adorable Harry  Ron and Hermione are a one of the best friendships i have read  Certainly they re a golden trio  Anyway I love these books so freaking much  This reminds me to my childhood because i grew up reading these precious books so   PD  I love re read and instead of finding faults  find things that make me love even more the book   It s pretty unfair of me to review this book  I unabashedly adore this entire series so I don t see the faults  nor do I want to  I am one of those kids who grew up with Harry  I remember waiting in line at midnight for my copy and spending the entire night and day devouring every word  wishing I d get my Hogwarts letter  So I m a little biased J K  Rowling has created such a deep world that is so easy to get lost in  I m always sucked right in with the first sentence  Harry Potter himself is such a sympathetic character  It s so easy to put yourself in his shoes and share in his experiences Rowling packs so much into 310 pages and the book never feels shallow  Every character is fleshed out  distinct  and memorable  The plot move along at a nice clip while leaving plenty of room for characters to develop and relationships to form  Not only that  but Rowling is a beautiful writer  It s so easy to get lost in her words  She s also a natural at humor  There are quite a few moments where I laugh out loud  and garner a few funny stares  I could go on and on but suffice it to say  I love this book  I love this series  Prima lettura  2004Seconda lettura  2014Ci sono delle cose per cui non si e mai troppo grandi  i dolci  i cartoni e ultimo  ma non per importanza  Harry Potter  Che tu abbia otto  diciotto o ottant anni Harry rimane sempre incredibilmente magico  Si puo leggere il libro una  dieci o venti volte e scoprire ogni volta qualche dettaglio nuovo che magari ti era sfuggito o che gli anni ti avevano portato via  Perche alla fine Harry e senza eta e di certo non si e mai troppo cresciuti per riprendere Harry Potter e la pietra filosofale tra le mani  Cosi ho ceduto anch io  la mia copia malconcia appollaiata sullo scaffale con le pagine ingiallite un richiamo irresistibile  la promessa di un pomeriggio di fine estate piu bello del previsto  Via il vocabolario  benvenuta cara vecchia Hogwarts  Capitolo uno  Il bambino sopravvissuto  E come riscoprire una parte di te che avevi chiuso in un cassetto  un angolino buio e un po  impolverato che torna a essere accogliente dopo la prima riga  Harry Potter e un po  il mio essere Peter Pan  la volonta di rimanere bambina ma allo stesso tempo la consapevolezza di essere cambiata tanto  Pero lui rimane sempre uguale  un rifugio tra le pagine impolverate e il ricordo di quando aspettare il nuovo libro della serie era come aspettare il Natale  Quell attesa che sembrava interminabile e che  in un certo senso  non e mai realmente finita  sono sicura che il gufo si e perso la mia lettera  Mi avranno mandato Errol    I am amazed at how much it included in this book  How many questions were both raised and answered  and how much character was introduced  It s no wonder I fell in love with the series   The characters were just as delightful and loveable  in many instances  at they are later on in the books  and the plot just as interesting    It was really nice to go back and know for certain how things began  and what exactly occurred in Book One  There are so many points that are brought up in later books that are addressed in this book   it s amazing it s all there so early on  I was also surprised at how late in the book Hermione befriends Harry and Ron  but by the end it s obvious that the books are about  the trio   I was also surprised at the little that Dumbledore was in the book  but what little he was in it made an amazing impression  So delightful and wonderful and magical  I love    D     Read  Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone on  June 30  2014 through September 18  2014Re read  December 24  2007 through January 7  2008Originally read in July 2002  10 27          I already love these books  And am so curious to find out how it all began  As Katie said  meeting everyone again for the first time    I ve reread books 3 6  but not 1  2 or     yet  I m so excited to be rereading book 1 and learning  in addition to how it all began  how many hints are there from the beginning  A delightful way to spend a magical holiday  D Yeah Hogwarts    D This is a wonderful gift edition of the first Harry Potter novel  I purchased this for my 11 year old son  who has never read the Harry Potter books and he was immediately attracted to the cover  where Hedwig flies  golden and utterly eye catching  above the Hogwarts Express  Full of glorious illustrations  this edition brings Harry Potter s world to life I think makes a wonderful present for any reader and is also perfect if you want to read the book aloud at bedtime to a younger child  Everything  from the cover to the quality of the paper and the ribbon bookmark  has been designed with care  This really is a glorious edition of a  now classic  children s book and will grace any child s bookshelf   You guys do not need a review for this book from me  One  because everyone has read this  Two  some weird random people like me  who haven t read this yet  don t need my review to know they have to pick this up If I had to name one reading regret in my whole entire life  it would be that I didn t read this series as a child  I was a reader growing up  but I also wasn t much of a reader  It just never happened  And now  every time I tell someone I like to read  the first thing they ask me is   Oh  have you read Harry Potter    This is obviously a very normal question  since most booklovers have read this series  But no  not me So when December aka holiday month aka Christmas arrived  and a  HarryXmasToYou was going on  I thought  why the hell not   So I picked up this beautiful baby  and it was worth all of the stars  Now is the time for me to review and recommend this book  If you haven t read these books then you need to drop whatever plans you have for the week and read them  These books made me the nerd I am today  I m going to be honest  when they first came out I rolled my eyes and made fun of Potter fans  Then  when they became cool to read  I decided to give the first book a try    already planning not to read the other books  Well  I was hooked after the first few chapters  I became a Potter fan    HARDCORE  When the 7th book came out  I reserved my book weeks in advance and stayed in all weekend to read it  only stopping to eat  go to the bathroom  and sleep  I didn t even shower or care to know what was happening in the outside world  All that matter was Potter and when I read the last sentence of the book my heart ached a little  knowing Harry Potter was over  I strongly recommend to read these books  Like now   I got hooked by Harry Potter magic the second time round  My first read was about a decade ago  and I felt it was a mediocre book   I dont know how I came to the conclusion  but that s what I remember about my impression that time   This time I started on it as a bedtime readaloud book for my son  who got immersed in it and started reading it himself at all odd times  soon completed it and is now on book 3  leaving me far behind  So I had to complete the last half reading alone   but I just loved the magic in the book  Sometimes I was so involved that I began thinking that a parallel world of sorcerers and witches exist  We even were joking about plat form no  9 3 4 when we were at the railway station recently I would recommend this one to all   you should read atleast the first book and continue with the series  if you like it  I am planning to go ahead with the other books and complete the series  Es una de las relecturas que mas impresionada me ha dejado porque aun sabiendo lo que venia  sentia que era como leerla de nuevo  Le he aumentado las estrellas porque no es posible calificarlo menos Me siento feliz de haber terminado esta parte de la historia y espero leer la continuacion pronto  No puedo dejar de recomendar esta saga y no importa la edad que tengas  Vas a disfrutarla y amarla mucho cuando lo leas  I read the Harry Potter series when I was about 10 years old and it s what really got me into reading  before Harry Potter I would read a lot of picture books and Star Wars  but then I decided to move on to something different  and I heard everyone saying how good the Harry Potter books were so I went out and bought the first 3 books  and I read the first one and I loved it Harry Potter is a boy who s parents were killed when he was just a baby  they were killed by Lord Voldemort  an evil wizard  who attempted to kill Harry and failed  but leaving a lightning scar on his forehead  Harry spends the next 11 years with his horrible Aunt Petunia  Uncle Vernon  and their son Dudley  Until a giant named Hagrid comes to take him to start a new journey at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry   Now  I wished that I had been a fan all along and didn t wait this long to read this book  I loved how it transported me into the world of Hogwarts and there wasn t a minute where I didn t want to know what happened next  Rowling knows how to write a good story filled with friendship  adventure and intrigue  There were times that I would be listening to this in my free mornings and I didn t realise how fast the time went  This book made me happy and even when I didn t listen to it for a little bit  I could easily get back into the world which was a good thing  I loved Harry as a character and his sarcasm always made me laugh  Hermione and Ron were the perfect companions for Harry and they were always by his side when he needed them  I ll stop there otherwise this will be too long   I first read this in 1998 when it was first released and this is my first re read What to say that hasn t already been said It s better the second time around  it s better than the movie  no matter how good the movie is   It s just f   ing magical The best world building ever   yes better than Tolkien  Words cannot describe how amazing the world she creates is or how amazing the characters are  Words really do fail me  This really is the high water mark  but of course you know that because there are only two people  I think they live in Topeka  left in the world who haven t read this book My plan right now is to re read the whole series  one book every quarter  We ll see if the rest hold up  Do I really have to explain this rating Yeah  didn t think so Also  Fred and George literally almost gave me an asthma attack  and I don t appreciate it   view spoiler  And to all the people who say Harry and Hermione should have been together  no  Do you not see the love hate relationship between Ron and Hermione  Because I do  and it is as beautiful as Lizzy and Mr  Darcy s relationship  Wait  nope  take that back  almost as beautiful  Because nothing is ever going to beat Pride and Prejudice   hide spoiler   Poslouchal jsem v audio podobe UK verzi  kterou prednesl famozni Stephen Fry Nemuzu jinak  nez za 5 hvezd  Mozna  ze kdybych Kamen mudrcu cetl poprve az nyni  vadily by mi nelogicnosti  proc Voldemort neovladl i mudlovsky svet    system magie  zakon zachovani energie tu neexistuje    chyby v pribehu a ruzne  deus

Mahtava kirja vielakin Harry Potter on vaan se juttu  ikuinen lemppari  Hyvia kirjoja tulee ja menee  mutta Potterit ovat pysyvia  There are some things you can t share without ending up liking each other  and knocking out a twelve foot mountain troll is one of them  Amending my original 4 star rating to the 5 it truly deserves  This book may not have excellent prose or sophisticated speech  but there is something about it that just makes me feel so at home  Every page  sentence and character feels like a familiar friend  I read it for the first time over a decade ago and I know I ll be re reading it for decades to come  I pity anyone who doesn t experience that warm fuzzy feeling that comes with returning to Hogwarts  Toto bolo tak dokonale  ako minimalne desatkrat predtym v slovencine  a to radsej nepocitam  kolkokrat som videla film  D   Milujem Harryho Pottera  3After all this time  Always  3Anglictina bola tiez velmi jednoducha  i ked si nie som celkom ista  ci to nebolo preto  ze tuto knihu poznam naspamat  Akurat s Hagridovymi hlaskami som mala problem  hlavne na zaciatku  potom som na to prisla a opat som to zvladala  3 Nutne chcem dalsie diely co najskor  To  ze mam celu seriu v slovencine je irelevantne  DNehovoriac o tom  ake je toto vydanie prenadherne  Polovicu casu som sa len kochala    Loved this even more the second time around than the first  This was such a fun re read  I loved this book  I loved the friendship that Harry  Ron  and Hermione share  This book was full of action  mystery  magic  and wizardry  I loved the storyline and the world building  the characters of the story  and the whole wizard school atmosphere  This book is about a boy who learns he is a wizard and goes to wizard school at Hogwarts  He also meets the evil Voldemort who killed his parents for the first time in this book  This is going to be a great series  I would definitely recommend this read  La Rowling ha contribuito a rendere il mondo un posto migliore  Grazie

series to grow up with and we had the best one  Growing up with HP was the best thing that ever happened to me in my childhood  Nothing was more beautiful than feeling like you are in Hogwarts with the trio  going on adventures  believing in magic  learning about love  courage and friendship  I was 9 when I started reading HP and this was the most wonderful escape from reality for me  Some books are worth reading once  but it s worth reading many times  Nadherny navrat do detskych let  Opet jsem se utvrdil v tom  ze Harry Potter zustane mem srdci naporad  Nadiavam se nikoga da ne doide vremeto  kogato shche dam na Khari Pot r po malko ot 5 zvezdi  MY HEART CAN T TAKE THIS  This book is like home to me  I love it so much and it will always be such a big part of my childhood and life in general  No matter what  I ll  always  be in love with this magical story and I can t wait to start reading the next book  I just got this edition  so it was time for a re read   I forgot how quick this was to read  Still a favourite  spent the entire train journey smiling while reading this earlier    I definitely should have decided to reread these sooner         ma cenu tady pod to neco psat  Beztak to vyzni jak klise   just ALWAYS  I love this book  This book is more than witches  wizards and witchcraft  It goes way beyond that  It deals with lost  pain  love  friendship  hatred  enemies  bravery  fear  bullying      He ll be famous   a legend   i wouldn t be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter Day in future   there will be books written about Harry   every child in our world will know his name    To Harry Potter   the boy who lived  Is J K  Rowling a genius or what    She did not only write a masterpiece  but has successfully predicted the future  As the story begins  the reader is introduced with a boy named Harry Potter with a lightning scar on his forehead who has lost his parents in  a car crash   according to his aunt and uncle   So far  Rowling deals with several themes  lost of parents  lies and torture  Yes  I dare say so  What kind of a human being  regardless of the fact whether that person or people are connected with the individual by blood or not  puts a little boy inside the cupboard under the stairs  Where do I even begin with explaining you the characters of Aunt Petunia  Uncle Vernon and Dursley One thing they have in common with every  or almost every  parent is that they would do ANYTHING to satisfy their child  even if it sometimes means spoiling it and making him greedy and bad humored if things don t turn out the way he wants them to  I am so very grateful to Joanne for writing about bullying  We live in the 21st century  but let s not get carried away  people seem to be downgrading on the scale of evolution  A lot of kids are being bullied nowadays  So  I love Joanne even more for standing up and fighting against it  Cause writing about it brings awareness to people  The book is translated in 77 languages and sold in more than 450 million copies and I believe that people are familiar with the book  or at least  the movie  I can only hope that when kids and adults read see it  it will point out to them how hurtful it is being bullied and as such they will  ripe it off themselves  Yet  another thing I love  the characters evolution through the story  especially Hermione s  She is a bossy little know it all  who is not afraid to stand up to whosoever and is comfortable being who she is  And yes  it means that at the very beginning  Ron and Harry  but especially Ron  disapprove of her and find her annoying  And as if it wasn t enough that she is the brightest witch of her age  she is a logical one as well  something that is not so common for witches and wizards    Books  And cleverness  There are more important things   friendship and bravery  P S  She consults books for literary EVERYTHING  Need I say how much that makes me admire and love her   And yes  she is my all time favorite book character  Oh  and let s not forget to mention clumsy little Neville and the fact that he goes from being scared and petrified in front of the face of the  bad guys   like Malfoy  to being able to stand up against his friends  if that is what it takes to protect them   How about Hagrid  Ah  my heart melts whenever he enters the scene  His character is like a big huggy bear  He is tall and big  with hair all over his face  but has a good  tender heart  As  for Harry and Ron    Thank you Rowling for creating them  Thank you for showing us that not all heroes are know it all when it comes to standing up against their enemies  Thanks for showing us that true bravery means being scared all the way till facing your deepest nightmare    Ok I did it  I read The first book  and I get it the hype over the series  it really was good and I will continue on in the series   now to pass this one on to my 11 yr old   definitely recommend  Would make a great gift  Ich hatte die Reihe schon viel fruher ein zweites Mal anfangen sollen  Es war noch besser als beim ersten Mal  I cannot even I loved this book so much more the second time around It s weird isn t it  I thought I would see issues and get all worked up but I didn t  I am just throwing it out there but could McGonagall have a crush on Hagrid  She did blush that one time On another note the hardest thing about reading this book was Fred and Snape  Snape will always be my hero  I decided to revisit this favorite when the Jim Dale narrated audiobooks became available recently on Audible  I can honestly say that this audiobook blew me away  I found myself smiling and laughing and falling back into love  I never actually fell out of love  with Harry  Ron  and Hermione  I look forward to listening to the entire series   The artwork in this is soo fucking beautiful  Even though I have three sets of different editions of these books  I m going to buy all of these illustrated editions as well  Hope they hurry up and make the second book   I ve lost track of the number of times I have read this book  It gets better every time I read it  There are more important things    friendship and bravery and       Hermione That s what these books are about  Friendship  loyalty  bravery    I m always amazed when I hear arguments for the banning of this book   This book is so magical  It has grown with me and I ve read it over 10 times now  on the past fifteen years or so  and each time I did I cheered with Harry s conquests  I learned magic with them  I was scared of Snape  even though I know how he ends up  What J K  Rowling created here will never be big enough  It s magical  Reread July 2015  So wonderful to revisit where it all began  and the story is still just as wonderful as the first time I read it  Definitely is quite slow  and there are some inconsistencies  but know what comes later in the series it is nice to see the innocence of the first book  Can t wait to read Chamber of Secrets  I feel as though I shouldn t even review this  What is there to say really besides the fact that this book is breathtakingly astonishing  I loved every second of it and am so mad at myself for picking it up just now  All these years    I actually cried in the end  I cannot wait to delve into the second book soon  J ai ete tres heureuse de relire Harry Potter  et meme si maintenant je le vois avec mes yeux d adultes  c est toujours avec le meme ravissement que je l ai lu  Ayant vu et revu les films  je n ai pu m empecher d associer les voix francaises a ce que je lisais  avec le ton employe  l expression du visage  ca m a permis de mieux visualiser tout ce qu il se passait  meme si du coup je me demande comment j imaginais tout ca a l epoque   J ai ete transportee dans l histoire  comme a l epoque ou il est sorti  Harry Potter et ses aventures me font toujours autant rever    En revanche  maintenant que je le lis avec mes yeux d adultes  j ai tout de meme quelques reproches a faire a ce tome 1  J ai trouve que l histoire allait parfois beaucoup trop vite  que dans certains dialogues on passait tres rapidement d un sujet a un autre pour faire avancer l histoire sans que ce soit vraiment credible  Mais c est le premier roman de Rowling et c etait sans doute plus destine a des enfants ou des pre ados qu a des adultes  a la base  meme si ca a seduit tous les ages  Ca ne m empeche absolument pas de mettre 5 etoiles car  meme si ca en est presque cliche puisque c est pareil pour enormement de gens  ca reste mon univers favoris de tous les temps  Pour 2016  je me prevois un marathon Harry Potter   un livre  un film  The illustrations in this edition are just perfect  I hadn t done a re read in ages and I felt myself fall in love all over again  I was tearing up at parts and remembering what it felt like to read this for the first time  so many years ago  Positively brilliant   I absolutely fell in love with the characters to start with and even though it s a middle grade novel as a 17 year old I feel that anybody could get into this book  I really wish I had the second book in my hand now so that I could continue on with the series     I was not a kid when Harry s books appeared  I was on my last teens  I remember I first came across them while I was hanging around in a bookshop waiting for some friends  It was a hard reading time for me because I was so stressed with university compulsory readings that I could hardly find any books I really enjoyed and suddenly the image of a tiny green eyed boy with glasses and a lightening scar on his forehead caught my eye  I picked the book up and started reading the first pages and I couldn t stop  so I bought it and I went out of the bookshop reading and tripping over things  That s how my love story with Harry started  before he was even a world wide thing  I started it thinking it was a children book but it grew on me as it did on everybody else  and like many kids who grew up with Harry  I cried my eyes out when certain unexpected things happened  But above all I remember developing as a person as they did  my life experiences run parallel with theirs  although in different levels of course  So when I bumped into this new edition my mind went back to that moment and although it s Christmas and there are tons of presents to make I had to buy it because not only does it contain J K  Rowling s magic  which I already knew  but Jim Kay s  What he does with the illustration is amazing  There s not a single one of nos drawings which does not fill my heart with tenderness or make me smile  I love his vision of Harry s world  It s one more reason to hold this book as a treasure and to fall in love with it once more but harder   Simply magical    I had this time where I would reread the series every year and I managed to do so 4 years in a row  It was now two years ago since I ve reread the series and I m having so much fun  Rediscovering things and seeing situations with different eyes because of all the extra information J K Rowling has given us over time  it s always an amazing journey  It s home One thing I never thought about and I suddenly realized it  Ron has so much troubles with spells  because he is using Charlie s wand  We already know you can only perform well when you have a wand that choose you  so poor Ron is working extra hard  It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live  remember that   That mirror always seemed cruel to be  How dangerous to see your deepest desire reflected in a mirror  Like with Dumbledore   He saw his family alive  whole and happy   Ariana  Percival and Kendra all returned to him  and Aberforth reconciled to him     J K Rowling I thought it was also interesting to see Quirrell after finding out how he met Voldemort  http   pottermorespoilers tumblr com     Sassy Harry Harry Potter   What s this  Petunia Dursley   Your new school uniform  Harry Potter   Oh  I didn t realise it had to be so wet  I also like the explanation why the Dursleys kept Harry for all those years  It shows to me that they aren t completely evil  Yes  they are assholes and they made his life terrible  but at the same time they kept him save and fed him  They could have kicked him on the street or dumped him in another family  Explanation Very good question  As you know  as we find out in book seven  Petunia once really wanted to be part of that world  And you discover that Dumbledore has written to her prior to the Howler   Dumbledore wrote to her very kindly and explained why he couldn t let her come to Hogwarts to become a witch  So  Petunia  much as she denies it afterwards  much as she turns against that world when she met Uncle Vernon  who is the biggest anti wizard you could ever met in your life  a tiny part of her  and that s the part that almost wished Harry luck when she said goodbye to him in this book  she just teetered on the verge of saying  I do know what you re up against and I hope it s OK  But she couldn t bring herself to say it  Years of pretending she doesn t care have hardened her  But Dumbledore appealed in the letter you re asking about  so that part of Petunia that did remember wanting desperately to be part of the world and he appealed to her sense of fair play to a sister that she had hated because Lily had what she couldn t have  So that s how he persuaded Petunia to keep Harry  Good question    J K Rowling This made me giggle  I always wondered how they got off the island http   stepchildofthesun tumblr com p    J adore tout simplement ce livre  JK Rowling a reussi a creer un monde fantastique  dans les deux sens du terme  et perce tres bien a jour la psychologie enfantine  ses peurs  ses reves  etc  A lire et a relire  Oh my gosh  3I shouldn t have gone on for so long without re reading this  It s seriously just as amazing as the first time  Or even    better than I actually remembered Now on to the rest of the series  COMO E QUE EU NUNCA TINHA LIDO ISTO ANTES       It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies  but just as much to stand up to our friends   Oh  Dumbledore  I forgot how much sarcasm Dumbledore had in the book  It was fantastic

as always  I loved every second of it    REVIEW COMING SOON         Re read  08 08 15Previous read    12 13Again   twas perfect   Made me cry  obviously  Full review  http   wp me p4LMeC t8 The more I read it  the more I fall in love with it   Much needed  And better than ever   Reread for the millionth time  This edition is so gorgeous  I finally read Harry Potter  I was so scared about reading this because almost everybody knows and loves it And all the hype is worthy  at least for this first book  I laughed  I cried and I was surprised  this book was amazing  it is really good My favorite parts of the book 1  At the station when Harry is helped by Mrs  Weasley 2  Jordan s comments on the first quidditch game 3  When Harry finds the mirror  4  Dumbledore giving points to Ron  Hermione  Harry and Neville 5  And at the end when Ginny is excited to see Harry  she s so cute  Feels  Feels everywhere    I love rereading the series  WOOOO  HARRY POTTER IS BAEE  I ll start of by saying that I now understand the hype and fandom  I fell in love with the book at the chapters in the middle  Especially  Quidditch   Hogwarts Houses  It s not that I don t know which houses I want  per say  But I don t know which to choose between Gryffindor or Ravenclaw  Hmm   Maybe I should Google up a  Which House in Hogwarts would you be in Quiz  or something XDHP and PJO fandom war  I feel like this book is similar to Percy Jackson  not in the plot   cos its wayyyy different  but in the style genre  Which was meant to be a children s literature book  I would have to say that I love the Harry Potter series much more than the Percy Jackson and the Olympians  The plot in H P is way more interesting and capturing  I ve always loved magic after I watched Bonnie  in The Vampire Diaries TV series  do her thing  Yes PJO has the  magic  element as well  but not with the classic wands and wizard hats magic   3Characters  Dumbledore is a very wise man indeed  Well  not in choosing Bertie Bott s Every Flavour Beans tho  We have to thank him for his words of wisdoms and advices  Somehow this is one of those books that gets better each time you read it  Reading this again as technically an  adult  now  I m picking up on so many foreshadowing elements that I never caught before  Even things that aren t mentioned until the seventh book show up through Dumbledore s talks with Harry or Harry s insights on Snape and Malfoy  J K  Rowling is simply a genius to have her entire world mapped out like that  I can t think of another author or book series that puts this much detail and love and pureness into the story  I m always blown away and shocked each time I pick this up and this time I felt way more emotional about everything  The Christmas scene really got to me when Harry woke up and Ron s mother had a present for him on his bed  Honestly  at any age it s unlikely to find a friend that is as wonderful as Ron or Hermione  never mind to find them at the ridiculous age of eleven  It s just so heartwarming and on nearly ever scene between the three of them I found myself tearing up  Maybe it s because I already know what s in store for them  but it s just beautiful as a stand alone  The best moment however HAS to be when the three of them are stuck in Devil s Snare and Hermione can t figure out how to start a fire because she doesn t have wood and Ron just goes  HAVE YOU GONE MAD  ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT   I was DYING laughing  I clearly forgot how hilarious these books are which I feel sometimes get lost in the seriousness of the films  but at the same time it s nice to have the books to come back to  to find these little hidden gems  I haven t even gotten into the amazing illustrations  and MY GOD are they unbelievable  I picked this up to  lightly skim  through the pictures and I found myself a hundred pages in sobbing at the sheer beauty of this novel and now the beautiful art that goes along with it  They enhance the reading experience in a way that I never thought was possible and now I can t wait for the rest of the illustrated versions to be released  Honestly if you don t have it yet get your hands on it  Alright  that s it for my Harry Potter ramblings  I m now going to continue binging on the series because this has completely sparked my interest again  Soooo happy     I resisted reading this book for a long time  thinking that it would be  too childish  to hold my interest  Then  one night back in 2007  I happened to be at my local Barnes   Noble during the midnight release party for Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows  the last book in the series  Seeing the enthusiasm of all the fans gathered there  some of whom were in full costume  made me curious  so I wended my way through the crowd  in the process wondering what  The Sorting Hat  was all about  and approached the first free cashier I could find  the first book in my hands  I was suddenly eager to discover what all the fuss was about Well  as they say  the rest is history  I not only promptly devoured Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone  but began acquiring  and also devouring  the sequels  I only stopped in the middle of the sixth book  when a very sad event made me unable to continue    but I hope to be able to go back and finish the series I picked up the first book the other day  and plunged into Harry s magical world once again  Once again  I was totally delighted and enthralled  Rowling s very fertile imagination seems to have no bounds  all the books in this series are full of magical events  as well as twists and turns  and one just never knows exactly what is going to happen next Rowling also has the uncanny ability to make her characters  as well as the magical world around them  seem so real  From the very first moment  the reader becomes immersed in this very quirky  wonderfully weird world  where nothing is as it seems  unexpected surprises await  and household chores can be accomplished by the mere wave of a wand  something I positively loved  Harry  Hermione  and Ron are wonderful characters  and it s not the first time I have wished I had grown up with friends like them  It s great how well they mesh  too  especially since  at first  Harry and Ron constantly found Hermione so annoying Harry  of course  is the main hero  He starts out life with the odds stacked against him  what with his sad personal history  and  He Who Must Not Be Named  wanting to kill him  In spite of it all  Harry remains courageous  and will not let his curiosity  innate optimism  and eagerness to learn magic be dampened by outward events Hermione could have been the main hero of this whole series  because she not only matches Harry  and her name is the female version of his  in all his great qualities  but is also willing to take that extra step to find out more  Books are very important to her  and I really liked her for that  She is also very thorough in her research  and has an excellent memory  Besides  she can really think on her feet As for Ron  he is that friend who remains steadfastly by your side  through thick and thin  He s funny  as well  and willing to attempt any adventure  despite his fears  Besides  he s an excellent chess player    even beating his two friends at the game  In this first book  his chess playing skills become extremely important in preventing a great catastrophe Then there s Hagrid    sweet  lovable  gentle Hagrid  who has a soft spot for creatures great and small  and loves Harry like a father  or perhaps a big  bumbling brother  He s pretty much like a giant teddy bear  and I SO wish I could hug him  He s had some rough times himself  but still remains as positive as he can possibly be  And  most important of all  Dumbledore  the Hogwarts Headmaster  trusts him completely  Dumbledore is another of my favorite characters  but I won t say much about him because he plays a greater role later on in the series  What I did get to see of him  though  during both my first and second readings of this book  made me like him a great deal  He is definitely a father figure to Harry    always wise  patient  and willing to give Harry the benefit of the doubt There were other great  more minor characters  as well  such as Professor McGonagall  who is really a very fair minded person  despite her stern exterior  Quirrell  the stuttering professor  the funny Weasley clan  especially the mischievous twins  Fred and George  and Neville  poor  shy Neville  who is constantly losing his pet toad    Then there s one character who is almost in a league by himself  and a rather hateful one  too  Severus Snape  Alan Rickman plays him superbly in all the movies  He gets the character s oily manner  his hair is even greasy  and incomprehensible attitude toward Harry just right  Rickman made it extremely easy for this reader to despise Snape  Even before I met him on the screen  though  Rowling had already succeeded in making me hate him Another character I love to hate is Draco Malfoy  Harry s personal nemesis  I m surprised he isn t related to Snape  because he can be just as spiteful and horrible to Harry Amidst all of the typical boarding school activities and classes with such interesting names as  Potions    Charms    Transfiguration   and  Defense Against the Dark Arts   the three friends become very adept at amateur sleuthing  and uncover a secret at Hogwarts  one that students are not supposed to know about    Of course  there had to be time for sports  as well  and I soon discovered that the magical world s version of soccer    or is it a strange combination of soccer and basketball     with the delightfully odd name of  Quidditch   was not only great fun  but had elements of danger  as well  especially when a certain evil wizard nearly took one of the most important players out of the picture    Rowling manages all the elements of her plot with great skill  leading her readers along the path toward the exciting  final discovery of the school s secret through tight writing  with not a word to spare I especially liked Dumbledore s final words to Harry  It was the power of love  he told the young wizard  that won the day  Some readers might criticize this as  cheesy   but I thought it was altogether fitting to the story  considering Harry s background This is such a terrific story  No wonder it s loved the whole world over  by readers of all ages  This book definitely deserves all the praise it has garnered  and more  I know that I will want to read it many more times in the future  And of course  I will also want to watch the movie just as many times For more of my YA reviews  please visit my blog  A NIGHT S DREAM OF BOOKS http   anightsdreamofbooks blogspot com RE READ from January 5  2016 January 8  2016WOW HOW CAN I NOT SAY GOOD THINGS ABOUT MY ALL TIME FAVORITE BOOK SERIES  It would basically be blasphemy if I did honestly  I could never stop loving this series  I honestly felt like a kid all over again  The one thing I noticed re reading this now was that this book was only 317 pages        I remember thinking to myself as a kid OHEMGEE THESE CHAPTERS ARE SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO LONG J K  ROWLING WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO ME and now I just laugh at myself thinking how short the chapters really are  Anyways  HARRY POTTER IS AMAZING IF YOU VE NEVER READ IT GO READ IT  AND IF YOU HAVE READ IT AGAIN  I just want to go live at Hogwarts  be a wizard  and live in the world that I live now  But sadly I shall just keep re reading the rest of the series and keep dreaming   J K Rowling knows how to write a great book  She deserves to be the most successful author of all time  All we have ever heard about the Harry Potter series is true  these books live up to the hype  When I started reading this book  I was awe struck by how great it is  and I couldn t put it down The characters in this book are real  developed  relatable and quite memorable    I can t even choose a favourite character because they are all close to my heart   The scenes are very well described to the point that everything feels real Each time I read these books  it feels as if I am reading them for the first time  I always discover something new and I will never get bored of reading them  it is always a pleasure to reread the Harry Potter series This series is recommended for both children and adults and I am sure everyone will enjoy these magical  suspensful and breathtaking books  And the most imortant thing is that this book is more about friendship and family and a mother s love for her child  This will forever be my favourite book series and I will never give it less than five stars  although it deserves way more     This review is also posted on my blog   view spoiler  There isn t much to say here that I didn t say when I re read the regular edition of this book earlier in the year  It s  Harry Potter   Of  course  I ll always love to re read it Oh my GOD though  these illustrations  I am in LOVE  Complete  heart stopping  yes I ll show them to the receptionist when she asks before my eye exam and we both have a squee moment LOVE IT S SO GORGEOUS I MIGHT CRY I need to own my own copy YESTERDAY P S  I m not sure if it was just this copy  or if it s how they were all published   but this copy of the illustrated edition had the BRITISH version of the story  Not the American one  It had all the British spellings and grammar and wording   and it was actually REALLY interesting to read its original version   Also interesting that it was still the SORCERER S stone  not PHILOSOPHER S  I wonder if that was done intentionally  No matter  really  IT WAS STILL REALLY NEAT  I M SO STUPID EXCITED FOR BOOK TWO S ILLUSTRATED EDITION YOU DON T EVEN KNOW    hide spoiler   Welcome  Welcome to another years hogwarts La verdad la primera vez que tuve este libro en mis manos lo lei mas de cinco veces en una semana  anos mas tarde un primero de septiembre lo vuelvo a leer  y estan fascinante como la primera vez  no es solo un ano  no es solo potter  el cual es el protagonista  es la astucia e inteligencia de hermione  es el ocultismo de snape  es la sabiduria de dumbledore  el amor de hagrid  la amistad de ron  la severidad de mcgonagall  es de todo un poco  No es solo la magia  es la cultura detras de la historia  es un libro que recolecta tantas historia de culturas tan diferentes  Es el sombrero con su lenguaje particular  es un mundo paralelo al cual muchos queremos retornar  Empece a leer estos libros cuando tenia 14  creci mi adolescencia y parte de mi adultez con estos libros  y hoy unos anos mas tarde vuelvo a ellos con el simple proposito e olvidar quien soy y que sere  no importa lo que piensen los demas PD  Odio cuando harry culpa a snape de todos sus males  y sobre todo cuando siempre piensa que estas tras el por odio a su padre  simplemente infantil su reaccion  Read in January 2016 This time  reading this book was a whole new experience  For starters it was the illustrated version which is absolutely gorgeous and gave such a nice touch to the story  The illustrations are something new to add to the wizardry world of harry potter  I found them to be great  We surely picture almost everything according to the movies nowadays  but the illustrations are very loyal to the actual description Rowling does  It s awesome This was also a very wonderful reading experience because I read it with my 10 years old little sister  out loud  one chapter per night  more or less  in the past few weeks  I was amazed on how she absorbed everything  how she learned each detail and was able to keep up with everything that was going on  She was so hooked while I was reading to her  it made me so happy She also read  time to time  and that was also nice for her and for me to rest my voice xDAnd when we got some word wrong we would laugh so so much  Sometimes it was hilarious    I really loved reading it this way and I m hoping to the same when the next illustrated version comes out Read in August 2015  You re a wizard  Harry  oh the nostalgia It s been some time since the last time I picked up HP This is one of the books I wished I could forget about it all and read it like the first time ever In other hand  it s also nice to have the older me re reading the series It s interesting and enjoyable  the way I can see small details of things that will only appear later on  Rowling is indeed a genius I feel like I will forever own to this series a lot  can t wait to keep re reading    lkthyr w lkthyr Hdth f  hdh ljz ldhy l ykhlw mn

Hogwarts  which could pass for you average boarding school  except with the difference being that this school features a heavily magic orientated curriculum in addition to the other things   D Not to mention it has a particularly suspicious forest by the school grounds full of strange creatures   D Plus there are also towers and dragons which make for a fantastic adrenaline monster evading environment   DThe book starts of in very English manner   D The books beginning is almost like what you would expect from a back road English country lane  assuming of course that a lane could be a book in that is very picturesque and what you can find in the villages you find at the end of them   D You are introduced to the characters in this manner and as the introductions and story continues you get to see a vein of humour weaving its way through the proceedings gives the book a clever feeling all the way through as if the reader is getting to know all the little secrets  and some of the bigger ones   D   that are being exposed throughout the book so while the book is written in the third person perspective the book almost has a first person perspective in it   D So as we get introduced to Hogwarts and the surrounding area through the eyes of the lead characters and this also gives the impression to the reader of discovering everything in Hogwarts for themselves as well and this is handled very cleverly and cunningly   D Many of the scenes are genuinely unpredictable which was a great surprise and some of the scenes simply you cannot help but laugh out loud at and a certain dog makes a big impression as well as a dragon making  friends  with a teddy bear   D The way pupils are chosen for the their houses as well is so funny as well though a talking hat must know a thing or two   D Throughout the book there is also the ongoing competitions between the houses that keep the interhouse competition coming thick and fast and leads to lots of machinations from a certain house   D Not to mention Quidditch which has a refreshing lack of health and safety   D LolThe world that is crafted in Philosophers  Sorcerer s  Stone is big and full of mystery a huge range of characters and locations  not to mention many fantasy creatures and beings and is a fantastic start for a series as well as very good world building   D Throughout we see lots of setup for the future books in the series as well as a lot of backstory as the characters find out about the past in order to deal with the big nemesis floating about who will and which have no doubt appearances and ramifications in the future books as at the end of the book there are untold questions waiting to be answered   DBrilliant  fast paced  funny  intriguing and gripping   D Brilliant and highly recommended   D Re Read 2015  Lookie what I got   Isn t it so pretty    Gaah  I m going to savour this re read  I m going to look at the amazing illustrations Jim Kay provides and really soak it all in    Wanna see some Hermione      BosswitchHagrid  you magnificent beast  uncontrollable fangirl squealing  Original Review  I have been putting off reading these books because I was afraid of ruining the movies  which I really enjoy  My brother read the books when they were released and can t watch the movies because he says they ruin the books  But I loved this book  and I enjoyed comparing it to the movie and seeing the differences  The characters are all very well developed and likable  and I love Dumbledore s wisdom  I just have one very important question  WHERE IS MY HOGWARTS LETTER   I already know I m in Hufflepuff  and proud   now I need to actually go  Wow  this kind of book opening is really a head turner not only page turner   its one of the fewest books I read that caught my attention once I started reading and I had to move the book away in order to get some sleep  I have to admit  I love Harry Potter since the first movie I watched but the book is way much better than the movie  The amount of details this time is really exactly what you need and expect from a wizards story  The movie scenes helped visualize things but even without the movie J K  Rowling drew every detail in an amazing way that not only let you in the story but also take you by the hand and let you in Hogwarts The characters are well created and defined and they are a little bit different from the movie  Comparing the two you can find how the movie twisted some of the scenes and the characters to accommodate the selling of a loveable motion picture  Looking back to the movie that I watched again  don t know exactly how many time I did already   I have to admit that getting back to the book story I might not fell in love with some of the main characters but after all there is no way to escape loving those three   This is the first book of my journey back to Hogwarts with Rowling and I m pretty sure it will be full of fun  magic  amusement and thrill and Rowling is really good at creating this amazing wizards world  No wonder Harry found exactly where he belongs  I believe I have no right to review this book for this is the superior of them all Anyway  I think i should consider writing a short one   J K  Rowling s Harry Potter and The Sorcerer s Stone is obviously a breakthrough of all readers  generations  Men of any ages would love reading all the books in the Harry Potter series  Story wise  Rowling was able to write a book that is not cliched and is bound to tell a really exciting story  It doesn t matter if the plot doesn t include love stories or whatever  because the way the book is written excites the reader  enough for him not to look for other things to look forward to  Plus  the fact that as compared to other books in a series  each book has its own story   unlike those which are cut in between and are connected in terms of the events happening  I still feel unworthy of reviewing the book though  not to mention the fact that the book is really really well written  I m not going to waste your time recapping what happens in this book  because I think everyone and their demented great aunt knows what this series is about It s been years since I first read this book  but I have seen the movie many times since  Which is why I probably thought I knew everything about this book  Turns out that s not true  As it often is with movies there s much more to a scene or a conversation than shown on the TV screen  which is understandable since they can t fit everything in a two hour movie   Now the reason I m saying this is because I absolutely loved noticing those little differences  it soon became some sort of a game  And the little magic that was lost due to this being a reread came back because this way I was able to notice all the little details of this book that may have escaped attention when I first read the book over a decade ago I feel like everything I say about The Sorcerer s Stone has already been said a thousand times and it s hard to put all my feeling into words  but I ll try  So needless to say I enjoyed every single word written in this book  I absolutely love the imagination and the detail required to create such a wonderful and diverse set of characters  All the details the author put into every single character is incredible  I even loved the assholes like Dreco Malfoy just because of all the details the author put into describing him  it made him so real  and thus the pleasure when he was verbally slapped down was even greater   Her attention to the smallest things created very vivid imagery in my mind while I was reading it  And not just when it comes to the characters but also with the scenery and all the creatures that exist in Harry s world but not in Muggle s Even already knowing the storyline of this book I was still blown away by it and how so many little things here and there created a much bigger picture that became apparent in the end  Even though I knew who the bad guy was I was still shocked by the reveal in the book because I was so immersed in the story I really encourage you to read this series if you haven t yet  Even if you re not an avid reader or a fan of fantasy fiction you should try it  Who knows  maybe this will be the gateway series that will expand your reading preferences  BOY FINDS OUT HE IS A WIZARDHagrid  You killed one bad

DUMBLEDORE COMES AND DEFEATS VOLDEMORT  AND THEN THEY ALL EAT EAR WAX FLAVORED JELLY BEANS TOGETHER  THE END  BEST BOOK EVARR   I had to read this novel for my Children s Lit class  How cool is that  I don t think I ve ever been so excited to do homework  And I would gladly study it again All right first I have to admit that when I picked up a spare copy for class  one that I could write all over  I laughed  Here is why  I will admit I haven t read this book in a while  Many  many years have passed since I last picked it up  however  I ve read it many a times  Anyhow  when I read it years ago when I was much younger it was always such a great adventure  still is   but also such a huge book  It s huge in the sense that so much happens but I laughed because its 223 pages long  I guess I was more use to the 500 pages of the last four novels But who knew that behind an adventure there was so much hidden meanings and allusion  I mean I read this before and just dove right into the story of an orphaned boy in a magical world  which of course is perfectly fine to do as that was Rowling s original intentions  Who knew that there was allusions to genocide  class separation  Who knew that Harry Potter would fit the structure of Romance  Fantasy Romance   Quest  High Fantasy  Fairy Tale  Fantasy  School Story  Orphan story  Gothic story  and Detective story Who knew there was so much wrapped up in one loveable adventure  But too me that s what it will always be   one hell of an adventure  For 223 pages  a lot sure does happen We are thrown into the world of Wizards  where we are actually referred to as Muggles  while a young boy learns who he is  fits the idea of who other people think he is  and accepts himself for who he is  Harry goes from an orphan with no friends whom weird things happen to  to one that was written in Wizarding history books with some rather great friends and adventurous life Harry Potter is a book for all ages filled with pages and pages of mischief  adventure  friendship  self discovery  and the teachings of Good vs  Evil  with Evil always losing  Good Harry Potter  Humble  good  courageous and curiousHermione  Waking up in the middle of the night to run to your books and get half way through your notes to realize   you ve already taken that exam  HilariousRon  scratch that  The Wesley Brother   mainly Ron  and Fred and George  the most hilarious characters I think I ve ever come across  Wish they were real   I m in love with the whole familyNeville  Always awesome  And the idea that he too can fit the role of Hero  especially throughout the rest of the series  makes him even more awesome Bad  Nothing here Overall  Writing style  story line  and general  Overall Rowling manages to put across her meanings and provide a clear picture through few words allowing for an adventure every page that everyone follows and no one questions  She answers every question that needs to be answered in this novel and somehow manages to set up plots for books that will happen far into the future from when this was released  and I can t help but ask how  Her imagination and planning must have been meticulous  and it paid offView more of my review and others at my blog  www mynotsovacantshelf blogspot com The world Rowling has created is beautiful  intricate  Full of love and hate  good and evil  muggles and wizards alike  Told from the point of view of orphan Harry Potter he attends Hogwarts  school of Witchcraft and Wizardry training to be a wizard and learning alongside his best friends Ron and Hermione  When he discovers that the most evil wizard Voldemort is after him  his life changes again  I m doing a reread of this series  I can t wait to delve back in the Harry Potter world Can t count how many times I ve actually reread this series but you can tell how loved it is  My books are a bit bent and the glue is falling apart but that s why I love it  Rereading it again as an adult just makes me remember my teen years  They came out so long and when I remember my little sister telling me to read it  I thought she was crazy because I was a teen and she was a child  why would I read such a book  Then out of curiosity  I picked it up and couldn t stop reading  Naturally my grandpa was the one who recommended this series for my little sister and if it wasn t for him  I wouldn t have bothered  at that time  Still one of the best series  I have ever read  Harry Potter will always be my instant favourite  The following is an excerpt from a post I wrote about the first two chapters in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone  Could t post the whole thing because it s stupidly long    if you want to read more  there s a click through at the bottom CHAPTER ONE  THE BOY WHO LIVEDCertain things are always mentioned when anyone talks about why it is that so many people love Harry Potter so very much  the hero s journey  the fish out of water thing  the wish fulfillment thing  very deliberately not using the word  escapism  here   Harry s dual role as an Everyman and as The Chosen One  etc  But something that I never really hear people point to in this context is J K  Rowling s voice as an author  This is especially astounding to me not only because it s the very first thing that drew me to this book  but also because it seems to me that her voice is what holds the rest of it together    all those other lovely  constantly shifting pieces of word and story  Right from the very first sentence of the very first chapter of the very first book  it s obvious  Mr  and Mrs  Dursley  of number four  Privet Drive  were proud to say that they were perfectly normal  thank you very much  They were the last people you d expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious  because they just didn t hold with such nonsense  Even as a thirteen year old  this seemed different to me than the usual stuff I read  It was polite yet sassy  It was saying things that were maybe a bit over my head  things about being an adult  but which nonetheless were amusing and stuck with me  Every time that I ve read it since  though it s read a bit differently to me each time  it s never failed to suck me in  to the point where if I accidentally pick the book up and read the first sentence  it s often not until I reach the end of the chapter that I realize I m still reading  I have done this on multiple occasions  including the first time I read the book    I found it abandoned on the floor of my sister s room  picked it up  read the first chapter  and then stole it from her  I still don t think she realizes I ever did that    And the way she introduces the Dursleys  Uncle Vernon with his thick beefy neck  Aunt Petunia with her long skinny one  and both of them caring way too much about what other people think of them I have always loved that our first glimpse of Harry s world is through the eyes of his aggressively normal Muggle relations  particularly the expansive Vernon Dursley  We know from later books  more on this in a bit  that while Petunia may certainly pretend a hatred and ignorance of the Wizarding World  she s not exactly what she appears  But Vernon    yeah  it s pretty much all on the surface with him  He kisses his priggish wife and chubby son goodbye  and then he spends the rest of his day alternately missing signs of the wonderful that occur practically under his nose  and pushing those he does see under the dusty rug in his brain that is reserved for Things That Cannot Be   the get ups you saw on young people     But cats reading maps  owls fluttering all over the place  people in cloaks  a whisper of the Potters       and then this  Mr  Dursley stood rooted to the spot  He had been hugged by a complete stranger  He also thought he had been called a Muggle  whatever that was  He was rattled  He hurried to his car and set off home  hoping he was imagining things  which he had never hoped before  because he didn t approve of imagination  For as much as Vernon Dursley doesn t approve of imagination  he sure does use it a lot    mostly to pretend things  In fact  both of the Dursleys are champion pretenders  pretending being the main way they get though their days  They pretend Petunia doesn t have a sister named Lily  who was a witch who went away to Witch and Wizard school and who married a wizard  Vernon pretends here that nothing odd is going on around him  squashing down reality into little bite sized pieces until it fits into his preconceived notion of What The World Should Be  until he can once again believe that he lives in a world where everyone is just like him   I m also thinking of an incident from the beginning of Chamber of Secrets when the Dursleys force Harry to stay shut away in his bedroom  pretending he s not there     this could actually describe their entire relationship with him  but there it s just made more explicit than usual  Even though I think Mr  and Mrs  Dursley are very entertaining on their own  all that excessive Dursleyishness makes what happens next seem all the more wonderful  After Vernon has finally manage to fall asleep  we meet Albus Dumbledore  who  didn t seem to realise  that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome   Dumbledore is the living embodiment of everything the Dursleys work so hard pretending doesn t exist  As soon as he puts out all the lights on Privet Drive with his  Put Outer   we forget all about the Dursleys  And then the cat who s been sitting on a wall all day  reading maps and upsetting Mr  Dursley with it s non cat behavior  turns into a severe looking woman who Dumbledore greets warmly    How did you know it was me    My dear Professor  I ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly    The interaction that follows does a lot of heavy lifting in a short amount of time  By the time it s over and everyone except Harry has left Privet Drive  we may not know exactly the details of their lives  but we do know exactly what kind of people they are  and we ve barely met them We also learn the bare bones version of Harry s story  that the reason owls have been flying around all day and people in strange cloaks ruined Mr  Dursley s day is that someone called Voldemort has    unbelievably     gone from the world  that Voldemort was unspeakably evil  to the point where people are reluctant to speak his name   and that according to McGonagall  Dumbledore is the only wizard Voldemort ever feared   You flatter me       Voldemort had powers I ll never have    Only because you re too    well    noble to use them    We learn all of this in an organic fashion  piecing together the bits and pieces of McGonagall and Dumbledore s  and later  Hagrid s  conversation  She eases us into the story without resorting to clunky exposition  This is exactly how these characters would talk if this had really happened  WHICH OF COURSE IT DID   We get just enough information to understand what s going on  and to tempt us to read further to find out more But the meat of their conversation isn t in the veiled clues about Voldemort and Harry  or even the Wizarding World  it s in the deep human emotions that these people display even from the very first chapter  It s these same deeply felt emotions that clue us in to their characters  It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss  the real reason she had been waiting on a cold hard wall all day  for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now  While everyone else was out celebrating  McGonagall    who has to be the most stubborn  immovable woman I ve ever read about    waited all day to hear news that was only going to devastate her  She is fierce and hard and very contained  and yet she feels things very deeply  It s a really nice touch that when she starts asking Dumbledore about the rumors  that Lily and James Potter are dead  that Voldemort tried to kill Harry and failed  he can only bow his head  That he was only moments before yammering on about sherbet lemons makes his lack of words here even more notable  There s real grief under there  grief he doesn t have the words for at the moment  grief perhaps he doesn t want to feel quite yet  and so he talks of Muggle sweets and scars shaped like the London Underground  And that s Dumbledore s character in a nutshell  Eccentric and kind on the outside  dark and unknowable on the inside  And then there s Hagrid  a giant of a man who shows up on a flying motorbike with a sleeping baby Harry wrapped up in a blanket  Hagrid  wild and hairy  who gives baby Harry a big whiskery kiss before letting  out a howl like a wounded dog  at the thought of leaving him there  Hagrid  who McGonagall questions  but of whom Dumbledore says   I would trust hagrid with my life    This statements tells us two things  1  That Hagrid and his appearance are strange even in the world these people come from  and 2  that Dumbledore is the kind of man who places his trust in people the general world mislikes   For the rest of Chapter One and for Chapter Two  click here   You will never want to put this book down  and when you do  it will leave you hungry for more of Harry Potter I reread this book because I was curious why my friends praised the Harry Potter books so much and why it was in all the lists on Goodreads with names like  Best Books Ever   Since I read them so long ago  I could barely remember what they were about  so I decided to read it once again This book had awesome world building  dynamic  well developed characters  a plot that was rich and definitely entertaining   and it even had some humor Harry Potter  the main character  was intelligent  courageous  and cared more about others even more than himself despite the horrible childhood he had with the Dursleys  This book gives an insightful theme about friendship and good vs  evil Although the writing could have used a little more work  since it s a children s book  I ll let this go  The delightful story makes up for the lack of a well written book One pet peeve I have about this book is that it is almost alwayscompared to Twilight  Neither of the books have anything in common  yet they are still compared  Twilight is about a girl who has to decide which boyfriend she wants to choose  Harry Potter is about an orphan boy who tries to save the world from the dark forces of evil no matter what the cost  You be the judge on which is better One part of the book that made me want to burst into tears was when Harry sees his parents in the Mirror of Erised  His deepest desire is not money or world domination like most people  but only to see his parents Once again  this book was a delightful read that anyone at any age would enjoy  not just children   Papa  So what did you think  Bronte Bronte  I loved when   well  there s one part that I loved  I mean that I really loved  That there was a couple stuff that I really loved that was cool and exciting  but I can t remember those  Well   I   loved the movie of it  except the one with Dobby  I hated that  He gives me nightmares Papa  But what did you think of the Philosopher s Stone Bronte  I liked when we in Calgary and he looked the Mirror Papa  You mean the Mirror of Erised Bronte  Yeah  I loved that one because it was cool  Papa  Yeah  but more than that   Bronte  Well what was mostly cool was that Harry could see his family  and I liked when there was the cool thing about   that   well  I thought it was silly that Harry Potter  Ron  couldn t see it  I thought that was a little silly  Because if you see your parents and he doesn t what s the thing of that Papa  So  pretty much  you thought it was cool Bronte  Mmmhmm  I really like when Harry says  Brilliant  or  Lovely   That was in the movie theatre  do you remember that Pa Papa  Yep  you know that part was in the book too Bronte  Cool   UPDATE 14 01 16  RIP Alan Rickman  you will be missed  3                                                                                       Update  Didn t think it was possible  but I enjoyed Harry Potter even more the second time round  Got me right out of my long reading slump Ok  so if you re one of the minority here that either hasn t read the novel  or finally read it  way too late I  strongly  recommend you read it  as soon as possible  I m in the latter category  but how I wished I read this book when I was even younger so I would have liked the book even more  Nonetheless  it didn t stop me from loving this book  Don t even get me started in Quidditch  One of my favourite moments throughout Harry Potter  is when they play Quidditch  Of course  there s no need for me to say that JK Rowling is just amazing and a genius  I  adored  the whole idea of Quidditch  It s like a way cooler version of football  but in the wizarding world  I would have given Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone five stars even without that amazingly clever ending   view spoiler   Who in the world would have expected  Quirrel  to be the bad guy  And of course just when I thought Slytherin won the house cup  BAM  GRYFFINDOR WINS  HOORAH    hide spoiler  So  all in all  if you re one of those people that hasn t read it yet  you re missing out a lot  I rarely say this   Even if you have watched the movies first and think there s no point reading the novels  just read it  because the novels are obviously better than the movies  the movies are amazing too   I m sorry but I cannot go without mentioning that the creator of such a phenomenon  is a female   Whoop   Most eloszor olvastam el eredetiben es nem bantam meg  Magyarul az elso konyv volt  amit elolvastam  A magyar verzioban meg mindig ott vannak az elso fejezeteknel a nyomok  amikor egy bekezdes utan bejeloltem ceruzaval  hogy itt tartok  mivel elsoskent egy bekezdest elolvasni is hostett volt Mit is mondhatnek   Nem csak az elso konyvelmenyt adta anno a Harry Potter  hanem az elso olyan dolog is volt  amiert igazan rajonghattam  Amikor elsos voltam nemcsak a konyvet olvastam el  de akkoriban jott

akkorra  amikor eloszor olvastam es eloszor varazsolt el  Szerintem sokan vannak igy  de a Harry Potter meghatarozo resze volt a gyermekkoromnak  Amikor az utolso konyv kijott magyarul  akkor

mindent szerintem J  K  Rowling  Thank you  That s all  No creo que pueda decir todo lo que siento por este libro  Sinceramente no   Por que  Porque fue el principio de muchas  muchas cosas en mi vida  El principio de una etapa  de un amor  de una inspiracion  de muchos suenos  de cambios  de una yo completamente nueva  Fue el principio de algo que todavia no alcanzo su final  y no creo que nunca lo haga  Ni siquiera creo que tenga un final  Tenia once o doce anos ese verano que mi hermano dijo  de la nada   Quiero leer los libros de Harry Potter   Los dos habiamos tenido nuestras etapas de fanaticos de chicos con las peliculas  y los libros nos llamaban mucho la atencion  Asi que  cuando el lo termino  lo agarre y lo empece a leer pensando   Que es lo peor que me puede pasar    Ahora  mas o menos seis anos despues  no sabria como responder esa pregunta Harry Potter y sus personajes me cambiaron la vida  Me hicieron pensar sobre quien era y quien queria ser  y me dieron el coraje suficiente para tratar de convertirme en esa persona  Me proporcionaron un escape cuando estaba enojada  un consuelo cuando estaba triste  un entretenimiento cuando estaba aburrida Pero bueno  hablemos de la Piedra Filosofal  No es mi libro favorito de la saga  pero le tengo un carino muy especial porque este fue el libro que empezo todo  La ingenuidad e inocencia con los que esta narrado me causan mucha ternura  y me dan esas ganas de agarrar a Harry  sacarlo del libro  hacerle una chocolatada  taparlo y darle un beso de buenas noches Por supuesto  en este libro conocemos a varios de los personajes principales que nos van a acompanar por el resto de la serie  Ron  Hermione  Hagrid  los Dursley  Dumbledore  Malfoy y muchos mas  Pero  sin embargo  aunque sea un libro que parece inocente y orientado para nenes chiquitos  tiene escenas que te dejan con la piel de gallina  JK misma dijo que la parte de la saga que ella considera mas escalofriante es la de la figura encapuchada bebiendo la sangre del unicornio en el bosque  Y  pese a que salio varios anos antes  nunca pude terminar de ver la pelicula antes de los diez anos  porque me daba miedo la parte de la pelea con Quirrell  Sin duda  este es el principio perfecto  para la saga perfecta  Oh my god I finally read this book  I m a little bit embarassed because I live in the Harry Potter generation and I haven t read all the books yet  I know I know  But I finally decided to start the series  And tell you what it was one of the best decisions I ve ever made I can t really explain what I feel for this book  Every time I went to a bookstore I was like   okay Despina you need to buy and read those books    and I didn t do it  But now that I started reading them  I feel a big obsession coming up So about the book I always believed that the hype was too big for those series but I was wrong The book totally blow me away  It had a very quick pace and I just couldn t put it down  And even though I ve watched the movies and I knew what would happen next I had the feeling that I ll discover something new and I did  It was just amazing   Totally loved the book  And I know that I m late but it s better to start reading the series late than never reading it so    My first time reading the legend that is now Harry potter and have to say it was every bit as enjoyable as everyone told me  There is constantly something new and magical happening and rowlings biggest talent is her ability to write a good mystery in this one    it s a very good  who done it  along with a coming of age story of friendships  I can t say it is the best writing ever but her storytelling abilities are brilliant there must be some Irish heritage there The characters make the book and what I feel the film didn t get right was the minor characters  they play far more prominent a role in the book Can t wait for the next one    Me encanto Me arrepiento de haber visto las peliculas antes de leer los libros y de no haberlos leeido mas de chica y ir creciendo con ellos Amo a Hermione es mi personaje favorito la mas brillante e inteligente de su clase  Ella sigue las reglas  hasta que llegan Ron y Harry  comienzan a tener una hermosa amistad y a meterse en mas problemas  Fur dieses Horbuch muss man einfach 5 Sterne geben  Ich weiss nicht wie oft ich diesen ersten Teil von Harry Potter schon gelesen   gehort habe  aber es begeistert mich doch immer wieder  Ich kenne Passagen wirklich auswendig und doch finde ich die Geschichte immer wieder spannend und will weiter und weiter lesen   horen Rufus Beck ist wirklich ein begnadeter Sprecher  Ich kenne niemanden  der allein mit seiner Stimme einen Charakter so lebendig vor meinem inneren Aug formen kann  wie er  Am meisten gefallt mir ja wie er Hagrid und McGonnegal und Vernon spricht xDProbleme habe ich ein bisschen mit Snape  weil naturlich Alan Rickmanns Stimme die Stimme eines Gottes und der feuchte Traum meiner schlaflosen Nachte ist  wtf  aber wer kann da schon mithalten Ich freue mich jedenfalls schon auf den nachsten Teil  weil ich mal wieder traurig war  als der erste Teil vorbei war  I can t believe I didn t read this book when I was younger  But better late then never right  This book was extremely well written and they re really was no boring part  There was some funny moments and some sad but all together it perfect  My friend and her family are obsessed with this series and I always made jokes about it but now  I understand  I cannot wait to start reading the second one  Rileggere Harry Potter mi ha fatto tornare bambina  E lo dico perche io non ho mai mai ripreso in mano il libro dalla prima lettura in eta molto molto  piccola   Bellissimo immergersi in una storia con cui sei cresciuta  da tempo mi ripromettevo di rileggerli  hanno sempre stazionato i miei scaffali  spostati  riposizionati  ammirati  ricordati  accarezzati  Poi l altro giorno improvvisamente per staccare un po  ho deciso che era giunto il momento di rincontrare i miei maghetti preferiti  Harry  Ron e la dapprima antipatica ma poi fantastica Hermione  Cosi persa tra i corridoi di Hogwarts cosi come nelle incantevoli magie e il fantastico mondo di creato da zia Jo sono tornata bambina  e credo continuero a tornarlo per ogni volta  o decennio     che mi verra in mente di riperdermi fra le pagine di Harry Potter  Going into this  I obviously knew that the story was going to be fantastic  as it is my sixth or seventh time reading Sorcerer s Stone  However  I had no idea that I was going to enjoy the artwork as much as I did  This book was 100  worth the purchase  It provided a brand new reading experience and made me want to start rereading the entire series  so maybe clear your schedules before picking it up As I m too lazy to completely re format the entire full review  complete with pictures and fancy bullet points  I ll just leave this little link here if you re interested  https   forwardsandbookwords wordpres   Bottom line  Buy it  Read it  Love it   This was my first time reading this  yes first time shame on me  and I am actually wondering how on earth I haven t read this book series before  I read this first one in one sitting and I m absolutely in love  Everything about this is great  the plot  the characters  the relationships between them  the wonderful quotes and the writing I am extremely happy I started this  This tiny book made me laugh and cry and it got me so close to the characters that I feel like this will now be a love for life  I always say that better late than never but I really did wish it was part of my childhood  At least I ll make sure my kids read them because this is something really priceless   It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live    It doesn t matter how often I reread this book  It s still absolutely amazing  and I love it so  so much  The characters  Hogwarts  Diagon Alley  the wizarding world    They all have a special place in my heart It s about time my owl arrived now  Hem Ingilizcesini hem de Turkcesini satin aldim  Turkcesi bitti  simdi de Ingilizce olarak okumayi deneyecegim  Ilk okuyacagim Ingilizce roman olacak  anlayabilirsem ne mutlu  Olmazsa hikaye kitaplarina devam  Magical  Just as I hoped it would be   read it a looong time ago so hardly remember how I felt about it back then   Love Rowling her writing  the plot is just right  Starting part 2 soon  my boxset came in and it rocks    I totally loved it  When it arrived in the mail I was so happy  I screamed  aaaaaaaah   while jumping up and down  so full of joy   I know very dramaqueen  This stunning edition was the perfect excuse to re read it  I loved the illustrations  they are so beautiful  I want to read it again and again and      I m very curious for the next one too  _  Diagon Alley was my favorite illustration  there was so much to look at  Jim Kay s drawing style is amazing  definatly a fan of it  Fa un certo effetto leggere i cognomi dei personaggi  che per anni hai pensato in un modo  riportati alla versione originale  Silente e Piton sono pero rimasti nella vecchia versione Salani e questo  credo crei confusione  Non si puo cambiare alcuni nomi si e altri no I disegni sono molto belli e tutta questa nuova edizione e in generale davvero una gioia da possedere  So  I love all the Harry Potter movies and since it s summer I decided to read the books as well  Before reading them though  I read some reviews here on Goodreads about the books and they weren t so happy with them  Fortunately  I gave it a chance and I really liked it  Moving on to Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets GAAAHHH  OMG OMG    if I knew it would be that good I wouldn t waste so much time afraid of this story  let me start off by saying if you watched the movies and you think you know harry so well without reading the book think again  I watched the movie twice in my life and I only watched the first one    and in my opinion the book was way WAY better    it was well explained and the world building was marvelous  D    can t wait to get started on the second book but I want to watch the first movie one more time so I can be a fair judge    but it was good    REALLY good    I love George and Fred they are my favorites  D Una maravilla de la literatura  fascinate  maravilloso  Tarde demasiado en obtener este libro  Voy a por el segundo sin dudas  Pero ahora me voy a ver la peli   5 0 Stromecek  cukrovi  darecky a nadherny ilustrovany Harry Potter  Proste Vanoce jak maji byt     First time ever reading the series and I can already tell they are going to be as AMAZING as everyone says they are   Wat een magisch boek is het ook  Heerlijk wegdromen in een andere wereld   Re read I know I ve read this book loads of times already  But it s been years since the last time I ve read it so I kind of forgot some of the scenes specially those who are not included in the movie  I still enjoyed reading this a lot  Harry  Ron and Hermione are so young  weak and naive in this book  It amazes me how their character grows throughout the series  On the other hand  I remember why I used to hate Snape  I love him alright  but in this book  he is really mean  awful and bias  XD I think I will re read the entire series   Re reading this makes me want to cry and bow down to JK Rowling  If you haven t read Harry Potter then you are missing a lot   Mr and Mrs Dursley  of number four  Privet Drive  were proud to say that they were perfectly normal  thank you very much This is my fifth time reading this book  I m still amazed and in love with Harry Potter since I ve read it the first time  The opening sentence automatically made happy when I first read this    it still does  J K  Rowling created a world about magic  courage  friendship and a boy who  after waiting ten miserable years with his Aunt Petunia  Uncle Vernon and his cousin Dudley  discovers who he really is   No matter how many times I reread this I will always be amazed by this introduction to the wizarding world  Totes got teary eyed again when Neville win those last ten points for Gryffindor  the book that started it all Rereading my original  well worn paperback copy for what must be the 30th time and I just want to hug this book forever  I also still have my first HP bookmark I ever got and it s utterly beautiful and I can t stop grinning like an idiot while reading this fantastic book The fact that I picked up my first Harry Potter book when I was 8 and I still adore this series to death at 22 years old says it all  Harry Potter has affected my life in more ways than I can say and Hogwarts will always be my home   soon  perfection   _  I read Harry Potter  at last  I have the feeling I m taking part in a huge thing  It s a nice one  of course  I liked the characters  the writing style is incredible  the plot is coherent  except a few things which are still a bit mysterious to me      Some moments really made me emotional  especially the end  I had already seen the movie  so I had the actors and actions in mind  It was not a specially good thing  because I had a lot of memories of the story  but anyway   I can never properly write a review of this book  It s better than anyone could ever put out in words  Every time I reread this book it brings back so many memories  I love how all these little hints are given in the book  but you only notice it when you read the others books in the series  I will love this forever and it will forever be my favourite series in the world  There isn t anything in the world I can fangirl this much over as the Harry Potter series  No matter how many times I re read I always love this book  but it was really fun re reading with this illustrated edition  It was so gorgeous and so much fun   The 8rd time    Still as good as i read it for the first time   P S  I ve got this 2014 edition of HP last month  I feel the sudden urge to read it again  who is to blame anyway  This is ALWAYS magical  It s like coming back home after a very long time  Deservers 5  5 stars for sure  No question asked Reread this book for like the 100th time  this was definitely a different experience though  for two reasons as well For one  I finally got my hands on the illustrated edition of the book  which makes it such an awesome and fun read  It was great to turn every page and see new and beautiful illustrations of the books wherever I looked  It definitely upped the reading experience The other thing was that this was the first time I actually read this book in English  I ve known this story since I was very little  but I was always reading it in Hungarian  which means a lot of wizardy stuff and a lot of names as well were translated into Hungarian  no idea why  really   And even though I ve been meaning to read the books in English for quite some time now  I ve only gotten around to do it now and that was a totally new  and fun twist on the books for me But to be honest  it s the same old story I love so unbelievably much  and the most important thing didn t change  I still loved every second of reading the book  it gave me this warm and very home y and special feeling that I only get when I am reading Harry Potter books  which was something I really needed because I didn t pick up these books for quite some time now and I ve been missing the world and its characters for sure So I m going to do a reread of the books in the next couple of month  Probably not marathoning them  because there are other books I d like to read soon too  but one book a month for sure  and if I can find the books in English in my town s library  I m definitely going to try out the following books in English for the first time as well  Cada vez que releo Harry Potter me vuelvo a sentir esa nina de 10 anos esperando su carta de Hogwarts  No hay nada mejor que reencontrarse con viejos amigos  viejas situaciones  viejos lugares  aunque ahora suenen diferentes por el idioma original siguen siendo mis fieles amigos de la infancia  Por cierto  vaya dialecto endiablado se gasta Hagrid  goooood   Always the innocent are the first victims   he said   So it has been for ages past  so it is now       Mars is unusually bright tonight  Unusually bright   Why didn t anyone listen to the Centaurs  I ask Always a pleasure to return to Hogwarts  And this time fitting  since the new school year started yesterday  Harry Potter non delude mai    anzi  in inglese si apprezzano molto di piu le filastrocche e gli indovinelli per la musicalita della lingua  L inglese non e difficile  il mio livello e scolastico e per di piu arrugginito ma non ho avuto difficolta quindi lo consiglio a chi  come me  se la cava ma vuole riprendere dimestichezza con la lingua  I have to give this 5 stars  A great story set in a  believable  magical world full of imaginative details  A children s classic  obviously  and so charming that everyone else will love it to  I really enjoyed it   Thanks for the prod Justin  Me encanto  Me rei mucho con algunas partes de la historia y otras me tenian tan cautivada que no que ria dejar de leerlo por ningun motivo  Los personajes  las voces  el ambiente y los lugares donde se desarrolla todo  tienen una magia tan especial como pocos libros lo consiguen  Es simplemente fenomenal   If I didn t read this book I wouldn t read books today This book Made me read This book is a book That I will read to my Children    And I m sure That they will love it This book is the most magical and kinder inspire book I can t describe how much IT means to me Wherever I go this book is with me Always  Um  can I just give this book 10 stars instead of just 5   Seriously  Thanks to this series I m the reader I am today  It s so nostalgic diving back into this world and I cannot wait to reread the rest of the series  and I never want to leave Hogwarts for this long ever again  Suka banget  Ulasan  http   bibliough blogspot com 2015 05   Satu saja

awesome now  It will forever be awesome  I m just so impressed by what an incredible start to the series this is  It s just full of win  FULL OF WIN  That is all   It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies  but just as much to stand up to our friends   Harry Potter is one of them  Since I can remember myself I loved the movies  but reading the books was the real dream  Now I finally started after so many years and I enjoyed every second of the first book Seriously  if you haven t read the books yet  do it   This book is enchanting  Enjoyed this magical  fun and hilarious book much more than I would ve imagined  D If only I read this during my childhood  I guess no one is too old for some Harry Potter  Hope it s not too late to jump on the bandwagon  p I ve read this several times now and I still give it 5 stars great book  great characters and a storyline that you will love for years I think this is a great read for Christmas even though it s not really Christmas related  Forste gang jeg har laest bogen pa engelsk   og det var jo naermest som at opleve historien pa ny  Jeg nod virkelig laesningen  og glaeder mig meget til at fortsaette  gen laesningen af resten af serien  I dont know why I took so long to read this book No matter how many times I have read this book series I find a new fondness for Harry Potter and his friends I have my full review on my blog  https   jaynikkibelthoughts wordpress    Hallelujah  I finished  It took me almost four freaking months to read this book in Spanish  but it was still an excellent book and now I want to re read the rest of the series  In English  What do I do when I m in no mood to read anything at all I re read Harry Potter  Again  After one million re reads I can safely say    it just gets better every time   3 I ve only read the first four in the series  but this first one is far and away the best of those I ve read  To me  it s a lot more playful and whimsical than the others  I forgot how much i loved harry potter  Even tho it wasn t as  magical  as when i first read them  it brought back a lot of memories  I m so glad I reread these  This was a super fast read and it held my attention from beginning to end  So excited to finally have a foot in the door and I can t wait to read the second book  Just finished reading this to Audrey  Here is her review   I like Neville because his last name is Longbottom  I like Ron s useless rat  I like when Fred and George call Ron  Ronniekins   It was interesting that the stone was right in Harry s pocket  That was funny when Norbert ripped off the head of the teddy bear and when Harry flew straight down and caught the Snitch in his mouth  One of my favorite parts was with the centaurs  but I was sad when one centaur told the truth and the other centaurs didn t believe him  It was sad when the unicorn died  Harry doesn t know anything and Hermione knows EVERYTHING   That pretty much sums it up  On to book two  Give me an HGive me an AGive me a RGive me a RGive me a yGive me a PGive me an OGive me a TGive me a TGive me an EGive me a RHARRY POTTER This is obviously a reread starting on the 18th of May and finishing in the 29th  I did a mix of audiobook and physical book  I love this series way too much  The title and author says it all  this is pure perfection  I can not express how much I adore this so I won t even try as nothing could possibly do it justice  The illustrations are breathtaking and add so much more to the story   Can t wait to keep getting the rest of the books in these stunning editions  It s Harry Potter  what more do I need to say  5 stars obviously  I love rereading this series so much  It brings back so many good memories  This was the most amazing book I ve read in a while  No  no  in the year I mean  Oh  actually  it was the best book I ve read in my entire existence  There s something so comforting about re reading a book that you absolutely love  Third or fourth time round for this one and it still feels new    The truth   Dumbledore sighed   It is a beautiful and terrible thing  and should therefore be treated with great caution  It is truth that this is the first time I read Harry Potter  And the fact that it took me eighteen years did not take away from the thrill during Harry s first Quidditch match or the unicorn search  I feel bad for poor Neville Longbottom  I adore Hagrid  Hermoine occasionally makes me want to grab some duct tape   but I love her too  I want to object to the unfair favoritism of Gryffindor s victory over Slytherin but  c mon  it s Dumbledore  These characters are whole and captivating  She started something in a coffee shop that connected her with millions of people  Hmm  Well done  J K  Rowling  You have my attention postscriptum  every  I told you so  is warranted     Re reading the series for the 4th time  3 I can t believe I finished this so fast considering I ve just gone back to uni  I still love this book  but it was different reading it after not picking it up in a while Full review to come  Beautiful  just beautiful  it feels so good to rediscover Harry Potter  the book just gets better and better each time I read it I should have read this series when my friend told me so a couple of years ago  This was really good  Such a great way to re read this beauty  Loved the illustrations though I wanted more of Hermione   Ya no he visto este libro  no se si iba a ser por un momento nada mas pero que triste porque la verdad quiero es libro y espero alcanzar a comprarlo  ME ENCANTA  lo hojee el dia que lo vi y la verdad claro que releeria HP las veces que quiera OMG  3  3 Loved it  I can t believe I ve waited for so long to read Harry Potter  it really is amazing  A whole new experience with this amazing illustrated edition  Love it to bits  3 It feels like I ve fallen in love with the series all over again  It s Harry Potter  It s illustrated  Can I give it 6 stars    I will always love this book  Forever and always   Such a magical and perfect introduction to the series  And thus began my life long love affair with books     Obviously  this is the best thing ever   how do I live in the muggle world after this Charming  lovely  I m a new fan  3 Just as magical the tenth time over   I still get the feels  Every  Time   Whooooo     Review to come  Re read    It seems like every one of you guys is re reading this series at the moment   and you have no idea how badly I want to join in  Really  But I just can t squeeze it in  But  with the eighth book coming out this summer  I figured it was about time I revisited this series  at least in spirit  and tell you my HP story  So  here s the thing  my brother was the one who loved this series before me  He had the books  the movies  even a poster that he bought online when the Goblet of Fire came out   Of Mad Eye Moody  his favorite character   He tried to get me into it  but every time I picked it up  I could only read a chapter or two before losing interest  It just wasn t for me  at the time  What was I into instead     You guessed it  I was a Twihard  There is a lot I regret about my younger self  but reading the entire Twilight saga when I was 10 years old has to cut the cake  It was not a good influence on me  at all  I m surprised that I even kept my friends  The irony is that  when I was in 6th grade  my homeroom teacher actually asked me to read something else other than Twilight  My obsession was that bad  And to please her  I picked up Harry Potter and The Sorcerer s Stone  which I was sure I would pick up and abandon within the next hour  and then I could go back to my sparkly vampires  That s not what happened  At all  I quite literally devoured it  I guess I had finally reached the age where a story about a young boy who discovers he s a wizard appealed to me  My brother had kind of left the Wizarding World behind  just in time for me to throw myself  headfirst  into the masses  That didn t stop us  though  from having long  intellectual debates over the dinner table about whether Slytherins were really all evil  Nah   what our Patronus would be  I think mine would ve been a cat  I told my brother that he d be a donkey  but he doesn t seem to like that very much   or who was better  Sirius or Moody   Come on  Sirius   In less than three months  I read the entire series  Then I went back and re read it  Then I went online and read fan fiction  Harry Potter pretty much possessed me from the age of twelve to thirteen  Even after all of this time  I still dig through the fandoms  because this series is a place I go to for comfort  And luckily  thank god  it was in reading this series that I finally sobered from my Twilight obsession and came to realize its inferiority  So  in my mind  J K  Rowling is basically the Goddess of Literature  By the way  I might as well add  my favorite character is Draco Malfoy AND I AM NOT SORRY   Review on Blog   http   yabookaholic123 blogspot ie 20   Oh my God  Why did I wait so long to read Harry Potter    What the hell was I doing  On second note though  I m glad that I did wait because I wouldn t have been able to get these beautiful covers from Bloomsbury  I grew up with the Harry Potter movies  I watched them as they released and every Christmas and Easter the tv would just be full of all the Harry Potter movies  I know people say that you aren t a fan if you just watched the movies  but I was a fan of the movies and now I have decided to read the books  One aspect that I am delighted to have done is watched the movies first  As I went through and read this book  I could see the movie playing in my head  I saw Hagrid  Hogwarts  Daniel Radcliffe as Harry  Emma Watson as Hermoine and so on  I had their voices in my head and well  for me anyway  it increased my enjoyment of the book I just adored this story so much that I even completed this book in a day  A day  people  that must be a first  But well what can I say  I just fell in love    J  K  Rowling s writing is fabulous and well she is a queen  She created Harry Potter and the world he lives in  She is simply awesome for that and I fell into this story so easily it was like returning to a lifetime favourite even though I was just reading this for the first time I can t wait to continue on with this series  You all know that one of my 2016 goals was to read the whole Harry Potter series  So I plan on reading a Harry Potter book a month if I can  P But that s the plan anyway  I still just can t believe I waited so long and I seriously can t wait to read the rest  OMG          How the hell did I leave Harry Potter till now  So this book definitely deserves more than 5 Stars DEFINITELY    I will not write a review about this book or any of the harry potter books  I think    because they are just too precious and whatever I will write wont be enough to explain the depth of emotions I had while reading it What I can say is that Ive read Page 300 at least 5 times before I went on with the book  I just loved chapter 17 it was full of MAGIC Also  I wish some of the things that were in the book were actually in the movie like when Ron  Harry  and Hermione were on the 3rd floor and the passed the 3 headed dogs  and where they had to drink from the potion bottles where there was a letter with a somehow riddle Or when Hermione and Potter were trying to escape the dragon on the highest tower But I guess thats what makes the books better  I just wonder sometimes how would life be without Hogwarts or without Harry  My childhood all revolves around this magical place  I m glad J K Rowling had such an incredible imagination and that her books were made into movies      I am re doing this review because I feel like my other review was not perfect so I am going to make it even better  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone by J K  Rowling  Rowling s storytelling was absolutely amazing  The characters were well developed  The story was easy to get  There was never a dull moment in this book  There was tones of action and funny little moments in the books that made this book 100 times better than what it actually was   When my dad read this book to my siblings  I was far too young to really understand the meaning and the magical moments of this book  Now that I am older and actually got into adventure and mystery books  I fully understand why this book got so much praise  It is so amazing  I read the illustrated version of this book and all I can say is that it made this book even better than it was before  The pictures were a perfect way to really get a image in your head if you never watched the movie or you just have a hard time picturing  The illustrations were also gorgeous  I loved how Jim Kay drew what he thought the characters looked like  my sisters discovery   He used what he thought the characters looked like in his head and not in the movie   I really really really loved this book  I recommend this book to anyone  This book was amazing and I really want to read the other books in the series  xoxo Bebe I love the Harry Potter series  as someone who grew up with books I see the joy of a book series that grows with you getting progressively darker and more complicated as the characters too age Add to that the magic of feeling different and discovering a special world waiting for you to explore  with an exotic pet  loyal friends  evil and magic  monsters and more Lots of appealing details to be snatched at for merchandising   But also simple things   the cupboard under the stairs  I remember playing there as a child  to parental frustrations While the first story is a children s book  the world has a timeless appeal for anyone who felt that bit different to everyone else  for adults who ve managed to retain their wonder and that love of magic   And just to brag have you seen the illustrated  Jim Kay  version  GO CHECK IT OUT  NOW  It is a thing of beauty  The world is brought to life with quirky colourful detail and each page is a joy to turn I bonded with strangers today  each of us hugging the book and beseaching  I need this  Santa in the form of my most beloved and most wonderous hubby in the history of hubbys agreed with me  D There will be much squeeing at Christmas   I am not ashamed  Less Review  more Rumgelaber Ich las Band 1 das erste Mal 1998 1999 im Alter von 11 12 Jahren und bin die Jahre uber mit Harry  Ron und Hermine aufgewachsen  Ich bezweifle  dass ich jemals wieder so aufgeregt uber die Erscheinung eines neuen Buches sein werde  wie ich es bei Harry Potter gewesen bin  Hogwarts ist Teil meines Herzens  aber nicht so wie es Mittelerde geschafft hat  Dennoch war diese Buchreihe meine Kindheit Jugend eine wichtige Konstante fur mich  Einige Erinnerungen blitzen dabei immer wieder auf  Ich habe die ersten Zeilen von Band 1 bei meiner Freundin daheim gelesen  Band 4 im Auto auf Kreta  bei Band 5 sehe ich mich in einem Zugabteil  ich sehe mich Band 6 vorbestellt von der Post abholen   als Band 7 erschien war ich zu einer Feier eingeladen und traurig  dass ich das Buch nicht um Mitternacht holen konnte  da schenkte mir der Bruder meines damaligen Freundes vollig uberraschend das Buch und ich sass wahrend der Feier auf einer Band im Saal und las  Das war schon  Ich finde es toll  dass wir alle in Hogwarts waren  auf die eine oder andere Art  sei es durch Bucher oder durch die Filme  durch Horbucher oder Tumblr  Ich mag Dinge  die viele Menschen auf eine positive Art miteinander verbinden und dass J K  Rowling so etwas mit ein paar wundervollen Buchern erreicht hat  treibt mir jedes Mal fast Tranen in die Augen   3 I re read this children s classic to refresh my memory for the details  I was going to  The Wizarding World of Harry Potter  at Universal Studios in Orlando  and I wanted to be  up  on everything so that I could discuss it with my grandchildren  The book was just as amazing the second time around  If you have never been to  The Wizarding World of Harry Potter   I can HIGHLY recommend it  We went  through  the brick wall  and it was all there   Diagon Alley  The Leaky Cauldron  Ollivander s Wand Shop  Gringott s     And then we took the Hogwarts Express  from Platform 9 3 4  of course  to Hogsmeade  and the enchantment continued  We gorged on chocolate frogs and all flavored jelly beans  bought Gryffindor cloaks for the children and watched them cast magic spells  in certain designated spots  with their interactive magic wands  went into Hogwarts where the pictures were all talking to each other    and so much more  The only thing missing was Voldemort   which was probably a very good thing for the younger visitors I felt like I was actually there https   www universalorlando com harr    I could never be more in awe of a book than I have been after reading The Sorcerer s Stone of The Harry Potter series  It s that refreshing feeling you get   when you partake on a whole  new  enchanting journey to fantastical worlds with interesting characters  extraordinary abilities and mythical creatures   that makes it even more magical and exciting We ve owned the HP Books for almost 13 years now  And I m so glad that I waited for the right time to read this  From being a series I heard a lot about but never really touched  this starter rose to the top of my ladder and is currently one of my all time favorites  However  it is almost 2015 and I really have some catching up to do   9 5 10 Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone  contains a fantasy world full of wizards  Muggles  unicorns  centaurs  goblins  ghosts and many more awe inspiring creatures  The Harry Potter universe is an universe with a variety of terms unknown to the reader  However  as the novel progresses the reader gets familiarised with the terms and somehow seems to grow fond of them  The writing style is impeccable  it contains depth  humor  honesty and humanness  Rowling shows the reader the world from the eyes of an almost eleven year old and after his birthday the eyes of an eleven year old boy  The story line is simple yet fantastic and amazing  It is realistic and imaginable yet not realistic in the real world  The characters have depth  There is character development  There is nothing wrong that I can point out  I simply and irrevocably love this novel to bits  I am henceforth a proud Potterhead    Always use the proper name for things  Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself      Professor Dumbledore  p 216   There are all kinds of courage   said Dumbledore  smiling   It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies  but just as much to stand up to our friends      Professor Dumbledore about Neville  p 221    There won t be a child in our world who doesn t know his name   La prima volta che incontrai Harry Potter avevo nove anni Dei miei zii erano venuti a trovarci e avevano pensato di portarmi in regalo dei libri per bambini di cui avevano sentito parlare molto bene  Fu cosi che mi ritrovai tra le mani  i primi due volumi della saga di J K  Rowling A ripensarci ora mi viene quasi da ridere  ma devo confessare di non essere stata molto felice dei miei regali quel giorno  L imbarazzante verita  e che li lasciai a prendere polvere sullo scaffale per ben piu di un mese Voi vi chiederete  MA PERCHE  Ebbene  il mio raffinato senso artistico di marmocchia  che se ne infischiava bellamente del saggio detto  non si giudica un libro dalla copertina   era rimasto profondamente offeso dalle illustrazioni del volume ed io proprio non volevo saperne di sfogliare quell orrore  Grazie al cielo  ad un certo punto mi ritrovai a corto di altre letture interessanti e allora decisi che vabbe    magari una chance al tizio smunto con il cappello fatto a testa di topo  la potevo anche dare    ah Basto il primo capitolo Finii la Pietra Filosofale e la Camera dei Segreti in un baleno e non mi sembrava possibile di dover attendere chissa quanto  prima di poter finalmente leggere il seguito Quel giorno  qualcosa cambio Quel giorno  aveva avuto inizio la passione che avrebbe per sempre segnato la mia infanzia e di conseguenza  anche la mia vita adulta  Harry mi aveva trovato  e con lui avevo ricevuto la lettera  con lui ero salita sull Hogwarts Express e avevo conosciuto Ron ed Hermione  con lui ero stata smistata del Cappello Parlante  con lui ero andata a lezione di incantesimi  con lui avevo volato su una scopa e con lui avevo vissuto fantastiche avventure in un mondo magico  che e il sogno di ogni bambino E  difficile spiegare a chi non lo ha vissuto in prima persona  che cosa significa crescere con Harry Potter  Quelli che lo hanno fatto  conserveranno i ricordi per il resto della loro vita  il modo in cui J K  Rowling ci ha permesso di credere in qualcosa di piu grande  qualcosa di meraviglioso  qualcosa di magico Quanti di noi hanno creduto davvero di poter ricevere la lettera via gufo  una volta compiuti gli undici anni  Quanti di noi hanno considerato Hogwarts  con il suo salone dalle tavole imbandite  con i suoi passaggi segreti e le scale  a cui piace cambiare   con il suo campo da quidditch e le sale comuni piene di studenti  una seconda casa  E quanti di noi hanno pianto al leggere la dedica di Zia Jo all inizio del settimo ed ultimo libro  Perche si  era proprio dedicato a noi  quell ultimo baluardo della nostra infanzia  A noi  che ormai grandi  eravamo  rimasti con Harry fin proprio alla fine   E come potevano chiederci adesso  di lasciarlo andare Be guardatevi intorno    ovviamente la maggior parte di noi non lo ha fatto  La creativita e la vitalita del fandom negli anni non accenna a diminuire  Siti  forum  fanarts  saggi  dissertazioni  fanfictions  parodie e tags su youtube  canzoni  addirittura esiste il wizard rock  un vero e proprio genere musicale   una trilogia di musicals amatoriali  ormai famosa quasi quanto l opera originale   parchi a tema  partite di quidditch  raduni annuali  podcast e prossimamente persino un prequel cinematografico  realizzato interamente grazie alla collaborazione dei fans  L uscita di Deathly Hallows Part 2 potra essere stata la fine di un era  ma noi sappiamo benissimo come tornare a spalancare le porte di Hogwarts  quando ne avvertiamo il bisogno Grazie Joanne Kathleen Rowling Grazie di cuore per Harry  per Hermione  per Ron  per Luna  per Ginny  per Neville  per Draco e per tutti gli altri Grazie per essere stata la mia infanzia Lascio qui sotto la mia traduzione di un post che riassume perfettamente il sentimento di un intera generazione  Avete tutti un idea di quanto Harry Potter abbia cambiato la letteratura  si  Voglio dire  L ha rivitalizzata  Ha fatto esplodere la scena letteraria  Il New york Times e stato costretto a creare una lista di bestsellers esclusivamente dedicata alla letteratura per l infanzia  soltanto perche Harry Potter esisteva  Harry Potter ha cambiato il modo in cui si legge Quando usci il primo libro  la maggior parte di noi bambini nati negli anni 90   non sapeva ancora leggere  Ma siamo cresciuti in un mondo dove tutti  tutti  tutti leggevano Harry Potter  non importa che eta avessero  siamo cresciuti in un mondo dove la storia piu popolare del pianeta  era un fantasy per bambini E  difficile a volte  afferrare quanto Harry Potter non sia solamente un libro  Quanto quella che e praticamente una serie di romanzi divertenti  interessanti e piuttosto ben scritti  sia una cosi enorme parte delle nostre vite  una pietra di paragone culturale  un punto di riferimento veramente universale  la cosa intorno alla quale molte persone hanno costruito la loro vita  la base per tutte le storie che avremmo letto e guardato in futuro    per tanti  il primo libro che abbiamo mai amato Quanto  cosi tanti di noi  non possono definirsi  fans  di Harry Potter  perche sarebbe come essere  fan  di  be  dei propri polmoni Non e questione piacere o non piacere  E  parte di noi e basta  _ loved it Relectura en 2014   Primer lectura en el ano 2000  No se como hacer una resena de Harry Potter porque le tengo demasiado carino  Es una de mis sagas preferidas desde que lo lei por primera vez hace 14 anos  y ahora que empece a releerla en ingles  britanico  hay otra version para USA  me gusta todavia mas  No se si se trata de que ahora entiendo cosas que antes no o si es porque hubo detalles que se perdieron en la traduccion  como la forma de hablar de Hagrid  pero se me desperto una vez mas esa semi obsesion que me atacaba cada vez que terminaba uno de los libros  que tantos anos se hicieron rogar   Por si alguien aun no lo conoce  Harry Potter es la historia de un nino huerfano que vive junto a sus horribles tios y su horrible primo  y que un dia descubre gracias a una carta que es en realidad un mago y que debe comenzar sus lecciones en el Colegio Hogwarts de Magia y Hechiceria  dirigida por el genialisimo Profesor Dumbledore  Al conocer este nuevo mundo oculto para los muggles  humanos sin magia  se entera de que el es conocido como  el nino que vivio  por haber sobrevivido a la maldicion que le hechara un tenebroso mago  ahora derrotado  de quien practicamente nadie se atreve a decir el nombre  Harry sintio una ola de excitacion  No sabia lo que iba a pasar    pero seria mejor que lo que dejaba atras  Hay unas cuantas cosas que no recordaba  O quizas visto desde otro modo  me acordaba mucho mas de lo que esperaba para todos los anos que pasaron  No recordaba por ejemplo que los alumnos de Hogwars usaban sombrero  culpo a las peliculas de eso  Es un libro realmente introductorio porque logicamente ni Harry ni nosotros conocemos el enorme mundo de los magos  Pero la forma en que nos enteramos de todo es genial  esta todo compaginado de forma fantastica para que aun entre el caudal de informacion magica haya un argumento muy atrapante  Esta muy  muy bien escrito Me encanta el humor inocente que tiene  es una historia inteligente y simple a la vez en la que ocurre de todo  Hay practicamente una historia individual por capitulo pero no se siente apresurado en absoluto Tiene accion  aventura  humor  drama  intriga  fantasia a borbotones    Los personajes son mas que queribles  y mas conociendo la historia de los siete libros  y como es una re lectura ahora estoy prestando atencion a detalles que en una primer leida no note  Y algunos de ellos creo que hasta hacen referencia a cosas que pasaran mucho mas adelante  Las cuatro casas se llaman Gryffindor  Hufflepuff  Ravenclaw y Slytherin  Cada casa tiene su propia noble historia y cada una ha producido notables brujas y magos  Mientras esten en Hogwarts  sus triunfos conseguiran que las casas ganen puntos  mientras que cualquier infraccion de las reglas hara que los pierdan  Al finalizar el ano  la casa que obtenga mas puntos sera premiada con la copa de la casa  un gran honor  Espero que todos ustedes sean un orgullo para la casa que les toque  Si no lo leyeron y les gusta la fantasia  que estan esperando   Harry Potter es un clasico moderno  Creci junto a estos libros y los adoro  adoro a sus personajes  excepto a los Malfoy   me maravilla la imaginacion de la autora y  como muchos  espero que algun dia decida retomar alguna partecita de este universo genial que ha creado  quizas con la historia de Dumbledore   no seria genial   Recomendado 100 Resena de Fantasia Magica Re read      finished 9 13 13  audio I ve read all of the Harry Potter books so many times that I don t know what the actual number this is    but honestly  I think the first couple books I haven t read as many times as 4  5  and 6  And 7  It was SO AWESOME re reading HP1 again  Firstly  JIM DALE  Hi  I love JIm Dale  and JD reading audio  Fantabulous  I haven t re read Harry Potter since I started blogging over a year and a half ago and it was totally different experience re reading as a more critical reader  I definitely had a different view of the book as far as world building and writing style go  I absolutely loved the audio and it was really great to re read seeing as this was probably the most accurate book to movie adaptation  I definitely pictured the movie as I was reading which did add an extra something special because I could really visualize it as well  Full review originally postedHERE on The Book Addict s Guide  I ve re read the entire Harry Potter series countless times  seriously  I ve lost count    Then again  I didn t keep track when I first started all these re reads  and before I started getting back into reading  whenever I needed a book  Harry Potter was my go to  I d finish the series and then just start all over again and for a while there  it was pretty much the only thing I read except for a few Meg Cabot books  I felt like it was time for a re read because I really missed reading this series and I toiled over the fact that I m falling further and further behind on my reading and wasn t going to have time to do it  Lucky for me  I had plenty of friends who assured me that the audio was amazing and the perfect way to do my re reads  And they were right It s hard to review a book I ve re read countless times and that everyone already knows so well but I m going to do my best  I will say that as a blogger  re reading this series was kind of an entirely different experience  I was paying more attention to how the characters interacted and MUCH more attention to the world building which  BRAVO  JK Rowling because everything about this book is fantastic  Having more of a analytical approach to reading actually enhanced this experience for me because I was paying so much more attention to all of the details and the foreshadowing was that much more interesting as well I loved going through this discovery with Harry again for the first time  Obviously the movies have to cut things out and some minor things are switched around  like which character said what  for production  but Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone being the first book  this is definitely the closest book to movie adaptation of the series  One of the best parts about this movie series being so big as well  and also have watched the movies countless times too  is that listening to the audio was like watching the movie in my head  It s great to be able to picture the characters in full  Usually when I read  I end up picking up on the author s details of character descriptions  or sometimes I don t    Oops  but I don t usually see a specific face in my head  Since I don t know the  person   it s hard for me to make up a face to match  I know the Harry Potter movies so well that it s easy for me to picture each and every character as well as their mannerisms so it just makes the audiobook that much more lively for me I think the thing I was most impressed with was re living all of the world building  In some fantasy books  the world building stops at the world and really  there can be some pretty amazing worlds out there  But JK Rowling right off the bat gets so detailed  She s clearly thought every small thing out and plotted this whole world out for her readers which is really why I think these books are so amazing and almost feel real  We not only see the characters but we see their families  their friends  their teachers  We see Hogwarts but it also has ghosts  houses  rules  sports  classes  books  potions    all of which even have their OWN histories  There s the wizarding world outside of Hogwarts with shops  communities  subdivisions  strategically placed wizards and squibs in the Muggle world  EVERYTHING IS THOUGHT OUT  Which is also why I really think this world is real and JK is just trying to BOLDLY TELL US that there really is magic out there  Where do i begin with the Harry Potter series i don t know  as so many people have read JK Rowling s epic series and it is loved on an international scale that is just so huge i feel dizzy just contemplating all the fans and admierers of it  I began reading Harry Potter when i was aged eleven and it was kind of ironic that the main character was the exsact same age  so i was able to instantly relate to Harry and immediately fall in love with his journey of discovery  It was so creatively beautiful and imaginative beyond belief that i was bowled over by JK Rowlings creation  as personally to me it is one of the greatest fantasy creations within literature and i love it as much now as i did aged 11  Hogwarts was the dreamlike place that i would visit whenever i daydreamed at school or took a nap and it will always have a special place in my heart  especially as i did not have an easy time of it at various schools and like many a child i consistantly wished that Hogwarts exsisted so that i could escape from everyday life and become a witch who posessed a couldron and a broomstick  I also remember throughout that particular year in my life of looking longingly at the letterbox and eagerly anticipating the post arriving  so that i could examine the mail for a hogwarts symbol branded envolope  sadly i had no luck  perhaps mine had got lost in the post     It was the begining of not only a love and passion for fantasy literature in general but also it was the main catalyst that sparked my creativity and imagination  which i hoped one day to put to good use and make the most of  JK Rowling is such an inspiration to all and to amateur writers everywhere  in saying that you do not need to have celebrity status  loads of money  lots of contacts especially within the lititary world to be able to write and to be able to create a masterpiece  because JK Rowling proved everyone wrong  including a lot of critics  and by putting her heart and soul on paper she became a legend  If you have failed to pick up a Harry Potter book then  apart from myself crying in shock  i would urge that you do so  as they are loved and cherished by adults and children alike and it is that because they are so universal to all that they are so much enjoyed and loved by all    There were a hundred and forty two staircases at Hogwarts  wide  sweeping ones  narrow  rickety ones  some that led somewhere different on a Friday  some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to jump  Then there were doors that wouldn t open unless you asked politely  or tickled them in exactly the right places  and doors that weren t really doors at all  but solid walls just pretending  It was also very hard to remember where anything was  because it all seemed to move around a lot  The people in the portraits kept going to visit each other  and Harry was sure the coats of armor could walk  Honestly  I don t know anybody who d refuse to even entertain the thought of attending a school for wizards  Yes  the experience itself may be daunting and scary but really  most of us would welcome an opportunity to escape the mundane world and enter one of the fantastical  And such is what  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone  is  an introduction to world that you could never have imagine may possibly exist I ve already lost count as to how many times I ve re read the Harry Potter series  The plot and characters are well known and described in many reviews  so I will not address them  I don t even think I need to convince anybody to read these books and or watch the movies  Harry Potter and the magical world that J K  Rowling has creating  Leaky Cauldron  Diagon Alley  Hogwarts  in the first book alone have already become household names the world over that you have to be living under a rock if you haven t been aware of this phenomenon   Welcome   said Hagrid   to Diagon Alley  Harry wished he had eight more eyes  He turned his head in every direction as they walked up the street   trying to look at everything at once  the shops  the things outside them  the people doing their shopping There were shops selling robes  shops selling telescopes and strange silver instruments Harry had never seen before  tottering piles of spell books  quills  and rolls of parchment  potion bottles  globes of the moon   I believe that I maybe counted as one of the millions of readers worldwide who wished something better for Harry Potter  especially being made aware of the miserable treatment done to him by his Muggle relatives  I too wish to know the contents of the mysterious letters which were detailedly addressed to the exact location of Harry  I cheered when Hagrid finally got a hold of Harry and conveyed to him the message that he ll be attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry that coming term   Harry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place  It was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four long tables  where the rest of the students were sitting  I was looking forward as well to the process of selecting a wizard s wand and what exactly it is that aids magic  Every Ollivander wand has a core of a powerful magical substance  Mr  Potter  We use unicorn hairs  phoenix tail feathers  and the heartstrings of dragons  No two Ollivander wans are the same  just as no two unicorns  dragons  or phoenixes are quite the same  And of course  you will never get such good results with another wizard s wand  Instead of retelling the plot of which most people are already familiar with  I d like to post here my favorite scenes and quotes from the book itself  One treat was finding out the type of delicious treats available to those who travel aboard the Hogwarts Express  What she did have were Bertie Bott s Every Flavor Beans  Droobles Best Blowing Gum  Chocolate Frogs  Pumpkin Pasties  Cauldron Cakes  Licorice Wands  and a number of other strange things Harry had never seen in his life  I didn t expect the fast and true friendship that would form between Harry  Hermione and Ron  Early on we ve managed to catch glimpses of the personalities of the two boys but of Hermione  I snickered  I hope you re pleased with yourselves  We could all have been killed    or worse  expelled  One item  aside from a witch s wand  that I d like to have is most probably Harry s Invisibility Cloak  Just think of the possibilities  And yes  I wouldn t pass up the chance to stand in front of the Mirror of Erised   I show not your face but your heart s desire   No matter what Dumbledore may say that  It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest  most desperate desire of our hearts  The best laugh out loud moment of the entire book would be  Devil s Snare  Devil s Snare   what did Professor Sprout say     it likes the dark and the damp     So light sa fire   Harry choked  Yes    of course    but there s no wood   Hermione cried  wringing her hands  Have you done mad   Ron bellowed   Are you a witch or not  But what would make one continue reading and ultimately finishing the Harry Potter series  It s because  like Harry and the rest of the magical world  we all want to know what exactly happened that night when Voldemort tried to kill the Potter family  How was it possible that Harry  as a mere baby at the time  survived  Would the friendship between Harry  Ron   Hermione survive the test of being constantly thrust into the limelight fraught with dangers  Why does Prof  Snape hate Harry so much  that you couldn t help tagging him as the one trying to steal the Sorcerer s Stone all this time   The truth   Dumbledore sighed   It is a beautiful and terrible thing  and should be treated with great caution   Book Details  Title Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s StoneAuthor J K  RowlingReviewed By Purplycookie Wow  such a great book which I loved rereading over the past two days  I can t wait to get onto reading Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets  even though I don t think that one s as good  Anyway  let me dive straight into my thoughts 1  The educational feel   it s strangely awesome  So different to a regular school like any of us go to  and the magic and wizardry is so awesome  There s so much inside Hogwarts to find out about and it s been developed with great depth  There s so many little intricate things  too  that really add to the world 2  The characters are really nice  and I especially enjoy reading about Harry  Ron and Hermione  and I feel as though in many ways I can relate to them and would love to be friends with them in real life  The other characters are really great too  loads of different personalities and types in there 3  Very simple and easy to follow plot for the most part  but despite this it doesn t always go the way you feel   it s very rarely predictable  I like how whilst you may imagine Harry to be a perfect character  he s still got rebellious streaks at times 4  The writing is nice and descriptive  It s not the best  but J K  Rowling deals with the talents that she has and her descriptions are always fun to read about  and really bring the world alive in front of your eyes  Some parts could possibly be considered slightly repetitive in the way she writes  but it s still very good and leaves you wanting more 5  So much better than the movies which aren t all that good  or at least in comparison to the books  I don t like how people say they are true  intense fans and wept when it was over yet haven t even read the books because they  don t see a point  or  cannot be bothered   The true fans are the ones that read the books and appreciate the literature  which is much more impacting than the movies  You connect so much more with everything and find out intricate details that the films don t have  In some ways the movies seem overrated and the books underrated  by the majority of non readers   But maybe it s just me     Oh  and I don t like how some people say the series is for kids  because it s not  I know a few adults that say that and it s annoying    Word count  only about 70 000  seriously  I remember it being longer    A perception of a child is a curious thing Rating  a mesmerizing start   WARNING    SPOILERS AHEAD   As I didn t have an opportunity to post updates as I read I shall include a few loose observations I made along the way  and disguise them as a review  I hope this will be agreeable to most Is this a perfect book  Of course not  It has some serious faults that  even as a child  I found mind boggling  But the world is captivating  characters relatable and varied  and narration delightful  yep  that s my opinion  Now bumble off  A few loose notes  not all positive   RANDOM  Food   this was  as it still is  one of the greatest wonders of Hogwarts  The moment I ve read about the feast at the beginning of the year  I was 100  in  Can you imagine it  No cooking  no cleaning and a varied choice of food available on a table  Every single day  Wow  Just wow  Don t get me wrong  I love the fact it s an awesome castle  I do  But the food is what made me weep about it being only but fiction A way Harry  Ron and Hermione became friends  Now  if you haven t read the book  don t continue with this review  You have been warned  I never understood why did Hermione feel she has to lie to the teachers about what happened with the troll  Couldn t she just tell the truth  That she didn t know about the troll and was sitting in a bathroom  Harry and Ron could have said  as it was true  in fact  that they meant to grab her and go to the common room  That in all the commotion  as they were already on their way to the Griffindor tower  there was no time to look for a teacher to handle it  There  No need to lie  Nobody did anything wrong  I never understood why she felt she has to lie  Maybe we should just leave it alone before we  I  break it   I love Weasley twins  There s no getting around that  Every single time they appear they bring a smile to my face  They have always been my utmost favourite characters  Knowing people like that is awesome  I d love for them to be a part of my life As well as their friend  Lee Jordan  His commentary of quidditch matches never ceases to be entertaining  It was such a cool idea to not only describe the action  but also have an additional commentary of one of the characters  Brilliant move on Rowling s part As They were searching for the info about Flamel I couldn t help but appreciate the internet XD Can you imagine Harry whiping out his Iphone and googling it  Technology    Getting rid of it is half the magic XD That s what makes it timeless The way Hagrid tells them that there s nothing to fear in the forest as long as they stay with him    aaaaand then tells them they ll split into two groups  Lol  Isn t that fun How the fuck did Harry and Ron manage to NOT feel something is strangling them until Hermione mentioned it  WTF And how stupid do you have to be not to move out of the way when your friends jump down  Wouldn t it suck if they land on top of you Ok  nuff with the randomness  So what is my final judgement My biggest gripeThat this book has one  serious flaw  Why for the fucks sake are the spells traps protecting the stone presented alongside with ways of getting through them  Why not enchant figures to simply kill all that enter  Why put the un openable door in  and a key nearby  instead of destroying it or Dumbledor keeping it in his pocket  How convenient  Why go through the hassle of conjuring freaky flames just to give a riddle alongside with potions to let you pass through them  Verdict  stupid fuckery  That s what always felt wrong to me in this book  The ending doesn t make much sense  Why   This whole thing lacks gravitas  Why would you make it into a game  Dumbledor is a sick fuck  that s why  But why wouldn t other teachers protest   They were supposed to protect the stone  not make it into a game  And I still don t like Snape  Now more than ever  No  I don t care much about his contribution to the cause   he s an asshole  Period  Charm of Alan Rickman sometimes makes me forget how unpleasant he s in the books  Damn  this man is sexy  That voice   flails I don t  however  have a problem with them winning the house cup  McGonagall was a bitch about subtracting points the night they transported Norbert  She took 150 points  Dumbledore gave them back And if you think about all the stupid subtractions Snape was allowed to do    Nope  it s not unfair  They deserved it  I m with Dumbledore on that  Trying to save the world against all odds deserves at least a pat on the back  Even if the threat was a bit   This book doesn t not deserve 5 stars on its own  I absolutely understand people that upon reading it weren t impressed and couldn t comprehend the hype  I have a whole heap of reasons for my love of the series  which I will post when the group read is done   But even thought it s not perfect  I still appreciate many element s of the first instalment  like not dumbing it down the kids  which authors often do  and that s just insulting   The humour  the magic  captivating world  relatable characters  hardships instead of overwhelming sweetness    It s still a very good book  Just not perfect     One surprising observation   I like the Polish translation more than the original version   gasp  I m shocked too  I don t think I ve ever said anything quite as sacrilegious as this before  but that s the truth  The language is more varied and complex  the words chosen to convey simple meanings are much more subtle giving the story more depth  Even the songs  rhymes and names of people and places are     often  better  More smooth  More interesting  Less awkward  That discovery was an utter shock to me  It s not just a matter of not loosing things along the way  it s a matter of making them finer  more polished  After comparing both I can t continue to read Polish versions without any regret  And done  That was a very pleasurable experience  I like how the words flow freely and the imagination even more so  To just come up with all these crazy things that happen at Hogwarts one would have to be a genius  Ms Rowling obviously is  Harry s terrible home is just perfect   that is EXACTLY what kids love to hear  little weak nerdy boy goes from sad  sad place to becoming a hero with his peers  Actually  this also goes for adults  We all need someone to root for  and boy  Harry makes you want to root for him in a big way  He always stands up for his friends  That poor boy Draco Malfoy has me in a twist  however  I wish there were some way to make him happy  to wash away the constant sneer on his face  I do have issues with the underdog  and however much Draco seems to be from the bullying In Crowd  I still want him to turn around and become part of the friends  Do not ask me why  because he has been nothing but terrible in the whole book  Ms Rowling must have sown a seed of sympathy into his character somewhere  because I can t let the feeling go  Especially at the end  with the hall decked in Slytherin colors  I hated  not that Harry and his team won  no   I hated that they changed the colors  took away all the decorations    What a disappointment that must have been  when they were already celebrating their victory  But  that is me  I will always try to get everyone up on the winners  podium with me  I shall now move on to the next book in the series   how lucky am I that I have six more  The Philosopher s Stone  the book which started it all  The book which taught us such everyday words as  muggle   Quidditch  and  Hogwarts   the book which introduced us to Voldemort and Dumbledore and the book which made 9 3 4 a very special number  It s hard to remember life before these things became significant and 15 years on they are still captivating the imaginations of millions around the world  It is incredibly difficult for me right now to think of Harry Potter as just a book and not the phenomenon that it has become  For so many people around the world it is much more than a set of books and it seams to do them an injustice to strip them back to just words on a page when they have become so much else  THE GOOD BITSMy favorite thing about this book is that you can split the readers of this book into two catagories  the first time readers who are discovering the world and the fiftieth time readers who are reading it just to remember what they learnt from it and to see if they can learn anything more  It s because of this that I love the book so much  it will always stand for those two things and will entertain both adults and children  it can address so many issues whilst remaining heartfelt and entertaining  You can read these books again to both rediscover your childhood and to discover more wisdom  Now when I reread the books I don t often think of how gripping it used to be I always think of the parallels and metaphors that can be drawn from it and it s easy to forget that as a child I was completely lost in this fictional world of goblins and ghosts and magical things  I loved that these books also teach as well as they entertain  There are so many morals and snippets of wisdom in this book that I will be undoubtedly reading it to my children just to try and give them so good rules to live by I am referring here to things such as 1 Some times we can get so lost in dreams of how things might have been that we forget to live and move onYou must never go along with things just because your friends are  you must always have the bravery to do what is right 2 No matter how old or wise you are you must always have a good sense of humor 3 Love is the one thing that can escape death and give comfort to those left behind THE BAD BITSI know there are a lot of people out there who believe these books are a bad thing filled with many copyright claims and bad writing but I am going to chose to be in ignorance to these people s views  Not only am I going to say it s a must read I m going to say it s a book you must reread  you ll always learn something new and it s nice to just settle back some nights and return to something so care free and relaxing Overall  There are some books which are destined to end up as car book sale junk in the future like 50 Shades of Grey and there are books which will retain their fans and remain on bookshelves like Twilight  Then there are books like Harry Potter  which are books that are not destined to live on bookshelves they are destined to be move about and be read many times  they might show battle scars like the odd coffee stain  battered page or child s drawing but in your heart they will remain whole and unblemished Favorite quote   After all Harry  to the well organised mind  death is but the next great adventure    For more book reviews click here  I was probably in grade 3 when I first tried reading Harry Potter  and it seemed hard and boring for me at that time  But after 8 years  I love it While reading the first couple of chapters I was sure I wouldn t give this book a 5 stars  rating  The book didn t seem to me like one of the books that demand to be read because they are so amazing you cannot possibly stop reading them  it seemed like an ordinary  good book  But as I got towards the middle of it  specifically when I reached the part when Harry had to catch the train to Hogwarts  I couldn t let go of it  I ve watched all the movies  and now I m wondering why it took me so long to start on the books  And I can t help but wish I studied at Hogwarts too Now for the characters  of course I loved Harry Potter  He s very brave  smart  and talented  I think Hermione is exceptional as well  She might seem kind of bossy sometiems  but I loved her thirst for knowledge and intelligence  Ron is  of course  great too  Each one of them is brave in his  her own way I loathed Snape  yeah  yeah  he s a good guy and all that  but he s so mean to Harry  and everyone  actually  but especially Harry   So what if he had problems with Harry s father in the past  I hated malfoy too  of course  He s mean and selfish I cannot wait for my exams to finish so I can start on the other books in the series  And I m already worrying about the time when I reach the last book because I know that I will go through a new state of depression  always happens when I finish a good book  series    sigh Do yourself a favor and start reading Harry Pottr right now  if you haven t read it yet  Reread  October 2015Feeling disproportionately obsessed with Hagrid on this reread  Also with Hogwarts school administration practices and how much parent correspondence the typical Hogwarts professor receives from parents  I cried over  like  everything in this reread  MVP moment  Neville and the last 5 Gryffindor points     Reread  Jan  2013So many feelings during this reread  I realize that the reason I fell in love with this series  the reason I have to come back to it every few years  has to be the friendship  That sense of loyalty and goodness  especially among the Trio  always brings a tear to my eye     Reread  Aug  2007In preparation for the release of the final Harry Potter book  I went back and reread the first four books  I often forget how lovely this first book is when compared to how wild the rest of them get  but there s no better way to describe this than  enchanting   Since I m so often asked to defend Harry Potter to a breed of people I like to describe as  haters   I defer to my girl Hermione on the value in reading Harry Potter when there are people like Salman Rushdie and Margaret Atwood still publishing out there   Harry    you re a great wizard  you know   I m not as good as you   said Harry  very embarrassed  as she let go of him  Me   said Hermione   Books  And cleverness  There are more important things    friendship and bravery and    oh Harry    be careful    Chapter 16 It s true  there are far better written books out there  but sometimes  there are more important things than  better   The simplicity of Harry Potter is its genuis  I still remember the very day I began to read it  whch turned out to be the day before I finished it   I woke up feeling a little depressed and out of sorts  and for no other reason except that it was on the table next to me  I decided to pick up the book and start reading it  I was barely 5 pages into it before I noticed a palpable change in my mood  I started to feel much happier as I immersed myself into the story  a little giddy even  as though I was 14 years old again  The story was clearly written for younger readers  but J K  Rowling was considerate enough to provide an ample amount of humor and depth to satisfy most adults  Herry Potter is one of those stories that makes you fall in love with the protagonist immediately  pulling you deep into the plot whether you like it or not  because you can t help but find out what happens next  Also  it is the kind of book series that befriends you to its characters  making the story life like  it causes readers to develop a certain kind of relationship Harry  Hermione  and Ron  which gives you the sensation that you re not just picking up the next book in the series  you re checking in on the story of your friends  I m aware that sounds a little neurotic  but I m ok with that  Suanda bir kitabi bitirdigim gibi

of 7 books  Beautifully told children s tale of a 11 year old boy who finds out that he s a wizard  Really good storytelling  This first book    s 3   7 are my favorite in the series  This book focuses on showing Harry going from a setting where he was unloved and an outsider to his new school where he finds true friendship and a place he belongs and where he s  for the most part  welcomed  I was so interested in this story  J K  Rowling writes in such a way that I cared about the characters and her imagination is great as she creates an extremely detailed and unusual  but familiar too  alternate world  A fantasy book but as with all good fantasy books  there s a lot of reality in there  especially in the relationships between the people  or this case  wizards   witches  There is also a message about the power of love  This book series will be a classic  Serious stories that are told with a lot of humor  I feel like my childhood has been plain right now     WHY HAVE I NEVER READ THIS BOOK BEFORE          I feel stupid right now   God now I feel relieved I finally started reading this book because it s absolutely amazing  Words cannot describe enough how wonderful this read has been  I understand now why we say that this book is suitable for a reader of any age  because it truly is  just so you know I m 19  D   Well    I m thinking of writing a detailed review on my blog   my shiny new blog  squeals   here so stay tuned for that  As I expected  This book is one of my favorites now  I knew this would happen since its movie adaptation is one of my first favorite movie in the history of movie making ever To sum up my current state  The whole movie turned me into a fangirl  It was a bonus for me to read this book because 1  It made me tear up some times especially when winning the House Cup  2 It was a whole lot funnier than the movies   That s pretty obvious isn t it  The books are  always better than the movies Now off I go to watch the move again  I loved the Illustrated version of this  omg it was just so amazing  I ve heard that they re releasing all of them in illustrated form and oh gosh I hope they do  It was just so so good  I loved getting to picture the world again from a different perspective and not just imagine the movies as I read it and imagine them scenes  Definitely worth the price that it was  even if I didn t buy it haha   Nunca es tarde para leer Harry Potter  Eso es cierto  y tampoco afecta el haber visto las peliculas  simplemente es increible  Un libro que ensena sobre la amistad  el valor  la fuerza  la

Oh My Gosh              I watched the movie years ago  and I knew pracitcally everything that was going to happen and I still LOVED IT   Although  since I saw the movie first I pictured the characters like that  and I practically talked the whole book out to myself  Mimiking the characters voices best I could  Snape was the hardest  lol  But anyway  I loved it and I m finding it hard deciding between J K  Rowling and Cassandra Clare  I normally can t read a book more than once becuase I already know what is going to happen  but I already knew what was going to happen in this one and I would read it over and over again  AMAZING                       The world that Rowling created is my comfort zone  Reading Harry Potter is like going back to childhood  I get my dose of light when I read the series  and reading the books in English impact me even more  Rowling s word is so cozy  I feel so warm and comfortable  Some stories stay with us forever   This was so wonderful      I can t say something that everybody doesn t already know besides the fact that I loved everything about it   view spoiler   I was not expecting that plot twist  I loved that justice has prevailed for Gryffindor and if I were Dudley I would definitely not bother Harry   hide spoiler   Simply put  not reading this book is voluntarily shutting yourself away from an incredible world of magic  myth  and entrancing mayhem While I understand that reading Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone may be difficult at the age many of you reading this likely are  I cannot encourage you enough to at least give it a shot  The world J K  Rowling has created is so rich in detail and fun that it draws you in with such force not even the likes of Tolkien can compete  Maturing well with its audience  the entire series is a story worthy of the ages And certainly worthy of  if not reading yourself  giving to your children as a means of opening their mind to the great wide world of imagination  Eh oui je viens juste de lire le premier tome de la saga   Et alors         mieux vaut tard que jamais  Alors alors   j ai a d o r e   J ai eu l impression de retourner en enfance et de retrouver mes meilleurs amis  3 La lecture etait   etait    MMM   Magique   Oui voila  J K Rowling a vraiment un don pour la description   j ai beaucoup aime son ecriture Je n ai vraiment rien a reprocher  D j ai juste hate de retrouver Harry  Ron et Hermione pour de nouvelles aventures    one of my first re reads ever and I absolutely loved it    can t wait to re read the second and then read the rest of the books for the first time     ah better late than never right   I hope I get to go to Hogwarts  Under professor Snape A feast of hocus pocus and yet there are undertones of race issues and identity that put me in mind of reality  I hope Harry doesn t get off with Ron though   Ik had alle boeken al eens in het Engels gelezen  Maar dit boek verdient ook in het Nederlands zeker 5 sterren  Heerlijk lezen Ik vind het keer op keer verwonderlijk Hoe JK Rowling deze bijzondere wereld heeft gecreeerd  First time for everything  I can see why this series is so loved  Well deserving of all the stars  The movie did a good job of following the book  but as most things go the book just added so much  Magical  October 2015  Missing my fiance like crazy  so I m going back to Hogwarts Even though I have lost count of the number of times that I ve read this book  I love it every time  As the official introduction to the Wizarding World  Harry s journey to discover himself  friendship  and  most importantly  happiness stands the test of time  Our little bespectacled hero has a rough journey ahead  but witnessing him as the innocent  wide eyed First Year that the world fell in love with is sweeter than his favorite treacle tart  Even in the Muggle realm  Jo s imagination and whimsical style make Sorcerer s Stone magical  5 stars   It was great rereading the first book in the series  I read it the first  and only  time in 2002   and  meeting  Harry  Ron  Hermione  Hagrid  Dumbledore  and  yes  Snape    for the first time  once again  I was once again impressed not only with the characters and the imagination but also JK s writing ability for this first effort  though it surprised me a little how quickly everything happened  though  that s to be expected when this book is half the size of later installments   It was fun reading this after knowing  the end  of the series as much was foreshadowed and hinted at throughout      Three cheers for Hogwarts     I always love the ending  I cry  I laugh  It just makes me so happy  These characters are all family and always know how to cheer me up And the art was just STUNNING  I can t wait to see how the rest of them turn out   3 My first official read of 2015  I have always wanted to read Harry Potter and I mean who wouldn t  It s a record  I just didn t find the right time and I think this is the right time  So excited FINISHED   That s it  I ve always expected and known Harry Potter was so good and awesome since I watched some of the movies but reading the real thing  it s more spectacular than I have imagined Harry Potter is full of creativity  cleverness and adorable fantasy Brilliant characters Cool setting Amazing plot Awesome magic Entertaining Interesting ExcitingGreat  Just great  I loved re reading this book  I always find something new every time  Can t wait to re read it again in the future  Now on to read the next book hopefully soon   A great re read to start off the 2016 year  Can t wait to read the rest and dive back into the world of Harry Potter   Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone is the amazing first book to the Harry Potter series  I read this years ago back when it just came out  loved it then  adore it now  The introductory book to this wonderful world of magic did not disappoint  I laughed and cried enough to mark it as amazing  From the start to the end  Rowling was spot on with this story  the dialogue smart enough to be appreciated by every age group  It doesn t matter if you re 11  21  31 or 41 years old  Harry Potter and his world of magic will appeal to you It is 6 stars for this ageless book  a classic  Genial  Todos los ninos y no tan ninos deberian leer Harry Potter al menos una vez en la vida  All I can say is  wow  why had I not read this book sooner  it was amazing in all ways  i m so excited to read the second one and carry on with Harry and everyone else s adventure  A historia de Harry Potter e fantastica  mas com estas ilustracoes ainda se torna mais magica  I m no literary proficient reader but I loved this book  Of course it was written with a child s imagination in mind and that I think really made it  I thought the pacing was good and none of the storyline was too cliche  I was surprised with the twist of bad guy character at the end  I appreciate how Rowling really makes some good points about life and people at the end that even kids can understand  All truth is Gods truth so I m glad kids everywhere are reading this and learning to be courageous and smart and kind  even if it wasn t written from a Christian viewpoint   Obviously I m fucking late  I don t give a damn though  I CANNOT STOP SMILING  Da igual cuantas veces haya visto la pelicula  eso no a impedido que devorara el libro y disfrutase de el de principio a fin  ME HA ENCANTADO  y obviamente me voy a leer toda la saga  Hver gang jeg laeser den her bog  opdager jeg noget nyt  3 I re read it for the umpteenth time and I am still find it oh so magical like the first time I read it  I finally decided it was time to commit to reading this series  As I poured through the first few chapters my brain started sending down vibes of hesitation  It just felt so childish and transparent and my clinical adult mind wasn t having it   Perfect if I was a naive nine year old maybe  but my 35 year old cranky ass can see around every corner and it s all a no fun zone   said my brain as it angrily turned its back on the book But   But that heart spark held strong and I thank her for that On we go into book two and not a moment too soon   Obviously this will always be one of my favorite books worlds characters fandoms     in the world  Even after rereading it for the 394th time    I don t think I can tell you how many times I ve read this book because I ve just lost count  It s never failed to bring me to tears  but only because I love the world so much  and I connected with the characters so deeply and when certain people  cough  cough  were mentioned  I couldn t help but start crying  So good  So good  Harry Potter has such a high ranking in my heart that when people ask me what my favorite book is  I never mention this series because I assume everyone already knows that it is  FIRST AND FOREMOST  my number one   Re Read December 2015I cried like ten times re reading this IT PULLS MY HEARTSTRINGS SO GOOD  HarryXmasToYou Nechapu  proc jsem to tak dlouho odkladala  This book is my first experience with Harry Potter  So far  the Harry Potter series is incredible  Hermione has to be my favorite character because she is the teacher s pet and she reminds me of myself  I think the part when Harry and his friends was being sorted was hilarious  This book was amazing but  is in it kind of weird that Harry beat you know who twice  I am going to make a prediction and say that I think all of the Harry Potter books are going to be unbelievable  I recommend this series to kids that love reading   Still brilliant  Still engrossing  Still in love with Harry Potter Merged review So I enjoyed this book   but I didn t LOVE it  I am hoping that the remainder of the series will justify all of the hoopla  I felt like Hermoine was not a very good female role model   she was whinny and a little miss know it all  And other than her there were no other strong female characters  In this day and age when young adult literature is awash with strong female leads it surprised me that Rowling didn t include more  What an amazing reread  It was so nice experiencing this all over again  It s been over 6 years from the first time I read it  There were so many things I forgot that surprised me  i had forgotten all about the twist at the end   and there were so many things I remembered that I could not wait to read again    The train ride to hogwarts  being sorted  first dinner  Christmas at hogwarts  the first quidditch game  it was all so magical    can t wait to continue on rereading the series and reliving this all over again    I have read this book many times over the years and LOVED it every time  It will always be the series that will stand against all other fantasy series and I will be surprised if for me anything ever tops it  This year when I read it it has taken on a new and personal meaning     making it once again and even more so untouchable in my eyes  Here is my latest review  http   bookjourney net 2016 01 26 1st    4 5Me ha gustado muchisimo   quiero el segundo ya  Nahh  Ain t giving this book  5 stars  can t and won t  A new and magical world has opened itself for me  I enjoyed this so much  Pasti tau perasaan ingin segera membaca satu buku tapi tidak ingin buku itu selesai dengan cepat  Begitulah perasaan saya membaca ulang Harry Potter edisi ilustrasi ini  Walau pun tahu setiap ceritanya  tetap saja saya ingin menghemat dan menikmati setiap halaman yang penuh dengan ilustrasi indah ini  Tapi akhirnya keajaiban ceritanya malah membuat saya hampir lupa dengan ilustrasinya  Setelah asik mengikuti ulang kegiatan The Trio di tahun pertama beberapa halaman  baru ingat ada ilustrasi yang belum dilihat detail dan akhirnya membuka halaman halaman sebelumnya lagi  Semakin bertambah umur dan semakin sering membaca ulang saga ini  semakin sadar perubahan  kepolosan  cerita anak anak di buku pertama dan kemudian perkembangannya di buku buku berikutnya  Dan otak saya serasa menyala kembali oleh cerita yang sangat familiar dan tidak pernah bosan untuk diulang ulang dibaca  Saya yakin semua Potterheads merasakan yang sama saat membaca ulang buku ini  Apalagi dengan ilustrasi yang sangat memanjakan mata  Sebuah pelengkap yang sangat pas untuk cerita yang memanjakan otak ini  Dan yang pasti membuat kangen untuk membaca ulang semua bukunya  Dan tidak sabar untuk menunggu ilustrasi buku buku selanjutnya   Review to come ETA 11 2014I could never imagine loving a book as much the second time around  yet here I am     Hogwarts  Hogwarts  Hoggy Warty Hogwarts Teach us something please Whether we be old and baldOr young with scabby knees Our heads could do with fillingWith some interesting stuff For now they re bare and full of air Dead flies and bits of fluff So teach us things worth knowing Bring back what we ve forgot just do your best  we ll do the rest And learn until our brains all rot   Original ReviewWhen I review a book  basically I m breaking it up into little pieces  placing the parts into neat little boxes  and ending my journey with that particular world  It s bittersweet at times because I want to share my journey with everyone  but in doing so  I get sucked back into the real world I was in before I read the book In this case  I refuse to do that  I am keeping all the feelings this book gave me  all the  magic   to myself  If you want some of your own  you ll have to go out and get it yourself  I m not ready to let mine go  Not just yet So if you know how to get there    meeting some good friends along the way  maybe I ll see you at Hogwarts   That s where I m heading  5 ninja bunnehs holding wands and casting a million magic spells stars Rien a dire   un bonheur a relire     Mommy  Why are you crying so much  This is an awesome ending   It s hard to describe to a six year old  flush with triumph about Quirrel s defeat and Gryffindor s improbable recapture of the House Cup  thanks to Neville Longbottom  how I ve been waiting for this moment since long before he was even a glimmer in my eye  Reading it aloud to him  thirteen years after I read it to his daddy  was one of those rare parenting experiences  it was everything I hoped for and imagined  and more   There s no need to write a review or explain the rating  You all know how amazing this book and series is     Love It    And I finished it already  Gosh  I love this book  I love all of them  but this one obviously made me fell in love with the Harry Potter series Now  reading it with these illustrations included  it gives the story a even more magical touch  Every illustration kept me gazing at it for a couple minutes  trying to discover little details and looking at how wonderfully they were drawn  It really lifts the story I m so glad I purchased this version of the book  Five stars  no doubt  I absolutely love and adore Harry Potter  Sorry  It had to be said  No  but seriously I do  I first bought Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone at my school s Scholastic book fair when I was in 5th grade  I remember that they were having a buy one  get one free sale and I went there with the sole intention of finding another Party of Five book told from Claudia s perspective  I had bought one of those at a previous book fair and loved it  Oddly enough  I had never watched the show at that point  just read a few of the books     and I thought since it was free  might as well pick up The Sorcerer s Stone  My older sister by a year had been raving about this book because her teacher was reading it to the class and she loved it  So  I picked it up I devoured that Party of Five book in a day  loved it  and re read it again the day after  The day after that  I picked up The Sorcerer s Stone  read one chapter  deemed the book  boring   set it down  and that was that  At least until the movie was released during my freshmen year of high school  I watched the movie in theatres and absolutely loved it  I then picked up my 5th grade copy of The Sorcerer s Stone  dusted it off  read it  and loved it so much more than the movie  That started my anything but brief obsession with everything Harry Potter I just fell in love with the whole world that J K  Rowling created in the books  And I ll admit that even though I was a freshmen in high school when I first read it  all types of grown up or so I thought   I still dreamed of waking up and finding my own Hogwarts letter delivered to me by owl post  I think that s the magic of the Harry Potter books  The children fall in love with a brand new world that s so different from their own and the adults are taken back to a more innocent time  where you still believe that good always triumphs over evil and when we all still believed in fairy tales Since that first initial read  I have re read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone  and the other novels in the series  more than a dozen times  Every time I re read it  I get something new out of it  Some subtlety that shows up in the later works that I didn t really grasp until I had read it again  It also never fails to make me feel better if I m having a crappy day because let s face it  Harry  Hermione  and Ron were going through something so much worse I just loved every single one of these characters  Harry was everything a hero should be  brave  loyal  clever  etc  And Hermione and Ron are the types of friends that everyone hopes for  The ones who are with you through thick and thin and don t judge you the whole way through  My favorite characters in this series would have to be Hermione  because I m just a big a nerd as she is  and Fred and George  because their humor always made the books for me  of course  Luna is also one of my favorite characters  since she doesn t show up until Book 5  she doesn t get more than a brief mention here   Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone introduces all of us to an amazing world with tremendous characters  both good and evil and everything in between  However  as much as I love The Sorcerer s Stone  I do have to say that re reading it both last year and this year  I m not surprised that I put it down in the 5th grade  Since it is the first book  we have to wade through the exposition of how Harry gets to go to Hogwarts  The result is that the beginning chapters aren t as exciting as the ones that follow  I do have to say that as much as I love this book because it introduced me to the spectacular world of Hogwarts  it is my least favorite of the seven  It s just that the books get so much better as the series goes on  And now I feel bad for even thinking the words  least favorite    Anyway  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone will always hold a place near and dear in my heart because not only is it a fabulous novel  it was the book that got me back into reading  While I read a lot in elementary school  my interest in reading waned during middle school  Since I ve read The Sorcerer s Stone  my interest in reading hasn t waned one bit  And I think that s the magic of the whole Harry Potter series  it a lot of people back into reading and it definitely got kids excited about reading again  I think it s influence is something that will still be significant in years to come  The illustrated edition just was so beautiful  I loved the pictures and to discover the story again with some drawings was wonderful  I ll just be a potterhead forever  Este libro siempre sera un 5 estrellas para mi  Con este  comenzo la magia y la fantasia  las ganas de sonar y ver que el amor de verdad que lo puede todo Ame leerlo por primera vez y releerlo ha sido genial  Es sorprenderte darte cuenta de cosas que se te pasaron o de cosas que sabes que seran importantes mas adelantes cuando relees uno se estos libros

book  of course  was even better than the movie  There is much more detail in the book than in the movie  because otherwise the movie would be eight and a half hours long   This is a tremendously fun childrens  story  It s simple to follow but it s very fast paced  It s very easy to miss something important if one zones out  while listening to the audiobook edition   The narration  by Jim Dale  was well done  Hermione s voice was annoying but I suspect it was intended to be so  She is a little annoying after all  view spoiler   I thought that letting Gryffindor win The House Cup at the end was just a little too perfect  It felt contrived  It would have been a better life lesson for kids if Slytherin had taken the cup  They saved the Sorcerer s Stone    isn t that reward enough  The ending didn t have to be perfect   hide spoiler  I m looking forward to reading book 3 but I think I ll take in a few other books before I do  rereading this series     so much love  reread december 2015 STILL AMAZING AND I STILL LOVE IT FIFTY POINTS TO JK ROWLING  wow  i can t believe it has taken me this long to read Harry Potter  I love all the characters  Harry Potter is strong and curious  Hermione is sassy and hard headed  Ron is funny and lovable  Dumbledore is amazing and Dumbledore so you have to love him and who could forget Neville Longbottom such a sweetheart and a hero himself  Loved this book and can t wait to read more of Harry  Ron  and Hermione s adventures   Ive finally finished my first Harry Potter book and I m in love  Can t wait to start the next book Non so quante volte io abbia visto il film  ma leggere il libro e stato completamente diverso  anche se sapevo quello che sarebbe successo ci rimanevo sempre sorpreso  la scena del unicorno mi ha fatto veramente paura  il discorso che fa Silente a Harry alla fine del libro mi ha fatto venire i brividi  Non so per quale strano motivo io non l abbia letto prima    Merita assolutamente cinque stelline  I m new to this series  I ve never watched the movies neither  I started reading it after finishing the Twilight series and needing another series that would take me in  I really liked the first book and I was afraid that it would be a bit too childish for me but to my surprise it wasn t so bad  I will def  read the rest of the series  I have started the 2nd book already    You re a wizard  Harry  After 12 years I m writing my review  It s been so long since I first read this book and I can honestly say  with my whole heart  that I love it  I loved it then  and I loved it now Always When I first read this book I was around 13 years old  I had started it way before that  but by that time I wasn t that much into books so I didn t finish it  until I saw the movie  yeah  I know      after that  I was a goner  I read every single book the moment they were released  and saw the movies  the second they came out  I grew up reading this magnificent story and I can proudly say  I am a Potterhead  I don t think there was  is  a better way for someone to start their way into the reading world  than it is with Harry Potter  It has absolutely everything you need Love  Friendship  Evil  Goodness  Action  Sadness  Happiness  Magic  He didn t realize that love as powerful as your mother s for you leaves its own mark  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone introduces us to a world of magic and possibilities  This story let s us believe in the impossible  We meet Harry Potter  a boy who was raised by his aunt and uncle  Petunia and Vernon Dursley  after his parents died  He s never felt comfortable at his family s house  He never felt wanted or loved there  That is  until he receives the amazing news about his past and his present  He s not only Harry Potter  a boy without parents  He s a legend  He s a wizard  In this book we start the journey that going to Hogwarts means  we find the meaning of friendship and loyalty For one thing  the writing to me is just flawless  The story and each character grows in their own way  and they never fail to amaze you  They re all part of this incredible story and  without one of these characters  it wouldn t be the same  They each give something that makes the book even more extraordinary  Harry is just a kid who s living his life for the first time ever  He s finding new things every day and more than that  he s finding his own way to himself  Then we have Ron  If there s one character who s loyal to his friends  it s him  He s always believed in Harry  and supported him no matter what  He s kind and funny  Next is Hermione  Well  she s a know it all  She can be annoying at times  but overall  she will always stay by your side  doing her damn best to help you  The three of them combined make the best of friends  the best characters  They re their own family  and I loved that  because then they became my own family  The three of them are the bravest and most loyal characters I ve ever met  And you won t EVER regret meeting them   It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies  but just as much to stand up to our friends  There are a million other characters who play an important pat in this story  If you don t know them  then you NEED to read the books  There s no fun in me telling you all about it when you can experience it for yourself   I truly believe that reading Harry Potter while I was growing up was just the best experience ever  This story  these characters gave me the opportunity to travel to a whole new world without even leaving my house  but most importantly  they started my love for books  I can t say  thank you  J K  Rowling  enough   This is the only copy I can find with the title  Philosopher s Stone   which is the real title as JK Rowling is British and she name it this over here  Maybe it  translates  to sorcerer over there  because they don t have  philosophizers  in America   but I expect to be able to find a copy of the book I actually read from the year it was actually published in    It s been a while since I ve reread Harry Potter  I picked up on some details I didn t noticed before  I absolutely ADORE Jim Kay s art style  whether it was a simple wash in the background or a fully detailed castle  IT IS GORGEOUS  He effectively used the combination of watercolours and ink  I can t wait for the chamber of secrets in this edition   Let s just say that I really  really LOVED this book and wished someone would ve pressured me to start this series when I was younger   wow wow wow   where do I start   this was one of the best books I have ever read   I was hesitant to pick it up in the first place due to it being a  kids  book  but boy was I ever wrong   I will never ever let that hold me back ever again this book was so magical   period  there really are no words to express how much I loved this book  I could say I love this book a million times and still not get my point across  that s how much I loved it  thank you to my GR buddy Stepheny for lighting the fire under my ass    I wish I hadn t waiting so long I want to stress to everyone that no matter your age this book has something for everyone   so try it  what do you have to loose   but I guarantee just like me if you pick it up you will not be able to put it down so book one the Philosophers stone  We meet Harry Potter  We sadly learn what happened when he was a baby  and where he is now  and life with those awful Dursley s  We discover with him this wholeother world of witches and wizards  We learn together the reader and the character  which is why I think this book is brilliantly done  we are discovering everything for the first timetogether   I loved how this was done written  We follow Harry through his first year at Hogwarts  the many ups and downs  An instant classic   I found at some parts I was literally laughing out loud   I could just imagine what the character was saying or doing  some of my favourite parts   MAY CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS  when Hagrid tried to turn Dudley into a pig but ended up giving him a pig tail   then as the Dursley s let Harry off at the trail station uncle Vernon said they have to go get the dreaded tail removed  lol  When Gryffindor won the house cup due to the extra points awarded due to them saving the Philosophers stone  When Harry told Hermoine and Ron that the Dursley s don t know about the no magic rule out side of school so he s going to have some fun over the summer I was surprised by how slowly the relationship between Hermoine and Harry progressed in the book apposed to the movie   In the book the boys found her annoying for quite some time  And in the movie I don t remember it taking that long anyways I can t wait any longer to start book 2  The Chamber of Secrets    so that s it for the review  love love loved this book   este livro foi tao bom  desde o inicio  senti uma vontade enorme de entrar na historia mal  entrei  em hogwarts a sensacao de conforto que senti foi enorme  para nao falar

by the film and I d forgotten about all the little details  I fell in love with the story of Harry Potter all over again  If you ve only seen the films and not read the books  then you are seriously missing out  Although  thanks to the films  I can now pronounce everyones name correctly  The characters in this book are fantastic and I have a serious fan girl crush on Snape  Haha  The world is so creative  I ve recently come back from The Wizarding World Of Harry Potter  Universal Stuidos in Orlando and it was amazing  They bring it to life  it s like being in the book film  This series is destined to become one of those timeless tales that will be read long after Rowling is gone  Classic children s fantasy  recommened to everyone   This book is simply magical  There s no other word that would better describe it  Full of hope  heartbreak  true friendship and real fear  Whenever I need a pick me up from the doldrums of real life  I pick up these books  There s no other books that make me laugh out loud or cry my eyes out as much as the Harry Potter series  This was so magical and amazing  I Never thought in my life I would read this book  I LOVED IT INCREDIBLY  I loved Hermione and how nerd she is  I loved Ron s humor and for sure Potter s bravery  Their friendship is very beautiful   This book is a MUST for any Harry Potter fan  I enjoyed every aspect of the design for this book  The pictures are lovely and surprisingly moving  in the muggle sense   It would be wonderful if Jim Kay illustrated the rest of the series  but if not  I ll be grateful that he illustrated at least this one  How could I have forgotten what it was like to read the Harry Potter books  Despite the fact that there was a lot of sheer dumb luck involved in Harry s adventures   narrow escapes  it s still as flawless a read as it was the first time around    Can t believe it took me this long to re read the series   I loved loved LOVED this book  I am a late Harry Potter bloomer   I am so glad that I have the rest of this series to look forward to  I am going to savor them slowly  This will go down as one of my favs  I loved the plot  characters    writing style  What a fantastic imagination Rowling has   Finished this in less than two days and I can t believe I didn t pick the Harry Potter books up earlier  I definitely now see what ALL the hype is about  I ll be asking for the box set for my birthday which will be coming up soon  and I can t wait to continue  Just magnificent     Re reading this brought back fond memories  although I was not as impressed as I d been the first time I read the book several years back  Will still continue re reading the rest of the series  and this time I will read the entire Book 7  and not just the last couple of chapters   D I re read one book of the series every year The people who say they don t need to read the book because the movie is true to the book     are liars If you don t read HP series you don t really know what the series is about  The best was left out of the movies  The character depth and world building in the first Harry Potter book are wicked intense  I m so excited to continue on  I loved this first book so much  It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies  but just as much to stand up to our friends    This book will never not have 5 stars from me  I know that some people get annoyed from the hype of Harry Potter books  but I wholeheartedly believe that this is one of the best series  the best to me  ever written  There is something for everyone within these books  Rating  5 starsDate Started  20   Jan    2016Date Finished  27   Jan    2016I started the Harry Potter series at the age of 11  the same age as Harry  I finished this series at the age of 17  also the same age as Harry  No word in the English language  nor any other spoken language  can ever describe my eternal and imperishable love for the Harry Potter series  No word at all It been such a long time since I last read a Harry Potter book  Come to think of it  the last time I had read it was during high school days  So coming back to the world I consider to be my home and my escape  I went through an emotional ride   Everything about this series is amazing  The writing  the characters  the plot  the world itself  Everything about the Harry Potter series is beyond perfect  This book is my childhood  and Harry happens to be my best friend  we grew up together  J K Rowling is a genius  She is one of the few authors out there who actually bothered to build a sophisticated fictional universe  Rowling alongside Tolkien and Lewis gave me the best childhood memories   I don t know why it took me this long  but I finally buckled down and read this and I just love it so much   runs off to start the next book  Doing a Reread of all the hp books as I get the new editions in the post  the pretty colourful ones w gold lettering  but goodreads wouldn t let me say I m re readig them so  and I m living the happiness all over again im so glad I m doing this     3 THIS WAS SO BEAUTIFUL  I CANNOT   Reading this book again in an illustrated format was beyond amazing  Jim Kay knocked it out of the park the the beautiful illustrations and I will be waiting patiently until next year for Illustrated Chamber of Secrets  Too good  Too good  Lo disfrute muchisimo  en serio fue como si viajara unos anos atras al Diego pequeno que veia las peliculas fascinado con este mundo de magos  La parte del final  con todo el misterio y las pruebas de los maestros fue excepcional   I had forgotten so much  I love this book  I ve been smiling and laughing my way through it  Thank you Cory for organizing the group read  It has been so much fun  My daughter is going to finish soon and I have the movie ready to go  I finally gave in and bought myself the Illustrated Edition of Harry Potter  and it was as wonderful as a Harry Potter fan could desire  Reading it and looking at the pictures  I felt as if I was experiencing the magic of Hogwarts for the first time all over again  So many readers wish to have the chance to read a beloved book again for the first time  and it s just   magical  When I reached the end of the book and Dumbledore awarded those final points to Neville  I m not going to lie  I teared up  It was as if I was right there with them in their trials and in their victories  I can t wait to see what the rest of the series is like in an illustrated edition  I m betting they ll continue to be magical  Re read  October 2015This book was fabulous of course  I loved re reading this  and can t wait to get to the rest of the books in for a re read soon  Hagrid is my love and just this entire book was so good ahhhhh Re read  May 26th  2015This is the first time I ve listened to the audiobook  I loved it  Stephen Fry is an incredible narrator  and of course  nothing could ever diminish my love for the wizarding world   This was actually a re read but who cares I m adding this to my 2015 reading challenge I can t even remember how many times I ve read this book  Maybe 3 or 5 or 10  THIS IS LIFE GUYS  HP IS LIFE First read  2007 Second re read  2014Third re read  2015This book is so freaking good that I just can t  I loved it when I was a little child and I m loving it right now  it s just amazing   Non credo servano commenti  Harry Potter e Harry Potter e il mondo creato dalla Rowling non finisce mai di incantarmi  anche all ennesima rilettura  Pero  in lingua originale e ancor piu bello     First read  October 31   November 2  2010Rated  5 starsUPDATE DECEMBER 2014 Rereading this over the holidays  I have been wanting to reread it since last year  but kept getting distracted   Buddy read the week before  American Thanksgiving with a ton of people  Can t wait to get back to Hogwarts   I loved this sooo much  So many childhood memories were brought back  Off to watch the movie now XDAme el libro demasiadoooo  Tantas memorias de mi infancia    Ahora ire a ver la peli XD Este libro sigue siendo lo mas hermoso que me ha pasado en la vida en terminos de lectura  Escribiria mas  pero creo que nunca terminaria de explicar mi amor por el mundo de Harry Potter  Hace unos dias me dio la nostalgia  empiezan las lagrimas   y dije  un dia de estos me releo a Harry chiquito precioso Potter   se descontrolan las lagrimas FIN DEL COMUNICADO XD Wow  has it really been a few years since my last re read  2011  Say it isn t so  Time to pick a fancy cover edition to double shelve  D Read for Bethwyn s read along   My high school French teacher gave me this edition and I love it to death  Every time I see it on my shelf I think about getting the rest of the series in French just to have it  I always thought that Harry Potter was just another mere series about witchery and holds aspects that embodies supernatural elements  That s the sole reason behind putting reading it off constantly But Harry Potter is more than magic and supernatural elements  it s about depression  I probably wont have a lot of readers supporting such perspective  but this is how I felt after finishing the first book  Normally  if a person goes through depression and is at the verge of hitting the rock bottom of losing it all  they would directly be sent off to an asylum  Well  Harry Potter did suffer from depression and Hogwarts was his asylum  We all had an aunt Petunia in our lives  whether it be a teacher  headmistress  parent or a boss  We were all forced to stay inside cupboards  metaphorically speaking  and had to somehow come out of the closet to establish our existence  This novel serves two purposes  the first one is to help you escape your harsh reality and fly off to a shining reality with a broomstick which is your mind to a complete whole new world  In other words  it inaugurates the concept of escapism  The second purpose  is to help you reflect upon your own self  and explore parts within your character that might have been alien too  I am not trying to turn this into a philosophical essay or anything  but I believe that magic exists and is hidden from us  That s why  magic is wholeheartedly required to reconstruct your beingness  I cant wait to finish the entire series  Let me just say again  I AM IN LOVE             I am SOOOO glad I m FINALLY reading this series     Now I can finally say I HAVE READ A HARRY POTTER BOOK    This Book has been always special to me on the various reasons   as wonderful as always  I am sure it will give me the same amusement every year as its giving now   5 stars  obviously  Rereading this book felt like coming home and the beautiful illustrations only added to the magic  This world will always be my favourite  I LOVED EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS    Ordering the next two books ASAP  Why didn t I get into this series sooner is beyond me but  better late than never      2015 Reading Challenge  A popular author s first bookRead it in French  There is no need to say that I enjoyed reading it as I did the very first time  After 10  more than 10 but I will say 10 because it makes me fucking old  years and more than 5 rereads it is still one of my favourite books EVER   Que os voy a decir  Que este libro es una MARAVILLA Y UNA PRECIOSIDAD  Punto Llevo siendo fan de Harry Potter desde hace muuuuuuchos anos y es una saga de libros que me encanta Harry

to read more  Amo  amo  amo a este libro Admito que al principio  las primeras 50 y algo de paginas  se me hacian pesadas y llegue a pensar que no lo iba a poder seguir  pero  desde que aparece Hagrid  todo se vuelve mas ligero e interesante  Admiro la forma en la que J K Rowling desarrolla los acontecimientos  es tan puntal y da los detalles necesarios  ni mas ni menos  Lo que mas m gusto  sacando la parte de la historia  es el gran mundo que ha creado  Es tan grande y original que la admiro por tener tanta imaginacion  Hasta ha creado un deporte completamente original  Ya habia visto las peliculas  pero los libros siempre hacen que apreciemos mas cosas que las peliculas  No tengo mucho que decir mas que estar orgullosa de mi por al fin haberlo leido   Re reading    There s nothing like Harry Potter  is there  This book gave me so many happy feels  I m so glad I m rereading the series this year  Read it in the 7th grade on sheets of printed paper because our teacher could not afford books for the entire class but loved it anyway   D I loved reading the new illustrated edition  the artwork is fantastic  Definitely a great way to revisit an old favorite  superb  it s a crime that my mom didn  t allow us to read this as children  I only wish I had read this before seeing the film  It doesn t matter how many times I read this series  It s still just as good  even better really  than the first time     after re reading this book  i ve changed my mind  it deserves 5 5 stars     Snape was trying to save me       tamamen koptugum yer     Yine harika  hala harika  Just

express the awesomeness of this series  and the awesome re read first time listen of the audio  Simple answer  I can t  All I know is I ve been waiting and waiting for my belated letter to Hogwarts  my chance to put on the sorting hat  my visit to Diagon Alley  and my own chance to smuggle a dragon out of a castle under a cloak of invisibility  Still to this day  waiting I can t wait to slowly gobble up all the audio titles released on Audible  Sadly  slowly it will be due to the approaching holidays and my pocketbook  but you will be mine  my pretties  You WILL be mine  Rereading a book

because I was terribly homesick  It was about time for a reread  J  K  Rowling gets all the stars   I LOVED THIS REREAD SO MUCH   excited for the next oneeees Revisiting old friends  SUPER GOOD REREAD IN 2015 Never gets old     Perfect  again  Brilliant  Amazing  Full review bisa di baca di   http   wp me pwz2f wt Kalau ada satu hal yang tak bisa dimengerti Voldemort  itu adalah cinta  Dia tidak menyadari bahwa cinta sekuat cinta ibumu kepadamu  meninggalkan bekas  Bukan seperti bekas luka  bukan tanda yang kelihatan   dicintai begitu dalam  meskipun orang yang mencintai kita sudah tiada  akan memberi kita perlindungan selamanya akhirnya selesai juga edisi baca ulang Harry Potter dan Batu Bertuah  Padahal baru kemarin habis maraton film Harry Potter 1 7  The last time I read Harry Potter was during my 3rd year in high school  That was like    7 8 years ago  Lama banget ya     sekarang udah lumayan tua sih hitungannya walaupun dihitung hitung baru 22 tahun  p  Ini bukan buku baru ya temen temen  ini masih buku pertama dari serial harry potter  bedanya ini adalah edisi ilustrasi jadi didalemnya ada full color ilustrasi oleh Jim Kay  Bagus   Bagus banget  Cantik  Keren deh  Saya gak sabar jadinya nungguin A Monster Calls di terjemahin dan filmnya tayang   Loh kok nyinggung nyinggung A Monster Calls sih    Iya  Karena yang membuat ilustrasi Harry Potter ini juga membuat ilustrasi untuk A Monster Call nya Patrick Ness  This is the story I read over and over as it is my comfort read  During long weekend  you have nothing to do but get cosy and treat yourself with this master piece may be 4th time   First time I bought it  it was this  Second time I got this  And I got confused  while searching I came across many HP fan sites and fun facts site  One of them is here    Quora So basically Philosopher s Stone is British version whereas Sorcerers  Stone is the US version This story is just not my favorite but it is loved by my parents too so basically it is family book so Nothing more to add  Though I watched movies and would be grateful to see our favorite heroes to come alive  I am still partial to books     I think it s obvious how this review is going to go   Having not re read Harry Potter for a few years now I decided 2015 would be there year For me the Harry Potter series is for every child and adult may I add  I say this because in no way are these books childish  if anything they re mature and therefore not cheesy or ridiculous  Rowling treats every character with importance  all of them bring something different to the story and that s what I admire  Linking to this I forgot how much more Neville appears in the books compared with the films  Neville is awesome After the revelation that Harry is in fact a wizard from our friendly giant Hagrid  Harry is whisked away to the world of Hogwarts where he begins his journey into becoming a young wizard  Famous as he is  Harry has no problems making friends and even has the bull to stand up to those who are clearly his enemy  ahem Draco Malfoy Harry  Ron and Hermione s first adventure leads them to the forbidden corridor of the third floor hidden amongst the ever changing staircases  After a robbery at the wizard bank Gringotts  a mysterious package is being hidden in the depths of Hogwarts and Harry and his friends are stopping at nothing to reach the object before the mysterious Professor Snape does  but all is not quite as they pieced together   Promoting friendships and their importance really shines through this book that it make you go all warm and fuzzy inside  I adore each of the characters  even the moody Professor Snape  The book captures your imagination from start to finish by a hint of mystery and a lot of laughs keeping you turning the pages until you get to the very end and realise you need to grab the next book quickly I thoroughly enjoyed this re read and I loved all the little details I forgot about  there seems to always be something that magic s itself into my mind again  This book makes me want to be a kid again If I d have read this when I was kid  this would ve been my bible  And my holy trinity as Harry  Ron and Hermione  Oh my goodness  I m stunned  All the worldwide timeless hype was right  This is such a good well written book  No  this was a fantastic read  This book made me so happy  This magical world has made me happy since I was 9 when the first movie came out  Back then I didn t read books but I did grew up with the movies and I loved them  But now  that I ve actually read the first book  My love has increased A LOT  This book can be read by a 8 year old or by a 50 year old and I bet it would be relatable to both or at least acclaimed as a wonderful book  If I loved it now  I wonder  a bit bitterly  how much I would have been obsessed with it if I had read it 14 years ago    Random thoughts    Book Ron is much better than movie Ron in my opinion  And another thing that I m impressed at  is that the movie is basically the book  Such great adaptation Jo Rowling enchants you with her easy but engrossing words  Now  SHE is the real wizard in all this  The whole story is so well put together  Everything flowed  the pages turned themselves and I was THERE  living what Harry was living  I m just seriously stunned     I now understand why Harry Potter is as popular as it is  This was an amazing book  One of my favorite aspects of it has to be that even though it is classified as a children s book  you can read it as a teenager and still thoroughly enjoy it  I could definitely tell that this book is a wonderful read no matter your age Next  let me say this  Hermione Granger is my spirit animal  I relate to her so much  I am just as crazy about school and grades as she is  and am definitely just as socially awkward  if not more so  I also might have had a slight crush on Ron Weasley  Might Harry was great too  I was suprised I liked it  because I m usually not a fan of books in third person  But  hey  I love The Mortal Instruments and that s in 3rd person too  so I guess it really just depends I will definitely be continuing the series  in fact  my friend is actually lending the second book to me tomorrow  so I ll be able to jump right into it  I do wish I had been born in 1986 though  so that I could have been on Harry s journey year by year  starting at 11 years old  just like him  Oh well  Can t change that now  can I And yes  I do feel guilty for not reading this earlier  No need to remind me  Okay  I apologize for only reading this Now  People read this at the age of 7 or lesser and I m only reading it now  When Im 17  Well I m sorry but let s not make fun of me anymore  Now now  the book series everybody s talking about  What s so worth talking about it and what made people lining up in the middle of the night to get a first released copy  Did I say that right  Maybe not but you get the idea  I didn t think it d be that great  Usually books with great hype turns out to be disaster  However after reading this  I got what the hype is all about  It is SO good   How is it possible for anybody to write a book this great   And   and the twist of  view spoiler  Snape  hide spoiler     my goodness  I mean the twist wasn t as surprising but what Dumbledore said about  view spoiler  Snape  hide spoiler     that was a genius twist there  I loved all the characters  just Amazing  Loved them all    Long live Harry Potter  Challenge completed  A book With Magic  I have been wanting to re read these books for ages now  It has been some years since I last read the Harry Potter books  And I am thrilled that I decided to finally re read them now  Because I adored reading this first book again  It is so awesome  I had a few issues  but mostly loved it a whole lot  Writing is amazing I m sure you have all read Harry Potter by now  Well  you should have  But if you haven t  you really should read them  They are amazing book  And I adored this first one so much  Getting to know who Harry is  How he grew up  How awful his Aunt and her family was to him  It was amazing and so heartbreaking I have actually only read the first four books one time before  As I started liking Harry Potter after movie four came out  I read book five and six in Norwegian  while waiting for number seven to come in English  Back then I didn t really read anything  But I read these books  And then it still took a few years before I started reading again  But yeah  I loved Harry Potter back then  and I have loved it since  The movies are so so gorgeous  But the books are perfect too  And I m thrilled about finally re reading them  I do own some precious Harry Potter items  But wanting more    Have three box sets  currently reading the new UK hardcover set  which is so gorgeous  I love the art so much  All my editions are perfect  So precious   3I just can t describe this book  And I m not going to talk about all the things I usually talk about  Well  I probably will  but feel like there isn t that much I can say about why I love this book  Will try describing some of my love for it  I adored this book because of Harry  He is the cutest boy  I loved how innocent he was about magic and his fame  How he didn t know anything  I hated his Aunt for never telling him  but I also loved it too  because I loved the boy he ended up being because of it  Harry is just awesome I loved this book because of the magic  I loved Hogwarts  I adored reading about the teachers  And the forbidden forest  And Hagrid  I even liked re reading about the evil boy Draco Malfoy  I loved getting to see Harry making friends with Ron  And Hermione  I loved reading about how just about every day at Hogwarts is Harry s best day ever  I just want him to have more happy moments  Sobs  Then I remember all the awful things coming in the next books  Hmph  It is not fair  Sigh  But so excited to re read it all I truly don t know what to share about this precious book  It is the story of eleven year old Harry Potter  We learn that his parents died when he was just one years old  He was then placed with his Aunt  And he has lived a pretty awful life  At least the way I saw it  He deserved to have someone love him  Sigh  But he didn t have that  And it still breaks my heart  I do love reading about boys that are broken  Though Harry isn t really  He s all kinds of strong and kind and gentle and polite  He s the best to read about There is just so much I love about Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone  I adore how Harry finds out that he is a wizard  I love going shopping with him and Hagrid  It was lots of fun  Though that goblin bank is pretty freaky  I loved getting to know Hagrid more  He is a favorite character of mine  I loved getting to know how the school worked  how Harry felt about it all  Yeah  This book is special  Not fully perfect  but perfect in my heart  And it is precious to me  I just adore Harry and Ron and Hermione   I don t wish to say more about this book  Just that I am so happy that I re read it  It was lots of fun  And I had forgotten so much  since it has been more than four years since I last read the books  I will now finish reading the next six books  then I will watch all the movies again too  Which will also be perfect  Sigh  These books are amazing  And I adore the movies too  And just  yeah  I want more Harry Potter  If you still haven t read this book  I really suggest that you do  Because it is amazing  You might love it     This review is also posted on my blog   view spoiler  I ve legitimately never read this book  or any in the series  with the intent to review before  So  here goes  Let s see how it works out It s been a few years since I ve re read book one  and it was just as beautiful and magical  figuratively  not literally      as I remembered  I deliberately was reading it SLOW  too  because I wanted to make the re read last and I wasn t ready to leave such a comforting world yet Sorcerer s Stone is likely the most childish book in the series  except for perhaps Chamber of Secrets  Which is understandable  as it was the first one written and at the time was GEARED TOWARDS children  You can tell  too  with how some of the sentences were written and how some descriptors were chosen  very awkwardly and over simplified   I would not call that a negative thing  but that is something I have found to be important to mention when describing the series to someone reading it for the first time and struggling to make it through books one and two  They do not all have those childish attributes  believe me I just   don t know what else to say  I love that the characters are massively flawed and therefore feel real and lovable  I love that you can already start to see Dumbledore s manipulation of Harry to get him on his side  I love meeting beloved characters again for the first time and knowing how they re going to end up  even if it s in death   I love how happy Harry is by the end  I love having the awareness to read this and think of how asshole of a move it was by Dumbledore to give Gryffindor the cup at the end of the year  Slytherin would have won their seventh year in a row   can you imagine how those seventh years must have felt that their streak got ruined    And ESPECIALLY how asshole of a move it was to give Harry to be raised by a family like the Dursleys  when Sirius Black was a perfectly viable   and legal   option at the time  DAMNIT Dumbledore   I love knowing things Harry doesn t and noticing bits of foreshadowing  I love being able to see firsthand proof of just how much an inexcusably abusive DICKWEED Snape is  and always will be   I love seeing Neville s humble beginnings and his very first flames of growth  Mostly  I love being re submerged in my absolute most favorite literary world  and being able to criticize it at the same time I truly don t know if I ll be able to wait until future Help Me Choose surveys to continue re reading the series  I may have to  as OCD has the most difficult time letting me do otherwise  But if ever there was a series to let me break free from it and actually do what my heart wants  it s Harry Potter It has my love  as always  My love  my heart  and my life    hide spoiler   I think there might be people who had watched the movie before the book but either way proves that Harry Potter series are the best Harry Potter  the kid who always wears saggy and dirty clothes and lives in the small and dirty room under the stairs at his big chubby and vicious uncle Dursley  He is always bullied by his cousin Mr Dursely s son  He stays at their house like a servant or a maid who does the chores  But one day  everything starts to change like magic  It starts from the weird envelopes delivered by owls  Mr Dusely starts to panic and tear those letters and burn them in fire  As more days pass  more envelopes are delivered and the old man panicked more  One day  a huge man like giant named Hagrid came and searched for Harry and informed him that he had been invited to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry  There he came to learn about his parents and make actual new friends J K Rowling  the author of Harry Potter s popularity rises up as the Harry Potter series came along  She is admired by others and has been recieving love from her fans  Well really  what can I say about this       I first read  Philospher s Stone  when I was 5 years old  just after my parents took me to see the film  Since then  I have adored the series  and I waited impatiently for most of my childhood waiting for the next book to come out  There has never been a period in my life that I haven t loved Harry Potter  and I can t imagine there ever being a period when I won t  Maybe that s a big statement to make  but it was almost 14 years ago that I was introduced to the world  and if anything  I love it more  I ve now read all the books  and books that accompany the series  Beedle the Bard  Quidditch Through The Ages  and Fantastic Beasts   I ve been to the HP Studios twice  and have visited filming locations dozens of times  helpfully I live very close to one   I ve read the books and seen the films at least 10 times each  and have a HP dedicated blog  I m not quite sure how I could love it more  but I m sure that I could Once a year I re read the series  It s quite a big undertaking that takes a couple or 3 weeks  but there comes a time each year when I actually feel hungry to read it  Does that make sense  When almost every thought leads back to it  and I can t focus on reading anything else  I don t mind  of course  I welcome the opportunity to re read the series  Philospher s Stone  is a brilliant start to a brilliant series  It eases you in to this magical world  and it s one that you never want to leave  It s strange coming back to the first book  and reading Harry as an 11 year old  when you know everything that he is going to go through  Though I think it s exciting reading the series for the first time  and in fact I envy those who are reading it for the first time   I think that re reading it has a certain magic  because you do know what s going to happen  and you can pick up on foreshadowing  Each time I read this book  I find new stuff that I ve overlooked or forgotten in the past  1  I hate Jim Dale s dialogue narration 2  I m assuming there are female goblins   what do they do  They didn t seem to be mentioned at Gringotts  but maybe they look the same  I feel like this might have been addressed in later books but I can t remember3  How do muggle born children prove they are in school  In America that s pretty strictly regulated so I imagine it is in Britain too 4  How do they break the news to muggle parents  I d say I can t imagine it s just through the Hogwarts letter  but wizards are notoriously oblivious illogical so it wouldn t surprise me  But for the muggle students to get all their supplies and get to school  they clearly need someone to walk them through things or they d never get there at all 5  Are there scholarship students 6  I can t imagine that Hogwarts is really something you can turn down   it would be dangerous to have untrained witches and wizards running around  so how do they deal with students who don t have money parents refuse to let them go 7  I teared up as soon as Fred was introduced  God it already hurts and I still have 6 books until it happens too 8  What s done about their education pre eleven years of age  I mean they re all expected to be able to measure  read  do basic math write grammatically correct   and not all parents are created equally whether they won t or can t teach their kids this I can t believe all of them actually DO so unregulated 9  It seems really unfair to Slytherin that Dumbledore awards all these last minute points to Gryffindor  I think he does that in more than one book    If he really wants to encourage inter house camaraderie it s clear he does nothing to ingratiate himself to Slytherins or make them trust him  and judging by the state of things   all houses dislike Slytherin   not much had been done before him  Maybe it would be too much to expect only eleven years after Voldemort s fall  but still   You may have noticed that I have added a new shelf to my collection  Bandwagon Books  I try to stay away from the popular crazes  I just do  And Harry Potter was at the top of the Bandwagon List  However  I caved  Finally after 18 years since publication  after growing up in the Harry Potter generation when every other kid at school fell in love with these books  I have finally read them I m not sure why  Perhaps because the fanfare has died down a bit  I m not sure  But I m certainly glad that I did I fear there isn t much I can say about  Sorcerer s Stone  that hasn t been said a million times already  literally   It s a wonderful story  There s bravery and friendship and mystery and fantasy  There s a little bit of everything But you already knew that So I suppose I can just tell you my own favorite bits First  I love the humor that went along with the Dursleys  They were a horrid bunch to poor Harry  but it was comical  nonetheless  I think I liked the details more than the plot itself  The Sorting Hat for example  I love the idea of it  And Quidditch  Where did she think of these things  Brilliant  There were quite a few poems throughout the story that I thought were really clever  especially Snape s  I m glad Hermione could figure that out  because I still can t  I would love to see Dudley and Draco in a room together  It would just be hilarious  Now that I ve started this series  I can t wait to read the rest  I know  for the most part  how it ends  but I think he journey will be fun      Original Blog Review  http   landamac weebly com blog revie   My Blog  http   landamac weebly com My Instagram  http   instagram com blog myescape Buy the same edition I got on BookDepository  http   www bookdepository com Harry P   BookDepository Affiliate Link  http   www bookdepository com  a_aid     I can t believe it took me so long to decide to read this series    I mean  I know that I started reading just last year  but what ever    I waited to long to get into this awesome story It took me one day  not even that  to finish this book  it was an awesome reading in my opinion and I know that EVERYONE love these books    so not just in my opinion but in everyone s opinion    this story is really good I don t know what I was expecting from it  honestly  before I even started reading it  I really wanted to like it but I was not sure if I was going to    so when I actually started reading the book I was quite  afraid  that I was not going to love it since everyone in this world seem to love these books    the thing is  I really loved it and I honestly think that it was one of the fastest readings I had in some time Everyone knows Harry Potter s story so I m not going to explain to you what this book is about    what happened with me was that I watched the movies a long time ago  and I didn t even watch all of the movies because in my opinion the movies were crap    so I gave up and I was always saying that I hated Harry Potter    NOW  I decided to marathon the movies  and I did it    I watched the movies and I enjoyed them more than I did before  yes    but I didn t love them  to be honest sometimes I got quite bored watching them    BUT  I ve already bought the first three books of the series and I really really wanted to get into the books as soon as possible  so yesterday I decided that I should start reading the first book of Harry Potter s series and I did it    I started reading it  I finished reading it and I loved it so so so much      After many years  I decided to read again this magical series  The first time I read the Philosopher s stone I was in high school  when the first movie came out  and the second  I was on my first year of college  Re reading this in the age of 27  is a whole new experience  All the feelings that I had the first time were also there this time  much more intense and along with some new ones  Fro example  I knew that Dumbledore is a very wise character  but as I was reading it this time I really felt how everything he says about life  friendship and everything  is all so true  I mean  when you read it as a child  you take what Dumbledore says as advice  As an adult  you can relate to what he says  you  ve realised most of what he says  living your life  through bad and good  But most of all  knowing what s to come  this first  little book  had me almost in tears at many points  The one that got to me the most was what Firenze the centaur said in the Forbidden Forest   Good luck  Harry Potter  The planets have been read wrongly before now  even by centaurs  I hope this is one of those times   Finally  I have finished the first book from the ever so famous Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone  Back when I was a student  I wasn t even able to touch any of these books at all  I have my fair share of history of being restraint from reading these series  Sarcastically  I would love to thank the one who speaks against reading this series over at the pulpit of fear that the idea of witchcraft would seep into our daily lives  Verdict after reading the first book  I don t even have a hint of curiosity on witchcraft at all  Practically speaking  who would even want to venture into something so dark I love how we are being introduced with the world of Muggles  humans  and then to the world of Witchcraft and Wizardry  The transition from one world to another was fascinatingly amazing with so much awe and jaw dropping scenery  The magnitude of how Hogwarts were being described is mesmerizing I  for one  would love to witness the majestic scale of The Great Hall especially during their Christmas season  It is really to die for  What makes it even greater is how all those wonderful delicacies were being displayed and described  Characters are fairly well written and I can never get enough with all the conversations between Ron  Hermione   Harry  British hilarious  Always love their come backs  It s always a lot of insults with posh and styles Plot wise was intriguing enough to grip you from the very start even for a middle grade  Clues and suspense are well planted into their conversations  Suspicion on the main idea is even greater as the book progresses Hint  Dumbledore has given his opinion on death which would be greater and the definition of the truth will be ugly and painful to be borne for the rest of ones life As of now  I cannot wait to read about their upcoming adventures until the day comes with full explanations on how it all started Ratings  4 7 out of 5 starsMy Blogspot ReviewMy Movie Review Not a fan of fantasy and magic I have stayed away from this genre normally but yet always being a little curious to the phenomenon of Harry Potter that seems to consume some children and adults  For my reading challenge I needed to cover a series trilogy   magic and this just seemed a natural choice as part of challenges are to take you out of your comfort zones  I have to say this first book is pure escapism at its best taking you out of your life in to an enchanting magical World Different ages can all take something from this book  children can innocently enjoy the story and yet adults could pick out underlying discussion topics they could talk to children about such as class judgement Both however will experience battles  magic  emotion  friendships  power  personalities  and a whole wealth of characters to pick your favourite from I listened to this on audio and Stephen Fry was so perfectly cast as the main narrator and the book really came alive with the accompanying narrators also I feel very late to the Harry Potter party but on the upside I don t have to wait and have the other 6 to listen to now     Goodreads Challenge 2015  Book 8  Pop Sugar Challenge  Magic  Series  Trilogy  Still to confirm category choice  Bibliotheque Challenge 2015  Ist book by popular author banned book young adult  still to confirm category choice  This review was also posted at Books are stories I felt like starting to reread the Harry Potter series and when this beautiful edition arrived I started right away  I first read this book when I was quite a bit younger  I again really enjoyed it and this time around I noticed some things that I was not aware of at the time  Especially how Rowling s writing style is reminiscent of Roald Dahl s writing  I loved how ridiculous some of the descriptions of the Dursleys were It was wonderful to once again enter the magical world that Rowling created  It is so detailed and interesting and I think almost anyone would love to go to Hogwarts It had been a while since I had read the books  but I have seen the movies not too long ago  While reading I was reminded of how different some of the characters in the book are compared to the movies  Ron Weasley was in the movies never one of my favorites but I really like him in the book  He was funny and smarter than the movie made him seem  Hermione Granger went through a quite wonderful transformation in the book  From an annoying know it all she changes into a loyal friend  All the characters are so complex and I can t wait to continue rereading the series to again get to know them all a little better  What I liked about the characters is that they all had something interesting  but they were also not that extraordinary  They all had both good character traits and bad character traits  Harry himself is very brave  but he is also a little bit egoistic  In the wizard world Harry is quite famous  but I love how Rowling gave him a quite common name  Very often authors think their character needs an extremely exotic name that makes no sense at all when you realize their heritage  only to sound interesting Although the book is not extremely long Rowling manages to tell a great story while also introducing the magical world Harry enters   Let me tell you a story When I was younger my dad brought home a Harry Potter film  it was Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban  I was so excited to watch it  I was 7 years old  So my dad puts on the film and we re all sat watching it until the freaking Dementors appear on my screen  As soon as they appeared I ran out of the room  crying  yes I was a big wuss   I had nightmares for weeks   From then on I promised myself I would never read see Harry Potter ever again Oh how I was so wrong  I hate how I missed out on the Harry Potter childhood  11 years later  I m sat here typing up my book review for this book that I just finished in a day and a half and saying how much I loved it  It filled my heart with such warmth and love  I could not stop smiling in some parts and I must admit I did cry in some sections I loved how it was written in third person so we got an inside on every single character  I immediately fell in love with each character except from He Who Must Not Be Named  Obviously   Mr and Mrs Dursley and Dudley  I just loved loved this book so much and it brings the little kid inside of me out  like I m with Harry Potter arriving to Kings Cross and jumping in between Platforms 9 and 10  and getting on the Hogwarts Express and finally getting on a boat to go to Hogwarts  It took me on this magical adventure and it was absolutely breathtaking  And oh my god the character development in Harry Potter was astonishing to witness  as he comes across this kid who lives in the cupboard under the stairs and has to put up with such brutal characters who makes his childhood a living hell and doesn t know anything about himself or his family to a kid who knows where he belongs and is loved and brave  It was an emotional ride seeing this spark light up in him and him being truly happy  Also gotta love the british humour in this book and the sarcasm  god I laughed too many times  I just adored how every character played a part in this novel and that everything comes to life and it s so magical and remarkable  I believe that everyone should at least this give this book a try  so they can experience this magical world and it s so exciting because you actually feel like you re there   Would you judge and review bible  Alright gather around    Collect your tickets here for we have for you an amazing persona who has not read Harry potter in her life and yes that person would be me Yeah yeah I know that I have to have been living under a rock to have not read this book yet  But at least I was aware of the series  So why finally read it a  One of my book soul mate have been practically begging me to do so   I hear you swati       b Let s just say that there is this one person who may have not even bothered to read a shopping receipt in her life  let alone a book  So turns out that even this person has read harry potter series and even have all the seven books in her collection and when that person mocks you about having not read Harry potter  then you know things have gone bad and that you are doomed and you should pile up on the potter series as fast as you can  so that you could shut the person up You should know about me that my room has furniture made out of books because that s how massive my collection and addiction to books is and apparently none of them is a harry potter book  Apparently not having read a Harry potter book makes me some kind of outlaw and sinner in the book world so fearing the wrath of book gods  I have finally read my first harry potter book    so open up the best bottle in your collection and we will have party at your house  So leaving all the crap aside   let s talk about the book There is practically nothing that you can say that has not been said before  Yes the book is intriguing  grasping and full of fun element  It is something that any age can immerse themselves into without regrets  No doubt I want to go through the entire series  There are elements and magic world details that need your undivided attention  In whole  the book is pretty good and one hell of a read  This book is fantastic  It s really hard for me to not fangirl all over this review instead of writing something reasonable but let s try to do this As a relatively young person I ve read Harry Potter while i was just a kid  Cut to the closest relationship I ve ever had in my life  And it was with a book  I d never let it go away my mother was getting angry  I d cheer for Harry and his friends every time they did something great  I d want to punch Voldemort in the nose  if he had one  every time he hurt someone i liked  And when  died i nearly threw the book out of the window  I feel really sorry for the person who gave me that book since i was supposed to return it someday  NEVER LEND ME ANY BOOKS Anyway going back to the history i think that what most got me about the main character was how ordinary he was  He was so normal if you go past the all magic stuff  Also Harry was so sweet even being abused all his life  He showed me that no matter who you are and what you live you can be the most extraordinary person in the world  And that is an important lesson to teach a kid   Duh  Nunca pense que fuera a resenar estos libros  cuando los lei no sabia siquiera lo que era un blog literario y mucho menos sabia como hacer una resena decente  tampoco es que ahora sepa hacerlas je  je  je   Creo que contar el argumento de este libro es totalmente absurdo  todos sabemos de que va la historia de Harry Potter   el nino que vivio    pero aun asi recordare que se trata de un nino huerfano al que acogen sus tios y le mantienen en la ignorancia durante once anos  Llegado el momento empieza a recibir cartas de una institucion peculiar de la cual no ha oido jamas  sus tios intentan a toda cosa que no reciba esas cartas y que no sepa nada acerca del mundo magico  el cual la familia Dursley desprecia  Finalmente consigue recibir la carta y descubre que es hijo de magos y que tiene una plaza esperandole en el prestigioso colegio de magia y hechiceria Hogwarts  Ahi es donde empieza toda la aventura de Harry    See more at  http   pink hummingbird blogspot com     Originally published on www chapterofdreams comThere are times that you need to revisit books that have delighted you  to try to recapture the allure of different  magical worlds that enchanted you in prior years  and J K Rowling s Harry Potter series certainly fills that need for me Several years ago I was given this book from my daughter as a Christmas present  It was quite usual that I received a book as books were always on my wish list  but receiving a book written for children along with the latest mysteries and thrillers of the day was most perplexing  I couldn t understand that choice  but not wanting to hurt her feelings I decided to tackle it first  Little did I realize that Rowling was to weave her magic  casting a spell over me  one that is unbroken to this day  I was so taken with the story that on Boxing Day we rushed out to our local bookstore and purchased books 2 and 3  all that were published at that time  and I was lost in that magical world with Harry  Ron  Hermione  and all the other students and teachers at Hogwarts I soon learned that I wasn t alone  At that time I was working in an office with high power corporate executives who had all had somewhat similar experiences  One has to laugh now when remembering the lawyers  engineers  designers and myself delving into the lives of Hogwarts students and how we were so eagerly anticipating books 3 then 4 then 5  With each new release we were spellbound and devoured those pages and happily exchanged views on their exploits There are critics of these books  but Harry Potter brought so much delight to children and adults alike while instilling a love of reading to so many young people  a love that hopefully will last throughout their lifetimes  I think this is my third or fourth reading and while missing the mystery of what was to happen next it still delighted me as it had so many years ago  It brought me back into that world of wonder where all things are possible  What a perfect Christmas gift   5 Stars Infant Harry Potter is orphaned and left on the doorstep of his intolerant and neglectful aunt and uncle  Petunia   Vernon Dursley  Harry s aunt and uncle are embarassed by Harry s parentage and try to keep the truth away from him  hoping their shameful secret died with Harry s parents  The Dursley s indulge their son Dudley at every turn and provide the bare minimum for Harry  But when Harry s 11th birthday rolls around  the Dursley s are unable to stop his destiny  Harry receives a visit from Hagrid  who was sent especially to ensure Harry had everything he needed to start school in a few weeks  An angry Hagrid has to relay news the Dursley s did not  that Harry is a wizard  the truth about Harry s parents including their death and Harry s attendance at the Wizarding academy  Hogwarts  is met with Harry s bewilderment and the Dursley s annoyance  Hagrid also explains Harry s fame throughout the wizarding world  that Harry is the only survivor of a murder rampage by the greatest dark wizard of all time  Voldemort and  that Voldemort killed Harry s parents  All of these revelations don t overshadow Harry s joy about magic and separation from the Dursley s An excited Harry is overjoyed that on his trip to Hogwarts he makes a friend in Ron Weasley and because he has pocket change Harry gets to have whatever candy he wants  Quickly Harry adjusts to life at Hogwart s as he easily makes friends  has adventures and finds he s actually good at a popular wizarding sport on flying broomsticks while he learns rudimentary magic  But it seems that one of his classmates  Draco Malfoy and one of his teachers  Professor Severus Snape really seem to hate him although he doesn t understand why  As the semester wears on  Harry learns copes with the dislike from Malfoy and Snape  finds another great friend in the very smart Hermoine Granger and spends time with people who genuinely seem to care for him  However everything is not perfect at Hogwarts  Something sinister is lurking on the school grounds with the intent of harming Harry  Through Harry s rudimentary magic  his growing powers  a little help from his friends  Ron and Hermoine  and a bit of luck  Harry is able to succeed in his first year of Hogwarts and thwart the threat  After this very interesting year wraps up  Harry understands how dangerous Voldemort is for him and that he has a powerful protector in the legendary wizard and Hogwarts headmaster  Albus Dumbledore  who has watched over Harry undetected for years I don t know how many times I ve read this series but it s the first time I ve read it in a couple of years and it s lost none of its magic for me  Although this series is termed a children s series  I think its more accurate to be termed a young adult read due to the themes and scenes that may be too frightening for children or sensitive readers  This origin story for a series that has become a classic is light hearted enough to read with children and detailed enough to entertain an adult  I was as fascinated as Harry was on his first trip to Diagon Alley and Gringotts and seeing Hogwarts for the first time  Watching Harry cope with danger and gain confidence in himself and realize that he is happy with his new life was cheering and made his triumphs that much sweeter  This fast paced engaging read has interesting  charismatic and vividly drawn characters with strong voices that are easily discernible in each situation and character subset  The overall storyline is layered with so much detail that it has something for everyone as this tale also promises many more surprises  adventures and reasons to care about this gentle boy as he accepts his heritage and learns how to live in both worlds  This book was every bit as charming and lovable as I remember and custom doesn t stale its infinite variety  Surprises included how child like it is now that I m calibrated to later novels in the series and also how short it is  It seems to be about 20  of the last book Regardless  it is fabulous to immerse with these characters again  witnessing their indomitable courage and watching them and their friendship grow 2013  Oddly  I ve read this series a couple of times over the holidays and come to associate it with Christmas  even though the work is in no way related to the holidays  Even though it is sooner than I would typically revisit it  I found myself craving it  Also  it is literary comfort food  which is something I m in deep need of right now  I m so happy to be returning to Hogwarts     2016  Finally reading these with the kids  It s been absolutely fantastic  My kids had seen the movies  and they re usually reluctant to read books and see movies based on them  though they re happy to do either  They fell so in love with this book that Alex is racing ahead of me and Lily and then going over it again with us  The movies for  most of  these books are excellent  but the books are so much more  AHHH TIMES 394 I just got the new box set  oh my gosh so gorgeous and it feels so good I ve been stroking it and giggling  my family probably thinks I m crazy  and I just finished rereading the first one  I think this might be the fourth time  I m not a 100  sure at this point   Anyway it was amazing and I picked up on a lot of foreshadowing  I gasped and giggled like a druggie while reading  I m so excited to enter the wizarding world again  it s been far too long 25 December 2013      I love these books  The first Harry Potter novel has no rival   J K  Rowling changed the world with The Boy Who Lived This time  number 5 or 6  I don t even know what time it is at this point  I really took my time reading  I savored it  read things over   caught things I didn t before For example  the Sorting Hat took almost a minute when sorting Seamus   interesting  no  And the Essence of Dittany   what saved Ron s arm in book 7 was first mentioned at the very beginning Oh Joanne  did you really know everything from the beginning  11 August 2015      The first novel really is spectacular  Each time I read something new  How can one story be so different every time  I read it again this time for class  Yes  I m taking a class on Harry Potter  We re going to read all of them during the semester  so here comes reread 7  8   I m not quite sure at this point  I ve lost count 24 January 2016  This is a review from my third time reading this book  It s rare that you find books that you can return to years after your first read and still find yourself in love with them  I remember having this read to me when I was 9 in 4th grade by my teacher and adoring it  I d sit in the front of our group on the floor and be completely pulled in  Now as I sit here after reading it again at the age of 21 I still feel that same enthusiasm I did back then  I still feel all the same emotions and had the same reactions  but I think it s been intensified  Knowing the whole story I can look at that first book and see things I didn t the first time  I certainly appreciate my favorite characters more There isn t much else I can say about how much I love these books  They ve been with me for so long that I can t imagine a world without them   By this point everyone knows I love Harry Potter  so this review is less about the actual story  which is awesome  and more about the experience of the new Illustrated edition I first encountered Harry Potter at the age of 8  in fourth grade  A full year after it had first released  so after my teacher finished reading the first one to us in class I pressured my dad into buying both the first one and second one for me  It s been 17 years  with the US release date  not UK  since that wonderful year  and this story has aged beautifully  Instead of growing tired of the same story  I only love it more with each reading and I love finding new ways to enjoy it like buying foreign editions or reading them with friends  So of course I used my birthday money to buy this  in July  and then proceeded to freak out until it finally released in October  It was so worth the wait I barely got a chapter in before I realized that THIS is the way Harry Potter should be read  Not only did the larger book format make the story easier to gobble up  the pictures only fueled my need and desire to keep flipping the pages because I so desperately wanted to know what the next one would look like  The illustrations themselves are gorgeous and I think that Kay really knocked it out of the park with his interpretations and art style  I spent a ton of time simply staring at each one looking for all the small details that he skillfully added in and even letting others look at them to see if they spotted anything I didn t  The one image I had issue with  and yes there was only one  was the image that of Snape  I just didn t get the potions room   it looked less like a dark  dank  apothecary and more like a chamber of horrors  I think my favorite character portrayals are Hagrid  Hermione  Dumbledore  and McGonagall To top it off  they have plans to release the entire series like this and I really hope with everything I have that they do  It s so amazing to have something new to look forward to again  This Harry Potter nerd is completely in love and utterly satisfied  Talmente piccolo da dormire in un sottoscala  cosi umile da sopportare un cugino

Stars This book is definitely one of my all time favorite books and I have read it at least half a dozen times  This book is actually the book that turned me into an avid reader in the first place  The first time I read it  it so charmed and enchanted me that I decided to read others and soon enough  reading had become my favorite pastime to the point where I barely watched television anymore  even though before I could hardly go a day without watching it What makes this book and this series so great The characters  the first time I read Harry Potter  I was the same age as the characters in the book  So  I completely related to them and enjoyed their adventures  I was always able to find a little bit of my own character traits inside each of them  At times  I could be as serious as Hermione and as silly as Ron  and sometimes I like to think that I could be as kind and brave as Harry  Now  I m 21 years old so I shouldn t still feel the same way about these kids but I do  I don t know if it s because I grew up with them or if because the way Ms  Rowling wrote them gave them a certain kind of life for me but after 10 years  they can still make me smile and excited and even outraged on their behalf on occasion  Reading the book  I either felt like yep  if I was in this situation  I would have done the same thing or I could never in a million years do that  but you go guys  I still had these same thoughts reading it for the seventh time the past couple of days The setting  Hogwarts and the magical world of this book is so well written and imaginative  You can t help going wow  how did she come up with this  Quidditch alone  I now realize  is a mix of basketball  soccer  cricket or baseball  capture the flag  and dodgeball   Basketball hoops  quaffle and the chasers  soccer the keeper and the chasers  cricket or baseball the beaters  capture the flag the seeker and the snitch  and dodgeball the bludgers   The castle itself just speaks to the explorer in every person  I mean can you imagine playing hide seek in there  it would be awesome  The lessons  This book teaches great lessons about friendship and bravery  good and evil  love  sacrifice  loss  loneliness  how to rise above abuse and bullying  and most importantly that you have the power to change your life and no matter how bad things seem  there s always hope  Some of these subjects would normally be a little heavy for children but the fact that it s explained in a way that would appeal to a child as well as an adult is a part of what makes this series so great  I mean  a kid won t go into this book expecting to be taught a life lesson  it s only when you re finished reading the book that you realize that you ve been through a journey and that at the end of a journey  you can t help but have learned something from the experience Last but not least  what makes this book so memorable is not Hogwarts  the wands  the broomsticks  or the magic but Harry himself Reading this book as a child  you never really realize the severity of what the Dursleys put Harry through and how it could twist and embitter anyone  The truth of the matter is Harry is not only an orphan  he has also been abused  neglected  and severely bullied his entire life  He is incredibly isolated  alone and lonely without any kindness in his life  He has no friends and absolutely no one he can talk to or rely on  He lives inside a tiny  dark cupboard  and is locked inside whenever the Dursleys fill like it  If anyone read the conditions Harry lived in in a non fiction novel  we would be appalled and would start thinking of all the issues and psychological damage Harry could have as a result of living in these conditions  Instead of becoming angry and bitter  instead of lashing out at the world or lash out at himself  Harry goes on  he takes it one day at a time and never loses hope that things will get better  That s why when he s told that he is a wizard that he can t believe it  just because you have hope doesn t mean you actually believe that things will get better  And that is precisely what Harry Potter is about  hope in the face of adversity  hope that things will get better People who hate the Harry Potter series because of the magic in it need to realize that the book would be just as popular and inspiring without it  The magic itself is more like window dressing to get you interested about reading the life of this very special boy  Let me show you Harry Potter in another context  We have an abused and neglected orphan who one day meets a man that tells him that he is special  that he matters and has a lot to bring to the world no matter what he s been told  We have a boy that has been through so much  that he might have decided that life wasn t worth living anymore  finding strength in a stranger s kindness  We have a boy that could just as easily become a bully himself or abuse other the way he s been abused but this boy is kind  thoughtful  and very empathetic  Harry could have easily made fun of Ron for being poor but instead made himself vulnerable by sharing his own story to make Ron feel better and showing him that he understood his pain  That is rare and incredible and that is what inspires children and adults all over the world Reading about Harry s life  you think  if Harry could make it through all that so can I  If Harry can wake up every day and face life with the Dursleys then I can go to school every day and face that bully that s been making my life hell  If Harry can still find a way to go on after losing his parents  then so can I  or even if my parents are getting a divorce  I know they would still do for me what Harry s parents did for him so I can make it through this because unlike Harry I still have my parents  I know I m shy but if I don t get the courage to talk to this other kid  then I might miss out on getting my own Ron and Hermione  friends that will be there for me no matter what  If Harry can fight this big scary thing that is Voldemort  then I too can fight the Voldemorts of my life  I can overcome all these obstacles in my way  I can fight this cancer or this disease that wants to kill me as long as I have hope like Harry did  Hope  that is the essence of Harry Potter  this boy whose story has gotten me through some of the toughest times of my life  who has made me smile when I thought I would never smile again  I don t care about the magic  even as a child I never did  it was just a means to tell a story  That was what I cared about  Hogwarts was fun and so was the magic  but what I really cared about was     the story     of Harry  Resena completa  http   quieroleersinlimites blogspot          Para mi este libro es esplendido  y me da igual que algunos aborrezcan la saga  estan en su derecho  o que el grupo de lectores intelectuales que se empena en menospreciar las sagas de fantasia que han tenido exito  porque asumamos que hay gente que aborrece todo lo que tiene un exito notable  digan que es una basura que no vale nada  Para mi seguira siendo increible  y seguire leyendo los libros como si fuera la primera vez  y seguire pegando las paginas con celo porque cada dia se me sueltan mas Si lo juzgo desde el punto de vista de la primera vez  tened en cuenta que era una nina XD  recuerdo que me sorprendio al saber quien era el verdadero malo  sin tener en cuenta a Voldemort  por supuesto   sigues tanto las divagaciones del trio y sus conjeturas tienen tanto sentido  que no te paras a pensar que tal vez sea demasiado obvio  aunque hoy en dia tal vez lo hubiese hecho  nunca lo sabremos   asi que este libro me parecio misterioso  divertido y triste  Me encanto descubrir ese mundo que te hacia esperar todos los anos una carta de Hogwarts  que te hacia desear que en la tele apareciese de repente un partido de quidditch o mirar por la calle por si veias gente rara con capa        What can I really say that hasn t been said before about Harry Potter I never read the books nor watch the films before  When the Harry Potter craziness spread all over the world  I was very busy with my Agatha Christie books  and I couldn t care less   back then  about Harry Potter  I absolutely love the fantasy genre  and always told myself I m going to read the Harry Potter books someday  and only just finished the first volume I m very happy with the book  I smiled and let out a happy sigh when I finished  in only two sits  which is a record for me  Everything was crafted perfectly  the writing is superb  the events were remarkable and gripping  and the characters  all of them   were interesting and memorable Harry Potter is the perfect fantasy formula  drawing apparent inspirations from Tolkien but branching deeply and separately to form its own league  This is a book to be read by everyone  Excellent blend of literature   imagery  The book often reminded me of the Dragon Quest games   light hearted  yes  but it s simply perfect  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone  what is there to say that hasn t already been said  Magical  creative  spellbinding  suspenseful  cleverly crafted with a sense of camaraderie  just to name a few Harry Potter  the boy who lived has no idea that he is special or famous  how could he with a cousin like Dudley Dursey  So when Harry gets his letter to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry a whole new world opens up for him filled with adventure It is hard not to fall in love with Harry Potter and his slew of run ins with danger  not to mention defeating Voldemort the most powerful Wizard not once but twice  Although  even though the stories are enchanting  they have a kind of nostalgia to them as this was one series I read over and over again  and obviously still do   Recently  my mom told me that when she would read the novels to my brother and I it took everything in her power not to continue on after we had fallen asleep  I think it really says something about a book  or books  if they can be read and enjoyed by multiple generations  Classic  Prin merika khronia  an mou elege kaneis oti tha eblepa tis tainies tou Khari Poter maniodos tha tou elega oti einai trelos  Blepete

I forgot just how magical this story was  Between the amazing characters  the world that you can t help but become immersed in  the fun adventures  and the amazingly delicious sounding food  this book is fantastic Welcome Harry  the boy who lived  Also the boy who doesn t know what he is  After the tragic death of his parents Harry is sent to live with his only living relatives  However  this isn t exactly a happy life considering his Aunt  Uncle and cousin don t treat him like family but more like a servant  However  at the age of eleven  Harry is accepted to the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and embarks on a magical adventure where he learns about friendship  love  and himself He s treated like crap  yet keeps his head high  He knows what its like to be the underdog so he doesn t judge people but gets to know them instead  He s kind  funny  courageous and has no shortage of nosiness  He may get into trouble a lot  but thats only because he s trying to help out  I admire that he stands up for what he believes in and isn t afraid to get his hands dirty because of it I love Ron and Hermione  They may be just the friends of  The Boy Who Lived  but they take center stage just as much as Harry  Ron is the youngest of 4 brothers and is just trying to prove himself and he doesn t fail  He s funny and adventuresome and knows how to play a wicked game of wizard s chess  Hermione  the brains of the bunch  may be a bit high and mighty  but when it comes to Ron and Harry  she s willing to do anything to keep them safe The Weasly twins  Oh goodness  I loved them from the beginning  The funny pranksters are definitely a great addition to this story  Neville may get picked on often  but when its time to be brave  he definitely lives up to it  Dumbledore may be a bit  off his rocker  but he s wise and witty and makes an awesome Headmaster  A lot of thought went into these characters to make them unique and I can definitely say that Ms  Rowling did a fantastic job The writing is simple  yet beautiful  I really enjoy that the story sounded almost like someone telling a story  I could easily imagine sitting in a circle listening to someone tell this story The world building was fantastic and so well thought out  Honestly  J  K  Rowling though of everything  But don t think that you ll be bogged down by details  She gives just enough to really let you see what its like without going overboard  She obviously put so much thought into this world and was able to create something so incredible  Also  I actually liked that I had seen the movie because as I was reading it  I was picturing the movie in my mind  I love to compare the books and movies to see what was kept in the movie and what was left out  Let me say that they did a fantastic job to bringing the book to life The plot will not let you down  There is so much adventure and action and fun that is in these books  Also  since I ve read all the books before  I ve now realized how much thought had to go into these books  This story arc stretches across 7 books  which takes a lot of thought to keep things organized and flowing  There are references in this book that you recognize in later books and things that they talk about in this book that happen in others  Although the plot may seem simple in this book  once you read them all you ll realize how complicated and intricate it all is If you can t tell from my long  sorry bout that btw  review  I absolutely adore this book  I want to go to Hogwarts and visit Diagon Alley thanks the wondrous descriptions given by Rowling  I want to meet Ron  Hermione  Harry  Neville and all of the other characters that I ve fallen in love with because of reading this book  I want to eat the delicious sounding food  Harry Potter is such a great story about love and the power of friendship and I encourage all who have yet to read it get their rears in gear and head to the bookstore to buy it asap   So  I am re reading the entire Harry Potter series again and that means they now can get the full review that they deserve  I found myself falling in love with this book again  I never really realised how much I had missed reading the first book in an amazing series  I still remember when I first started reading it and I know I fell in love then too  Only now can I really and truly appreciate its magic in all its forms after I have read it again for I think the 7th time now  My mindset is a lot stronger and I know now how much these books and the characters in them still mean to me after so many years  I loved how much Harry stood strong in a family who didn t love him or care for him  He was tossed aside and he stood his ground and lived life the only way he had ever known  A lot of children these days would be taking another route and ending it completely  I love how Harry didn t even contemplate such silly notions and kept strong through every little thing that tried to destroy him in life  I truly adore how much love he has to give and how generous and brave he is  Sharing sweets with Ron on the Hogwarts Express  saving Hermione from a troll  standing up for Neville and knowing who he should befriend and who is no friend of his at all  Harry Potter for me will always be known as someone who had so much love to give and never stopped giving it  I don t have any bad points at all  and I normally find something to complain about  but with this book  there is nothing  I found myself smiling at random points during this book and when I realised I was doing it it only made my smile bigger  This book begins something truly special for me  it symbolises my childhood  showing me how much love and bravery are some of the most important values to hold and to never give up no matter what  I can t wait until I decide to re read this again another day  I honestly look forward to it    Everyone should read this book  There are hyped books  there are books that are so hyped that you re sick of hearing of them all the time  and there are books that are hyped and are supposed to be fantastic  wonderful reads  but they turn out to be dreadfully horrible instead  Fifty Shades and Twilight come to mind   Then there is the Harry Potter books I have heard so many people rave about these books  never saying anything bad about them  saying you MUST read them  you certainly won t regret it  and I knew I should get around to reading them  but I never had a good opportunity  Until now  I realise now  while I was wasting my time reading Twilight and Halo and all other distasteful books  that I should ve been reading the Harry Potter series  I mean  wow  A such hyped book hasn t impressed me this much since     forever  When I read the Hunger Games at the beginning of this year  I know I m behind the times  ___   there were little things about it that bothered me  but I still enjoyed it  With this book  I have found not one thing that I didn t like or enjoy or find boring The characters  even the less major ones  burst from the page and just seem so damn real  The writing style    oh my gods  I have not read something with such beautiful story telling in my life  From the first page  I was transfixed to the book  not daring to put it down  I have probably paid my friends so little attention in the past few days while reading this  they  hopefully not D    might be a little sick of my reading habits  Granted  I did borrow the first four books from my friend  so it is mainly her fault  Hehehe   The setting was absolutely amazing  and I could not comprehend how much detail J K Rowling fit into her story without it dragging on like a hot Summer s day when you re stuck in the classroom  I mean  she had everything a good story needs down pat  It s astounding  really  I can t wait to read the second book   Note  this review is for the whole series So  this book is so famous that probably everyone has heard of it and either read the book  seen the movie  or both  But I have to write a review  This is the best book I have ever read  I LOVED the whole series FOUR REASONS WHY YOU SHOULD READ HARRY POTTER 1  Characters  Harry is the best protagonist ever  He is endearing and sweet and throughout the series he grows up and his character becomes more complex as the series progresses  Ron and Hermione were awesome too  I loved the friendship between all of them and the tremendous amount of development in their characters  In fact  all of the characters  whether major or minor in the story  had personalities and felt like real people  2  World building  J K Rowling created a fantastical world of magic and it was amazing  Magical creatures  the Ministry of Magic  the spells  Hogwarts  magical objects  all of it was so well thought out and written  Best fantasy world ever    Only thing was  I was slightly confused by how clueless some wizards were about the  Muggle  or non wizard world  But in the end it didn t really matter   3  Themes  There are such strong themes of family  friendship  love  good vs  evil  power  I liked it  The books taught some very good lessons  4  Writing  J K Rowling is a brilliant and insanely talented writer  She created characters that are lovable  relatable and endearing  she came up with an amazingly fantastical world for the story  she came up with new and interesting plots for all seven books so I never felt like I was reading the same thing over and over again  And the way she writes  There are some heart wrenching moments  especially in Order of the Phoenix  Half Blood Prince and Deathly Hallows  and there are some light hearted and joyful moments  It is perfectly balanced out and I loved every page of all seven books As an added bonus  the movies stay true to the books and I felt they were well done  I Enjoyed the movies almost as much as the books  especially the Prisoner of Azkaban movie  In short  I absolutely adored all seven Harry Potter novels  And I absolutely recommend them  Can I even write a review on Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone  when so many reviews have already been written by so many people that love it  I shall  I must  Because I love it too  I love it first and foremost for one simple fact  Harry Potter is pure storytelling  There is no lengthy descriptions  no droning on and on pages of dialogue  or side plots that lead nowhere and leave you puzzled  Every single little detail has its place  everything is used  from a card in the chocolate frog to Scabbers the pet rat to Quirrell being accidentally knocked over by passing Hermione Granger to    I can go on and on  In other words  as Chekhov said  if you introduce a rifle in Chapter 1  in Chapter 2 it better fire  And fire it does Harry Potter is the perfect likable character you can imagine  an orphan  set up to live with terrible horrible Dursleys  He s a boy who wasn t killed by the most powerful dark wizard Voldemort  Due to this fact alone  Harry Potter is destined for greatness  It s the perfect fairy tale about an underdog who becomes a celebrity overnight and has now to live up to the hype  Or else  It s a story about love and death  albeit decorated profusely with such amazing things as baby dragons  trolls  magical alleys  flying broomsticks  invisible cloaks  the incredible game of Quidditch  a sorcerer s stone and much much more  set against the background of a boarding school in the green valley somewhere far away in England  In one word  it s magical  It pulls you in  grabs you and doesn t let you go until you re finished  making you want more  Isn t that what books are about  about losing oneself in them Harry Potter will do that to you  It did it to me  Into Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets I go  Harry Potter was literally my best friend growing up  No one could convince me that there were better books out there  ever  Not in a million years  However now that I ve finished up high school  I thought I d give the series another go  try to be objective this time  and see if through my childhood I was just reading these books with rose colored glasses on  And my impression this time around is that book one is   cozy  On the surface  as a light reader  it s all really very simple  easy to follow  Magic and the wizarding world all feel so natural  JKR really didn t have to try hard to submerge us into this fantasy world  In a way  Harry is like a ridiculously young Odyseus  his journey is a series of severely loosely connected steps that end in one big hoorah  And part of the reason why we like Harry so much is that he s clueless  and he s practically useless most of the time  He s learning things about the wizarding world at the same pace we are  and we like that  because it almost boosts our egos and makes us believe that hey  maybe we can be first years at Hogwarts  too  Book One doesn t lead us to believe that this is the best fantasy series since Lord of the Rings  Rather  it s more like The Hobbit  introducing us to everything we need to know and getting our feet wet before we get into the heavy stuff  It s a phenomenal book  and I m so happy that I revisited it  Let s see how I feel about the next six  Who would have thought that the long awaited release of the Harry Potter series  written by the clever and imaginative J K Rowling  would have had such a worldwide impact on the lives of children and adults alike Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone is the first in the seven part book series and sets the tone and pace for the other books to follow The book begins with a timid ten year old boy named Harry who is led to believe that he lost his parents in a car crash when he was just a baby  Poor Harry is therefore made to live with his outrageous uncle Vernon  aunt Petunia and spoilt cousin Dudley Dursley Harry knows it will not be long until he turns eleven  which to him is just another birthday and another day living with the Dursleys  What Harry doesn t know is that  when the clock strikes 12 on his birthday  a large  friendly character called Hagrid would turn up and inform him that he is  in fact  a wizard Harry embarks on a series of adventures that take place at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry with his new found friends Hermione and Ron  meeting very strange characters along the way  one of which being the evil and threatening Lord Voldermort Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone is my favourite in the book series because it shows us that not everything is as it seems and that when you feel that life is as good as it s going to get  things can change drastically  We start the journey with Harry Potter learning how to be a wizard and it feels to me as if we are on the journey with him  I also like the fact that we get to see Harry change from being this shy boy  who feels he is not worthy of even a bedroom to himself  to this young man who is an important and essential part of the wizard world  The descriptive language used is extremely effective in creating this magical world This book is highly appropriate for ages 7 11  especially because it impacts on the young mind and enables them to be creative in their own writing  be that for pleasure or at school  I feel it would help 7 11 year olds realise that friendship is important and you always have someone to rely on  be that of an adult or child  I wouldn t have a bookshelf in my classroom without it  Last week  I got invited to see the upcoming midnight showing of Harry Potter  7 Part I and got to thinking that I should read the books  I haven t seen any of the movies     yes  clips here and there but didn t think anything of it  WOW WOW WOW    I so totally see all the rave now  I am happy that I finally started this series  Although I d love to see the upcoming movie  I don t want to see any spoilers but rather enjoy reading the rest of the installments and catch up  So  I ll hold off and see it later Ms Rowling surely has an incredible imagination  She was throwing those adventures left and right as if she was making it up as she went along  Like when you tell your kids an impromptu bedtime story and the kids eat it all up  Afterall  there was magic  games  candies  potions  forbidden forest  and on and on and on  I was eating up this spectacular book  She must have had fun coming up with those names and terms too  Hogwarts  Dumbledore  Hufflepuff  Bertie Bott s Every Flavor Bean  Muggles  and tons more  I loved them   And there were all sort of creatures    dragons  centaurs  owls  goblins  rats  etc  For crying out loud  there s unicorns  Who doesn t like unicorns  Of course  the cast of characters were marvelous  AAAHH  I so enjoyed reading this amazing book and especially how it ended   I read this at the perfect time too  Nothing like reading this in the midst of PMS to make this book even more exciting  I know  too much information  It s just that my moodiness went along with the book  The beginning was so sad  then an adventurous craziness  followed by a very happy ending  The ending was what sealed the deal for me  I m a total sucker for a happy ending with a moral growth building aspect If you re one of the seven who has not read this book    like Nike says  just do it   I m having my soon to be 8yo son read it over the minimum week and holiday break  He s excited  He actually saw the movie adaptation of this book  I had to Shhh  a few times because he kept saying things like   Have you gotten to that part yet when      Anyway  a truly must read book  It was exhilarating        Find this review and more at Jinky is reading I am re reading Harry Potter yet again  This time around I am finally going to post my favorite moments from Harry Potter books and movies on my blog as I had planned many times before  But as many of you dont follow my blog  I decided to post it here but the amount of time it was taking was insane and I just spent 5 hours working on the blog post and m in no mood to spend 5 hours here again  I am sorry about this but I request you to visit my blog from the entire post but here is the preview 1   Moment 1    Mr and Mrs Dursley of number four  Privet Driver  were proud to say that they were perfectly normal  thank you very much 2   Moment 2    There will be books written about Harry   every child in our world will know his name 3   Moment 3     I would trust Hagrid with my life   said Dumbledore 4   Moment 4     To Harry Potter   the boy who lived  5   Moment 5    As the snake slid swiftly past him  Harry could have sworn a low hissing voice said   Brazil  here I come    Thanksss Amigo  Rest of the review is here   http   harini me books best moments o    Merely  I won t say anything except that J K Rowling has an extraordinary wide range of imagination   She created a chimerical world including special bank of wizards Gringotts   Quidditch and its rules  platform nine and three quarters o_O and Diagon Alley   She even invinted the Ministry of Magic o_O I liked also the peculiar idea of owls sending letters   The sequence of events was very exiting and was constantly changing in an unexpected way   Namely  Harry and Ron hated Hermione so much but by time they became best friends      Also   Snape was considered to be killing Harry but in real he was trying to save him  As for my best chapters   I really loved   The Sorting Hat     The descriptions in   Diagon Alley   were very interesting too  After I finished the book  I knew why was a chess board drawn at the beging of the book and 9 3 4 at its back   And as I recently knew that   Sorcerer s stone   is used at U K while   Pilosopher s stone   is used at the U S A       Here are the things I like to collect     Harry Potter   was firstly mentioned at page 20     Philosopher s stone   was mentioned at page 237 and Harry  Ron and Hermione became friends at the end of chapter   Hallowe en    Thx 4 reading    Finalmente mi sono decisa a leggere questo capolavoro Ricordo che mooltoo ma mooltoo tempo fa vidi qualche film e ora me ne ricordavo davvero vagamente Leggere Harry Potter e stato come tuffarsi in un nuovo mondo a dir poco fantastico  Harry Potter e un normale bambino di 11 anni che vive con gli zii  che lo maltrattano  e l odioso cugino Dudley perche i genitori sono morti in un presunto incidenti d auto  Il giorno del compleanno di Harry   dopo moltissime lettere che lo zio ha bruciato  nella loro casa arriva un gigante che finalmente rivelera la verita ad Harry  lui e un mago  proprio come i suoi genitori che  in realta  sono morti per uno scontro con  Voi Sapete Chi  al quale Harry e riuscito a sopravvivere mantenendo una cicatrice a forma di saetta sulla fronte  Hagrid spiego che il ragazzino era invitato a frequentare la famosa Hogwarts  la scuola di magia piu importante  Harry accetta piu che volentieri e da qui per lui iniziera un altra vita  Credo che Harry Potter abbia ogni requisito per rientrare nella top ten books  molto probabilmente al primo posto  Prima cosa  riesce a trasportarti in un altro mondo da cui non vorresti mai uscire  Secondo   l ultimo aggettivo per descriverlo sarebbe noioso   e ricco di colpi di scena ed azione  Terzo  lo stile dell autrice e spettacolare  Ogni personaggio e profondo e singolare Quanto mi piacerebbe essere Hermione    Silente  il professore della scuola che mi ha ricordato un po  Gandalf  mi ha veramente affascinato  Credo che nel resto della saga la sua figura sia ancora piu presente  me lo auguro  Leggero gli altri presto  Ma mi voglio impegnare leggendone piu e meno uno al mese per far si che posa apprezzare al meglio ognuno      When I was a kid  my grandma sent me the first Harry Potter book  I made it through book 4 before we transitioned to a different church than the one we had been attending  this one was super conservative and condemned all sorts of things    magic  fantasy  Halloween    and that was the end of my foray into Harry Potter s world  Now  several years later  I am re visiting Harry  and it s so exciting  it s so fun to read what I loved when I was a kid  I m looking forward to re reading and also to catching up on the books and movies that I missed I could not put The Sorcerer s Stone down  It s wonderful  it s gripping  it s funny and heartfelt  I can clearly see why so many people think J K  Rowling is a genius  I m a librarian now  and I see why so many people of so many ages are attracted to her characters  I love how her books appeal to all different kinds of people  I love being moved by her writing  It s going to be a wonderful rest of the year as I read this compelling series  I honestly don t remember how many times I ve read this  Every time I find something new in the books  I find something to think about and to enjoy  This is a really beautiful story  I cannot help myself  When I was a kid I only appreciated the storyline    but now I see more important things such as family  having friends and just being happy and satisfied with yourself  I just cannot give Harry Potter less than 5 stars for his sentimental value    So once again   I LOVED IT  FINISHED  I loved it as usual  although reading the book aloud was a different experience for me  in a good way  Little Sis told me it was her favourite book ever and burst into tears when I said I wouldn t start reading the second book tonight  Any guilt went out the window when she sat on my head and refused to move until I d promised to read her a chapter of book 2 before bed  HAVE I CREATED A MUNCHKIN SIZED FANGIRL FANKID FANBABY OR WHAT           Don t answer that  My first excursion in the Harry Potter universe was what you would call a life changing event  I think I was about eight years old when I first got this as a gift from a friend of mine for my birthday  Since at the time I was more in love with being outside and playing hide and seek with my neighbors than sitting inside all day snuggled up with a good book  it took me about six months to finally crack this open and start reading it  and my God what a surprise I was in for I couldn t put the book down  I actually stayed up all night reading it  and then my mom caught me and I was grounded for a week but I didn t even care  I just sat there reading this wonderful masterpiece and loved it  It was the start of my career as a Harry Potter die hard fan  and I have to say  I still remember the butterflies in my stomach every time I turned a page and delved deeper into that wonderful universe of magic and danger  NEVER HAVE I EVER thought that I d read Harry potter  Let alone like it  Let alone LOVE it It s just the way I picture their world is too close to accurate   the details help me imagine them so clearly it hurts  I never dragged on the details like I used to do in other books because it s just way too interesting     Shame on non potterhead Rasha for not reading it sooner    But hopefully I can make up for my mistakes  I thank Razan     3  There s barely a point in reviewing this book as I ve loved it dearly with all my heart ever since I was five and my mum would read it to me every night before bedtime It was rather better to reread The Philosopher s Stone at the age I am now  though  as moments like when Harry sat all night on a cold hard floor in front of the mirror of Erised just so he could be with the mere reflection of his dead parents struck me emotionally way more now than when I was an anxious infant eager to hear about the part where stuff got blown up with magic  Plus  I get all the jokes and references now Fifteen years after it first being published   and thirteen after it was first introduced to me   Harry Potter is still Harry Potter  Hogwarts is still Hogwarts  and the magic that first fascinated me more than a decade ago is forever enduring  and will hopefully never fade from grasp And thank Merlin for that  FIVE  5  stars of course    I never thought I refused to read this back in high school  _  AND to even think I chose Nancy Drew s Books over this  OH  how I wish I could go back in time Oh by the way  prior to the movie adaption of this film  I would like to give a small statement  Before you start reading the Harry Potter series  PLEASE  Separate the film from the book and you will be impressed  Totally  I remember watching the film but as a huge fan of the book  I must be very unrealistic  I knew there have been a lot of information left out in the film adaption  There were few parts of the book that I wish have been included in the film because it could have made the story richer  but I won t go into detail so I don t give away any of the film s changes and this is a book review  as I remember   pWell  my journey doesn t end here  I will pursue to read the rest of the Potter Series  3 Releer este clasico  mio  en esta hermosa edicion ilustrada fue una experiencia muy especial  Hacia muchos anos que no releia el primer libro de HP  y fue como si redescubriera el universo creado por Rowling y volviera a ver todo por primera vez  Las ilustraciones son muy bellas y complementan la lectura a la perfeccion  La traduccion es lo unico que no termina de encantarme  hay varias detalles que cambiaron que no fluyen o que no cuadran con el original  como poner  buhos  en vez de  lechuzas   Aun asi  ame esta edicion    I love everything about this series and the first book in particular  The characters and the whole setting are so unique and loveable and I think everybody catches himself imagining  this world truly exists   I certainly do  The plot is interesting and exiting no matter if you are eleven years old or twenty eight or whatever  And I cannot help but admire the multitude of details  Those little things help constructing a rich and vivid world  make the reader laugh and create an amazing arc through the whole series of book  I enjoy this book every single time   so no doubt it deserves five stars  My first reread of Harry Potter  I only read them last year  and I m so happy I chose the Illustrated Edition  I absolutely adored the illustrations by Jim Kay and am extremely excited to see the rest of the series  It s very strange seeing someone elses vision of a world you have imagined yourself   It s also very strange reading something you already know the ending to   makes you see people differently    Technically a reread as I read this about 15 years ago  I was really thinking I would not love this and would not get the hype because I was not obsessed when I first read this  But  I think reading this as an adult makes me finally get it  Also knowing how things play out  because of the movies  definitely adds a whole new meaning to everything  It was beautiful  The emotions  All the foreshadowing  I definitely freaking cried because I am an emotional monster  This book was so great  I should ve read this book years ago  but better late than never  view spoiler  I m a slytherin  but man oh man was I happy for the Gryffindor gang for winning the House Cup  Then  I felt guilty for betraying my house  Oh well  I suppose I m not technically in their year  and us slytherins need a good beating every once in awhile haha     hide spoiler   4 99999999 StarsAudiobookNarration   Jim Dale   Kick Ass  I love these darn Harry Potter books  Read them all  then bought the CD s because audible doesn t carry them and am now Putting all the CD s into iTunes so I can listen to them again  The ONLY reason I won t say they are complete 5 star reads is because of the MASSIVE Scooby Doo endings that they have  It s all in how the secrets are revealed in such an obvious and simplistic manner  Basically every bad thing that they were trying to figure out regurgitated from the bad guy in the last scene  I m not explaining it very well  but some authors manage to reveal the mystery without making the reader feel like a tool who needs it spoon fed to them  Does that make sense  Anyway    Other than that   I love these books  Highly recommend them to kids and adults alike   I still don t know what took me this long to finally start reading the HP series  I loved this one SO much  And even though I already knew the story and knew what was gonna happen  it kept me constantly at the edge of my seat Can t hardly wait to move on to the next one in the series and to become a part of this fandom that marked an entire generation   This book needs no introduction  I m pretty sure everyone knows of it  so I won t insult you all by telling you what it s about   I was quite surprised when I received my copy of the illustrated edition through the post  I haven t expected it to be so big or so beautiful  I actually do like the size  it makes it all that more special  but I do wonder just how big will the later books in the series be  especially Order of the Phoenix  The artwork is just stunning  Jim Kay is ridiculously talented  Every page has something on it even if there are no illustrations  It gives the book a look of old parchment  I have many favourite illustrations and especially love Jim Kay s depiction of Hogwarts on the inside covers   I can t wait to get my hands on the rest of the series  Just reread this fabulous book and I can still see why I read them in the first place Harry Potter was really the first  super natural  book that was published for young kids  Thats before Vampire Diaries  Twilight and all the rest  Its so refreshing also to read about something other than vampires  and picking up a book you love is a sure way of getting you out of a reading slump Harry  as most would know  is a young boy living with his aunt and uncle  Their not exactly loving and they dont want anyone finding out that they have a secret  a secret about Harry who lives under the stairs When Harry finds out he s a wizard  his whole life changes and he becomes known as the boy who lived  the boy who destroyed Lord Voldemort  Or did he  I can t believe I wasted so many years not reading the Harry Potter books  I just thought I wouldn t like it coz I m not really into fantasy and all those stuffs  But I m surprised I really really really enjoyed it  I adored everything about the book  Mini Review When I was young  like three four years old  I saw  and admittedly grew up with  the first two Harry Potter movies  I knew that someday I had to at least read these books one of these days  and I finally did that  And I loved it I feel like I don t need to say this  but the world of Harry Potter is so magical  no pun intended  and I want to live in Hogwarts  and I feel like I can now finally say that because I ve read at least one of the books If you have not read this book  you need to ASAP because it is a classic  and a children s classic that will forever have a legacy in the world of literature for many generations to come    Post reading  I FINALLY DID IT  I READ A HARRY POTTER BOOK  I WAS EPIC    HARRY POTTER FOREVER     D Dobby has a sock  Dobby is a FREE elf   MY FAVVVOOOUUURRRIIIITTEEE BOOK IN THE WHOLE  ENTIRE  WORLD  EVVVERRR                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    If you don t like it  I will personally throw a bludger at your head and have you writhing in pain on the floor while I point a pen at you saying  SECTUMSEMPRA    and you will be made to read it   SO READ HARRY POTTER YOU FILTHY MUGGLE  D  just kidding but it is a really epic book  I read this book so long ago  but who cares  Do opinions even expire  Hell no they don t         I LOVED Harry Potter when I first read it and I ve grown to love it even more  It s magical perfection  Amazing  This just gets better every time I read it  I have seen the movie so many times and I was actually surprised at how often I was finding small details that were altered for the movie or left out altogether   This book is just too good to even put into words I absolutely love this world  Its so nice to break away from dystopian  dark dreaded worlds which leave me feeling sour  into this gorgeous world of witchcraft and wizardry  I was so totally immersed in every page because of J K Rowling s amazing writing  It is her writing that makes this whole book what it is  She is able to concisely describe situations and events  the story is character driven  and her world building is so beyond anyone or anything else  I can t say anything else  but this book is amazing  You don t realise how many boring books you are reading until you read one that just stands so far beyond the rest   What do you mean  it s excessive to sit and read this all in one sitting  I haven t read it in years and it s just as fun as I remember  Oh  Harry  I missed you  Read Listened for FunOverall Rating  5 00Story Rating  5

FINALLY READ HARRY POTTER Can I just say I am so impressed with how well this book is written  But I even more impressed with how magnificently J K Rowling described  imagined and built such a detailed and fantastical world  I can see why this series of books captured a generation I knew even before I read this book that I would love Hermione Granger  I think Ms Rowling was so clever in her characterisation of Hermione because so many girls that age try to be a goody too shoes and are teased by boys  not many would have disregarded the rules easily  So I praise her for writing believable characters  I JUST LOVE IT ALL  Re read HarryXmasToYou 2014God I missed Hogwarts  I wish I reread the series more often  but alas I m stupid  anyway first time around in english though  loved it  still kind of traumatized even though I knew this for ages  since the movie of the order of the phoenix  by the whole fact that they translated also the last names of the characters  I always wanted to compare the original names to the translated ones re read  HarryXmasToYou 2015I thought I would feel guilty towards all the books I still haven t read yet  but who am I kidding    there s always time for Harry potterI highly recommend the audiobooks narrated by Stephen Fry    I LOVE this book  Have read it a number of times and watched the video innumerable times  Rowling has a fantastic imagination and ability for  world  setting  After I finished the book  I couldn t help looking around at all the Muggles         Audiobook   5 starsNarrator  Stephen Fry20 Sep 2012 to 25 Sep 2012Beautifully narrated   the story captivated me again for the nth time  I loved Fry s characterizations which tied in seamlessly with the movies and my own internal dialogues  There is so much humour littered throughout that it takes a number of reads listens to fully appreciate the care and construction of this storyline  This book is the start of everything for me  This is the book that got me back to reading again and made me the bookaholic I am today  Which is why Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone has a much more special in my heart more than the other books  The relations and the friendship between the cahracters is amazing  The meeting of Ron and Harry is just so random  this reminds me the randomness of the first meeting of me and my close friends which gives bonus points to this book   In a magical world we have this randomness which is one of the elements why we all fell in love with Harry Potter books  It was the most brilliant journey for me  Merely  I won t say anything except that J K Rowling has an extraordinary wide range of imagination   She created a chimerical world including special bank of wizards Gringotts   Quidditch and its rules  platform nine and three quarters o_O and Diagon Alley   She even invinted the Ministry of Magic o_O I liked also the peculiar idea of owls sending letters   The sequence of events was very exiting and was constantly changing in an unexpected way   Namely  Harry and Ron hated Hermione so much but by time they became best friends      Also   Snape was considered to be killing Harry but in real he was trying to save him  As for my best chapters   I really loved   The Sorting Hat     The descriptions in   Diagon Alley   were very interesting too  After I finished the book  I knew why was a chess board drawn at the beging of the book and 9 3 4 at its back   And as I recently knew that   Sorcerer s stone   is used at U K while   Pilosopher s stone   is used at the U S A       Here are the things I like to collect     Harry Potter   was firstly mentioned at page 20     Philosopher s stone   was mentioned at page 237 and Harry  Ron and Hermione became friends at the end of chapter   Hallowe en    Thx 4 reading    Finalmente mi sono decisa a leggere questo capolavoro Ricordo che mooltoo ma mooltoo tempo fa vidi qualche film e ora me ne ricordavo davvero vagamente Leggere Harry Potter e stato come tuffarsi in un nuovo mondo a dir poco fantastico  Harry Potter e un normale bambino di 11 anni che vive con gli zii  che lo maltrattano  e l odioso cugino Dudley perche i genitori sono morti in un presunto incidenti d auto  Il giorno del compleanno di Harry   dopo moltissime lettere che lo zio ha bruciato  nella loro casa arriva un gigante che finalmente rivelera la verita ad Harry  lui e un mago  proprio come i suoi genitori che  in realta  sono morti per uno scontro con  Voi Sapete Chi  al quale Harry e riuscito a sopravvivere mantenendo una cicatrice a forma di saetta sulla fronte  Hagrid spiego che il ragazzino era invitato a frequentare la famosa Hogwarts  la scuola di magia piu importante  Harry accetta piu che volentieri e da qui per lui iniziera un altra vita  Credo che Harry Potter abbia ogni requisito per rientrare nella top ten books  molto probabilmente al primo posto  Prima cosa  riesce a trasportarti in un altro mondo da cui non vorresti mai uscire  Secondo   l ultimo aggettivo per descriverlo sarebbe noioso   e ricco di colpi di scena ed azione  Terzo  lo stile dell autrice e spettacolare  Ogni personaggio e profondo e singolare Quanto mi piacerebbe essere Hermione    Silente  il professore della scuola che mi ha ricordato un po  Gandalf  mi ha veramente affascinato  Credo che nel resto della saga la sua figura sia ancora piu presente  me lo auguro  Leggero gli altri presto  Ma mi voglio impegnare leggendone piu e meno uno al mese per far si che posa apprezzare al meglio ognuno      When I was a kid  my grandma sent me the first Harry Potter book  I made it through book 4 before we transitioned to a different church than the one we had been attending  this one was super conservative and condemned all sorts of things    magic  fantasy  Halloween    and that was the end of my foray into Harry Potter s world  Now  several years later  I am re visiting Harry  and it s so exciting  it s so fun to read what I loved when I was a kid  I m looking forward to re reading and also to catching up on the books and movies that I missed I could not put The Sorcerer s Stone down  It s wonderful  it s gripping  it s funny and heartfelt  I can clearly see why so many people think J K  Rowling is a genius  I m a librarian now  and I see why so many people of so many ages are attracted to her characters  I love how her books appeal to all different kinds of people  I love being moved by her writing  It s going to be a wonderful rest of the year as I read this compelling series  I honestly don t remember how many times I ve read this  Every time I find something new in the books  I find something to think about and to enjoy  This is a really beautiful story  I cannot help myself  When I was a kid I only appreciated the storyline    but now I see more important things such as family  having friends and just being happy and satisfied with yourself  I just cannot give Harry Potter less than 5 stars for his sentimental value    So once again   I LOVED IT  FINISHED  I loved it as usual  although reading the book aloud was a different experience for me  in a good way  Little Sis told me it was her favourite book ever and burst into tears when I said I wouldn t start reading the second book tonight  Any guilt went out the window when she sat on my head and refused to move until I d promised to read her a chapter of book 2 before bed  HAVE I CREATED A MUNCHKIN SIZED FANGIRL FANKID FANBABY OR WHAT           Don t answer that  My first excursion in the Harry Potter universe was what you would call a life changing event  I think I was about eight years old when I first got this as a gift from a friend of mine for my birthday  Since at the time I was more in love with being outside and playing hide and seek with my neighbors than sitting inside all day snuggled up with a good book  it took me about six months to finally crack this open and start reading it  and my God what a surprise I was in for I couldn t put the book down  I actually stayed up all night reading it  and then my mom caught me and I was grounded for a week but I didn t even care  I just sat there reading this wonderful masterpiece and loved it  It was the start of my career as a Harry Potter die hard fan  and I have to say  I still remember the butterflies in my stomach every time I turned a page and delved deeper into that wonderful universe of magic and danger  NEVER HAVE I EVER thought that I d read Harry potter  Let alone like it  Let alone LOVE it It s just the way I picture their world is too close to accurate   the details help me imagine them so clearly it hurts  I never dragged on the details like I used to do in other books because it s just way too interesting     Shame on non potterhead Rasha for not reading it sooner    But hopefully I can make up for my mistakes  I thank Razan     3  There s barely a point in reviewing this book as I ve loved it dearly with all my heart ever since I was five and my mum would read it to me every night before bedtime It was rather better to reread The Philosopher s Stone at the age I am now  though  as moments like when Harry sat all night on a cold hard floor in front of the mirror of Erised just so he could be with the mere reflection of his dead parents struck me emotionally way more now than when I was an anxious infant eager to hear about the part where stuff got blown up with magic  Plus  I get all the jokes and references now Fifteen years after it first being published   and thirteen after it was first introduced to me   Harry Potter is still Harry Potter  Hogwarts is still Hogwarts  and the magic that first fascinated me more than a decade ago is forever enduring  and will hopefully never fade from grasp And thank Merlin for that  FIVE  5  stars of course    I never thought I refused to read this back in high school  _  AND to even think I chose Nancy Drew s Books over this  OH  how I wish I could go back in time Oh by the way  prior to the movie adaption of this film  I would like to give a small statement  Before you start reading the Harry Potter series  PLEASE  Separate the film from the book and you will be impressed  Totally  I remember watching the film but as a huge fan of the book  I must be very unrealistic  I knew there have been a lot of information left out in the film adaption  There were few parts of the book that I wish have been included in the film because it could have made the story richer  but I won t go into detail so I don t give away any of the film s changes and this is a book review  as I remember   pWell  my journey doesn t end here  I will pursue to read the rest of the Potter Series  3 Releer este clasico  mio  en esta hermosa edicion ilustrada fue una experiencia muy especial  Hacia muchos anos que no releia el primer libro de HP  y fue como si redescubriera el universo creado por Rowling y volviera a ver todo por primera vez  Las ilustraciones son muy bellas y complementan la lectura a la perfeccion  La traduccion es lo unico que no termina de encantarme  hay varias detalles que cambiaron que no fluyen o que no cuadran con el original  como poner  buhos  en vez de  lechuzas   Aun asi  ame esta edicion    I love everything about this series and the first book in particular  The characters and the whole setting are so unique and loveable and I think everybody catches himself imagining  this world truly exists   I certainly do  The plot is interesting and exiting no matter if you are eleven years old or twenty eight or whatever  And I cannot help but admire the multitude of details  Those little things help constructing a rich and vivid world  make the reader laugh and create an amazing arc through the whole series of book  I enjoy this book every single time   so no doubt it deserves five stars  My first reread of Harry Potter  I only read them last year  and I m so happy I chose the Illustrated Edition  I absolutely adored the illustrations by Jim Kay and am extremely excited to see the rest of the series  It s very strange seeing someone elses vision of a world you have imagined yourself   It s also very strange reading something you already know the ending to   makes you see people differently    Technically a reread as I read this about 15 years ago  I was really thinking I would not love this and would not get the hype because I was not obsessed when I first read this  But  I think reading this as an adult makes me finally get it  Also knowing how things play out  because of the movies  definitely adds a whole new meaning to everything  It was beautiful  The emotions  All the foreshadowing  I definitely freaking cried because I am an emotional monster  This book was so great  I should ve read this book years ago  but better late than never  view spoiler  I m a slytherin  but man oh man was I happy for the Gryffindor gang for winning the House Cup  Then  I felt guilty for betraying my house  Oh well  I suppose I m not technically in their year  and us slytherins need a good beating every once in awhile haha     hide spoiler   4 99999999 StarsAudiobookNarration   Jim Dale   Kick Ass  I love these darn Harry Potter books  Read them all  then bought the CD s because audible doesn t carry them and am now Putting all the CD s into iTunes so I can listen to them again  The ONLY reason I won t say they are complete 5 star reads is because of the MASSIVE Scooby Doo endings that they have  It s all in how the secrets are revealed in such an obvious and simplistic manner  Basically every bad thing that they were trying to figure out regurgitated from the bad guy in the last scene  I m not explaining it very well  but some authors manage to reveal the mystery without making the reader feel like a tool who needs it spoon fed to them  Does that make sense  Anyway    Other than that   I love these books  Highly recommend them to kids and adults alike   I still don t know what took me this long to finally start reading the HP series  I loved this one SO much  And even though I already knew the story and knew what was gonna happen  it kept me constantly at the edge of my seat Can t hardly wait to move on to the next one in the series and to become a part of this fandom that marked an entire generation   This book needs no introduction  I m pretty sure everyone knows of it  so I won t insult you all by telling you what it s about   I was quite surprised when I received my copy of the illustrated edition through the post  I haven t expected it to be so big or so beautiful  I actually do like the size  it makes it all that more special  but I do wonder just how big will the later books in the series be  especially Order of the Phoenix  The artwork is just stunning  Jim Kay is ridiculously talented  Every page has something on it even if there are no illustrations  It gives the book a look of old parchment  I have many favourite illustrations and especially love Jim Kay s depiction of Hogwarts on the inside covers   I can t wait to get my hands on the rest of the series  Just reread this fabulous book and I can still see why I read them in the first place Harry Potter was really the first  super natural  book that was published for young kids  Thats before Vampire Diaries  Twilight and all the rest  Its so refreshing also to read about something other than vampires  and picking up a book you love is a sure way of getting you out of a reading slump Harry  as most would know  is a young boy living with his aunt and uncle  Their not exactly loving and they dont want anyone finding out that they have a secret  a secret about Harry who lives under the stairs When Harry finds out he s a wizard  his whole life changes and he becomes known as the boy who lived  the boy who destroyed Lord Voldemort  Or did he  I can t believe I wasted so many years not reading the Harry Potter books  I just thought I wouldn t like it coz I m not really into fantasy and all those stuffs  But I m surprised I really really really enjoyed it  I adored everything about the book  Mini Review When I was young  like three four years old  I saw  and admittedly grew up with  the first two Harry Potter movies  I knew that someday I had to at least read these books one of these days  and I finally did that  And I loved it I feel like I don t need to say this  but the world of Harry Potter is so magical  no pun intended  and I want to live in Hogwarts  and I feel like I can now finally say that because I ve read at least one of the books If you have not read this book  you need to ASAP because it is a classic  and a children s classic that will forever have a legacy in the world of literature for many generations to come    Post reading  I FINALLY DID IT  I READ A HARRY POTTER BOOK  I WAS EPIC    HARRY POTTER FOREVER     D Dobby has a sock  Dobby is a FREE elf   MY FAVVVOOOUUURRRIIIITTEEE BOOK IN THE WHOLE  ENTIRE  WORLD  EVVVERRR                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    If you don t like it  I will personally throw a bludger at your head and have you writhing in pain on the floor while I point a pen at you saying  SECTUMSEMPRA    and you will be made to read it   SO READ HARRY POTTER YOU FILTHY MUGGLE  D  just kidding but it is a really epic book  I read this book so long ago  but who cares  Do opinions even expire  Hell no they don t         I LOVED Harry Potter when I first read it and I ve grown to love it even more  It s magical perfection  Amazing  This just gets better every time I read it  I have seen the movie so many times and I was actually surprised at how often I was finding small details that were altered for the movie or left out altogether   This book is just too good to even put into words I absolutely love this world  Its so nice to break away from dystopian  dark dreaded worlds which leave me feeling sour  into this gorgeous world of witchcraft and wizardry  I was so totally immersed in every page because of J K Rowling s amazing writing  It is her writing that makes this whole book what it is  She is able to concisely describe situations and events  the story is character driven  and her world building is so beyond anyone or anything else  I can t say anything else  but this book is amazing  You don t realise how many boring books you are reading until you read one that just stands so far beyond the rest   What do you mean  it s excessive to sit and read this all in one sitting  I haven t read it in years and it s just as fun as I remember  Oh  Harry  I missed you  Read Listened for FunOverall Rating  5 00Story Rating  5 00Character Rating  5 00These are total every year rereads for me  The story just never gets old Versions I own  Hardcover US UK

read it  Now I am on to book 2    Better late than never right  I FINALLY READ HARRY POTTER Can I just say I am so impressed with how well this book is written  But I even more impressed with how magnificently J K Rowling described  imagined and built such a detailed and fantastical world  I can see why this series of books captured a generation I knew even before I read this book that I would love Hermione Granger  I think Ms Rowling was so clever in her characterisation of Hermione because so many girls that age try to be a goody too shoes and are teased by boys  not many would have disregarded the rules easily  So I praise her for writing believable characters  I JUST LOVE IT ALL  Re read HarryXmasToYou 2014God I missed Hogwarts  I wish I reread the series more often  but alas I m stupid  anyway first time around in english though  loved it  still kind of traumatized even though I knew this for ages  since the movie of the order of the phoenix  by the whole fact that they translated also the last names of the characters  I always wanted to compare the original names to the translated ones re read  HarryXmasToYou 2015I thought I would feel guilty towards all the books I still haven t read yet  but who am I kidding    there s always time for Harry potterI highly recommend the audiobooks narrated by Stephen Fry    I LOVE this book  Have read it a number of times and watched the video innumerable times  Rowling has a fantastic imagination and ability for  world  setting  After I finished the book  I couldn t help looking around at all the Muggles         Audiobook   5 starsNarrator  Stephen Fry20 Sep 2012 to 25 Sep 2012Beautifully narrated   the story captivated me again for the nth time  I loved Fry s characterizations which tied in seamlessly with the movies and my own internal dialogues  There is so much humour littered throughout that it takes a number of reads listens to fully appreciate the care and construction of this storyline  This book is the start of everything for me  This is the book that got me back to reading again and made me the bookaholic I am today  Which is why Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone has a much more special in my heart more than the other books  The relations and the friendship between the cahracters is amazing  The meeting of Ron and Harry is just so random  this reminds me the randomness of the first meeting of me and my close friends which gives bonus points to this book   In a magical world we have this randomness which is one of the elements why we all fell in love with Harry Potter books  It was the most brilliant journey for me  Excellent read  fast and easy  Will see how the story develops from there     I fell in love with this book so now I need to read the other ones  it was as awesome as everyone says    and maybe even more  Omlasning  Alskar fortfarande serien   3 I recently got audible and I have decided to listen to the Harry Potter series as I drive to and from work and to school  I am so glad I have made this decision  I am falling in love with the series all over again  The narrator does such a good job and even adds to the story  I can t wait to continue on the next book  The last time I had read these I was in middle school and I am now in my last year of college  I still love them just as much or maybe even more as I did the first time I read them   Magical  3  Note  I don t remember the exact date I finished this book  but it was about mid January  2016   Note  02  This is my re read of the book  I have read this book so many times  and I plan to read it many times in the future  For the Christmas of 2015  I eagerly unwrapped the gift addressed  To Emma  under the Christmas tree  I had some hopes what it might be  but this  This by far surpassed all of them  I spent the entire morning  afternoon  and even evening flipping through the Illustrated Edition of  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone   looking at the stunning paintings within  I brought it around the house with me wherever I wenta  because I didn t want to let it out of my sight  in case it got ruined by my dog or some brothersb  I couldn t put it down  it was too pretty It gets a special place on my shelf  only partially because I ran out of room  where it is displayed for all the world to see  On New Year s Eve  my little brother came into my room a couple hours before midnight and we spent our last hours of 2015  and our first hours of 2016  looking at these pictures  and reading the first chapters of the book  My little brother  who didn t much care for Harry Potter when he first read them  says he will reread the series  because he liked the illustrations so much  The Illustrated Edition is perfect for people like him who may get distracted from the pages unless they have a illustration to look forward to every page Also  it was perfect for me  who did read  and LOVE  Harry Potter upon first reading it  It just makes the experience so cool and unique  It was just as fun this time around as it was when I first read it  and thanks to Illustrator Jim Kay  and amazing JK Rowling  I now have a New Year s memory with my brother that I will treasure forever Another good memory of Harry Potter whilst reading this book is that one of my brothers wasn t allowed to sleep one night  he had a doctor appointment the next day  and some of the tests required him to be awake for  24 hours beforehand  I think  Something like that   so my dad  my brothers  and I all had a sleepover on the living room floor  We all laid in front of our TV with pillows and blankets and things  My brother brought down his Skittles to share  we popped some popcorn  and watched Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone I know this has been a bit of a personal review  and not exactly my opinions on the book  but if I hadn t made it clear already  I love this book  I love Harry Potter  I love the new illustrations  I loved everything  My favorite characters are Harry Potter and Hagrid  I like Hermione and Ron and Neville a lot as well  I liked reading about Quidditch  it was one of my favorite parts because the imagery that was put perfectly into words was just awesome As always  I love the Sorting Hat Ceremony  It makes me sad we don t get to see the Sorting Hat Ceremony in all of the books  since the rhymes are all so clever and the song is very fun to hum under my breath as I read the words   For those who can t tell from my current Goodreads Icon  I am a Hufflepuff and very proud of it  Pottermore sorted me into Ravenclaw  but what does it know  lol  I am a Hufflepuff  loyal  dedicated  hard working  fair  Hufflepuff and I have been ever since I read the later books  Reading Harry Potter is a magical experience and by the end it will making you awestruck at how far these characters have come  yet how true their friendship is  It always makes me sad that unfortunately my mother passed away before the seventh book came out so she never got to read the ending  but it makes me think of her when I read Harry Potter because she loved these stories  And I love them too I would highly recommend you read this series  because it is one of the most magical adventures you ll ever embark on I promise  you won t regret a thing    Rating  5 FANTASTIC STARS DON T ARGUE OR I LL IMPERIO U I first read Harry Potter at the ripe old age of 5  My mother got this book for my older brother back when it was a no name on the shelf of an independent bookstore  When my mother asked for children s fiction recommendations  the worker smiled and shoved it into my mom s hands  saying ferociously   Your son HAS to read this  Trust me  And my mother did  My brother ended up acquiring all of the Harry Potter books  and I d read them whenever I could  This world of magic  mayhem  and beauty    nothing can compare I ve reread Sorcerer s Stone  and the entire series itself  many times over the years  I ve listened to it on audiobooks  listened to chapter by chapter podcast discussions  read it online and on paper  and talked about it whenever I could find someone who was interested enough  And now  at the ancient age of 21  I am still in love  I reread Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone for the hundredth time this week  purely out of nostalgia and adoration for the world that I once never wanted to leave I still don t want to leave  I can see absolutely no flaws whatsoever in this book  It s perfect  in every way  Every word  every line  invokes the best magic of all  hope  happiness  and the power of love Some might say that this novel  Rowling s earliest  is simplistic or too childish  Nope  I disagree  J K  Rowling had a natural progression throughout her series  and I appreciate every single one of her novels as well as the unique writing style that each brings to this epic tale Rereading this book brought a huge grin to my face and a spring to my step  Never underestimate the magic of Harry Potter Mine too  Harry  Mine too  So  I finally did it  I finally read Harry Potter   Or  at least  the first book   As much as I like the movies  one would think I d jump right at the books  but I have this problem where if I ve seem the movie before reading the book  I have a hard time reading the book  It s partly because some of the surprise aspect is gone and I know what happens  Also  the movie visuals are in my head  so it takes some of the experience out of reading the story  I can already see it All that aside  I knew I would still get to reading Rowling s genius text eventually and I m soon glad I did  No  I couldn t help mentally pointing out the differences from the movie  or  I guess  the movie s differences from the book  and I couldn t help picturing the shots and angles I knew by heart from the silver screen  but this book was still GOLDEN  Like a snitch  It went fast like one as well  I wasn t sure what to expect from Rowling s writing  but it turned out being more simple than I expected  Not it a bad way  it takes all the more talent to explain things with less words  The plot always held me  The characters  THE RELATIONSHIPS  THE WORLD  GAH  I know I m only echoing praises that have already been said many times over  I ll just go ahead and close by saying a few more comments  I delighted in every part that wasn t in the movie  and latched onto them like they were new treasures   I adore Rowling s wit  some of the brilliant dialogue made me positively giddy  And  while I do wish I could ve experienced it before knowing what I knew  I enjoyed every word  As a child  my parents didn t want me to watch the Harry Potter films  they thought they were too scary for a kid my age  Because of this  I was turned off to the books and never gave them a chance   But nine days ago  my Mother shows me  the Sorcerer s Stone  and tells me that my brother tried reading it in high school but never got into it    I grabbed that book like I was a meat craving  starving hyena in some African plain  and I devoured the book  I took my time reading it which allowed me to savor every single page  It kept me on my toes  pulled at my heart strings  made me smile  panic  everything    It s incredible   Prior to reading  I had been somewhat familiar with the film s cast from seeing clips of the movies and tons of blog posts about the series   This made it even better I don t believe I was late in reading this  I believe it has been perfect timing   This series is yet another that I will read to my future children   10 out of 5 stars    I cannot wait to read the next book    It was so interesting re discover this world    Yo me preguntaba  que le ve todo el mundo a Harry potter  y pensaba que no era para tanto    pero al fin pude comprender lo que ven en estos libros  la facilidad con la que se leen y la escritura tan sencilla pero fantastica que nos da Rowling es increible y no hay manera de premiar mas este libro que con 5 estrellas Por lograr atraparme tanto y meterme en el personaje de una manera increiblemente maravillosa 215 paginas que fueron un vuelco de aventuras y molestias Harry tengo ganas de apapucharte mucho SUS tios  por el Angel esos tios molestos y asquerosos no pueden ser mas que escorias para la vida Hagrid estaba que lo abrazaba de amor tambien  la manera en la que cuidaba a harry desde el primer dia en que lo trajo y lo dejo en la casa de sus tios  que de una manera u otra siempre lo protegia eso fue maravilloso y conmovedor Ron    esa tremendura pelirroja  me hizo reir en muchos momentos y juro por Dios que me recordo a mis mejores amigos en diferentes circustancias Hermonie toda una cerebrito  amotinada por sacar buenas notas la mente de todo grupo     Sus encuentros con Ron me mataban de risa  no se soportaban Por otro lado Albus Dumbledore  No es bueno dejarse arrastrar por lo sue os y olvidarse de vivir   por Dios que hombre  me encanta Ahora hablemos del final      ES ENSERIO    me voltearon la tarta en pleno final sorprendiendome en cuanto a tartamudo y a snape casi tiraba el libro a un lado por hacerme eso  y juro por Dios que casi me da la yeyera cuando salio quien tu sabes Libro para dejar volar la imaginacion y dejar el mundo real apartado  Harry potter leyenda de leyenda Sigo sin entender porque tarde tanto en leer el libro  Oh  how I love this book   This edition is so beautiful  I wish I could eat it  Con esta reelectura  he vuelto a disfrutar de este fantastico libro y esta vez acompanado con bellas ilustraciones  Definitivamente  uno de mis libros favoritos de todos los tiempos   Okay  so I have been talking about re reading the Harry Potter series for like   a year  I was going to do it in February  then it got pushed back to the summer  then fall  and here it is December   and I finally started  Do I expected to read the whole series this month  No  Definitely no  I have reviews to write  holiday crap to do  etc  But I will read as many as possible  and continue into the new year  Because you know what would start a new year off right  HARRY  FREAKING  POTTER  I love Harry Potter  I was hooked from the second I convinced my Mom to buy me the first book in the store because I had heard so much about it  I love it so much I have Harry s glasses and lightning bolt scar TATTOOED ON ME  Because Harry Potter is not just a book series   it s a lifestyle  Or something  I actually own four copies of the first book   my hardback original  the paperback that came in the recently released box set  the illustrated edition  and this one   the British version  I bought this at a used book sale eons ago  and never even opened it  Until last night  when I decided that if I was going to re read this series that changed my life   I would read the British version that I had been hoarding  There really aren t words for this series  It s just   important  The writing is magical  the world is magical  and the characters can do magic  sure  but they are more than that   they are cool  and deep  and amazing  Five stars  Fifty million stars  All the stars in the night sky  After reading Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them I just had to dive back into this amazing world created by J K  Rowling  With Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone she initiated this beautiful journey so many of us loved to travel and after 8 years I m excited to start again  This is my 5th or 6th time rereading the Philosopher s Stone  but my first time reading it in English  Harry s magic   and I m not talking about the one they teach at Hogwarts   is always there  Truly the best story I ve ever read  mulla on kuumetta enka jaksa lukea mitaan jarkevaa  joten paadyin sitten lukemaan pottereita miljoonatta kertaa  Ingen tvil om at denne illustrerte utgaven av The Philosopher s Stone er den fineste boka i bokhylla mi  Fantastiske illustrasjoner  Please excuse any spelling errors and or typos  Review done from my not so smart smartphone  What can I say that hasn t already been said before  I loved it  Every single thing about it  I watched all the movies before I read any of the books and I was worried it would take away from the book  stupid  I know   It didn t  I love this world  If I could escape into any world it would be this one  Any amazing story in an amazing world with an amazing boy named Harry Potter   I now see what all the hype is over this series  I have seen the movie but it just can t compare to the book  The book was so much more interesting  descriptive  and easier to follow than the movie  I remember watching the movie and at times getting lost or losing interest   that did not happen once while reading the book  Such a highly imaginative start to a series and I can t wait to read the rest of this series  I highly recommend it to anyone who has not read it  Fabulous    The word  magical doesn t quite do it justice  Terminar el ano leyendo esta preciosura de libro es algo maravilloso Yo  como tantos otros  creci de la mano de Harry  He disfrutado esta lectura como si fuera la primera vez  perdiendome tanto en sus ilustraciones como en sus palabras ya que es la primera vez que lo leo en ingles  y queriendo mas que nunca volver a ser esa nina que esperaba impaciente su carta a Hogwarts Como siempre me quedo con ganas de mas asi que en 2016 habra relectura de la saga al completo   Actual rating  4 5  Getting to ready to read this with my daughter  I m excited to re experience Harry Potter through her eyes Edit  We finished it last night and my daughter loved it  She was thrilled with every difference from the movie  which I wouldn t have shown her  but someone else did  and said that it was so much better than the movies  She laughed  she was spellbound  she begged for more most nights  and when it was over she cheered with joy  Hooray for Harry Potter  I m embarrassed by how long I refused to read Harry Potter  assuming it was strictly for children and childish adults  Is there a way to repent for my sins  No  I haven t gotten round framed glasses  but I do defend Rowling whenever I can  even when she made a bad publicity move by suing vander Ark for wanting to publish a lexicon of her work  Can I be forgiven now for my past snobbery and closed mindedness or must I remain in Potter purgatory   How could I say no to the most life changing series in the world   This must be my 4th or 5th time reading this book and I still get excited about every single detail  After all the hype that I heard when I was growing up  I was excited to read Harry Potter but also sceptical  I d heard a little bit about the story and seen snippets of the films and they didn t really entice me  Therefore I was pleasantly surprised by how awesome it was to read  it s simple and fast passed whilst really intriguing and interesting  I can t wait to read more  Also  Dumbledore is just brilliant  Why is he such a drag in the first movie   Do I really need to write a review for this  It s Harry freaking Potter  It s been years since I ve read the series  I admit  I ve been lazy and have been watching the movies for my HP fix  One day while I was looking at my bookshelf for something to read  I spotted my old  yellowed copy of the Sorcerer s Stone and thought   Hell  why not   It s still the fun  wonderful  magical  hur hur  story that I remember from my childhood  Excellent read  fast and easy  Will see how the story develops from there     I fell in love with this book so now I need to read the other ones  it was as awesome as everyone says    and maybe even more  Omlasning  Alskar

million stars  All the stars in the night sky  After reading Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them I just had to dive back into this amazing world created by J K  Rowling  With Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone she initiated this beautiful journey so many of us loved to travel and after 8 years I m excited to start again  This is my 5th or 6th time rereading the Philosopher s Stone  but my first time reading it in English  Harry s magic   and I m not talking about the one they teach at Hogwarts   is always there  Truly the best story I ve ever read  mulla on kuumetta enka jaksa lukea mitaan jarkevaa  joten paadyin sitten lukemaan pottereita miljoonatta kertaa  Ingen tvil om at denne illustrerte utgaven av The Philosopher s Stone er den fineste boka i bokhylla mi  Fantastiske illustrasjoner  Please excuse any spelling errors and or typos  Review done from my not so smart smartphone  What can I say that hasn t already been said before  I loved it  Every single thing about it  I watched all the movies before I read any of the books and I was worried it would take away from the book  stupid  I know   It didn t  I love this world  If I could escape into any world it would be this one  Any amazing story in an amazing world with an amazing boy named Harry Potter   I now see what all the hype is over this series  I have seen the movie but it just can t compare to the book  The book was so much more interesting  descriptive  and easier to follow than the movie  I remember watching the movie and at times getting lost or losing interest   that did not happen once while reading the book  Such a highly imaginative start to a series and I can t wait to read the rest of this series  I highly recommend it to anyone who has not read it  Fabulous    The word  magical doesn t quite do it justice  Terminar el ano leyendo esta preciosura de libro es algo maravilloso Yo  como tantos otros  creci de la mano de Harry  He disfrutado esta lectura como si fuera la primera vez  perdiendome tanto en sus ilustraciones como en sus palabras ya que es la primera vez que lo leo en ingles  y queriendo mas que nunca volver a ser esa nina que esperaba impaciente su carta a Hogwarts Como siempre me quedo con ganas de mas asi que en 2016 habra relectura de la saga al completo   Actual rating  4 5  Getting to ready to read this with my daughter  I m excited to re experience Harry Potter through her eyes Edit  We finished it last night and my daughter loved it  She was thrilled with every difference from the movie  which I wouldn t have shown her  but someone else did  and said that it was so much better than the movies  She laughed  she was spellbound  she begged for more most nights  and when it was over she cheered with joy  Hooray for Harry Potter  I m embarrassed by how long I refused to read Harry Potter  assuming it was strictly for children and childish adults  Is there a way to repent for my sins  No  I haven t gotten round framed glasses  but I do defend Rowling whenever I can  even when she made a bad publicity move by suing vander Ark for wanting to publish a lexicon of her work  Can I be forgiven now for my past snobbery and closed mindedness or must I remain in Potter purgatory   How could I say no to the most life changing series in the world   This must be my 4th or 5th time reading this book and I still get excited about every single detail  After all the hype that I heard when I was growing up  I was excited to read Harry Potter but also sceptical  I d heard a little bit about the story and seen snippets of the films and they didn t really entice me  Therefore I was pleasantly surprised by how awesome it was to read  it s simple and fast passed whilst really intriguing and interesting  I can t wait to read more  Also  Dumbledore is just brilliant  Why is he such a drag in the first movie   Do I really need to write a review for this  It s Harry freaking Potter  It s been years since I ve read the series  I admit  I ve been lazy and have been watching the movies for my HP fix  One day while I was looking at my bookshelf for something to read  I spotted my old  yellowed copy of the Sorcerer s Stone and thought   Hell  why not   It s still the fun  wonderful  magical  hur hur  story that I remember from my childhood  I was worried I wouldn t be able to really get into it because I ve already seen all the movies   but it was still a very engaging read  I wanted to come back to it each time I put it down even though I knew what was coming  I m probably the last person to read these  but I m excited to make it through the series  My eight year old little guy and I read this together for his evening reading time  We are new  and rather late  to the Harry Potter scene  but we were immediately sucked in from the very first page To quote Ethan the book was both  FREAKY   and  AWESOME   We are pressing on to the next book and can t wait   Having reread this  I m wondering why Harry didn t end up becoming some kind of sociopath after having grown up with those darn Dursleys  And it still gets five stars  It s just as magical to me now as it was when I first read it 14 years ago   Holy jeepers  has it really been that long    Why  yes it has    0 This is my second read of the book  this time on Audiobook narrated by Jim Dale  The first time I read the book was prior to my joining Goodreads  so pre 2009  I gave the first read 4 stars I really enjoyed the second read of this story  Jim Dale was amazing as the narrator of the audiobook   Fantastic It s been a long time since I read the books so it s almost like reading them again for the first time besides the fact that I know what s going to happen  Small details were forgotten but know I remember them again and I realised why I fell in love with the series the first time around  Blogreview  http   hedisbookworld blogspot nl 201   I ve always been a big fan of the Harry Potter series and im so happy to be back into the wizarding world  Harry is so sassy in the book and i love it  Can t wait to read the next book   This book was released years before I was born and I only now got around to read it and all I can say is  THIS IS ONE OF THE GREATEST BOOKS I VE EVER READ  I know everyone knew this before me  but I m just so overwhelmed at how much I love this book  I can t wait to read the next ones  THIS BOOK WAS AWESOME  MIND BLOWING  ONE OF THE FUNNIEST BOOKS EVER  WITH AN AMAZING STORY  WITH GREAT CHARACTERS  AND AN INTRIGANT MISTERY TO SOLVE  I M IN LOVE WITH THIS STORY AND I CAN T WAIT TO READ THE REST OF THIS SERIES  I finished this last week  but just noticed that it was still on my currently reading shelf  Obviously I loved it  I mean  it s Harry Potter  The illustrations were lovely  I can t be bothered to write a review right now  I ll probably do a more in depth review later this week   All I have to say is  I LOVED IT  Harry Potter is by FAR my favorite series of all time  and it all starts with this book  In my opinion  JK Rowling is brilliant  and I applaud her for the creation so many are in love with  including me  And it all starts in this book   D My dad read me this book idk when I was 3 because I went to the movie when I was 4 and had a Harry potter birthday party when I turned 4  I have been to all the movies in theatres and read the books so many times    Defiantly my childhood   After all this time Always     Harry felt a great leap of excitement  He didn t know what he was going to    but it had to be better than what he was leaving behind   Podria leer este libro mil veces  Jamas va a cansarme  Siempre es bueno volver a casa  I oh so wish I had pushed through when I was younger  I would have loved this     Re reading this with the illustrations was a whole new reading experience  So much nostalgia  I feel bad about not being able to read this when I was a kid  but growing up with the movies was a vivid memory from my childhood  I am glad I m now able to get around these books because it s more magical than I remembered it was   This was such a magical experience to re read a childhood favourite  especially in this edition  I adored all the illustrations thoughout the book and I m super excited for the next one to come out to continue re reading this amazing series   What I am gonna say doesn t matter at all  The world has seen enough reviews and acclamations  As amazing as ever  Does this even need a review   _  Ik verschiet er best van hoeveel meer info je krijgt over de Steen der Wijzen  in het boek  In de film wordt dit niet verteld   Of ben ik dat stuk vergeten in de film dan   Hohja  het boek is zalig   482 punten voor J K  Rowling    Obviously I don t need to talk about the books here  they are absolute classics  However what I will say is that the illustrations are incredible  What I love and appreciate most about the art work is that it is clear the artist has been inspired from the books and what is written rather than just copying the images from the film  This really brings to life the characters and story in a way we haven t experienced The whole book has been put together in a really pleasing way  Each page is different and has its own art work or detail and the regular images are placed in ways which don t disrupt the story but allow you to digest the story  the images and work even more This is a whole new experience for the Harry Potter world and has made me fall in love with it all over again and I could not recommend the book more highly to anyone   Oh  hello  childhood Fancy seeing you here  I d write a proper review  but I ll just settle on  view spoiler  THIS SERIES IS MY CHILDHOOD  MY TEENAGE YEARS  AND MY FUTURE   hide spoiler  UPDATE  SO  maybe I should recount to you the story of how I first read Harry Potter and The Sorcerer s Stone  What s that  You don t particularly care  Yeah  well  I don t care  Ahem  So  I was seven years old  in first grade  I liked books  A lot  I also LOVED witches and magic  A lot  I would wave my little plastic wand with a star on the tip  I would dress up as a witch EVERY Halloween  not out of laziness  Would a lazy person get a new witch costume every year    and I would pretend to brew potions by putting water in bowls and putting in salt and pepper and other various spices in my mother s kitchen cabinet  One day  friends of my family let my dad borrow a little book to read to us  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone  So  my first HP memory is of my dad  reading it aloud to me  mispronouncing Hermione and Slytherin  as I eagerly listened  I already shipped Ron and Hermione  even though I didn t know what shipping was  I longed for friends like Harry  Ron  and Hermione  connecting to each of them like I never had before to any other characters  Whenever I re read the books  I still hear my dad s voice in my head  reading them to his little awestruck daughter  already entranced in the magical world of Harry Potter   view spoiler  Well  that was flowery and pretentious and boring   hide spoiler   Como e que e possivel eu nunca ter lido isto em 17 anos  Mas antes tarde do que nunca  Super fluido e agradavel  este livro de introducao a saga que me aguarda animou me imenso  Estou bastante ansiosa pra dar continuacao a esta viagem  omg foi lindo  deu para perceber tanta coisa que nao esta explicita no filme  simplesmente amei One of the best books I ve ever read    P And plus  it s literally my favorite book  I should have read it earlier  Now  I m waiting for The Chamber of Secrets to be returned to the library  Getting very excited   OH MY GOD THAT WAS FUCKING AWESOME  Re read number I ve lost count    Excellent way to kick off a series  so many unforgettable lines and a tale that movies will never  ever do quite enough justice in portraying  Some things are best left to one s own imagination  Y lo termine  Me encanto el libro  no fue muy sorpresivo que digamos  ya que vi la pelicula y hasta escuche un audiolibro una vez  pero leer el libro siempre es lo mejor  y hace mucho tiempo que tenia ganas de leer esta saga  I loved it  I absolutely loved it  This world is so interesting and I just want to move there  I want to live in this world  So brilliant  And of course  I love all the characters  They are absolutely amazing  So  so fantastic  I ve never read any of the Harry Potter books  nor watched the movies  This beautifully illustrated book was my first full initiation into this series  and it was absolutely wonderful  I fully understand the hype  This book was an extreme challenge for me  It was challenging because of the length and the deadline I had to complete it in  There are a few other books in the series  and I will continue to read them over the summer I would give this book 5 stars  because I love how much detail they put into describing Hogwarts and the events that took place there  I felt as though there were many words on each page  although the detail was outstanding  The best example is when they are giving out the house cup  J K  Rowlings  describes the colors of the banisters and how they transform according to the house colors  I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a longer book and loves to read fiction books       What can I say about these books that millions has said already The Harry Potter books are simply epic in my eyes  A great  great passion for any age It will forever be apart of my soul   honestly just as magical as when i delved into this story for the first time all those years ago  i felt like a little kid again when i was reading it  i just adore this series so much   Sice o deset let pozdejs nez vetsina    Ale co uz  Kazdopadne pujdu obehnout pribuzny a dam dohromady zbytek a pak budu cist a cist  Pochopitelne ale az po ty cetbe k matruite     D This book remains a 5 5 stars for me and probably always will  Needed a pick me up after a few bad books  and of course it was only natural to turn to Harry Potter  Time for another trip to Hogwarts  Reading this series will never get old  Reread  22 6 2015 It was so great to reread this  I can t believe how many little things I forgot since I read this series as a child  Can t wait to reread the next one   Just as good as the first time I read it    Unbeschreiblich  Ein fantastisches und magisches Lesevergnugen  Ich bin richtig verliebt und kann gar nicht aufhoren die wunderschonen Illustrationen anzusehen  This is pure gold  14 years of fangirling and I still can t get enough of this world and every time I discover something new that amazes me  This was only my

believe why I didn t read this book years ago  I am trapped in the Harry Potter fandom now  Can t wait to read the second book   Re reading this book  I was delighted all over again by the whimsy  humour  and humanity of what must be considered required reading for an entire generation  Stephen Fry is fantastic  I love Stephen Fry s narration  He is so amazing  But still I prefer reading Harry

but of the illustrated version was spectacular  Ahora entiendo por que a todo el mundo le gusta esta saga   This was obviously a re read for me  I read it for the first time when I was about 7 or 8 years old and since then I ve re read it a gazilion times  however  this was my first time reading it in English  It was like Christmas in book form  like that sheer happiness that takes us back to our childhood  I was remembered of how much I love this world  how amazing Harry  Ron and Hermione s relationship is  and how jealous I am for not going at Hogwarts  I m looking forward to re read the whole trilogy this year  and see if my opinion of each one remains  It s always a pleasure to come back home to Hogwarts    I absolutely loved it  I wish I read it as a child  Annual Harry Potter re readathon commences  Aug  2014  Reading Harry Potter always makes everything better  This book will forever and always make me smile  J K Rowling are my idol  This book is so perfect  This was actually quite good   very engaging  Rereading these books makes me so nostalgic  OH  MY  GOD  Why didn t I read this before  Moct tak si to precitat znova po prvykrat    Immer wieder so schon wie beim ersten mal   Reread  Every bit as good as it was the 1st time  Genial   muy buen comienzo para la saga I d give it 10 stars if I could   Tranchen aus den Augen wischt  A beautiful read as always

mladsi to muze byt prvni seznameni s magickym svetem  ktery vymyslela J  K  Rowlingova  Nejprve jejich zrak pritahnou pusobive obrazky a pote se nechaji pohltit pribehem stejne jako tolik ctenaru pred nimi Celou recenzi si muzete precist zde  http   www suzannesworldofbooks cz cl    What a wonderful journey    I know this is weird but this is my first read in to Harry Potter world   DON T JUDGE ME I HAVE MY REASONS     I ve already watched all the potter movies and adored them but couldn t find the courage to read the books anyway  I ve watched one of the book tubers talking about marathoning Potter in December and said Hey this is great chance to read them I read the book in e book format and as well listened to it while I m working    addicted already     Will continue reading the series right away  Fan freaking tastic  Devoured it  Amazing  25th and counting    Ahh I love these books   perfection i just love this Yes  thank God  the hype was justified  I LOVE this book  I am extremely excited to move on to the next in this series  It is a lot of fun  and I sped through it  Whenever I wasn t reading it  I was thinking about it  And when I finished it last night  I couldn t fall asleep afterwards because I was too excited  The first thing I noticed about this book that I loved was the writing  It reads like a charming kids story without sounding condescending and dumbed down to the kids  which makes it great for older people to read as well  And the characters are all lovely  I was most surprised by Harry  He turned out to be stronger than I expected  Growing up  I wasn t allowed to read these books becuase my mom didn t like the witchcraft stuff  So that s why I m finally getting to them at 18  Despite all of the pop culture involving this book and all the spoilers  I still really enjoyed it  There are actually a lot of smaller details that I don t know and am very excited to discover  This is a fantastic book  Hats off to J  K  Rowling   Romanian Review E atat de greu sa descrii o carte pe care o iubesti  Cu atat mai greu  cu cat Harry Potter si Piatra filosofala este cartea care m a impins pe usa pe care scria  Bookaholic in devenire  tratament innexistent  Sunt mai bine de 10 ani de cand am citit prima data acest volum  dar de atunci l am deschis  rasfoit si recitit de peste 20 de ori  Primul exemplar din biblioteca mea  primit in dar de la Teo  prietena mea cea mai buna  pe vremea cand aveam 12 ani  aproape s a dezintegrat  Este plin de banda adeziva  dar il pastrez asa si il pretuiesc  indiferent de starea in care se afla De curand  am reusit sa pun gherutele pe noua  stralucitoarea si cartonata varianta Harry Potter  cea aparuta la editura Arthur  cu sprijinul prietenilor nostri de la libraria online Libris In ciuda miilor de comentarii negative  pe care le am citit pe net despre aceasta editie  am incercat sa o primesc cu inima deschisa  pentru ca povestea nu s a modificat cu nimic  asa cum era si normal  ci avem parte doar de o noua traducere Il cunoastem pe acelasi Harry  in pragul varstei de 11 ani  care locuieste cu unchiul  matusa si varul sau  Asta pana primeste o scrisoare  in care este invitat sa studieze la Hogwarts  Scoala de farmece si vrajitorii  Echipat cu cele necesare pentru noua scoala  Harry se urca in Expresul de Hogwarts  fara sa stie ca de acolo va incepe marea aventura a vietii lui  Cea in care se va descoperi pe sine  isi va face prieteni de nadejde  dar va invata si multe lucuri uimitoare despre lumea magica din care face parte Aceasta noua traducere aduce cateva mici modificari ale termenilor folositi  Fiind unul dintre fanii care a crescut odata cu aceasta serie si care stie pe dinafara citate si replici din ea  am simtit  la inceput  un mic disconfort  De exemplu  denumirea de  Incuiat   folosita de vrajitori atunci cand vorbesc despre o persoana fara puteri magice  a fost schimbata in traducerea cuvantului  Muggle   folosit de autoare in textul original  si a devenit  Mageamiu    Vajhat  a ramas pur si simplu  Quidditch   adica varianta originala a cuvantului  Aleea Diagon este acum Aleea Tor  un joc de cuvinte potrivit  pe care l am apreciat si chiar m a amuzat Pentru  veterani   consider ca aceasta editie merita adaugata la colectia Harry Potter  Noilor veniti nu pot decat sa le o recomand cu caldura  pentru ca este cea mai buna serie pe care am citit o Lectura placuta si sa aveti intotdeauna bagheta la indemana  Pericolul pandeste la fiecare colt  I have such vivid memories of myself reading Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone when I was 8 years old  Honestly I know part of the reason why my love for this series is still so strong is because of how genuinely wonderful my reading experience was for all of these books  Though I m 10000  sure I d love this series regardless of whether I started reading it at 8 or 28   shouts into the abyss  HARRY POTTER ISN T JUST FOR KIDS I immediately fell in love with Sorcerer s Stone  reading it outdoors for hours at a time and soaking it all in  I ended up reading it with my mom when I was halfway through  except I couldn t not continue reading it   so I would read it by myself and then reread the parts with my mom each night more slowly  We read together for a few years  before we started to each individually read the books starting with Goblet of Fire  we owned one copy so I hogged it for the majority of the time and she would read at night catch up after I finished it within a week  and just discussed everything afterwards  Harry Potter was  and is  one of the things in life that I have loved with all my heart  no matter how many times I ve reread the books or rewatched the films  I thank my mom for taking me to Media Play each release day  bright and early  to pick up each new book  for taking me to Harry Potter library events where I dressed up as a witch  for sewing my brothers and I our own invisibility cloaks  To my family for creating these magical Harry Potter themed parties and putting up with me watching the first film every day for nearly 2 years  because of that I ve easily watched it at least 800 times   even though I know it bugged them when I recited every line while watching it  It was such a big part of my life and part of what made it so wonderful is how involved my family and friends were  so I wasn t alone in this Harry Potter obsession   it brought everyone together and I have SO many memories that involve HP in one way or another I ve since wished  like many have  that I could experience reading Harry Potter again  I wouldn t change my reading experience with these books in the slightest  but I d love to relive the magic for the first time with open  unknowing eyes  Reading the illustrated edition was about as close to reliving this as I think I ll ever get  It was so damn magical not knowing what illustrations were coming up next  getting teary eyed at how perfect some of the drawings were  Honestly it just let me read Harry Potter in a new light and was just another great experience to add to the plethora I already have This book is beautiful and perfect and exceeded any possible expectations I had for it going in  I cannot wait to read this to my children grandchildren one day  Anyone who knows me is quite aware that J K  Rowling s Harry Potter series is one of my favorite things on this earth  There are not many books that have inspired me as much as Harry Potter  So many of my fondest memories revolve around this classic tale  I ve been reading and re reading Harry Potter since 1999 and haven t stopped yet  nor do I plan to  Harry Potter didn t change me  it shaped me  I grew as Harry  Ron    Hermione grew  I studied and played and made friends and had adventures right alongside them  even though my adventures weren t so much a matter of life and death or good triumphing over evil   I m sure there are many people out there who share my sentiments  and there are some who just don t understand  I cannot put into words the effect that this series has had on my life  I would like to believe that I m equal parts Gryffindor  Slytherin  Hufflepuff    Ravenclaw  I m willing to do what s necessary to achieve my dreams  I m willing to work hard without the need for recognition  I value knowledge and learning  and I am continually seeking to widen my understanding of all of the subjects and topics that interest me  finally  I am determined to prove that courage and bravery take many forms  and I hope I have the nerve to fulfill my dreams and help others along the way  One last note  THE ILLUSTRATED EDITION IS PERFECTION  thank you Jim Kay    Harry Potter And The Sorcerer s Stone  This is the first installment in the seven book series  Harry Potter   The novel starts off in London  England where a boy Harry Potter lives with the Dursleys  Harry s parents died when Harry was a baby  so he was sent to live with the Dursleys because they are Harry s only family  When Harry receives letters in the mail saying that he is accepted into Hogwarts Witchcraft and Wizardry  Harry is confused because he does not know he is a wizard  Hagrid  the gamekeeper at Hogwarts is sent to find Harry and get him supplies for the school year  Once Harry had everything he needed for Hogwarts  he went home until school started  At the train station  Harry had to jump through a wall to get to the Hogwarts Express  the train that takes the students to Hogwarts  All of the students think Harry is a celebrity because the notorious wizard Voldemort could not kill Harry the night his parents died  he only left a scar on Harry s forehead  On the train  Harry meets his best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger  During the school year  the three friends discover a room with a three headed dog in it  All year long they wonder what it is guarding  They think that one of the teachers  Professor Snape  wants whatever the dog is guarding  The three of them do research  and find out the item that is in the room is the Sorcerer s Stone  When they go to try and find the stone before he does  the meet a series of challenges in the room  At the final challenge  Harry is the only one left because only one person would be able to advance  Harry reaches a room with the Mirror of Erised inside  and a man with two faces  The man is not Snape  but is Professor Quirrell  and Voldemort face on the back of Quirrell s head  Quirrell is trying to bring Voldemort back to life using the stone  but he cannot find the stone because it is hidden  Harry is able to find the stone by just looking in the mirror  After Quirrell and Harry fight for possession of the stone Harry defeats him by burning him by touching him  After the fight  Harry returns the stone to Professor Dumbledore  Harry s house  Gryffindor  wins the house cup for Harry  Ron  and Hermione s brave actions In my own opinion  Harry Potter and The Sorcerer s Stone is a great novel because of the details about the dining room  and the sport quidditch that J K  Rowling includes  At the feast there are tables for every house  a staff table  and candles floating above the whole dining room  During a quidditch practice  she explains how there are different balls used during the game  and how to score points  When I was reading this book  some of the lines that are in this novel are powerful  In one part  Harry would not listen to his friends  so he started yelling at them because he believed in what he thought was right  I recommend to read this book if you like fantasy  especially wizards  or you are into reading about other kids and what they do at their school  Another suggestion to read this book is because Harry Potter and his friends do something to try to stop evil  even though there were challenges in order to do so  Harry Potter and The Sorcerer s Stone is a great fantasy novel  Originally published on  My Books Are Me Like a majority of the population on the planet  I LOVE Harry Potter  J K  Rowling created such a fantastical magical world and flawlessly created a storyline  where a small detail in one book  suddenly appears as a major plot point in the next  Upon hearing that the books were going to be re released with illustrations  I was super excited  like most people within the Potter Fandom  Having a legitimate excuse to buy more Harry Potter books  other than just  I want to own every single book in every single edition  just because    was also a good bonus  Rereading the series is always a highlight for me  I love jumping back into the world and I always find things I had forgotten  or something I didn t notice before  It really does feel like coming home  This edition was such a fabulous way to dive back into the series again  since it s been a few years since I ve done a reread  The illustrated edition is gorgeous   from small illustrations around the page  to single and double full page artwork  Jim Kay has done a fabulous job bringing to life the Wizarding World and the characters we ve grown to love  His interpretations feel very acurate to my imagining of the world  and he really brought the characters to life  I recommend that any Harry Potter fan pick this book up if they haven t already  because it is such a beautiful addition to your collection  I can t wait for Chamber of Secrets to be released  and the rest of the series  and seeing how Jim Kay brings new characters and places to life  Welcome to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry   again  I m the generation that grew up with these books   literally  as I was almost the same age as the characters when the series first came out  I discovered them when Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was just out  by which I mean  a friend pushed one of the books at me and said  READ THAT    and I tend to listen when people tell me that  and immediately joined the masses of people spending the better part of each year eagerly awaiting the release of the newest Harry Potter novel  then promptly devouring it in one night before going back to waiting for the next  I d been meaning to re read these books for years   the characters and the whole marvellous world they live in never quite leave my head  and having recently re watched several of the movies I decided now it s finally time  Turns out that no matter how familiar the world and characters have become over the many years since I first encountered them  rediscovering this wonderful universe and its inhabitants again from the very beginning is no less enchanting and enjoyable at almost 30 than it was at 13  Another 30 years from now  new readers will still be discovering these books and falling in love with them  And 30 years from that  And another 30 years from that  These books aren t about magic  they ARE magic   it s as simple as that  I just realized that I haven t actually written a review for this book  How fitting for this pretty new American edition   It is gorgeous  That cover and all of the rest of the books  I mean  I own three full sets of them  plus some other random special editions  but these are the prettiest by far   I mean  I can t do the usual thing  Everyone knows the plot  so no summary  I don t have any wise additions or observations to give besides what I mentioned in a status update  So  what can I say I was one when this book came out and five when they made the movie  Sadly  I don t remember seeing the movie  but I did go and see it because my mom remembered reading the book and thinking I would like it  From there  we saw the second movie  and I have a great story for that which I ll share in my review of the second book  and then my mom picked up reading me the books  starting with the third  My whole childhood was Harry Potter  I made her stop reading the books to me somewhere in the fifth book  when I was in fourth grade  and picked up on my own with them Everyone has that one series    book  movie  TV show    that sticks with them forever  that they ll always feel like a child again when they pick it back up  For me  that s Harry Potter  It s helped me through the tough times  When I was scared or worried  I would pick up the first book and read the very first chapter to myself to calm down because it centered me again in this world  that everything was okay and rightI can t give this book any less than five stars  Wow  I know  right  You re probably thinking   Wow  It took Jana a REALLY long time to review this book  since SURELY she read this ages ago   Well  you re wrong  I just read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone for the first time in my entire life  FINALLY  right  I was scared of this book  I was not a fantasy fan when these books came out  so I could not have cared less about reading them  And then when I finally became a fan of fantasy  the books had received so much praise and proclamations of undying love  that I was too scared to read them  Of course  no book could EVER live up to the hype generated by millions and millions of devoted fans  I wanted to pass that right of passage  though  I m going to school to be a young adult librarian  How could I not read these  So  I lowered my expectations and forced myself to begin  And much to my surprise    I LOVED IT I SO wish I had been interested in these books as a child  because every child needs to believe in the possibility of magic  Every child who hates their life  not that I did  I m just sayin    needs to believe that there s more waiting for them out there in the world Hogwarts is just    magical  This world is so exciting and dynamic and it feels HUGE  I finally know what muggles are  And I finally understand why people are waiting for their Hogwarts letter  And I get the owl thing  And I understand who this creepy Voldemort guy is  And Hagrid  I love him  And Hermione is quite annoying  And Ron is adorable  And I want to smack Draco  And Harry is this sweet little skinny thing who I just want to hug because of his terrible childhood  I love that he became special  and recognized it I was not expecting Harry Potter to be a funny story  But it is  Hagrid had me laughing so much  And some of the things these kids say to each other is hilarious  Even the professors have their little jokes  I was not expecting my imagination to be so stimulated  This book made me hope that all this magical stuff is real  I was not expecting Harry Potter to read like such a universal book  I mean  these kids are little young things but I did not feel like I was reading a book for children I don t really know what to do  I m jumping from thought to thought  and there s really no organizational schematic to this post  Harry Potter has been reviewed and reviewed and talked about for YEARS  There is nothing else I can say  So basically  I m going to cut this thing short  say  ditto to all the 5 star reviews   and go stalk the mail for my really pretty 15th anniversary boxed set I just bought  J K  Rowling has another fan  I m a cool kid now  I can t wait to finish the series    Find this review and many more at That Artsy Reader Girl  As I m typing this  there are over 2 million reviews of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone on Goodreads  I m not sure I can add anything new to this discussion  It s a beloved classic  and probably always will be  even after almost 20 years  the whole series is still chugging along  Sorcerer s Stone is a bit uneven and takes much longer to gather steam than I remember  we spend far too long with the Dursleys   But that s quibble  What Rowling does particularly well  I think  besides continually express a disdain for government  laws  rules and petty bureaucracy and bureaucrats  is characters who do EXACTLY those things  I mean  we all love Harry and Co    but we REALLY love to HATE the Filches and Percy Weasley s that she lovingly crafts  They are what makes Harry Potter books so much fun   the many narrow minded busybodies who oppress for the sake of feeling superior that she writes into her novels  and how Harry and Co  thwart them and make them look foolish every single time  It s Rowling being her most radical  and secretly that may be why we all love these book so very much  This is one of my all time favorite series  I had actually first heard of the series when a friend of mine was reading the Prisoner of Azkaban and was trying to describe a dementor to me  From there I did some looking into the book to discover it was a series  The day before I flew out to visit my grandparents my dad bought me the first book to read on the flight  By the time the flight was over I had devoured the book  I have since read it several times and have yet to tire of it  and each time I read it  I take a little more with me I think just about everyone has heard about the books by now which is why I am not focusing so much on plot and characters  We ve all heard about them  Instead  I want to share mostly the overall feel the book leaves you with The world of Harry Potter has to be one of the most engaging concepts I have ever read  Envigorating and rich  Magic and adventure lovers should not miss this book  Honestly one book I think everyone should read at least once is this  Saying you ve seen the movie does not do it justice  There are so many details you ll miss this way  From how they celebrate holidays with Wizard Crackers to the fantastically annoying Peeves the Poltergiest of Hogwarts  still mad he is not in the movies   While the films are good  the book is so much more  I think just about everyone has heard about the books by now which is why I am not focusing so much on plot and characters  We ve all heard about them  The story is real enough we can all relate  We ve all read stories about good vs evil and this is no exception  But the originality that goes into the world building changes everything  Not to mention the imperfect heroes  Harry Potter is not some grand  perfect student  me makes mistakes  break rules  and is overall average as a student  His friends and even enemies have their own strengths and weaknesses as well  Yet relatable as the characters are  the magical world is one so fantastical I hate leaving it  This is one of the best  escape  from reality books  And a great mood lifter as well For older kids  teens and adults of all ages  People of all backrounds can enjoy this book  So if you haven t read it  do so NOW First read  June 1999Most recent re read  Nov  2015Total re reads        Several Why isn t there a separate entry for the illustrated version  Come on  Goodreads  there should be a difference Anyway  I just wanted to say I got my copy WOOHOO  It feels like I m 8 years old again  sitting on my bed holding that brand new copy of Philosopher s Stone and tentatively opening to the first chapter expecting a world of fun  mystery and intriguing characters and reading that iconic opening line   Mr and Mrs Dursley  of number four  Privet Drive  were proud to say that they were normal  thank you very much  And so the story goes   That was in 1998  Now it s 2015  And here we have 25 year old me  clutching my  actually very  heavy copy of Harry Potter   the Philosopher s Stone  the Jim Kay Illustrated edition  And I am super pumped for this     The illustrations are awesome  and colourful and funny  Its just brilliant  There s something magical about re living your favourite story through the eyes of someone else s imagination  Now I m off to re immerse myself in the world of Harry Potter and all of J K Rowling s glorious magic      It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live   I ve sat at my desk for over an hour and I still  after all these years  do not think I can review this book properly  All I can say is that Harry Potter feels like home  and every page of this book feels like magic  and not the magic that has to do with wizards or Hogwarts  but magic that has to do with love that is all encompassing  This book was published nearly twenty years ago  but when I opened this book to the first page it felt like not a day had passed  I really don t have any amount of words that I can string together to tell you how this book makes me feel  J K  Rowling will always set the bar for how a series should be written  because Harry Potter is written with love  and it makes all the difference  Always Twitter   Tumblr   Instagram   Youtube   Steam   Twitch Re read in Sept  2015Such an enjoyable return to the wizarding world  It s been a few years since I ve read the books and I forgot about all of the little bits that make it so wonderful  from Peeves lurking in the hallway to the Weasley twins bewitching snowballs to hit Quirrell in the back of the head  I e  Voldemort   I had forgotten quite how full of himself Harry could be  but I suppose I can forgive him as he is only 11 years old  I really found myself enjoying the parts with Neville in it this time around  It was so fun to read about him coming out of his shell and I m excited to read more about his character development as I continue on in the series  I really enjoyed my girl Hannah Abbot s shout out in the sorting hat scene  I m very much looking forward to catching glimpses of her again  poor Hannah   In the last chapter  Harry asked Dumbledore why Voldemort would want to kill him and Dumbledore s only response was that Harry would find out in time  Ahh the foreshadowing  Such a fun book to reread and what an awesome time to jump back into this world as I am studying in London   Harry Potter Sorcerers Stone It all started when Harry Potter  the boy known to survive the killing curse  gets a letter to go to Hogwarts  a school for wizardry  that his whole life changes  Harry  Ron  Harrys new friend  and Hermoin  also Harrys new friend  arrive at Hogwarts and get sorted by the sorting hat into their houses Slytherin  Hufflepuff  Ravenclaw  or Gryffindor  While Harry  Ron  and Hermoin are waiting to get sorted they meet Malfoy  the boy whos mean  and of course they hate him  Harry  Ron  and Hermoin all get chosen for Gryffindor  and Malfoy for Slytherin  When they find the three headed dog  Fluffy  and find out what Fluffy is garden and who is after it of course they get deep into the story and are off having the adventure of there life Wait  Are they wrong about who is after what lies under the door  Will they live to tell the story  I guess youll have to read this amazing book  Harry Potter Sorcerers stone by J K Rowling nyour self to find out    I like this book because I thought the author did amazing on all the little details and all the mythical creatures  The charactors were great beacause they were funny and so talented with there magic  When I picked this book up I could not put it back down  I would stay up at night and always say one more chapter  The story flowed along really well and kept you on the edge of your seat threw out the book  This book had so much imaginary creatures and storys that it made you picture it in your mind every second of of the story  I loved this book  My third time reading this amazing book was just as amazing as the first  I just love Harry Potter so much  And I loved being able to read this with Cheyanne who read it for the first time and loved it too  Seriously it makes me just want to read the whole series again What I noticed this time is how much the idea of a  sorting ceremony  has taken off  Think about in Divergent and the Hunger Games   they are both based on ceremonies which seem to stem from the HP novels  but it interested me in how much the Sorting Ceremony felt warm and invite whereas a lot of the others in dystopian novels were fear inducing situations The descriptions of a lot of the stuff shocked me because if you actually read it  a lot of things aren t described too well  But I feel like Rowling has done this so we can fill in the blanks ourselves and we are able to make trips world our own  rather than having it spoon fed to us  It s part of what makes it magical And I couldn t help but notice the Wuthering Heights similarities going on here after studying that book  They jumped out at me this time If you haven t read this novel  DO IT RIGHT NOW  I will admit that the whole Harry Potter universe never caught my attention  neither the books nor the movies  but in the recent events of a certain HP themed reading challenge I was faced with a strange curiosity about HP  So  naturally I guess you could say I m late to the party  but  nevertheless  I m immensely pleased that I finally chose to give Harry Potter a try Here is what I have to say I can honestly understand why people are so obsessed with this book series  I hadn t expected to fall in love with this book at all  But  alas  I did Although I was rather surprised about it  I really enjoyed the writing style  the way the author switched so casually between the characters  narrations brought something special to the story  I loved how we as readers were able to gain knowledge on each of the characters  well  almost  So much happens constantly throughout this novel  which I greatly appreciated  it kept me well entertained   I practically didn t want to let go of the book   Furthermore  you get the feeling that there are going to be lots and lots of secrets to unfold in further installments of the series The way in which we are introduced to the magical world of Hogwarts is absolutely fantastic  It s not only described in a fascinating way  but the way the scene is set whilst the story is being told from a plot filled with endless plot twists    it s just so  so great Okay  so this is a bit of a side note  but    Could we also just appreciate how lovely the Weasley s are  They re so great  I was surely smitten   Oh  and I went ahead and watched the first HP movie after reading this novel    and tiny Ron  Is  So  Adorable   Aside from the Weasley family  some of my other favorite characters were Neville  Professor Dumbledore  Professor McGonagall  and inevitably  the very cool Oliver Wood  Voldemort is certainly also an interesting character  but he creeps me out more than he intrigues me There s definitely an ocean full of great moments in the very first novel of the series  all of my favorite moments included Neville s clumsiness  Ron s temper and sudden outrages  any moment with the great giant Hagrid  who on the outside looks scary  but on the inside truly is as soft as a jellybean  the Quidditch games  and  of course  Ron and Hermione s constant bickering  that may even be my favorite part of the entire book I was wondering  though  since I read this novel in an English edition  What exactly are knickerbockers  I surely had to Google that one   A fancy word for  trousers   I m still not too sure  I sometimes find English terms so peculiar It s really true what they say  You should at least read Harry Potter once in your lifetime Edit  Also  I just briefly wanted to add that  I ll bet my broomstick that     is certainly only a phrase that could be said at Hogwarts   Laugh out loud   Rereading  August 2015It has been more than 3 years since last time I ve read this book and rest of the series after  for a long while I ve been feeling very nostalgic for this world  and here i am re reading the whole series all over again  This may be the sixth or seventh time  i don t know for sure  D   Philosopher s Stone   The first book I ve ever read  The one that opened all gates and doors to the world of reading and imagination The first book in the most beloved series ever in my heart  Door to the magic  since then i fell in love with Harry  Ronald  Hermione and Hogwarts  With the magical world  It always feels good to go back to this world  to the old days  Remembering and imagining again and again In this book they are all young and innocent  Harry knowing for the first time that he is a Wizard    exploring Diagon alley  meeting Ron and Hermione  Exploring Hogwarts and fighting for good  All good meanings and great morals are in this book and rest of the series  the beginning of a great friendship and future  Dumbledore  Snape  all Professors and Hagrid   Quidditch  i want to play it someday  D I have to say that Snape character have got my attention in this book  not loving him  no  not until the Third book  But i kind of been interested in that person  The Weasleys are adorable  the most amazing family I will never stop re reading these books  it is for all ages  Children  Young adult and even adults    and that s one of the brilliant things that Rowling created I still feel thrilled  enthusiastic and eager like the very first time reading  Philosopher s Stone   Knowing what is going to happen didn t affect me much  just knowing  but whatever other feelings  i felt them all like the first time to Rowling for sure is a great writer  She has a magical powers in writing  Her use of words  describing the places  details of the characters  their faces  clothes  and their way of talking and facial expressions  She also have embodied all the feelings so you will feel them all very strong  Let alone her brilliant mind in plots  she put something in this book or in some other  but you will find all truth about it in the sixth or even the last book  From all aspects  she is a great  brilliant and smart writer First time i have ever read  Philosopher s Stone   it never crossed my mind that i would hold on to these books for this long and never outgrow them  However  i am thankful for this world and these books  a lot of things in my life happened because of them  I owe them so much  I am so Grateful  Thank you Harry  Thank you Hogwarts  Thank you Rowling           Yet the old time fairy tale  having served for generations  may now be classed as  historical  in the children s library  for the time has come for a series of newer  Wonder Tales       L  Frank Baum  The Wonderful Wizard of Oz  I was reading The Wonderful Wizard of Oz just a few days ago and the introduction captured my mind  Thinking about it today  one would find it right to think it is time for a newer series of  wonder tales  and no other book would have the right to be called the fairy tale of today than the Harry Potter series  Philosopher s Stone  the first of the series is a thrilling book that will surely and properly introduce you to the Magical World of Harry Potter  A boy in despair sitting inside a closet is not what one would expect of the beginning of the story of a magical world  creating an even more enjoyable experience  Now coming to the story  it is one that was written to perfection and as we read through the chapters you can see the story coming together like a puzzle  Harry Potter is the son of wizard parents who die in  what Harry believes is  an accident and ends up in the care of his mother s sister and family  The Dursleys who are pictured as the most normal family you will ever see  who are always concerned about what people think and only seek to prove to their neighbors that they are the perfect family  Harry is mistreated in this house by their son and themselves and one day gets a letter from Hogwarts inviting him to study there  although the Dursleys try every trick in the book to stop him from going to Hogwarts but in the end he was able to  On his train to Hogwarts he meets Ron and Hermione    they are the ones to be beside him in every other book leading to the end Role of Hermione and Ron in The Story view spoiler  I decided to write this since different people tend to have different opinions and ideas on the role of Harry s friends Hermione and Ron in his adventures  In my opinion  they are not mere side kicks  they are individuals without whom Harry s greatness wouldn t have been possible  Take this for instance  In the book Harry is seen wishing to be in Gryffindor and the sorting hat although would have preferred Harry in Slytherin heeded to his request  Now why did harry wish to be in Gryffindor  Well its obvious that Ron was the one who told him about how many dark wizards were produced from Slytherin  Here is another instance  In Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets Hermionie is the one who created The PolyJuice potion  Harry definitely didn t have that much skill that time he could never have done that on his own  To me I see it like This 1 Harry Potter  The chosen one  the all powerful wizard and the one who loves  It is he who kept the trio together 2 Ron Weasley  The one who knows to break the rules  the one who gives Harry a fun and better life at Hogwarts 3 Hermione Granger  The smart one  Stops Harry and Ron from breaking rules and brings a balance  She has always got the information   hide spoiler  Overall this is a book to relish and read with a child s heart and perspective  One should be willing to enjoy the light touches of humor and enjoy the magic of the Book and the magic within the Story  This is my first review and I hope you like it Thanks to Julie Jacob my sis for editing  Le courage peut prendre de nombreuses formes    Albus Dumbledore   J  K  Rowling   Jean Francois Menard Un petit retour en arriere nostalgique  c etait un tel plaisir de remarquer des details oublies  En fait  j ai relu ce livre en anglais et en vietnamien plusieurs fois dans le passe  Mais apparemment  ca ne suffit pas  meme apres peut etre la enieme fois  Cette fois ci  c etait ma premiere tentative serieuse d utiliser mon francais pitoyable pour relire ce roman  Et elle etait assez reussie  je crois  Apres tout  c est Harry Potter   Et je pense que Harry Potter a l ecole des sorciers est un des livres qui inspirent le desir de lire  En ce qui me concerne  les adultes et les enfants tous peuvent l apprecier  Donc  il faut que tout le monde lisent cette serie exceptionnelle   Veuillez m excuser pour mon mauvais francais  I ve been wanting to reread the entire Harry Potter series for a long time  After realising it s been more than 10 years  how    since I started reading them  I decided now would be a great time  also bc it s summer  I forgot how freaking great these books are  While reading this I was just smiling from ear to ear  I love how detailed the books are and how life at Hogwarts is described by J K  Rowling  I also forgot how horrible the Dursleys actually are  I felt so bad for Harry at the start of the book  Something I missed in almost all the movies were long scenes of regular Hogwarts life  quidditch  having breakfast  lessons   While there are some in the movies  the movies are mostly action based which I understand  There s so much to tell in the movies  there s little room for scenes that aren t important  This is why I love reading the books so much and I totally forgot this since it s been so long  I grew up with Harry Potter and I m totally reliving my childhood through this books  Nothing but love for them  My favourite part from Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone is the beginning  Not the  let s leave Harry with awful people  part but when Harry is told  by Hagrid   seriously  who d send Hagrid to break such news to a 11 year old   not that I don t love Hagrid to pieces but he isn t the most tactful person out there  is he   that he s a wizard  The trip to Diagon Alley and the first view of Hogwarts made me fall in love with this story  I think  I wanted to get a Hogwarts letter so badly when I was a kid  though I was more than 11 years old when I first read the series My least favourite chapter is the one with the Mirror of Erised  I could have done without it  I can t really say why  it s just that I feel like the story wasn t moving anywhere and I was kind of bored  It also took me years to decipher  Erised   especially since it was translated as  Ajneneperh  in Slovenian  hrepenenje   a very deep  heartfelt desire  I would have preferred if the Dursleys weren t so absolutely horrible  though  All through this book   and for most of the series  really   they are very black  and Harry is seen as very white   I know loads has been written about this but I would have loved to see more positive muggle characters  Especially since the readers were essentially all muggles  I am upset with myself for not reading the Harry Potter series when it came out more than 10 year ago  I started them  but only read the first three before I let myself get busy with life  I had not wanted to get too far ahead of the movies  but I have never even seen the first movie I am upset because I could have carried this story and the lessons it has in it for a decade longer than I now will  It is a wonderful  superbly written story I read the series with my oldest daughter  I just finished and she s starting book seven  I can t wait until she s done so we can share our thoughts  It s hard not to give much of anything away to her and I ll try not to do that in this review as well When I originally read the first three books many years ago  there was a lot of controversy in the Christian world about whether children should read these books or not  I read it with an open mind and found them to resemble Roald Dahl s stories where children who are ill treated by the adults in charge of them gain special powers and make a difference in the world  I thought they were well written and would do no harm to any child who knew it was a fiction story I took this approach with my daughter and talked to her about magic and fiction before she started reading  She has enjoyed the story and loves the characters  but understands that it is not real life This series has many great themes  love  good vs  evil  friendship  loyalty  keeping priorities straight  sacrifice  loss and grief In the first book  Sorcerer s Stone   Harry learns why he can  make things happen   who his parents are and what it feels like to have family and friends who love him  It establishes the series  foundation of love and friendship and how important they are in our lives The second book  Chamber of Secrets  starts to show Harry more of his path in fighting the enemy  Voldemort  He learns to start trusting his instincts and taking care of people The Prisoner of Azkaban introduces Harry to more family as he learns to not always trust those in power  He also finds the strength inside of him often comes from his parents  love In the fourth book  Goblet of Fire   Harry comes face to face with his enemy and learns how serious the fight of good vs  evil is   and that it can come with a price In the Order of the Phoenix  Harry helps the official group trying to fight off Lord Voldermot  He also faces persecution for standing up for what he knows is true Book six  Half Blood Prince  takes Harry on the cusp of the fight of his life  Tragedy strikes close to home and he must decide to join the fight or get dragged into it The series ends  Deathly Hallows  with the final battle of good vs  evil  Harry realizes that he must sometimes rely on his friends and must sometimes face things by himself  His determination to protect those he loves leads to a great sacrifice I would recommend this series for older children and any adult  If your child is comfortable reading long chapter books and death  he or she would be ready to read the series  If you are an adult and have not read them yet  find a friend to read them with you or someone who has read them  because as soon as you read the final sentence  you will want someone to share your experience with    There is something magical about Harry Potter that I really can t understand  I never got to read it as a child for    reasons  But I did FINALLY get to watch the movies starting in late 2006  Then  in 2011  something amazing happened    I read the series for the first time and fell in love  I ve never quite understood re reads though and I never thought I d give Harry another glance other than having as many gorgeous editions as possible lining my shelves  But then something worked itself loose in my noggin and I changed my mind  Thus began the great Harry Potter re read of 2015 Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone is magic  I know that s pretty cheesy to say about a book that s literally about magic  but I don t know any other way to describe it  As I was reading this book I thought to myself  on several occasions    How did J K  Rowling think this stuff up    And reading it for the second time is even better because you can see how intertwined everything really is all the way through book seven I cannot think of one thing to complain about in Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone and you can rest assured it isn t nostalgia talking  This is just good storytelling  plain and simple  The characters are sympathetic  even Hermione later on  although she starts as a nightmare   the world building is spectacular  and I was totally sucked back into the world of Harry Potter from page one  And can we take a second to appreciate these awesome new UK covers  The artwork is absolutely gorgeous Knowing now how amazing these books are makes me really sad that I never got to experience them from a child s perspective  Despite that  I am so glad I DID get to read them as an adult and I have finally discovered what everyone loves so much about re reads  I can t wait to pick up book two  Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone Review on K Books    Review goes live August 20th 2015  NEVER INSULT ALBUS DUMBLEDORE IN FRONT OF ME   Harry Potter has always been  and will always be  my favourite YA series of all time  I grew up with this series being only 6 years old when the first book published and it still remains to be on of the best books I have read to date  I have read this series about 6 or 7 times but as I didn t blog then never reviewed it  So I thought it was about time for a re read and for me to review them Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone is such a stunningly additive introduction to this highly obsessive series  We are introduced to our amazing hero Harry while he is in such a horrid situation  It s only when he discovers that he is actually a wizard and not a muggle  non magic folk  and that he will soon be on his way to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry that things start looking up  Be prepared for a stunningly magical adventure because that is exactly what you will get in this book JK Rowling is really one of the most amazing YA authors and right from the very first page I was sucked back into this amazing world  I read it in one sitting as I just couldn t put it down  even with this being a re read and me knowing what was going to happen   Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone is filled to the brim with magic  adventure and danger  I loved every moment of it I have to say I enjoyed this book way more reading it as an adult than I ever did as a child  It took me back and turned me back into a Harry Potter fangirl while reading  I was squealing at all of my favourite parts and constantly going  oh why wasn t that bit in the movie   I loved re reading this amazing  phenomenal and heartwarming story  I absolutely love this series and I cannot wait to re read the rest of the book in the series  Now I ll just sit here and wait for my Hogwarts letter to turn up      Nicholas Flamel is the only known maker of the Philosopher s

and still have thousands more pages to devour before I complete the entire thing There s just something super awesome about Harry Potter and it never gets old and I ll always love it  I do very much enjoy this first book  Sorcerer s Stone  because of how well the mysteries were masked  I mean  going into it for the third time  I already knew everything  but I pretended I hadn t  I started noticing all the little details that later became so important and I mean  it was great because you don t really think to notice those things Hogwarts is a boarding school  I quite enjoy books with boarding schools  Looking for Alaska  The Mysterious Benedict Society  etc    And personally  I m not super big on fantasy  but Harry Potter s basically my exception to   well  everything I have the Special Edition 15th Anniversary box set where the cover art is illustrated by Kazu Kabuishi and I think it s so stunning and the material feels so nice and the spine isn t easily crack able breakable and I m in love with how the spines of all seven book make up the Hogwarts castle Okay  And also  if you haven t read the Harry Potter series or seen the Harry Potter movies  it is my wise suggestion that you get to doing both at some point in your long  long lifetime   Harry Potter and The Sorcerer s Stone by J K  Rowling I have read this book multiple times  but each time I read it  it s like the first time  I love this book as it s the beginning of a whole magical series  I guess this book would be categorized under fantasy or fiction  But to me  this is all real and I fell in love with it each time I read it  Anyways  I gave this book five stars because it has an amazing plot and the characters really pull you in  Their humor and witty comments  and the fact that they are wizards  really makes me excited to read the book  As a kid  I grew up in a house where everyone was talking about this  Harry Potter   and I was always confused  Once  I read it  I found out how amazing the book was  It shows so much adventure and mystery  which is what I like  Also  with each time I read the book I notice new things that I didn t pay attention to last time  Also  the storyline about a poor boy who doesn t even know he is famous  really makes readers grateful for everything they have  Harry was an inspiration because it made me believe that anything was possible   Overall  this book displays a great deal of emotion  humor  and fantasy that really makes readers eager to read the next books  J K  Rowling did a good job at giving the characters personalities that we can relate with and that we can feel sympathy to  The whole plot also draws readers in as it is about magic  something we all dreamed of  dy m tkwn lbdyt jmyl  jd wmbd      wlh Tb h lkhS  ly lrGm mn Hby lslsl  l flm

lives with his aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon and his cousin Dudley for eleven of his young years Eleven years of tolerating his unpleasant  miserable life sleeping in the cupboard under the stairs  and being excluded from any family activity and thinking his parents died in a car accident which caused his lightening shaped scar on his forehead After being rescued by Hagrid  the grounds keeper at Hogwarts school Harry is invited to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry where his parent s had also spent their secondary school years There he and his new friends find out about the evil one known to all around simply as  You Know Who  Hogwarts is a truly magical place  Hogwarts is a place that everybody wishes they could have gone to when they where eleven Everyone that is anyone knows all about Harry  including the story about that interesting scar which Harry soon finds to be different to the one he has been led to believe  Hogwarts school is full of excitement fantasy mystery and friendship but Harry soon learns that there is also dark magic around him and enemies out to get him This book has it all in spades including a three headed dog  an attacking troll and a life sized  come to life chess board Although this book is aimed at children  it really is to be enjoyed by all ages I am totally enamoured by the first book in this series I never read watch anything when it is in the  hype  and only recently watched the films in full  and in order  I am so glad I chose to read the books as well I didn t want my imagination influenced by the films and am very glad to say  it wasn t There is so much more to the book  much more detail that isn t in the film  and so the book was a whole new imaginative fantasy playing out in my mind There is a huge amount of action packed into this amazing warm book  JK Rowling s writing style flows beautifully with crafty segments of humour scattered amongst it  that made me chuckle out loud It s such an easy read and will appeal to children and grownups alike I can t wait to rediscover the rest of this series and enter Hogwarts magical world once more  Almost 12 years after first inadvertently picking up a Harry Potter book  and a lot of re reads and a real geek worthy anticipation for upcoming books and movies in the series  I ve read the series once more and now am finally ready to write a review It s difficult to express how much these books affected me  It was the starting point of my reading career and the obsessive nerdyness that never fails to weird out the people around me  Harry Potter satisfied a very deep hunger in me that I never knew existed  and every book I read after that in my teenage years was to find and have that feeling of satisfaction again  Of course  later on  I found that there are an almost unlimited number of books out there in the world  and a lot of them are potentially better written and much more informative than the HP series itself but to this day  I m still a proud fan and the books still hold a very important and loved place in both my mind and my bookshelf Review   Brilliantly imaginative  well thought out and laugh out loud funny  the Harry Potter series by J K  Rowling never fails to amaze and entertain  I recommend the series to both children and adults  as I have no doubts at least the imagination of the author and the fascinating world of Hogwarts  three headed dogs and Quidditch will be able to fascinate any reader who is willing to read through     Harry   yer a wizard   It is a pain to answer this question  Which is your favourite book  There are so many books that it is hard to figure out which one is the perfect one  However  don t when the Harry Potter series is here  I was just reading this book for the 169 th time because one can never read Harry Potter enough times The story opens with the introduction of the Dursleys  though the story actually revolves around Mrs  Dursley s sister s son  Harry Potter  This boy earned fame even before he had all his teeth in his mouth  Harry simply abhors this family  and always dreamed that someday  a person would come and take him away  Finally  on his eleventh birthday  a gigantic man  Hagrid  came to let his know who he really was   a wizard  Subsequently  the story proceeds with Harry s life at Hogwarts School Of Witchcraft And Wizardry  a school which teaches such magical folk  After his meeting with Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger  Harry slowly finds out all about himself  Truly  there is magic in those pages   Your father left this in my possession before he died It is time it was returned to you Use it well   Initially  when I tried this book  I disliked it  Now  I m in love with it  How is it pragmatic to detest Harry Potter   The eerie adventures  the Invisibility Cloak  the magical words  the lessons  Quidditch  Hermione   how can anyone not like these  Not to forget  Draco Malfoy and Professor Snape only present the book with unexpected climax with their hostility  In addition to it the urge to be in the world of wizards in simply tantalizing Harry Potter makes a wonderful book for children  The world of fantasy builds creativity  bringing about intense enthusiasm  The plot  unlike some books  is plausible  So  what are you waiting for   Grab a copy and start liking it  I don t think I need to write a long review about this book and how great it is so I ll just write more about my experience with it It s my first time to read this book but I ve seen the movie many times already  When I was in highschool  I never cared about reading it and never planned to even watch the movie adaptation  My highschool bestfriend  who is into magic and wizarding   I am more into ghost and paranormal  is a big fan of Harry Potter and I think she tried to convince me to read the book but I told her that  it s for kids  A coworker back in 2011 invited me to watch the second part of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows and I gave it a try  Of course I was lost the whole time because all I know was they were doing magic and kiddy stuffs  nothing serious  But then I was wrong and I told myself   Okay   This is not anymore for kids    I decided to watch  the movies from the beginning  because I was still not into reading during that time and yeah  I loved it  When I started to enjoy reading books  HP were on my to buy list and it took me almost four years to finally have my own HP book set I ve just read the first book and I love it already more than the movie  The writing style is astounding and I think even if I didn t watch the movie  it is still easy for me to imagine how the characters and scenes look like  I love Hagrid s character and I also want to go to Diagon Alley with him JK Rowling is so amazing  To think that she wrote about this magical world and created these unique characters perfectly  She is so magnificent If you haven t read Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone  it s still not too late  and it will never be  for you to start  I recommend this book to everyone and I will surely read this book to my future kids  Review de mon blog    coup de  Deja cette chronique risque d etre une des moins longue du blog  puisque je pense que tout le monde ici connait Harry Potter je n ai pas reellement besoin de rentrer dans les details  Mais je vais quand meme essayer  En tout cas en le relisant en VO  je me suis rappelais a quel point ce livre etait bien et beaucoup mieux que le film vu qu il comporte beaucoup plus de details importants Tout d abord au depart  on decouvre l histoire du jeune Harry Potter  c est un jeune sorcier qui a perdu ses parents peut apres ca naissance  il est alors confie a son Oncle et sa Tante qui sont deux personnes ignobles et bien sur  ce sont des Moldus   Non   Sorcier    Viens un jour ou Harry recoit une lettre  son Oncle sachant d ou elle provient decide donc de ne jamais lui donner et ca malgre le grand nombre de lettres qui arrive dans les jours qui suivent  Completement agacer son Oncle decide de partir  la ou personne ne pourra les trouver  et surtout  la ou il ne recevra plus ces maudite lettre  Mais cela n est que temporaire puisqu un jour Hagrid debarque et lui raconte la vraie histoire sur ses parents et sur lui meme  Et c est donc a partir de la que commence la vie d Harry en tant que sorcier Maintenant  je vais juste vous parler de certains passages  clef    c est a dire ces passages qui m ont fait rire  decouvrir les personnages  m ont donner encore plus envie de savoir la suite  bien que je la connaisse deja  etc  Deja quand l oncle d Harry Potter voit un chat lire une carte   qui n est pas vraiment un chat d ailleurs   ca m a fait rire  Je l imaginer vraiment choquer  entrain de penser qu il hallucine et franchement en lisant ca m a fait plutot rire  je vous l accorde  En meme temps voir un char lire une carte ce n est pas courant  Hagrid pour moi  c est LE personnage declencheur de l histoire  Ok le livre s appelle Harry Potter puisqu on va suivre ses aventures  mais pour moi Hagrid et tout aussi important que Harry  Ron  Hermione  Dumbledore ou le fameux Voldemort  Il est gentil et attachant  puis en plus de ca sans lui Harry serait encore chez les Dursley D ailleurs en parlant de la famille Dursley pour moi  ce sont des gens stupides   pour rester polis    ils ont mais vraiment rien pour eux  Il deteste Harry  alors qu il n a jamais rien fait contre eux  Mais le pire de tous  c est Dudley  Mais alors lui  c est le plus insupportable de tous et Thanks God qu il apparait pas longtemps parce que c est l incarnation du diable ce petit  Au fur et a mesure de l histoire  on en apprend plus sur le monde magique  sur ce qui s est passe au parent d Harry  par qui et pour quelle raison  C est plutot interessant de savoir tout ca et ca permet de se plonger plus facilement dans la lecture  Puis en parlant de monde magique  je ne sais pas vous  mais si Diagon Alley existait vraiment  j y passerais ma vie  ca a l air d etre le reve   Tout comme Poudlard d ailleurs   Pour en revenir a certains personnages  les freres Weasley m ont enormement fait rire quand ils ont remarquer Harry pour la premiere fois dans le train  C etait deux vrais Fangirl  Je les imagines vraiment comme ca  ca aussi  c etait plutot drole Une fois Harry installe  on fait la rencontre de Ron  le frere des jumeaux Weasley  Ron est un personnage super attachant et on sent des le depart qu entre Harry et lui  il y aura une grande amitie  Ensuite vient Hermione  Hermione et certes attachante au fils des pages  mais alors au debut  qu est ce qu elle est agacante  C est madame je sais tout  qui aime donner des lecons a tout le monde  Alors bien qu au final  elle s avere etre adorable  au depart  elle s avere etre plus detestable qu autre choses D ailleurs en parlant de gens detestable  je vais parler de ce blondinet nomme Drago Malfoy  Alors lui s est le pire  apres Dudley   Pour pas en dire trop  c est simple  c est juste un petit snobinard abus de sa personne  Bien que ce personnage soit mon favoris dans les films   puisque selon moi  il n a pas un fond si mechant que ca   dans ce premier tome  il m enerve     et dans le premier film aussi    Alors je ne sais pas vous  mais moi durant le passage du Choixpeau   je crois que ca s ecrit comme ca en VF   j ai ressentit le stress de Harry   Bien que sur Pottermore je suis Serpentard  Le fait de voir Harry  qui ne veut absolument pas etre la ou Voldemort etait  c est comprehensible  Je comprends donc son stress et je stressais pour lui durant ma lecture  Vous imaginez le soulagement quand il est admis a Gryffondor   Parfois  j avais aussi l impression que Harry faisait tout pour ce faire virer  Il n arreter pas de faire des trucs interdit et donc de faire perdre des points a sa maison  D ailleurs  Harry   Ron n aime pas Hermione  et il a fallu que limite un troll l a tue pour qu ils commencent enfin par l apprecier  Le rapport   Il a encore enfreint une regle  mais bon s etait pour sauver Hermione donc on ne lui en veut pas Mais l histoire et le mystere de ce livre commencent quand on evoque Nicolas Flammel   Mais qui est ce fameux Nicolas   On le decouvre au fur et a mesure et on comprend pourquoi   Fluffy     je sais plus le nom en francais desoler  garde ce que Nicolas a creer  Mais de qui le garde t il cacher  Ce livre est donc bien evidemment un coup de coeur  Et j ai hate de retrouver Harry dans le second tome Avez vous lu ce livre   L avez vous aime   Avez vous envie de l acheter   Laissez moi un commentaire  This was an engaging book about a famous wizard whose parents were killed by Voldemort  or as the wizard world knows him  He who shall not be named and You know who  Harry doesn t know that he is a wizard  but strange things have been happening  like when his Aunt Petunia cut Harry s hair  but covered up his scar  Harry lives with his Uncle Vernon  Aunt Petunia  and his abusive cousin Dudley  They didn t want anything to do with Harry s parents  All of a sudden  there are mountains of letters to Harry for Hogwarts  the best witch and wizard school  Then Uncle Vernon took everyone to an old hotel where Harry still got the letters  Uncle Vernon finally gave up and took them to a small island where a very large man named Hagrid tells Harry all about his parents and about witches and wizards  On the train ride to Hogwarts from platform nine and three quarters  which doesn t exist to Muggles  humans   Harry meets Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger  a know it all  Then he meets Draco Malfoy  a bully  Also  there is Neville Longbottom that constantly loses his toad  When Harry gets to Hogwarts  there is a hat that divides all of the first years into the four houses  Gryffindor  Slytherin  Hufflepuff  and Ravenclaw  When it is Harry s turn  he hopes to not be put in Slytherin  so the hat puts him into the Gryffindor house  with Ron and Hermione  Wow  The last time I read this series was the first time I read them  in 5th grade  Four years later I m still amazed at how a children s book could be so unbelievably wonderful  10 5 stars  This world is so beautiful and so special  Its crazy to think about how J K Rowling could have come up with such a complex and different world all the while making it simple enough for younger readers to understand and enjoy  This book is filled with magic  friendship  danger and anything else you could ever want in a book  Harry is simply a wonderful main character  He s quirky and brave and would do anything for his friends  I also adored Ron who was funny and witty  Of course Hermione is amazing with her clever thinking and bossy attitude  Malfoy is that guy you love to hate and I am no exception to that  I m not going to talk about the plot because if you haven t read this series  I honestly don t know what you re waiting for  I will say its interesting and  if you haven t read this series  you will be surprise at how things play out   So  of course  this book was wonderful  It was everything you could want in a children s book and teens and adults will enjoy it just the same   NOSTALGIA WARNING  I read this book for the first time in 1998   when I was 10    and pretty much grew up with the series  I even got majorly upset on my 11th birthday because my Hogwarts letter never arrived  I still think the owl got lost   I re read the earliest books in the series over and over again during my teenage years whilst waiting for each new one to be released  Needless to say  all the Harry Potter books have a special place in my heart Still  I m not going to say too much about this one  I re read it recently for the first time in several years  and am so glad it still stands the test of time  It s much shorter than I remembered   only about 120 pages   and yet each chapter is full of exciting events without ever feeling rushed  Rowling writes with a light  gentle and humorous tone that makes the book an absolute delight to read  and the world she has created is  well  magical  Hogwarts  Quidditch  Dumbledore  Gryffindor  all of these have become bywords for fun fantasy adventure  and this is the place where it first began  As an adult I thoroughly enjoyed this return to my younger years  and can t wait to re read the other six books in the series   Harry Potter  is about a boy who has been treated poorly before he was told he is from wizard descent and he defeated the most powerful dark wizard when he was a baby  Harry Potter attended Hogwarts  a witch wizard school  He made friends quickly and the three of them went on various adventures  including the time when Harry Potter met his enemy  There were times when the students at Hogwarts loved him and hated him for the things he did throughout the year  but in the end  he was loved by everyone around him  The reason I picked this book was because I have heard that many people have enjoyed the  Harry Potter  series  including Vaishni  I decided to step out of the Science Fiction category and read Fantasy for a change  Of course  there are also the movies of  Harry Potter   I have watched very little of the first movie when I was younger  Due to the fact that so many people loved this series book  I decided to give it a try and I understand their feelings towards the book  now that I have read it  The reason I finished this book is because this book was very interesting  This book was full of interesting events that come one after another  non stop  Some of the events really shocked me and I m glad that this book was not a predictable book  I thought that I knew how this book would end  but it was the total opposite of what I expected  This gives me another reason to read the rest of the books in the  Harry Potter  series I would definitely recommend this book to Sammy  I think she would really enjoy this book because she reads Science Fiction Fantasy  The books that she reads seem very interesting  The books that she have told me about sound very interesting  Also  she read the Percy Jackson series  which I completed half of and really enjoyed it  Therefore  she might also really enjoy  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone   MARAVILLOSO 5 5Es la primera vez que leia este libro y sin duda alguna me ha encantado  Me ha hecho sonreir porque no hacia mas que recordar la primera vez que vi la pelicula  siendo yo una cria de 6 anitos   totalmente extasiada por ese fantastico mundo que es Hogwarts  Ha sido fantastico descubrir de nuevos a los personajes  tanto los que salen en la peli como los que no  Me ha sorprendido mucho el hecho de que Neville salga tanto en este libro y tan poco en la pelicula  sin lugar a dudas es un gran personaje que tendra mucho mas protagonismo en las siguientes novelas  Ron tiene algo menos de protagonismo del que esperaba y Hermione es aun mas sabelotodo y tambien carinosa que en las pelis  sin duda es mi personaje favorito  El libro es magnifico  se lee en una tarde   aun que yo haya tardado dos por culpa de los examenes         es perfecto y se lo recomiendo a todos los fans de Harry Potter que hayan visto las peliculas porque me parecen fantasticos y una manera de conocer mejor este universo tan bonito que ha creado la autora  Es un libro que probablemente lea muchas mas veces porque me ha encantado y me ha hecho sonreir  llorar  gritar    En definitiva  emocionarme a mas no poder  Me gustaria anadir unas frases que dice Dumbledore casi al final del libro   para una mente bien organizada  la muerte no es mas que la siguiente gran aventura  y  La verdad  Es una cosa terrible y hermosa  y por lo tanto debe ser tratada con gran cuidado   Dumbledore esta un poco loco en este libro  pero como dicen en el libro  tambien es un genio y estoy totalmente de acuerdo  Reread 12 27 14 The first time I read this book  about a dozen years ago   I read it in one gulp  I have read it multiple times since then  each time seeing something new in this beautifully crafted series In this rereading  my attention focused on the theme of friendship and family that is embodied in the Weasley family  Harry   Ron s friendship is truly epic  reminding me of the great literary friendships like Huck   Tom  but their relationship also includes the entire Weasley clan  For instance  the initial encounter with the family is not with Ron  but with Mrs  Weasley  At the beginning of Harry s journey to Hogwarts  she is the one who tells him how to get to the platform that will take him to the train  and later Harry meets the twins when they volunteer to help Harry get his trunk onboard  While Ron and Harry s friendship deepens  the Weasley twins  as beaters  are fiercely protecting Harry during the Quidditch games  The Weasley s friendship is evident throughout the series but the roots are planted at the beginning of this book and play an important role in the formation of Harry s character as well as a pivotal factor in the plot development  Some things stick with you throughout your life  One of those things for me is the first time I read this book My dad read it first  being made interested in the whole craze at the time  I don t really know what possessed him   it wasn t as if he ever read children s books  but he was always interested in what was going on in the world I always loved reading  but have never been one to be aware of ongoing trends so didn t even know about Harry Potter  Besides  I was not too into fantasy at the time I remember my dad giving me this book and telling me I d like it  I remember being confused why he read it What is it about Harry Potter that makes it so special I did not love it because everyone else was reading it  because everyone else was raving about it  or because it was cool  I remember feeling this feeling inside that I can t explain and that I haven t really felt again  It feels special  A very happy feeling  like I had found something really special  And that was just after book one That so many other people felt the same  is spooky and amazing    It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live  remember that  About fifteen years ago  I huddled next to the stove in my college apartment and read the first three books in this series when I should have been studying physics or chemistry or something more immediately demanding   I don t think I d read a book for fun for at least the last two years   The final book in the series came out the year my daughter was born  and I remember thinking   I can t wait to introduce her to Harry Potter   I  almost  had to force feed this to her but after the first chapter  she was hooked  I enjoyed this book immensely the first time around  but I had forgotten so many details that reading it again was a rediscovery  and can I just say  what a whimsical and imaginative story  The wizarding world and all its details  Diagon Alley  Platform 9 3 4  Bertie Bott s Every Flavor Beans  The Sorting Hat  Quidditch  the Remebrall   aghhh  too many wonderful things to name   And the characters  Brave and kind Harry Potter is a worthy hero  but I have a special place in my heart for soft hearted Hagrid  and I think I ve passed that deep affection on to my daughter  If you ve read and loved this series  but haven t listened to the audio version  do it  Jim Dale is an amazingly talented narrator  probably the best I ve listened to yet  Highly recommended  and even more fun when you get to watch the look of wonder on your seven year old s face      First of all  isn t this book cover just amazingly beautiful  Ich meine  seht es euch einfach mal an  Es ist so wunderschon  Diese Farben  die Aufmachung  die hubsche goldene Schrift  selbst die Schriftart ist grossartig und der Schutzumschlag fuhlt sich so wundervoll weich an  dass ich gar nicht aufhoren mochte  das Buch zu  streicheln   Ich habe mich unendlich in diese Buchcover verliebt und bin uberglucklich  dass alle sieben Hardcoverausgaben der Neuauflage von Bloomsbury als Geburtstagsgeschenk ihren Weg zu mir gefunden haben  Zu Beginn muss ich sagen  dass ich nie wirklich Interesse an den Harry Potter Buchern hatte  Erstmals erschien der erste Teil im Jahre 1997   da war ich gerade 9 Jahre alt  also eigentlich das perfekte Alter  um mit einer solchen Buchreihe zu beginnen  Leider haben mich Bucher damals noch nicht so brennend interessiert  wie sie es heute tun  weshalb ich damals zwar das ein oder andere Harry Potter Buch nach Erscheinen gekauft habe  gelesen habe ich sie allerdings nie  Erstmals gelesen habe ich ein Harry Potter Buch dann im Jahre 2010  recht spat  wenn man bedenkt  wie lange die Bucher schon auf dem Markt waren und wie erfolgreich sie waren  Richtig uberzeugen konnten sie mich damals nicht  Das Buch war mir zu kindlich und noch immer war mein Interesse an Harry Potter gleich Null  Vor gut drei Monaten wurde mein Interesse dann allerdings grosser   keine Ahnung wieso und wodurch  Kurzerhand habe ich mir alle sieben Bucher zu Geburtstag gewunscht und siehe da  ich habe sie auch bekommen  Jetzt   nach all den Jahren   habe ich mich erneut an die Bucher heran getraut und war beeindruckt und verliebt von der ersten Seite an  Ich habe keine Ahnung  wieso ich so lange gebraucht habe  bis auch ich die Bucher fur mich entdeckt habe  doch ich bin sehr froh drum  dass es endlich so weit gekommen ist  auch wenn ich es im Nachhinein schade finde  dass ich sie nicht bereits als Kind gelesen habe  Es ist einfach beeindruckend  was fur eine Welt Joanne K  Rowling dort erschaffen hat  So voller wundervoller und interessanter Dinge  voller Magie  verruckter mystischer Kreaturen und mutiger Helden  Der Schreibstil der Autorin ist ebenso magisch  wie die Welt  die sie erschaffen hat  Kindgerecht und doch so  dass auch ein Erwachsener Spass am Lesen hat  Die Dialoge sind dem Alter der Charaktere angepasst und man merkt wahnsinnig gut  wie sich die einzelnen Charaktere weiter entwickeln  aus ihren Fehlern lernen und uber sich hinaus wachsen  Es macht unglaublich viel Spass  Harry  Ron und Hermine auf ihrer Reise zu begleiten  Ich finde es einfach so beeindruckend  wie viel Liebe und Idee Joanne K  Rowling in diese Bucher gesteckt hat  So viel Faszination  die zwischen diesen Seiten steckt  Nicht nur in Bezug auf diese ganze magische Welt  die sie erschaffen hat  auch in Bezug auf die verschiedenen Charaktere  die so wunderbar speziell und einzigartig sind und naturlich auch in Bezug auf die mystischen Kreaturen und die vielen Zauberspruche  Die Idee einer Zauberschule ist vielleicht nicht neu  doch Joanne K  Rowling hat es geschafft  das alles so wundervoll zu verpacken  sodass es einem tatsachlich vorkommt  als ware es etwas ganz Neues  etwas vorher noch nie zuvor dagewesenes  Auch diese ganzen Verbindungen zwischen den einzelnen Charakteren  zwischen den Geschichten und Geschehnissen ist so wahnsinnig gut durchdacht  so perfekt umgesetzt  Sie hat nicht nur eine neue Welt erschaffen  sondern gefuhlte hundert neue Leben  Ich kann gar nicht wirklich zum Ausdruck bringen  wie beeindruckt ich davon bin  was sie erschaffen hat  Ich bringe ihr jeden erdenklichen Respekt entgegen  denn das  was sie geschafft hat  ist etwas ganz besonderes und wahrscheinlich etwas  wovon jeder Autor traumt  Sie hat wahrlich ein Meisterwerk erschaffen und wird nur zu Recht Bestsellerautorin genannt  Ich will hier jetzt nicht zu sehr in die Geschichte abschweifen  jeder kennt die Bucher  Wenn nicht die Bucher  dann die Filme  oder zumindest weiss man  wer Harry Potter ist und worum es in dieser Geschichte geht  Ich mochte mit dieser Rezension einfach nur zum Ausdruck bringen  wie beeindruckt ich bin  wie  geflasht  von dieser fantastischen Geschichte  die aus den Feder einer Frau stammt  die vor ihrem grossen Erfolg niemand anderes war  als eine ganz normale Frau  die einfach Spass daran hatte  Geschichten zu schreiben  Auch die Aufmachung der neuen Bloomsbury Auflage ist einfach wundervoll  Nicht nur das Cover   wie ich bereits erwahnt habe   ist unglaublich schon  sondern auch die Gestaltung der Seiten ist einfach so toll  dass es sich auch schon lohnt das Buch zu kaufen  nur um es sich anzusehen und im Regal stehen zu haben  Eine absolute Schonheit unter den Buchern  Ich bin absolut verliebt Sollte es tatsachlich noch mehr Leute wie mich geben   Leute  die sich weigern Harry Potter zu lesen oder die sich einfach nicht dafur interessieren   bitte  tut es  Gebt euch einen Ruck  kauft euch diese Bucher und lest sie  Ich habe lange gebraucht  doch nach vielen Jahren auch endlich zu dieser magischen Welt gefunden und bereits jetzt wunsche ich mir  sie ware echt  Ich glaube hier muss nicht viel mehr gesagt werden   jeder weiss  wie grossartig diese Bucher sind   So  the first book of the great series  I always loved the films  and wanted to read the whole series  So  here I am  completed the series a year ago  I have to say that  books are always better than films  but this is not like that  Both books and movies are excellent  And the actor choices are good too  as a person who saw the film before book  i imagined Harry as the film Harry and others  and i don t regret anything  So  about book   The book started a bit slow but it became very interesting and facinating    I loved the world Juan Rowling created for us   I just wanted to go to Hogwarts   I loved the school and studying   And the whole exciting things happen there    Harry  cute  brave and loyal character    I loved his curiousness and courage because his way of getting into dangerous things and troubles are too much for a 11 year old boy    Hermione  BEST female character of all books in the world  Her cleverness  courage  loyality and a little bit bossy style are perfect for me  I adore her character   Ron  his funny side and originality makes me love his character too   Neville  I feel something in him    He will be great person  just wait other books   Pros  Interesting  unique  and exciting plot  characters   Cons  NO cons for this book  This isn t a typical review because it s more of a personal response to Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone I read this book for the first time after I watched the movie when it first came out  I read this book for a second time with my son and as a way to help him with reading I bought two copies  I would read ahead and find all the sections that Harry would talk and highlight it in his copy  My son wanted to read only what Harry is thinking and saying  while for me to have the task of reading the rest while he followed along  Encouraging him to read while enjoying the process of it was my major goal  It worked and this book means a lot to us and perhaps it s because all the nostalgia involved  Actually  I m pretty positive it s from all the nostalgia  Rowling did a wonderful job in building the wizarding world  I was impressed at the time and I m still impressed reading this for the third time  It s a great book and a great series  Learning about all the new ideas and elements in this world  This is a book series that has made wonderful memories for my family  Whenever I say the words Harry Potter  almost all of the people around me will burst out and start excitedly chatting about their favourite character or a gruesome monster or that epic moment  However  there is always at least one person who stands there in silence  They haven t read the books  They haven t watched the films  It s practically a sin to admit it in public  But why  Why is the series seen as such a crucial read  Why are those who haven t read the series instantly shunned or questioned  The majority of the people who haven t read Harry Potter are those who aren t actually big on reading  They d much rather play a game or listen to music and this isn t there fault  It is personal preference and these people shouldn t be shouted at just because they haven t read this series which half of the world is talking about  But the minority of the people who haven t read Harry Potter are big on reading  They d much rather read a book than play a game  but they just haven t read Harry Potter  I have a friend who is in this boat and I know what her reasons are  This might not be your reason but it is a reason   Fear  That s it  The seven book series is scary to embark on  To start reading the first book is to start a journey through the following six and that thought terrifies some people  But what I m trying to say is  don t be scared  Don t be afraid of reading the books  Yes there are seven books but if you re a reader  you probably read seven books in a month  If you re not a reader then this might take you half a year  Great  You re reading them at your own pace and not getting bogged down about the next six books that you have to read  Don t be scared on embarking on a journey that might take a couple of months  Some people grew up with these books  They were the ones waiting every year for the sequel to come out  I wasn t but I was close   The Harry Potter series is a adventure and a fantasy series set in a magical boarding school called Hogwarts  Harry Potter  our leading man  is a young wizard with a mysterious past  he is responsible for the disappearance of the most evil wizard of all time  Voldemort  when he was just a baby  However now  eleven years later  Voldemort is gaining support and his presence could destroy both the wizarding and the ordinary world  imagesVXPP858O At first the page count for the series looks scary  The first three books get increasingly longer and then  BAM  the page count jumps to over 600  But  take thing slowly  The first book is the shortest in the series and a perfect introduction into the series  With no complicated plot or millions of new characters  it eases you in slowly  From then on  the adventures get increasingly more dangerous and dark  The first book is classified by some people to be a  children s  book but by book seven it s unashamedly young adult  JK Rowling s writing style is simple but at the same time lyrical and engaging  She is a master at writing dialogue and creating individual  remember able characters  She manages to weave in humour   actual belly laughs   and equally dark moments   And the films are brilliant  Daniel Radcliffe portrays Harry to perfection  With a star studded cast  Dame Maggie Smith  David Tennant  Gary Oldman  Emma Thompson  Warwick Davis  Helena Bonham Carter and Robbie Coltrane  the films are perfect adaptations of the books  The script writing is humorous and engaging and the special effects create an enthralling atmosphere that is amazing to watch   Please  I m begging you now  Even if you aren t much of a book person  take your time and read the books that inspired the movies that are slowly becoming modern classics of this generation   The Series  How to write a Harry Potter review that conveys exactly what I feel for this series  There s nothing I can say that s not going to sound like a cliche because it s been said a billion times before   This series was my childhood   Correct  My mom gave me HP TPS for my 9th birthday  Thank you Mom    and that was that  This was the series that made me discover I loved to read  This was the series that taught me what a Book Hangover meant  This was the series for which I queued at my local library on each new release date to get it the moment it became available  This was the series that taught me how annoying people can be when they just don t get that they should refrain for talking to you or wanting you to acknowledge their existence when YOU ARE BUSY READING ABOUT THE ONLY PEOPLE YOU CARE ABOUT AT THIS TIME  This was the first series that  upon finishing it  made me think  there s never going to be anything as amazing as this EVER again   And that s true  There will never be another Harry Potter  This doesn t mean there aren t going to be books just as incredible and absorbing and awe worthy and cry worthy and  please let those characters be my BFFs  worthy  because there already are  The Harry Potter books aren t the most original or best written books of all time  BUT I m never going to be 9 years old again and no other series will ever be MY FIRST beloved series and I will never again experience my childhood and grow older along my favorite heroes heroines  Harry Potter will remain forever my childhood favorite  my first  the one with a unique place in my heart until I m old enough that I can read no longer and need to have it read to me  Harry Potter and The Philosopher s Stone  Re reading this book as a new adult was a very different experience from reading it as a child  I found myself being skeptical at some points  which made me really sad  but I guess we can t all be naive Peter Pan s forever  and immersing myself completely in the magic and wonder only the very young experience fully at some other points  Yey  I guess adults can keep a bit of innocence after all   It makes me sad to think of people who missed on reading it as kids  though it s never too late to start It s amazing to me how much forethought there is even in this first novel for later books  view spoiler  Mention of Sirius lending his bike to Hagrid  Hagrid s expulsion from Hogwarts  why You Know Who s curse didn t work on Harry  etc   hide spoiler    You can tell that J K  Rowling planned everything out carefully and that s one of the many reasons why this series is amazing  From book one there are already clues and hints and threads of different story lines and all of them will make sense at one point or another  Also  during this re read I found myself  hearing  the characters  voices as those of their respective actors actresses from the movies  I couldn t help it and I m ok with it  The Harry Potter franchise was lucky to have the best most faithful to the books cast ever  The only character that is  for me  fundamentally different in the movies is Dumbledore  Richard Harris and Michael Gambon both made outstanding jobs bringing Dumbledore to life  but the scripts were tweaked in ways which ended up making Dumbledore a lot less sassier  plus maybe a bit less nutty sounding   and more serious foreboding than in the books  which wasn t a bad thing for a screen format  My reviews of other books in the series Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets  Book 2 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban  Book 3 Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire  Book 4 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix  Book 5 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince  Book 6 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows  Book 7    Finished reading  September 3rd 2014   The truth   Dumbledore sighed   It is a beautiful and terrible thing  and should therefore be treated with great caution    view spoiler  I ve long lost track of the times I have read this first book of the Harry Potter Series  I still remember getting a copy as soon as the Dutch version came out when I was nine    I have devoured Harry Potter And The Philosopher s Stone probably at least a dozen times since then in three different languages  and I just cannot get enough of it  Every time I pick up this book  it transforms me back into the nine year old kid than first experienced the magical world of Hogwarts and its witches and wizards  I remember wishing I could go to a school like Hogwarts myself and learn how to use magic    Hermione was like a role model to me when I was growing up  and these books have definitely left their mark on my childhood  Books and cleverness indeed Poor little Harry Potter is forced to live a miserable life with his absurdly normal Muggle aunt and uncle after his parents die  Harry s only living relatives fear anything not normal and they keep the fact Harry is in fact a very special and famous boy a secret  But secrets are not made to be kept forever  Just before his eleventh birthday  someone tries to contact Harry with a message that will change his life forever  His uncle tries to stop it at all costs  but with the help of Hagrid he finally learns the truth about the past anyway  Harry is in fact a very famous wizard  The boy with the strange lightning scar has been invited to attend the Hogwarts School Of Witchcraft And Wizardry to learn all about magic  His aunt and uncle are against it  but Hagrid takes him along anyway  Soon the magical world starts to show its secrets to Harry   Harry meets his now famous side kicks Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger at the Hogwarts Express that takes them straight to Hogwarts  Ron and Harry hit off straight away  and this friendship grows only stronger when they get sorted into the same house named Gryffindor  Harry feels at home for the first time in his life  although he does have a tendency to get into trouble a lot  Unfortunately  that isn t the only thing that he has to worry about  as something dark is about to happen at Hogwarts  Something that involves the Dark Wizard that attacked and killed his parents when he was little    A wizard so dangerous people fear even speaking of his name  Lord Voldemort  You Know Who needs something that is currently hidden at Hogwarts  and it seems that he has the help of one of the teachers in retrieving it    Will Harry and his friends be able to stop them in time Harry Potter And The Philosopher s Stone without doubt deserves the full five stars  It brings back great memories and J K  Rowling is simply a genius creating such a rich world full of magic with a limited amount of words and pages  An incredible children story I would definitely make my future kids read   hide spoiler   P S  Find more of my reviews here   Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone is the first book in the series about a very brave young wizard Harry Potter who  as a little boy  survived a terrible curse  After living as a  normal  boy for 10 years he is now starting his life as a wizard and his adventures are only at the beginning  Instead of making a long synopsis for a story that is already well known and loved around the world I will just write how it makes me feel  Well  I adore Harry Potter  Simple as that  This is my second time reading the story  the first was when I was a kid   more than 10 years ago  and I find that I love and appreciate it even more than before  The story is full of meaningful life lessons about love  friendship  loyalty  bravery  determination  good and evil and basically all the worthwhile sentiments a human being can feel and experience  As a child  reading this  you might be drawn to the magical world that is so different from ours and so exciting but you will also inadvertently learn the lessons the story gives  As an adult you will also be drawn by the magical world  because  let s face it  it s gorgeous  because it will take you back to your childhood days when everything was magical and interesting but you will recognize the lessons on your own  being much more versed in life than a child   Either way  this story and it s sequels are a must read for every child and adult  You just might start seing our world through different  more magical  eyes and see that magic actually is all around us  All we have to do is   look  To me if you were allowed to rate only one book series with a 6 on goodreads  it would be without a doubt for Harry Potter  Harry  Ron and Hermione are three very interesting characters  deep and complex in a positive way  Each of them has their dark and bright sides  And this is the same for every secondary character  I can t pick one single character that I absolutely hate  except Lucius Malfoy and Crabbe and Doyle I guess but they are here to be hated  not developed enough to have an ounce of light shown  Every review will contain some opinion about the movies also  because all of them are perfectly and faithfully realized I read this book around 15 times between the age of 10 and the age of 22 so I guess my advice now can be pretty impartial because it isn t only related to one part of my childhood  I remember buying on august 2000 a set gathering the 3 first books  I took me a couple month to get over the first chapter which were kind of hard for me  because it was my first  grown up  book and I didn t get the point at first  And then  at the second Harry meet Hagrid  I ve been madly in love with this series  This first book is action packed  and at the time I thought it was dark  but it was mainly because I haven t had read the other yet  The best part of course is the end  when they go get the philosopher stone and have to go through all of the teacher s traps  Just PURE MAGIC  I m not sure how many times I have read this book  but it never gets old  There is always some new detail that I find and the joy of revisiting a wonderful book  This is the mark of a classic   it grows with you  What starts as an entertaining story reveals a labyrinth of depth as you move along In Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone  Rowling created a masterful world full of magic  wonder  and adventure  Harry Potter is probably one of the most beloved characters in literary history  and it is not hard to see why  He is the ultimate underdog  but that doesn t make him weak  Like the Sorting Hat says  he has  a thirst to prove himself   The other characters in the book are also brilliantly 3D  From the ones with the smallest rolls to the stalwart cohorts and sinister villains  they all wrap you up in their stories and pull you into their world  And that world is richly and profoundly described Another aspect I really enjoy is that Rowling expertly keeps her own  voice  out of the writing  So many times when reading  I notice cracks and holes where the writer s real thoughts and opinions seep through  I get distracted because I can picture them trying to find the right words  trying to figure out what happens next    and it inescapably evicts me from the story  But not so with this book  The story arcs along beautifully until at last the strokes and threads come together in a seemingly effortless way  Many people have told me to read Harry Potter   the first was in 2005  while I was doing my M A   the last was earlier this week  I ve signed up to read a longs of the series before   but was never able to find the time to read it  Part of me was worried that I d hate it  but now  17 years after the first novel was released  I m actually going to do it  Thank you everyone whoever told me I should read this series  whether I showed no interest in it or told you that I was planning to at some point  you have somehow been a part of making me pick up J K  Rowling s books  and now I can honestly say that I loved the first novel  Truthfully  it started out a little slow  Maybe that has more to do with the fact that I was in a not really sure what I want to read next mood  then the story itself though because the Dursleys where very entertaining  especially Dudley  who may very well be one of the stupidest characters in the history of literature   children s or otherwise  They seemed completely ridiculous  but I guess that is what happens when you spend your entire life living in fear of those  abnormal  Potters and their wizarding ways  There are a lot of other things to love about this novel  I found it interesting that Hermione was initially represented  through Harry s perspective  as being an annoying know it all  but who is clearly just a strong  intelligent  and hard working young girl  Most likely him and Ron just felt inadequate when they realized that she d read and memorized so much of the work they had to know for their first year at Hogwarts because once they see that Hermione is willing to put herself out there to save them from trouble  they stop mocking her and instead  consider her a friend  I also love Hagrid s accent  It s the kind of language that demands to be read aloud  and no wonder because  as a children s book  many of the first readings may be with a mother of father reading to their children  I found myself reading some of his lines aloud just to hear it for myself  That said  I m saving a declaration of my favourite character till I ve read more of the novels  I found that some of the characters seemed rather one dimensional  few secondary character  sure  but they were there   but I think that they will grow and develop more as the series progresses  As it was  the characters who were more frequently featured have already shown themselves to be more than they initially seem to be  I also was surprised   in a good way   about the number and variety of magical creatures and species that are already represented  or at least mentioned  in the novel  Beyond things already mentioned  I liked the writing  Yes  it s simple in this book to some extent as it was written for middle graders  but there are some very profound moments and beautiful turns of phrase in this series  I particularly like this quotation from Dumbledore to Harry   The truth  It is a beautiful and terrible thing  and should therefore be treated with great caution   Moreover  so many of the pages are a reflection of things that set Harry apart  and not only because he is  the boy who lived   but also because unlike most of his classmates  he was orphaned early on in life  Time and again  we come to understand just how much of Harry s being is wrapped up in his desire to know more about his parents and other family members beyond the horrendous Dursleys  Anyone who has known loss   whether of their parents  grandparents  aunts  uncles  siblings  friends  etc    or experienced a lack of a particular family member  who died before they were born or could possibly remember them  will understand the type of longing that Harry feels  I  for one  know that feeling  and I m certain that when young readers need to take comfort from this issue at this stage in the series  they will see it  feel it  and feel less along because of it  But for those who haven t experienced loss yet  Rowling doesn t present this loss and longing in a way that will destroy the innocence of the child reader  Yes  this is my first time reading Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone  or Sorcerer s Stone to Americans   Be free to feel jealous      This last week has signaled a milestone achievement for me Before this week  I have never read a Harry Potter nor watched a Harry Potter I read my very first pages of the books on July 31st  and it was later on that I found out it was Harry Potter s birthday I knew nothing of Hogwarts except that it says on many people s Facebook profiles that they went to that school  It must be really something I knew more  however  about the four houses  you get into one when a talking hat sits on your brains I used to get Dumbledore and Voldemort mixed up and I didn t know who was the good guy and who was the bad one I was embarrassment So I plucked up some courage  took what s left in my dignity  paid a visit to the bookstore and just bought the whole book set with the new 15th anniversary amazingly beautiful sight for my so sore eyes cover editions and went home looking very very pleased with myself Okay  back to the review now  While I thought this book is wonderful  I had that thing that kept bugging me at the beginning of the story  how fast Harry just caved in and bought into the whole wizard magic business  Not only did he not question the whole thing  he also never acted surprised at all Now I do realize that he d witnessed magic soon enough  but  regardless  it kinda went like this  Hagrid   You re a wizard  Harry  Harry   Really  Do wizards really exist  Hagrid   Yep  Harry   Okay  cool  The events that followed just flowed smoothly and I was immediately sucked into this marvelous  astonishing breathtaking world And I was hooked With almost every  Single  Thing From platform 9 3 4  to the magical Hogwarts  From Nimbus two thousand  to the Quidditch matches  the flying brooms and the snitch  From Peeves and nearly headless Neck  to Firenze the centaur  From Fluffy the three headed dog  to Norbert the Norwegian Ridgeback  From Wingardium Leviosa to Locomotor Mortis  From Ron  Seamus and Naville to Hermione Granger God  I love Hermione  Which is a weird thing to say considering I m 21 and she was 11 in this book  but meh All in all it was such a beautiful magical ride 4 75 stars  The first installment in the well known series that follows the adventures of boy wizard Harry Potter  THE SORCERER S STONE weaves a story that s both magical and heartwarming  Living with his aunt  uncle  and cousin  Harry grows up believing he is alone in the world and no more special than the throw rugs his adoptive family walks on  But on his eleventh birthday  everything changes  Harry discovers that he s a wizard like his parents  and he s invited to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry by headmaster Albus Dumbledore  Upon meeting some new friends  Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger  on the train to Hogwarts  Harry is shocked to learn that he isn t just any wizard  Harry is actually one of the most famous figures in wizarding history  the only person to ever survive the wrath of the evil wizard Lord Voldemort  Once at Hogwarts  Harry works on navigating his new magical world and mastering the rules of Quiddich  a popular wizard sport  but trouble is brewing  Lord Voldemort has long been presumed dead  yet someone

J K  Rowling s most beloved characters  including the kind hearted Hogwarts groundkeeper  Hagrid  Ron s mischievous older brothers  Fred and George Weasley  and the mysteriously sinister Professor Severus Snape  While the series was originally written for children  teenagers and adults alike will enjoy immersing themselves in the books  THE SORCERER S STONE is a must read for anyone who has yet to join Harry and his friends in their adventures  Harry Potter  The Chosen One  The Boy Who Lived  The boy who changed my life in one book series  This book is the beginning of the journey you can never take back  A journey that will no doubt transform your view of magic forever  Harry Potter with his famous lightening bolt scar  unkempt mop of black hair  bright emerald green eyes and round  quite breakable  glasses is easy to identify and even easier with his English accent  He is the main focus of this story and  sadly  does not begin as much of a hero  He lives with his Aunt Petunia  the stuffiest woman you ll ever meet   Uncle Vernon  large  VERY large  and annoyingly strong   an his cousin Dudley  fat  not very bright  and of course very popular  a suck up to his mum   Harry is known as the scrawny  nerdy freak and is basically treated as a servant  serving his family and being forced to live in the cupboard underneath the stairs  No one likes him  mostly because of Dudley and his intimidating bunch of friends  Thankfully  Harry has the cleverness to know how to escape his cousins clutches and he does not wind up in a toilet everyday  But he s noticed strange things  Every time he mentions something out if the ordinary  his aunt and uncle act oddly defensive and determined to change the subject  He s done very queer things in the past  including jumping all the way onto the school roof to escape from Dudley and his gang   His suspicions increase when he receives a letter  which Uncle Vernon quickly disposes of  and then another and another  all in the same type of parchment and lettering  Who would want to contact him this badly  Well  I ve said too much  You ll have to read the book to find out     Trust me you will not regret it  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone by J K  RowlingFirst in the Harry Potter series5 starsHarry Potter is a normal ten year old boy going on eleven  At least as normal as you can be living with the Dursleys  His room is a cupboard  he s ignored  and he hardly eats  One day something happens  Something Harry can t explain  Soon owls begin to arrive and Uncle Vernon goes insane Then Harry learns he s a wizard and it s off to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry he goes  As he makes friends and finally starts to belong  he learns who he really is  what happened to his parents  and that not everything is safe at Hogwarts  I have a confession to make  I have never read the Harry Potter series before this  I m sixteen years old  Edit  I wrote this review a whole year ago and forgot to post it  I m now 17   and finally reading Harry Potter  You wouldn t believe the weird looks some kids would give me when they saw me reading The Sorcerer s Stone  Harry Potter is a kids novel  but it doesn t feel like it  I LOVE this series  I read this book in five days  which doesn t seem like much  but when it s the end of the school year and summer s approaching reading doesn t occur much  But this book grabbed me and didn t let go  I m so happy I finally decided to read this magical series  It s a treat  Bloody brilliant  I ve never been so nostalgic about reading a series before  I love the movies to bits and it s weird to see the differences  but it s so cool  For me  The Sorcerer s Stone was a great opening novel  It opens with the third person POV of the day that Harry arrives on the Dursley s doorstep  I loved it  When I started this I was sitting in Geometry class bored out of mind because I understood the lesson and was tiring of hearing it repeated for the umpteenth time  but once I started this novel I forgot I was even in Geometry  Rowling writes in a way that transported me into the novel  I was there when witches and wizards were celebrating the fall of Voldemort and when Harry found out he was wizard  I was there at Hogwarts  I met Fred and George and Ron the same time Harry did  I saw friendships start and magic form  My mind was at home  Hogwarts became my home  I have a special place in my heart for this book  It was the start to a world I don t want to leave  I want to be a part of Hogwarts forever  I know when I open up this novel again years from now  I will be Whimsical Writing Scale  5The main male character is Harry  Harry Potter I quite love Harry s character  He s sarcastic and he just makes entering Hogwarts a treat  It s amazing to see him grow from a boy who isn t sure at the beginning of this novel into a boy who knows he s a wizard Swoon Wizard Worthy Scale  4I love Hermoine and Ron  but for different reasons in this one  I love Hermoine because I connect with her  I am Hermoine Granger  but I don t love nonfiction nearly as much as her  I love Ron because he s Harry s best friend  He s a good friend to Harry  There is one drawback to Ron though  He s a jerk to Hermoine  It really makes me dislike him  Fred and George are just hilarious  This series wouldn t be the same without them  Draco Malfoy may be a jerk  but he also happens to be my favorite jerk Character Scale  5The Villain  I remember the first time I watch this movie I was about to start kindergarten and when I saw what lay under that iconic turban I ran  My small child mind was horrified  The next day  I watched the movie entirely without running and fell in love  Of course  I think this villain is pretty creepy Villain Scale  4 75Hogwarts is my home and I wouldn t have it any other way  After reading this series I know that I am a witch  I have gone to Hogwarts and I have fought battles alongside Harry  Whether it was the Dursleys  Voldemort  or friendship quarrels  I was there through it all Plotastic Scale  5Cover Thoughts  I love the cover  It s so beautifully illustrated and it s beautiful  Not my favorite of my box set collection  but it s beautiful  Harry potter es un nino que queda huerfano  El vive con sus tios y su odioso primo en un pueblito de Londres  los cuales lo maltratan  lo tratan como si fuera su sirviente o pretenden que no existe  Harry no tiene ningun amigo  hasta que un dia recibe una carta que le cambiaria la vida  En esta  le comunican que ha sido aceptado en una escuela de magia y hechiceria  En esta escuela aprende trucos  encantamientos y hace muchisimos amigos como tambien enemigos   Me encanta la forma de narrar que tiene J K Rowling  lo hace de una forma tan simpatica que se nota que en un principio el libro estaba destinado a un publico infantil  Los personajes se hacen inconfundibles  Principalmente Albus  uno de los magos mas poderosos de todos desde el principio podes imaginarlo con su gran barba blanca  y ademas tiene un gran sentido de comprencion hacia los alumnos  Ron el pequeno pelirrojo y simpatico  y la lista de Harmione  que al comienzo se podia llegar a pensar que no me agradaria tanto como los otros personajes  pero mientras la historia avanza se ha vuelto una de mis favoritas  Tambien  tenemos a Voldemort  el villano  el enemigo de Harry  Son muchisimos los personajes que quedan en la memoria  desde los profesores hasta los fantasmas que viven en el castillo de Hogwarts Al final del libro quedan demasiadas dudas sobre el pasado de Harry  aunque estas dudas se resuelven en los proximos libros  Este libro me deja muchos recuerdos de mi ninez    Es un libro magico y lleno de aventuras   qSty m  hry bwtr bdt bmshhd  slsl  flmh wlty shhdth klh kthr mn

Harry Potter series Now  calm down there Ron  its taken me what   10 years  Oh my god  I just realized I ve had this sitting on a shelf for TEN YEARS  Hold on   mild panic attack   where does the time go    Ok  I m good  Nothing like thinking back on when you bought a book with the intention of reading it only to realize its been a freakin  decade     deepbreathsinoutinout  For reals this time  I m fine There s not much to say that hasn t already been said about this book and this series  The world has fallen in lurve with these characters and I can finally begin to truly appreciate why  It s one thing to see them in movies  its quite another to have Harry  Ron  Hermione  and so many others pop off of the pages of a book If I were to sum up my feelings into one word it would have to be Now I must promise to not allow another ten years to pass before I read the next  If I do  by the time I finish the series I ll be    cough  never mind   I love this book so much more now than I did when I was younger  I am finding so much more depth to the story  J K  Rowling is brilliant I also noticed something very interesting that had gone over my head every other time I read this    Firenze saved me  but he shouldn t have done so    Bane was furious    he was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going to happen    They must show that Voldemort s coming back    Bane thinks Firenze should have let Voldemort kill me    I suppose that s written in the stars as well   ch  15  260  Update  Still love the book  Big surprise     I read through this time picturing Harry Potter as a female identifying person  which required me to mentally switch a lot of hes and hims with shes and hers  Weird realization  The story itself doesn t change an ounce  Seriously  It doesn t  It s still great  it s still funny  it s still Harry Potter  Harry Potter is just a girl and not a boy  What I wouldn t give for a copy of the series that would allow me to read Harry as female without having to mentally change the words on the page  P S  Terribly sad that Alan Rickman is gone  He will always be the perfect Severus Snape   How can you not love Harry Potter  I didn t read any of them til last year  I d already seen 4 of the movies  but I could NOT put down the books until I finished all 7    they are excellent  I actually had lots of fun finishing off each book by watching the corresponding movie as I went    it s amazing what I picked up on in the movies that I hadn t noticed before  If you like the movies I would HIGHLY recommend reading the books  As always  the books are better than the movies    but they are amazing as well So  if by some chance  you haven t seen the movies    here s what they are about Harry Potter is a young orphan  does he start off as 11 in the first book  I forget  who has been told all his life that his parents were killed in a car accident and he was the sole survivor  Well  turns out that he s been in the dark  and there is actually an entire  Wizard world  that is kept hidden from  muggles   people with no magical powers   When Harry was a baby an evil wizard killed his parents  and tried to kill Harry  but he survived    and he has the scar to prove it  And in turn  the wizard was destroyed  or so everyone thought  So Harry is living with his awful  boring muggle Aunt and Uncle  but one day gets an acceptance letter from Hogwarts    a school for Wizards and Witches  and then the story takes off  I ve never read a series that is such fun  the author has an amazing imagination  You get to meet all kinds of interesting characters and creatures  and watch the Hogwarts kids grow up  and become great Wizards and Witches themselves  Every single book in this series is a page turner  I highly recommend Harry Potter to everyone   About once every year or two  I tend to get the urge re read the Harry Potter series  and not just because Harry Potter is my all time favorite protagonist  but because J K  Rowling creates a universe that is so rich  so inviting that I find myself missing everything about the magical world she built  The characters are so rich and layered   you can t help but feel for them    And I figured my review could also do with an update as well  since its over 4 years old and kinda lame Harry Potter   the Philosopher s Stone  I refuse to refer to it as the Sorcerer s Stone  is the first book in the series and it is like no other book I have every read  Rowling has a gift of  painting a word picture  for her readers so you can virtually feel as though you ve stepped into this new magical world right alongside with Harry  the ordinary  plain old Harry Potter  who didn t think there was anything special or different about him but that lightening shaped scar on his forehead  until the giant Hagrid comes barging in talking about wizards  and Hogwarts  and revelations about how Harry s parents really died  Harry Potter is a wizard  and he has been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft   Wizardry  In the blink of an eye his whole world has been turned upside down  and for the better at that  The reader gets to follow Harry on a magical journey filled with trolls and unicorns and centaurs   not to mention secrets  and danger   especially where Harry is concerned  This book really makes you feel like you re at Hogwarts  tagging along with Harry on all of his adventures  And I love knowing how Harry thinks  how he figures things out  what makes him tick  You can t not have faith in Harry because his heart  mostly always leads him in the right path The best part about re reading the Harry Potter series is catching all the little hints and clues that J K  Rowling had already started setting up  laying the groundwork of so many pivotal plot twists in small bits and pieces here and there  The long discussion at the end of the book between Harry   Dumbledore is so telling  view spoiler  especially what Dumbledore refuses to divulge at the moment  Why Voldemort tried to kill Harry  Ahhh such a loaded question and one not fully appreciated in hindsight    I also enjoy seeing how quickly and almost unconsciously Harry steps up  refusing to let anyone help Voldemort get the Philosopher s Stone  Already he realizes that he who must not be named must be stopped   at all costs   hide spoiler   An fantastic start to a phenominal series  I want to start 2012 reading Harry Potter because it s the first year without it  I admit  I m a Potterhead or whatever you call it  I got this book last December 2010 and being a bookworm  I m finished with it in a short period of time  I still remember  I was patiently waiting for my Hogwarts Acceptance letter even though my 11th birthday has passed by  It was silly but who ll refuse to entertain the thought of attending a school for witches and wizards This book is a spectacular little romp with funny  courageous  and endearing characters that you can t help but love  Hermione  the young scholar who starts out prim and up tight but soon becomes a true friend  Ron  the boy who has little money but who has an abundance of family and loyalty to his friends to make up for it  and then there s Harry  the boy who starts out sleeping in a closet and ends up being a hero  Harry is kind to those that deserve it  fearless when it counts the most  and wonderfully intelligent  So what s not to love I don t get it why some people say Harry Potter is evil  I mean  it does encourage me to become a witch  But we all know it s not going to happen  In my imagination    maybe  But trust me  there is nothing wrong with Harry Potter  None at all All in all  J K  Rowling has the talent I don t want to give away too much  Read it for yourself  it s one of my favorite books ever Now  if you ll excuse me  I m off to start Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets PS  Those who think the topic of Harry Potter or Twilight is worth arguing over  are and is utterly stupid  I mean  they both have different concept  for Pete s sake Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s StoneJ K  Rowling Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone What can I say  I m speechless  This book is just brillant and promises a great series  Though it may not probably be the best book in the series  it s good enough because there are so many things to watch out for  Though I agree that there are still many things left unquestioned  well there s still 6 books to cover those And yes  Harry still isn t that clever guy we come to love  He s still too innocent  but he s still young right  Still have a long way to go and to learn  But definitly love how J K Rowling came up with this  The first book is still joyful and happy  not much action and not much things going on but there is still excitment And I just love how J K Rowling came up with all these amazing stuff  They may seem childish  but they re awesome  Like the Mirror of Erised  which is inverted from the word desire  And Quiditch  Hahahaha  There s just so many things to love  and enjoy the first few books while things aren t that dark       So  here s the thing  This series changed my life  Harry taught me that the underdogs aren t always forgotten and that sometimes we win  I was taught that love conquers all and that friendship is oftentimes more important than anything else in life  J K  Rowling was my very childhood and she taught me so many different things through the telling of Harry s journey  I will always always be grateful for that  To properly rate and critique this series doesn t work for me because I cannot find negatives in any of the books that pen Harry s tale  I really can t  Many have said that there are better writers and that JKR s writing is  at best  mediocre  Maybe that s true  but for someone who lived in a world of magic and moving staircases  amidst math homework and elementary school bullies  I have to vehemently disagree  There will never be a better series or a better author for me  So  now I will list all of the things that I loved about this book in particular Dumbledore  He s at the top of my list  He always will be  He s always been my favorite character because he s just this hero who is humble and scarred and carries such sorrow and regret  but he loves Harry so deeply and he s charming and has a sense of humor and all I want to do is buy him socks  Lots and lots of wool socks  I love that this is the beginning of Harry s journey  that you can see the friendship between Harry  Ron  and Hermione start  I love the slack jawed wonder that Harry experiences in Diagon Alley because that s how I feel every single time I reread this book  I love the whimsy and the magic saturating the pages  I love the antagonists  I love Snape  Severus Snape will always be a favorite for me  too  I remember my journey I took with his character the first time and the emotions I felt toward him  He s beautiful and flawed and perfect in my eyes I love JKR s writing  I love her ability to tell this story  I love her emotions and heartache that bleeds into The Sorcerer s Stone  I love that this book starts it all  The journey for everyone  But  mostly  I love that this book in particular introduces to me  over and over again  the characters that I love so much  characters that I grew up with  I love Hermione s cleverness  and Ron s short temper  I love Neville s bravery  and Hagrid s innocent loyalty to those he loves  I love McGonagall s heart  and the Weasley twin s wit  The moving staircases and the Chocolate Frogs  Quidditch and good  old fashioned rivalry  I could make lists and lists of every way that J K  Rowling has impacted my life with this book alone  but I won t  Here s how I ll end this  If you ve never read this story  I beg of you that you do  It will change your life  just like it s changed mine and millions and millions of other lives  There s magic in the lives of Muggles because of J K  Rowling and I will always be in debt to her because of it  Mr  and Mrs  Dursley  of number four  Privet Drive  were proud to say that they were perfectly normal  thank you very much  They were the last people you d expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious   I can never fully express to you how deeply I regret not embarking on this series sooner  I m so late  Now the movies are over and its less likely I can parade my enthusiasm and the sheer joy I got from reading this  From the first chapter alone  it became increasingly obvious as to how J K  Rowling ended up a millionaire  or is bigillionaire       I d always been a BIG fan of the movies  but I didn t read the books based on my pre Reading Obsession years when I didn t very much enjoy them  I realized  though  that at the time  I didn t have it in me to appreciate this series  Now  I do  Boy  do I  This book incites the fan girl  or boy  in you Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone is full of magic and adventure  sparkling story telling  and is the embodiment of nearly every child s dream to run off to some foreign  magical place where excitement and danger is around every corner to chase off the boredom  What is so purely great about this first book  and I m sure the others as well  is the effortless world building that mirrors our own world in past and present spaces in our history  Nothing is over done and it s plain how deep Rowling s knowledge of the world runs  From wands and cauldrons to magical beasts to wizarding sports  The Sorcerer s Stone will fascinate you at every plot turn and through every character  It ensnares your attention and leaves you craving the next book I loved Harry  His book portrayal made me much more sensitive to his circumstances and feelings  Gosh  I can t tell you how many times this boy succeeded in making me cry  The cruelty of his care givers had me fuming and crying all at the same time  And the feeling of loss for his parents strikes you throughout the course of the movie series  but it hits much harder after reading the books  Growing up with the movies  the movie adapted characters stuck with me while I was reading  I saw Emma Watson when I read Hermione  and Radcliffe and Grint and so on  It honestly made me love the book that much more I appreciated the Big Mystery  and it was nice to go through the motions of unraveling it  because I had forgotten almost everything from the first movie  It was like starting fresh  and as I read the book I slowly began to recall what was going to happen  Strangely  that made it all the more exciting Perhaps it is because Harry Potter has been dear to my heart all this time  being apart of the Harry Potter generation  that the entire book captivated me from start to finish  but I can truly say  without bias  that The Sorcerer s Stone is an enthralling  unique  and astoundingly overwhelming read  I can promise that I was as bewitched as Harry when  together  we stumbled upon the wizarding world  and absolutely guarantee that my friends will be finding the Harry Potter books in my bag until I m done with the series Thought up by the lovely Small Review  Special Shelf books are unforgettable books that hold beautiful stories inside and characters you will forever be in love with     My Rating System In Depth  FRED  YOU NEXT   THE PLUMP WOMAN SAID  I M NOT FRED  I M GEORGE   SAID THE BY   HONESTLY  WOMAN  YOU CALL YOURSELF OUR MOTHER

WEASLEY TWINS YELLED   WE GOT POTTER  WE GOT POTTER    121 122  This is a great story and teaches some valuable lessons for children  or anyone for that matter I have read some criticisms of the Harry Potter series that I feel is unfounded  First  we need to remember that this is a series written primarily for children  and yet it continues to transcend the boundries of age and gender alike  Very few books have ever had the wide appeal of  Harry Potter  Perhaps it s not inspired prose  but it is descriptive and gets the message across  It borrows heavily from other works which many readers may not be familiar with  especially those of its target audience  I can imagine the delight of the original  Harry Potter  generation  of which my son is one  discovering the source of the imagery and symbolism in their journey through the rest of their reading lives  As in   Wow  so that s where she got that  I would certainly disagree with the reviewer who wrote that Harry Potter does not lead kids to read other books  that   kids who read Harry Potter only read Harry Potter   I am an elementary school librarian and I know that kids who read Harry Potter also read lots of other books  Big books  My son is a good example  Harry Potter helped turn him into a reader  I started out reading a chapter a night to him  That was going too slow for him so he began reading it for himself  and never looked back  He bought each book on the night it went on sale and read it through  I m not sure how many times he has read the series all the way through  He is an excellent reader  and we have Harry Potter to thank for it  I m not even sure how many times I ve read this book now but I still love it  It s one of my all time favorites and gets 5 stars    again  Every time I read Harry Potter  especially after the series unfolded more and more  I became amazed by the way that J K  Rowling not only created an entire world but filled it with incredible characters  wonderful scenery descriptions and delightful magic but that she was also able to so aptly address the good and evil of the world in not one but 7 novels  keeping all 7 books straight before they were even written  There are so many things in book one that aren t important until much later on in the series but are so much fun to discover now  It s not as fun as reading it for the first times but it s different and it s good  I m also enjoying watching the movies along with reading the books and picking out the differences along the way  Reading this book again was like meeting up with old friends that I haven t seen in a long time If you re one of the few people who haven t read this series yet    you really  really should    How Harry Potter Saved My LifeI will be forever grateful to J K  Rowling and her plucky  inspiring boy wizard for helping me and my two children survive the bleakest time in our lives  I credit Harry Potter for diverting us from the pain of an ugly divorce and for being the bond that held us together through a very difficult time  I would give anything to hug JKR and thank her for saving my family  Let me explain  My son  daughter and I were in an unpleasant rut after my husband left the family home and acrimonious divorce proceedings were underway  After a long school day  me as a teacher and the kids as students   our ride home was quite unpleasant  All three of us were tired and cranky  and the kids bickered constantly  Then one day  I had a brainstorm  I stopped by the library and picked up the first Harry Potter book on tape  I had heard so much about the books but avoided reading them because I was never a big fan of fantasy lit and I couldn t imagine enjoying a story about wizards and magic  Boy  did I have it wrong  When I popped in the tape  my car only had a cassette player at the time   a magical change took place in our car  The long  dreary rides flew by  and we found ourselves lingering in the driveway to see what would happen next  Listening together became the best part of our day Jim Dale s telling of the tale was simply mesmerizing  We marveled at all of the voices he developed and how well they fit the characters  I remembered seeing him on Broadway in a production of  Me and My Girl  quite a while back  He was great in that show  but who knew he had such a gift for narrating a story with so many different characters  The kids and I were  pun intended  spellbound We were disappointed when we reached the end of Book 5 and had to wait for the next book to be released  but that turned out to be a blessing in disguise  for we spent many hours in eager anticipation  and we had great discussions about what would happen to Harry and our other Hogwarts friends  I constantly reminded the kids of how lucky we were  this series would become a classic that would live on long after us  but WE were the ones who got to experience it first hand  as the books came out  and what fun we had speculating  We read and reread the books  and we were right there in line for the midnight releases of Books 6 and 7  Harry Potter was a gift from heaven that provided us with much needed light and happiness The release of the final book was bittersweet  We were so eager to find out how the story would end  and it certainly did not disappoint   but we knew that it would mark the end of an era in our lives I am now a school librarian  and I experience great delight every time a new young reader discovers the magic of the Harry Potter books  My students know I am a big fan and get great enjoyment out of the HP memorabilia I have collected and display in my library  I give out HP prizes to each student who finishes the series  I have been in mourning since I finished Book 7  but I am SO LUCKY that I get to pass on his legacy to future fans  The Boy Who Lived  will live forever in my heart  Though it s slightly embarrassing for me to admit  I did see the Harry Potter films before I ever read this book  I received book one as a gift when I was much younger  around 9 or so  but I didn t really become a big reader until I was about 15 years old  and by then I had already seen each of the film adaptations  with The Half Blood Prince coming out my freshman year of high school  In some ways I felt gypped  like I had missed out on the fandom  I thought I could never read the books because the characters were engrained in my mind with the faces of the movie stars  in short  I feared I d never be able to bring to life J K  Rowling s world in my own imagination  Boy  was I wrong At first  I will admit  I saw Harry as Daniel Radcliffe  but as the story progressed  I saw less and less of his face  and more of what my mind configured to be Harry  The Dursleys are hilarious and outrageous  I found myself chuckling out loud at times  The opening line displays Rowling s wittiness right off the bat   Mr  and Mrs  Dursley  of number four  Pivet Drive  were proud to say that they were perfectly normal  thank you very much  I enjoyed falling in love with the story all over again  in a new light  Fred and George are much funnier in the book  as I soon came to see  I couldn t stop myself from laughing at their silly little pranks  And Ron and Hermione are so lovable  I highlighted a few lines that stuck out to me  but one in particular was so sweet that I almost teared up while reading   But from that moment on  Hermione Granger became their friend  There were some things you can t share without ending up liking each other  and knocking out a twelve foot mountain troll is one of them  Rowling has a way of making this much more than a children s novel  with deep meaning and mature lessons seeping through the pages  By the end of this book  I ve seen what the power of love is capable of  I am eager to read the rest of the series  as I have already gained a different love for these characters  They re more personal to me than ever before If you re like me  and you ve seen all the films without reading the books  don t make the same mistake I did before  It s okay to uncover things later in life  Sometimes that makes you appreciate them even more  Though I wish I had read them sooner  in some ways I m okay with the way things turned out for me  It s never too late to read something beautiful  no matter how old you are  Harry Potter bears a timeless story that needs to be read and seen through each individual imagination   En esta re lectura de Harry Potter  pienso despedir la saga de una manera que estan compartiendo mucho de los fans en el mundo entero  ya que acercandonos a la ultima entrega de peliculas  Harry Potter y Las Reliquias de la Muerte Parte II  hemos sentido la necesidad de recordar cada uno de los buenos momentos que hemos pasado junto a sus paginas   y digo despedirlo  porque honestamente tanta publicidad me tiene harta la primera vez que lei a JK Rowling tenia 12 anos  y puedo decir que me abrio las puertas a un mundo imaginario  convirtiendome asi en la mas inmadura chica nerd  en ese entonces  bueno  aun no he madurado demasiado  por si no se nota  pero dandome ganas de fundirme con la literatura juvenil  haciendome hasta la fecha  seis anos despues  una BookAdict total  Con esta saga en particular  no me considero una  FAN DEVOTA  no porque no aprecie los libros  sino por el contrario  respeto el mas febril sentimiento de una fan  esperar con desesperacion y contar los meses  dias y horas  hasta la proxima publicacion  como esas chicas britanicas que dormian fuera de las librerias para ser las primeras en comprar los libros   Desgarrase de impotencia  al saber que actores tomaron en ciertos papeles en las peliculas  estar atentos a cada una de las noticias  libros paralelos  historias  adelantos o lo que fuese  Una fan  lo es totalmente desde el primer momento  Yo no vivi ese proceso con estos libros  y respeto a todos aquellos que si lo hicieron  porque yo compre los libros y los lei en mi momento muy despreocupadamente  y si  vi las peliculas tambien  pero no al mismo nivel de apreciacion que muchos otros lectores  que siendo en si mismos fans devotos  cuidan hasta el ultimo detalle La primera vez que lei Harry Potter y la piedra filosofal no tenia un buen nivel de lectura  lo admito  Y habia ciertas cosas que no entendia ni recordaba a menudo  como los nombres   Lo deje y tome    algun tiempo despues  Si recuerdo claramente algo que me llamo mucho la atencion en ese entonces   y no creo q lo olvide  fue una parte que dice que Dumbledore comia dulces Muggles con sabor a limon  Lo intrigante en ese punto para mi  fue que el  siendo un hombre mayor no se privara del gusto de los caramelos  inmediatamente lo compare con mi abuela  quien tampoco se priva del gusto  y no tengo idea de carajo aun se mantiene delgada y en buena forma en sus casi 70  pero regresando al tema  siendo nina  muchos de los personajes resultaron muy atrayentes para mi  lo cual fue un gol total para la escritora  Yo queria asistir a Howarts  Creer en magia  Ver un partido de Quidditch real en la tele  Y remontandome a mi parte nerd  leo muuucha historia  Hermione era mi idolo  y yo hacia eco de ello en el cole llevando buenas calificaciones  tengo a Marcelo de testigo   En estos dos ultimos dias que me reencontre con la historia y me he vuelto a enamorar  decir que lo recomiendo esta de sobra  Por ahora me dispongo a disfrutar de esta despedida  pero no adios definitivo  para una saga que ha marcado generaciones   cita farorita   La verdad   Dumbledore suspiro    Es una cosa terrible y hermosa  y por lo tanto debe ser tratada con gran cuidado  Sin embargo  contestare tus preguntas a menos que tenga una muy buena razon para no hacerlo  Y en ese caso te pido que me perdones  Por supuesto  no voy a mentirte   4 5 2014It staggers me that no matter how many times I read these books  I still find new things every time  Surely  after sixteen rereads  I shouldn t be surprised by anything  And yet  I am  This time around  Harry s nerves about being Sorted   He d never been more nervous  never  not even when he d had to take a school report home to the Dursleys saying that he d somehow turned his teacher s wig blue    p  86 26 11 2012I first read Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone on a plane from London to Singapore in 1998  My mum handed it and Chamber of Secrets to me as I was boarding the plane  and told me to read them and let me know what she thought when she got back to Australia the following week  I read both books straight through without stopping  I read through dinner  and I kept reading when they dimmed the lights so everyone could go to sleep  Fourteen years later  it still has the same power over me  I love every second of it  It may not be a perfect book from a critical point of view  But to me  as a reader  It s flawless   This is one of the most expertly crafted novels I ve ever encountered  and I never get tired of re reading it and experiencing the magic of both Harry s world and Rowling s writing  I wholeheartedly give this book five stars and recommend it to ANY reader thanks to its fantastical plot  richly developed cast of characters  and engrossing style of writing Harry Potter was one of the first books set in a fantasy world to really be wildly successful  Nowadays  vampire novels  stories of witches and wizards  and various otherworldly books are commonplace  but when I first picked up Harry Potter  I was literally and figuratively spellbound  The very idea of an average boy secretly being a wizard was something every kid could relate to  we all hope there is something special and different about us  and Harry  thanks to being raised in the Muggle world  showed us with great humility that it was a possibility for that to be true  The magical world of Diagon Alley and Hogwarts seemed even more wonderful when contrasted with the glum life of Privet Drive that the novel began with  The entire idea behind this novel is captivating The setting and plot aren t the stars of the show  though  the characters really are  Harry  Ron  and Hermione are a terrific trio supported by deeply thought out professors  villains  and classmates  I have only recently come to appreciate the depth of Rowling s thoroughness by reading on Pottermore how much she knows about each of her characters  in the books  we hear a great deal of Voledmort  the Weasleys  and Draco Malfoy s stories  but there is so much more that she crafts behind the scenes about Professor McGonagall  Harry s murdered parents  and everyone s sappy favorite  Severus Snape  I mean who saw that coming    We cannot forget one of the most expertly crafted characters in literature  Albus Dumbledore  with his profound quotations and serene wisdom to act as Harry s guide All of this is brought to life by the magical genius of J K  Rowling s pen  Her vocabulary  both real and imagined  is purely brilliant  and her ability to see this series as a whole entity from start to finish displays storytelling mastery of the highest degree  She has stated in interviews that she wrote the ending of this story before she wrote much of the middle of the books  and I believe it  there is no way she could have pulled all of the minute details that are revealed throughout the series out of her hat  pardon the pun   I admire her so much  and J K  Rowling  the world s first book made billionaire  is the person responsible for creating an entire generation of avid readers and HP fans I m sure you can see from my enthusiasm and largesse that these books are worth reading  Please  please  PLEASE read them if you have not already done so  please re read them if you have  and please use them to encourage everyone you meet to start to love reading  The ingenius plots  heartbreakingly real characters  and glorious writing will make a convert out of any Muggle reader  I m not sure what could possibly be said about this book   I mean  I m sure almost everyone has either read it or tried to read it at some point  It is a series that I hope and believe will survive the ages  it has already transcended age groups  countries  languages  and interests around the world  Somehow  this book has been granted a true touch of magic  whether by the creativity of the author  the heart of its fans  or some unknown factor that we can t pin down  It isn t the most original of stories  an orphan boy  bogged down by truly awful relatives  whose life is turned completely around with the knowledge that he has a greater purpose  a wizard who is a virtual celebrity among the magic folk for surviving a dark wizard s curse  But maybe what sets  Harry Potter  apart is the world  I  and countless other readers  have been invited by the easy  effortless writing to enter this world  meet these people  and make it our own  Rowling has only begun to tell Harry s story in this novel  and yet she is already painting a world so deep and wonderful that it seems almost natural to want to step into it and stay there  Characters you can speak with  Magical creatures and objects you want to see and touch  Hogwarts and its grounds  where you eagerly follow the amazed  naive  determined  confused  utterly real Harry Potter   who you just know is going to achieve great things  Rowling once said that she never really created Harry Potter  he  strolled into her mind fully formed   I think that is true  even while I hold great respect for Rowling for bringing his story to us in such a way  But I ve always liked to think that Harry Potter exemplifies a quality I ve always believed in  that the best characters are not made   they are found  Una capa  una lechuza  una varita y muchas aventuras  Es lo que ha significado para mi  Esta resena es algo express  ya que mucho se ha dicho  escrito y hecho sobre esta saga  Recuerdo que en mi muy poco divertida infancia  a los 11 anos y con la misma edad que Harry  comence a ver las peliculas  Y me enamoraron  Sone con que llegara la lechuza asi fuera en bus  y ahora  muchos anos despues por fin me hecho con la saga  y no me ha decepcionado en absoluto Todo en la historia me encanta  Tio Vernon  tia Petunia y Dudley  los malos del paseo  que son como de cuento  Una serpiente amigable que se va al Brazil  Un cabello que crece de un dia para otro y un sueter que se encoge  Unas lechuzas entrega cartas  Un gigante amigable en una moto voladora  Un callejon escondido con tiendas con miles de articulos impresionantes  Un colegio enorme con fantasmas  escaleras que se mueven y muchos secretos  Unos profesores dulces  estrictos y otros aterradores  Un juego con cuatro pelotas  tres aros y mucha emocion  Un dragon insaciable y una despedida sentida  Un malo maloso queriendo hacer de las suyas  Todo eso y mas es la saga de Harry Potter   Si no la has empezado  que esperas Resena completa  http   rapsodia literaria blogspot co    To see my full review http   wp me p1jhaj 423This is my second time reading this series  and I must say  it only gets better with age  I initially waited until all the Harry Potter books were out before reading them the first time because I didn t want to have to wait in between them all  so to tide myself over  I watched the movies many a time  And you know  I m glad I did it this way because I m actually one of those people who doesn t have an active imagination and I have no pictures of what characters look like in my brain as I read  None  An author can tell me exactly how they look and how they sound  but unless I stop reading and try to draw them  and I m not artistic in the least   there really isn t much there in terms of my imagination  It s like a blurry shell for me  And that s why I loved watching the movies first  because I now have an exact image of what each character looks like  and I can see them doing everything the text says  and it s amazing  It s also amazing because these books are so wonderful  I was a teenager when they first came out  and so I ve pretty much grown up with Harry Potter over the years  and to sit here and reread the entire series as an adult bring back much nostalgia The Dursley s are awful  just awful  but I enjoyed reading about them in the beginning of this novel  It took a great many more pages than I initially thought it would to get Harry from the Dursely s to Hogwarts  but I loved it from the beginning  But  even having read this once before  do you know what I didn t ever realize  Neville is actually in this book a whole lot more than the movie portrayed  and I never knew it  I mean  I always knew he was an important character  and it s been seven years since I last read these books  so don t judge me   but I guess I either forgot or never really internalized how much he s really in this novel  It s not just a group of three friends  but actually four  though Neville gets angry at some points and disappears from the text  only to reappear later  This was eye opening to me  and now I wish there was more of him in the movies as well because he does actually play a huge part  But  regardless  both the movie and the book did a phenomenal job creating a story that I just can t get out of my head  Which is better  The movie or the book  Well  that s actually a hard one to answer  I think the book wins because it s got so much more information  but the movie is a close second  I must preface my comments with the caveat that I am an unabashed Harry Potter fan  At the time of this review  I believe I am beginning my fourth time through the series I think that the reason I ended up liking this book is because I didn t buy into the hype when it was new  I actually began reading the series when it was more than halfway complete  Therefore  by the time I was finally coerced to read it  I didn t have any illusions about what it was  a children s book that was very popular  but still for kids And it really is a great children s book  Rowling does a fantastic job of fostering and maintaining a sense of wonder throughout the book  Harry is an effective avatar for the reader  while still being an interesting and sympathetic character in his own right  suspiciously so  in fact  considering his abusive upbringing   And while the story itself is a little thin  I was taken in by the novelty of being transported to the book s wizarding world through the everyday structure of the Hogwarts boarding school  Even at the book s climactic confrontation with Voldemort  I still got the sense that Harry was experiencing and taking in the feeling of being something special for the first time  I think that s what really makes this succeed as a children s book    it drew me completely into the world of Hogwarts as a cynical reader  and thus can certainly do the same to young readers That being said  this one isn t the best of the series  I d even argue that the series really doesn t start getting good until around the fourth book  The interesting thing about these books is that Rowling as an author seems to mature along with the characters in her books  the writing in each entry gets a little more sophisticated as the characters grow up and the story gets more serious  Accordingly  the first book is a pretty light read  and apt to let you down if you re expecting anything more than a book for kids  or an introduction to the books  setting and characters  And yes  Harry Potter is derivative  Welcome to the fantasy genre  I m afraid I ve got some bad news about our other bestselling and award winning authors I really do love this book  though  warts and all  It falls a little flat for me after the fourth reading  but I still remember how much I liked it when I first read it  and it s always fun to pick out the little hints  trivia  and foreshadowing moments that Rowling sprinkles throughout all of her books  I find new ones every time I read  she definitely had a plan when she wrote the Harry Potter series  Harry Potter  my absolute favorite series ever  What else can I say  I have loved this series since the first book I picked up  Chamber of secrets  at a market  I read it five times through in two days  couldn t believe a book could be that awesome  and immediately begged my parents for the first and the third  the only books out at that time This is the one that started them all  The magic begins  I read this series every few months  and waited until a reread before reviewing  Harry finds out he s a wizard  and it s off to Hogwarts   Sigh  my only objection to this book is that it s not real  so I can t go with him  Here he discovers magic  friendship and all the while living a great adventure every day  There are enemies to be made  tests to pass  great feasts to eat  Every sentence sparks off your imagination  and things stay with you for life  If you re young  the lessons Harry learns stay with you  and if you re older  it just reaffirms them in your mind  You find yourself growing to love and hate characters  and this will continue through the books  I often find it hard to express exactly how I feel about Harry Potter  and I know this review can t even begin to do it justice  Just go out  buy yourself the set  and get reading  You won t regret it  trust me  It has been over fifteen years since Harry Potter was first published  it is now hard to imagine a world without him and his enchanting story  The books have captivated me  as they have done with millions of other children around the world  and it is surely one of the most popular children s series to have ever existed  Although I have read all the books before I have always had a desire to read them again  This is not only for the powerful story  but because I feel that I did not fully comprehend the more advanced plot and details of the series when I was a younger reader  However  I now have the perfect opportunity to fully appreciate J K  Rowling s work This first book  The Philosopher s Stone  is more simplistic than later books in the series  Yet it is by no means less important than the others  In fact this beginning lays down the foundations of the magical world  Harry s main conflict  and focuses on enticings the reader to continue reading  I felt an instant connection with the characters right from the beginning  I couldn t stop reading about Harry s problems with his Muggle family  his introduction to magic  the highs and lows of life at Hogwarts  I also forget how comical some of the characters were  particularly Hagrid and his clumsiness  I m sure the Weasley family will also be rather interesting to read about in the next book  Rowling s attention to detail is a highlight of her writing  specifically with names  backstories and history in the Wizarding world  The overall development of a world such as this is rare to find  I was pleasantly surprised by the balance of these details whilst avoiding over complication or boredom for the reader  The depth here certainly makes the phenomena more believable  thus the characters more loveable  The few mysteries that are included in this first book indeed intrigue us  there is much more to learn about Hogwarts  Harry s connection with Voldemort and of course Dumbledore  who only appears in a few pages  This is a fantastic beginning to the Harry Potter series  I was definitely reminded of why we love these books so much  I cannot thank J K  Rowling enough for falling asleep on that train back from London  for dreaming up Harry Potter  and then writing it into a series of books  Because that train journey changed children s literature  in fact all literature  forever  The beginning of it all       the boy who lived Yeah  Funny thing though  I remember reading this back in year 9 10 and I m astonished by how little I remember of it  It was actually pretty funny and I laughed out loud several times  The pacing is pretty steady  though it does slow off a bit  However  the atmosphere and environment and just the new world in general is just so amazing that it doesn t matter  Rowling just makes you want to know more about this world We have the introduction of Quidditch  which was executed fairly nicely  Though  I would have liked the announcer to have played a bigger role in the movie  as it had in the book  we only hear one line  and then we just have the action   I don t know  I liked the commentary  Full of whimsy  fun and antics   this book is just the start of something amazing  I cannot wait to re read the rest of the HP books    I ll just have to ask my sister if I could borrow them  one by one  I didn t want to say much about this  since it s all been said before  I m sure And just for anyone wondering  I actually FORGOT that big twist at the end  You know  with Quirrel  I actually FORGOT  I m watching the film now  shortly after re reading Book 1  and it s been made so obvious  What else   I like that many of the quotes that Rowling wrote for her characters were actually in the film  I never made it to the last few books  and I didn t actually watch the middle films  so I m not sure if that nice feature is consistent throughout all the instalments  We shall see  I suppose  A good afternoon spent  Maybe in the future I ll invest in an HP box set  book   but I m getting ahead of myself here  Hooray  I m finally reading the books like I said I would   I remember being given this book by my mother at 8 years old  She always took me to bookstores and while we perused through the shelves together she would recommend books to me that I thought were boring or unrelatable  That s why when she handed me this book all those years ago and she told me it was about wizards  I thought she was crazy  That is  of course  until I read it  I fell in love with Harry  an orphan who always seemed to beat the odds  With Hermione  a female character who was admired for her intelligence and uncontrollable hair  And lastly  with Ron  A character so lovable with his natural clumsiness and his quick tempered sarcasm  In addition  I appreciated the book s themes of love  bravery  wisdom and courage  This was a book of adventure and intrigue I had never experienced before  It goes without saying I enjoyed every other book in the series  the movies too  I also remember a sunny afternoon  riding in the car with my mom to my uncle s house  It was probably for a birthday party or other family event  We were driving over a bridge when my mom told me that Harry Potter was the  next big thing  and that it was going to be made into a movie  I looked at her skeptically and  thinking I knew more than her  I replied   I doubt it   I also remember racing a childhood friend of mine to see who could finish the book first  I won When the other books in the series came out I usually had to wait until they were available at Costco  because they were cheaper  I remember when I finally got Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire I was spending a few weeks at a relative s cottage  Instead of going water skiing or participating in other cottage like activities with the family  I took the canoe and paddled myself to the other side of the lake  positioned myself so that my body matched up to the canoe and read  I did that every day until I finished the book  Those are my fondest memories of summer Fast forward to July 21  2007  the release date of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows  I worked at a bookstore and we all dressed up as characters  myself as Hermione  naturally   I was there at 12 01 a m   opening boxes and handing out the books to the mass of Potter fans desperately awaiting the final conclusion to the series  These are the types of things I think about when I look at my shelves and see Harry Potter  Mom  fourteen years later I would just like to say  you were right and thank you P S  If you have yet to read this series  please pick it up and experience the magic for yourself  ORIGINALLY POSTED AT Fantasy Literature I started reading Harry Potter a few years ago so that I could find out if they were suitable for my kids  Guess  what  I m a well educated adult  and I love Harry Potter  I can t believe that I can be so entertained by something that every kid on the block is reading  usually I don t go for children s fantasy  Sophisticated adults will complain that this is derivative and  light   Yes  it is  It s children s literature  and that s what kids like  But  this is superior children s literature  The writing is exceptional  the characters are deep  the humor is subtle enough for adults to enjoy  It s very well done  I wish that all of the stuff my kids were reading was done this well I m thrilled that  because of Harry Potter  children are reading large novels again  I know several kids who ve been inspired to read  and to not be intimidated by big books  because of J K  Rowling  If you have only seen the movies and haven t read the books  you are really missing out  Read more J K  Rowling book reviews at Fantasy literature   One of the first  young adult  book I ve read when I got into the good stuff of reading fiction novels  Even as I look back  I learned a lot of my vocabulary  mostly British  of course  from this series  I really liked this series because it was action paced and had a lot of suspense and mystery in it  I also liked the British touch that J K  Rowling wrote as she thought of the first book that would make her a very famous author Harry Potter is a scrawny boy who lives with his Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia  He is constantly bullied by Dursley  his cousin  Nearing his thirteenth birthday  a mysterious letter arrives at his house revealing secrets about his parents that mysteriously died when he was a baby  His uncle is extremely angry at this letter and decides to ignore it  When more letters come  when I mean more  I mean A LOT   his Uncle Vernon gets so mad that he leaves the house and stays in the middle of nowhere  That s where Harry meets Hagrid and discovers his past and what he s REALLY destined for  What Harry is REALLY destined for is a school of magic known as Hogwarts  He is admitted a wizard and everyone seems to know him because he survived an evil dark wizard named Voldemort  everyone fears him   When Harry and his new friend Ron Weasley discover a stone that makes the owner immortal  they find out that Voldemort  possessing a teacher  is after the stone so he can kill Harry  Will Harry survive Voldemort  Or will he fall under the hands of the dark wizard who killed his parents   After watching the first five Harry Potter movies with my boyfriend I wanted to re read the series again I have re read The Philosopher s Stone last year in June and somehow just didn t read on with the series Now I really wanted to read about Harry s first year at Hogwarts and about his adventure and I really  really enjoyed it I haven t thought that I would enjoy it that much because I ve seen the first movie just two weeks ago  but reading the book was just a different experience and there were quite a few scenes that just didn t show up in the movie  scenes that I forgot about  but was reminded of  when I read them I loved how Harry s  Ron s and Hermione s friendship built up and how they had to study for exams and try to do magic  Quidditch was most enjoyable  I am so not into sports  but magic sports is a different and far more interesting thing  for me at least It is also astonishing how events from Harry s first year are linked to the later books in the series  Just amazing I am excited to continue with the series and relive all of this wonderful magic  I just finished re reading this  The first time I read it  my husband and I  both grown and not a child in sight  read it while we were on vacation at Sea View Inn on Pawley s Island  We plucked it off their overflowing bookshelves and devoured it in a couple of short days while sitting on their big ocean facing porch  Our love for the series was born and we ve been faithful fans of the books and movies ever since I was re reading because it was finally time to introduce this magical world to the children we now have  We took turns reading it aloud as a family  cuddled up together on the couch  This time around  I loved it even more  Watching my daughter s eyes widen at the more fantastical parts  seeing my son wipe away a tear at touching moments  hearing my husband read with different voices for the different characters  and all of us howling with laughter over the Weasleys    reading this together has given me memories to cherish the rest of my life  And the book itself   the richness of the story and depth and honesty of the characters  emotions   drove the experience  I can t give it more stars this time  because I d already given it 5  but 5 it shall stay   Mr  and Mrs  Dursley  of number four  Privet Drive  were proud to say that they were perfectly normal  thank you very much   One of the most popular book series begins simply with the Dursleys  They are  normal  and do not tolerate anything outside of that box  This is the unfriendly world where Harry Potter spends most of his early life  On his 11th birthday everything changes and his own normal life begins  A life filled with friendship  heartache and magic  I first read Harry Potter many years ago when it came out  Reading it now  as an older  hopefully wiser  person  I appreciate it so much more  The world J K  Rowling created is not just entertaining  It also teaches about the importance of being yourself  For me  the heart of the story has always been the friendship between Harry  Ron and Hermione  Reading about the start of this lifetime relationship was especially wonderful  The Sorcerer s Stone is considered a middle grade book  Kids love it   my 8 year old nephew is currently reading it for the first time  But  adults  seriously  if you haven t read this then you are missing out on one of the most special series written  Don t let the fact that it was originally targeted towards a younger crowd dissuade you  It is very profound in spots   For example  the Mirror of Erised shows you your strongest desire  The temptation would be to sit in front of it and live a false life where you could see those you ve lost or do things you are unable to do  However  if you stay there  then you are missing out on your real life  A lot of adults today could learn from this   My second read through was so much fun  It was interesting to remember some of the details I d forgotten and also pick up on things that I missed the first time  How was I supposed to know how special Sirius Black was when Hagrid mentioned very early on that he borrowed the motorcycle from him      Mind blown  A review is impossible  What hasn t already been said  I loved it  5 5 stars  Italian Review  http   frannieinthepages blogspot it    My first time reading it and I wish I was still 11 years old I can finally understand now why everyone  and I mean it  everyone loves Harry Potter this much J K  Rowling s writing style isn t too complex such as her story  But somehow it s unique  I can t think of Hogwarts as a fantastic place because it can t just stay hidden in someone s mind  It has to be true  I honestly believe that Hogwarts exists somewhere and magic isn t just a dream Everytime I opened this book was like entering in a whole new world that was waiting only me to be explored and while reading it I actually pictured myself wandering through the corridors and the stairs with Harry  Ron and Hermione  It was like J K  Rowling was telling me a wonderful bedtime story and I was falling asleep and starting dreaming of Hogwarts and it definetely was one of my best dreams I wish I read it at 11 years old but fot its themes this book would be and it is perfect for everyone  What is more understandable than courage  nobility of the heart and true friendship  Nothing  I think It was just beautiful and I m so looking forward for the next book in this ageless and somehow endless series  Yeah  I know  Another 5 star review for Harry Potter  But I have to say as a voracious consumer of children s literature  in part because I have four kids  and in part because I really enjoy reading it  I feel J K  Rowling s Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone deserves all the praise and attention it has generated In this book  J K  Rowling shines as a master storyteller whose characters literally come to life on the page  Her dialogue is as good as it gets and her balance of narrative and dialogue as well as the book s pacing are perfect for the young reader who could easily become overwhelmed by elaborate descriptions and long expository passages  Though her descriptions aren t necessarily colorful or particularly original  they are more than sufficient to create the atmosphere needed to pull the reader into the story  Her action scenes are also well done and the book never seems to drag  Finally  she effectively uses subplots to keeps a constant source of tension flowing I loved this book the first time I read it  and continue to love it as I read it again to my younger children I would recommend this book to children ages 9 and up  as well as adults who appreciate a good story  This is the third time I ve read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone  I really enjoyed reading this along with Pottermore  Pottermore incorporates a lot of the details mentioned in the story  It was fun to pay attention to the little details this time since I know the story so well  I also liked reading the bonus material she wrote on Pottermore   it adds a lot to the story  I don t know if I realized this before  but J K  Rowling is excellent at showing and not telling  For example    Mr  Dursley  hummed  Tiptoe Through the Tulips  and as he worked  jumped at small noises   She doesn t have to say that he s starting to lose it because I ve decided that for myself  The books have so many fun characters that aren t in the movies  I love how optimistic and humble Harry is  I also like how light hearted and quirky the books are  The movies tend to focus on the darker aspects of the story  I never get tired of reading these books This book is also reviewed on my blog Books  A true story I can t even count on the fingers on my hand the number of times I have read this book  I started when it first came out in 1997 and haven t stopped yet  Obviously  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone was so much fun to read  not only the first time  but every single time after that  I love the readability of these books because not only can you read them over and over again without succumbing to boredom  but once you have read them all and start over again  you notice things about the earlier books that you really didn t catch on to during the first read Not only is Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone a great read  but the entire series as a whole is a great read for children of all ages  I loved them when I was 6 years old  I still love them now that I m 20 years old  and my mother can t stop reading them and she just turned 56  This book is full of magic  adventure  friendship  and love  What is not to like about it I highly recommend this book to every single person in the world ever  Old  young  male  female  etc  You need to read this book and this series  You have no idea what you re missing out on  As an oldie  ie  someone who is outside the target age range   I m offering my insights as less of a review  because  let s be real  I think the theme park and the astronomical success of anything that this series touches speaks as an advertisement for itself  but as encouragement to retread the tracks of your childhood and give it a go one more time  Or  if you re like me and have spent the last 10 years just reading other things  set a day or week aside to start reading this series One of the first things I noticed was Rowling s intelligence  She has created an entire world that contains our whole world  If you want to know how difficult this is  check out a list of banned children s books  Children s literature is easy  a few princes and princesses and some display of morality and you ve got a story  Young adult is harder  It s harder to create a world of interest that remains intelligent and doesn t resort to canned or pre digested symbols and lessons spit out in obvious ways  requiring no mental effort or imagination on the reader s part  It s especially hard to do this while showing the darkness of life  the obligation of reputation  the learning of what it means to have a  rep   and  coming into one s own  For being able to avoid those pitfalls and for having the confidence in what she created to write  on page 13  no less        there will be books written about Harry    every child in our world shall know his name   J K  Rowling is boss  Acabe de terminar un libro increiblemente maravilloso y ya estoy ansiosa por leer el siguiente  Y si  es la primera vez que leo un libro sobre Harry Potter  por supuesto que no me han faltado frases como  Oh perdonala gran reina Rowling porque no sabe lo que hace  o   Realmente tuviste infancia   de parte de mi amigos  Debi haber leido esta saga hace anos pero bueno   Todo sucede por algo  no  Al menos eso quiero creer Creo que no ha habido personajes que me hayan caido tan gordos como los Dursley  en especial el rechoncho malcriado que tienen como hijo   ironico  no  En el otro lado de la balanza se encuentra Hagrid  oh por favor   Es maravilloso  De lejos el personaje con quien mas me encarine fue con el y por supuesto con Hedwig  En cuanto a Malfoy  quien se supone que es antagonista  me agrada Ahora realmente entiendo a mis mejores amigas cuando me dicen que han esperado toda su vida por su carta de Hogwarts y que lo seguiran haciendo  Comprendo realmente su amor en especial por este libro  porque pagina tras pagina me encarine con el  la forma en que su autora lo relata  las aventuras de Harry  los personajes y la trama en general  Ellas tenian razon  me encantaria esta primera entrega y de seguro las que siguen tambien  Agradezco haberles pedido prestado este libro   porque leerlo fue magico  True story  Jeffrey bought this book for me when this book first came out  but before the reviews did  I must have been in some kind of mood because I really didn t like it  Neither did Jeffrey  I returned it and exchanged it for who knows what  First US edition  First printing  Insert head slap here  Now  15 years later  I have fallen in love with Harry s stories  And so has Sloane  January 21  2013 This was so good that I finished the series  read  listened  to one other book and started all over again  Just finished my second reading  It was great fun to see the way that Rowling must have had the whole series already planned out in her head  She set so much up in the first book that you don t notice on first reading because you don t know what happens next  Some time in early April  13 I started reading these again for the third time  Oh my  April 19  2014 Just finished my fourth read  Still love it  February 3  2015 Fifth   love it more  April 8  2015 Sixth time  November 16  2015 Seventh time  Still in love   This story is a well written  powerful example that not everything can be as it seems and that every one of us is capable of accomplishing something great if we only put our minds to it  It  in my opinions  teaches children about perseverance and to try one s best at all times  The characters are easy for a young child to relate to  as well as for an adult to grasp onto and see the merits of the characteristics of that individual  And yet  people still find fault in it  A lot of times  the reason a book makes it onto that list is because it challenges the basic tenets of one religion or another  Do the fanatics remember the constitution  That whole freedom of speech  freedom from religious persecution thing  Yeah  bet they forgot that one I refuse to censor what my child wants to read  as a parent My thoughts on Harry Potter from a parent perspective My oldest child asked for the Harry Potter books for his 6th birthday  Let s set aside the sheer delight at a child wanting books instead of toys as a gift  especially at 6  That is a whole other blog post that I shall entertain eventually  But let s look at what my thoughts about the book he asked for were Hmmm  Harry Potter  huh  Well  having either seen all movies to date at that time  2009  or read all books  I evaluated my thoughts on whether it was appropriate for my then 6 year old son to read  The answer was yes  As mentioned in the above referenced post  I do not believe in censoring what my child reads  Yes  I understand there is a bit of violence and a few things some others may not think appropriate for a child his age  I get that  But the difference between me and some other people is this  I view it as an opportunity to learn and teach him  We discussed the parts that others might have thought inappropriate  We also discussed that some of the words in the book are not words we hear regularly  because it was written in England  and there are a few differences in our version of English and theirs  Which then led to a discussion about England and it s history and culture  See how that worked out there  Great stuff This opened a door  Now  at nine  he has read the books  seen all of the movies  and amazingly  he never had nightmares because of it  Now  watching The Punisher with his stepfather  totally different story  that kind of creeped him out a little  But I digress Harry Potter is an excellent series that I feel all middle grade children should read because it can teach them things about life  It opens the door for communication with parents about all sorts of things  not least of all the difference between fantasy and reality  Alas  I ve read the book that all of people seems to be talking about Honestly  I m afraid I might not like this because  it s not my thing I read it  Enjoyed  And loved it And I keep asking to myself  do I love Harry Potter because everyone seems to love it and I just feel like carried away or do I love it because I saw  or read  the things that any person can love about this book The answer is the latter There are a lot of things to love about this book I love Harry  the uber cute 11 year old who is funny  intelligent  and a dreamer I love the supporting characters such as red head Ron  know it all Hermoine  and long bearded Dumbledore I love the magical yet mysterious world of Hogwarts I love for the fact that even if this book is high fantasy and there are monsters  the author still manage to throw hilarious moments and lines  the beginning was actually funny  I thought I m reading the wrong book   right drama and lessons you can learn I love that it ended without cliffhanger but would still make any reader wanting for more And I could go on I could really say that this is one of the best books I ve read this year As you ve obviously seen or read  this is the first time I ve read HP and also  I ve never watched any of the movies  Yes  believe me Don t worry  I ll watch the movies after I finish the series    It would take forever for me to start HP if not for my aunt  She gave me her more than 10 year old HP books this Christmas and I m so happy   They were just the first three books  but hey  three is better than nothing    I ll buy the rest  or you can be my Santa and send me them   D   This review isn t posted on my blog  I just wrote a quick review because I can t keep these thoughts on my head  I love Harry Potter  Love  love it  The Sorcerer s Stone is a small  quick  yet fun read  It s actually quite a simple book  as it was written for children and was Rowling s first novel  I realize that it could have been better and longer  but there are little gems in it  Laughter and tears  friendship and love  It s really quite a little treasure with fantasy and fun in it It isn t as well written as the latter books  but it is Rowling s first novel  and she s just barely tapping into the wizarding world of Harry Potter  I love the world Rowling created  I love the characters  especially Fred and George  My favorite line   You haven t got a letter on yours   George observed   I suppose she thinks you don t forget your name  But we re not stupid  we know we re called Gred and Forge   Ha ha  Love it Ah  I love the Harry Potter series  I ve read this book several times  each time the next book came out  and I still love it  And I will read it several more times in my life  SooooooooooooooooooooooAlways but always in love with the Weasleys Especially with my dear Ron I missed them so terribly much I missed Hermione and her smart ass lines Harry and his extraordinary plans Surprisingly the movie hasn t affect my imagination I mean I still kept my version of these characters how I imagine them This was one of the reasons I enjoyed it sooo much more than the first time Seriously what a nostalgia this summer will be Again I would like to say about my Ron I adore him I remember how slowly I fell in love with him during this series but in this case I was already in love with him I have to admit that enjoyed him so much more this time Ah The Weasleys especially Ron will always have a part of my heart Always  Rengetegszer olvastam mar  itt csengenek a fulemben a magyar mondatok  es ez talan nem tul szerencses  de igy sorrol sorra ossze tudom hasonlitani a magyarral  Termeszetesen az emberben akaratlanul is felmerul  hogy mit forditott volna maskent  de Toth Tamas Boldizsar zsenialis munkat vegzett  Rengeteget hozzatett a regenyhez egy egy szohasznalattal Peldaul magyarul   Mordizomadta  Fulviasz Eredetiben  Alas  Earwax Es meg van millio kis aprosag  amik nelkul szegenyebbek lennenk    A regeny valtozatlanul varazslatos  ehhez nem lehet semmit hozzatenni   This is more of a 4 70 stars rather than 5  The first time i tried reading this book  last year  i hated it s o m u c h  it was so boring and i stopped reading it halfway through  I found it boring mainly because i already knew what was going to happen  i watched all the movies before even thinking of reading the books  And i felt so bad because everyone loved and still loves harry potter and i didn t want to be excluded ahaha so instead of dnf ing it  i just put it off This year i started reading it all over again but with the audiobook  so i was basically reading the book along with the audiobook  and that completely changed my experience because i tend to read at a very fast pace  and thanks to the audiobook i appreciated it a lot more  Again  the fact that i already knew the story kind of ruined the magic of the book  which is why i can t give it 5 stars  Nevertheless  i enjoyed this a lot and I m looking forward to read the second one  I don t normally read books when I ve seen the movies as it takes away the element of surprise but everyone said the Harry Potter books were better so I decided now was the time to start reading them and I m glad I did There just so much more to the books and a bigger insight in to the story and world of Harry Potter  You also find out realise things while reading the books that you don t while watching the movies  like what Aunt Petunia washing in the sink MINOR SPOILER       and that Harry Dad saved Snape life  I really liked the idea that the chess pieces talk to you and learn to trust or distrust you and that Charlie friends take Norbert back to Romania  I think they should of put those scenes in the movies along with Peeves  Anyway even if you seen the movies then it still worth reading the books as there so much more in them and things happen differently  for example Harry meets some characters earlier on then he does in the movies   Before the Harry Potter series  it was hard for me to choose a favorite author  and I had very few favorite books  Now  when someone asks me those questions  Harry and his creator  J K  Rowling  race to the tip of my tounge  even as an adult  I have read this particular volume of the series twice  so far  This one warrented a re read from me not necissarly because it was my favorite of the series  but because it was the first  It s the volume that brings back that sense of discovery  of encountering this world and these characters that have become dear to me for the first time  Many people talk about Harry Potter making them readers  but the series made me a re reader  fot me  it was that gem that all bibliophiles walk through life hoping for  a truely special book that stands out in your memory and touches you in that rare way  It s been tweleve years since I first met Harry  and it doesn t look like the friendship will end any time soon   Tazko sa mi hladaju slova  ktore by dokazali opisat vsetky moje pocity po kazdom precitani tohto jedinecneho pribehu  Vzdy je to dobrodruzstvo  Vzdy je to nieco nove  Zakazdym som ohromena  ocarena  Nepoznam ziadnu inu knihu  ktory by lepsie vystihovala slovo  domov   Hoc  ci sa do Rokfortu vraciam kazdy rok  nikdy ma neomrzi obracat jeho stranky  Harry ma vzdy vazme na nove miesta a ukaze mi veci  ktore som si dovtedy nevsimla  Doslova sa vraciam domov  vraciam sa k priatelom  Tato kniha nesie v sebe take caro  ako ziadna ina  A pat hviezdiciek nestaci   So I m about 18 years late to the party  but at least I can keep my day job as English teacher  Some of my students were suggesting I was a bit of a sham for not having read the most popular book series of all time  I get it now  Harry Potter s character is endearing  his adventures thrilling  the magical world he inhabits enchanting  and most surprisingly  the writing of this  children s book  witty and finely crafted  Onto the second book   I have only ever seen the movies before  and never read all the books  I really wish I would have grown up with the books like many other people have  and not just the movies  It s really different comparing movie to book rather than book to movie  It s different  but interesting  I noticed how some of the most famous quotes from the movies were changed from the original that J K  Rowling wrote  I had mixed emotions about that  Needless to say  it s Harry Potter  and it s amazing   Review in Portuguese                    Tenho pena de ter descoberto a magia dos livros tao tarde na minha infancia e de mesmo assim  ter demorado ainda uns bons anos a ler livros sem interesse pois nunca tive algo nem ninguem que guiasse o meu percurso literario  Harry Potter foi um daqueles livros  series  que apesar de estarem na minha lista ha seculos  foram ficando para tras e algo esquecidos  Gostava que a minha versao de 11 anos tivesse lido este livro  era capaz de ter perspetivas diferentes ao crescer  afinal ha livros que mudam coisas em nos Sempre tive reluntancia em ver os filmes para um dia mais tarde ler os livros e aqui estou eu  com 18 anos a ler Harry Potter pela primeira vez na vida e a sentir me uma crianca de novo Nao ha muito que eu possa falar sobre este livro e mesmo que fale  sinto que ja venho uma decada atrasada para opinar sobre o quer que seja  Agora  que venho o proximo  HARRY POTTER AND THE PHILOSOPHER S STONE by J K  RowlingThe Harry Potter series is genius  and it couldn t have started out any better than it did with this book  The characters are rich  and dynamic  and you can t help but be drawn in by each and every one of them  The magic and mystery of Hogwarts pulls you in instantly  there s is no better world to lose yourself in than this one  I have never known another book to be so versatile than HARRY POTTER AND THE PHILOSOPHER S STONE  I have seen men and women  boys and girls  children and adults alike  all reading this novel  and all of them being in awe of the magical journey this novel takes you on  I loved this book even more the second time around  I highly recommend it to those of you who haven t yet had the pleasure of meeting Harry Potter    Overall Opinion  A Visit my blog for my complete review  and more    http   kaylasbookcase blogspot com  Kayla I found the first reading of this novel to be enjoyable   As much as I liked it and its sequel  The Chamber of Secrets  I initially didn t become  hooked  on the series until I read the third novel  The Prisoner of Azkaban  which remains one of my favorites   Reading it again after completing the series is an altogether different experience  as you recognize all of the subtle  quiet ways in which J K  Rowling was building the foundation for future plot developments and  more importantly  planting the seeds of truly profound themes and lessons that would come to full bloom in later novels  I ve lost track of how many times I ve read this book    the fact I teach it and write about it proves that I find it important as well as fun    and it s wonderful to discover that there are still new things to see in it  and new ways it can speak to me  It was a delight to reread this again   I ll be perfectly honest and say that I was not excited about reading this book  I am not a big fan of YA and I have never read a book of this nature before I have to say I was pleasantly surprised  I wish there were books like this to read when I was a kid  I admire Ms  Rowling for having such a fascinating imagination and appreciate her sharing it with the rest of us  She gave us all a gift  A moment for our minds to travel to other places we wish existed  She injected subtle humor that I went back and reread a few times and thought  Now that is pretty funny    The live chess pieces and the toilet seat gift are a few that stick out in my mind Now I want to see the first movie again to implant the characters and the story it in my mind and relive the story one more time I need to make room on the top of Mount TBR for the next HP book because I can t wait to read what happens next  I must say  it has been a tremendous joy returning to Hogwarts after all these years to share these lovely stories with my 5th grade daughter  It was so fun watching her twisting her blanket and rocking her bed in anticipation as Harry walked into the room to find who d come for the Sorcerer s Stone    The new illustrated version of the book  illustrated by Jim Kay is gorgeous  I cannot wait for the rest of the series to be released  In closing  I must encourage those who enjoyed these books when they were released to return to them to share them with the next generation  It was so rewarding to reread this well written book  but even moreso  to see my beautiful daughter enjoying it anew  Despite being familiar with the text as it has permeated our culture since it s original publication in 1997  it was a new and endearing experience shared with the next bibliophile of my family tree  Nao ha nada melhor do que encontrar um livro que ultrapasse as nossas expectativas iniciais Para quem e fa dos filmes  recomendo vivamente que deem uma oportunidade aos livros  A historia para alem de extremamente bem elaborada  e tao envolvente  O livro transmitiu me um conforto enorme  como se me sentisse completamente abstraida do que me rodeava  As personagens  os pequenos pormenores    Um dos meus livros preferidos de sempre  So for the month of February I have decided to take part in the  AYEARATHON challenge and re read Harry Potter  I ve decided to take my time and spread it out over the month instead of the week  just because I have found I m loving savouring each sentence and basking in the world that is still so vivid and beautiful in my imagination  I watched a video of J K Rowling just the other night and the interviewer asked her what she wants readers of Harry Potter to take away from her books  even in 100 years time  and she said that she hoped that Harry Potter would be what her favourite books are for her  a welcoming home to escape to  no matter where you are  or at least something along those lines  I must say  that Harry Potter for me is definitely a safe place for me to feel at home  because let s face it guys  in the words of the famous Harry Potter   Hogwarts is my home   Fabulous series   I was a bit shy about letting folks know that I was reading this  children s story   But it got such rave reviews from my Dad and Aunt  I just had to give it a try  I was hooked from the beginning and eagerly anticipated each new installation of her 7 part series  I quickly became one of the Harry Potter devotees October 2014 update  Finally got around to reading this with our girls  We listened to Jim Dale narrate the story on audio CD ISBN13 9780807281956  while we followed along with our paperback copy  interesting quote  If only the hat had mentioned a house for people who felt a bit queasy  that would have been the one for him    p  119  5 out of 5 starsThis is the first time that I ve reread Harry Potter in six years  and let me just say that it was AMAZING  It was basically like reading it for the first time  and it was fantastic  especially in this edition  All of the art was beautiful and well done  and reading it in a new medium really changed my reading experience  I do think that I m going to read this again in its original form to see if the experience is any different  though I ll fully admit that there were a couple of time while reading when I teared up  and whether those tears came from nostalgia or just from the sheer magnitude of some of this book s scenes  I can t honestly tell you  Reading this with fresh eyes and more years behind me has greatly changed the way that view this book  in a good way   and I m more excited than ever to reread this series as a whole  Releer Harry siempre es un placer  Releer Harry es reencontrarme no solo con esta brillante escritora  estos distintivos personajes  este magico mundo  estas tramas misteriosas  sino tambien reencontrarme conmigo misma  con decenas de versiones distintas de mi misma que se sumergieron en estas paginas durante ya casi 14 anos  Por Harry Potter  el nino que vivio  OMG  Mesmerizing indid many of you already read this so I will make this review short and nonsense I really handt got a chance to read this series eventhougt I watched the movie version of it I think Im the last person on earth who handt yet finished reading this series I watch the movie of it when I was 10 years old  i think   so I didnt understand it much  and i remembered  I watched the series of it not in order or not all  Im really dizzy trying to understand this  So when I got a chance to have one I already start reading it  Anyway  as eveybody know the Harry Potter movie is great but the book is greater Harry in the book is more cleve  funnier  and of course more trouble maker kid  with his sidekick Ron Weasly   P And also I find Hermoine more smarter than the movie Such a great story and creative way of writing  I love Harry Potter  I don t remember how much I have read the seven volumes of Harry Potter  I simply don t remember  All I know is  for the past fourteen years  Hogwarts  Harry Potter s realm  and the Shire  Tolkien s realm  have been my solace  Many days I had to trick myself into believing that there will come a time when I receive my Hogwarts letter  I had no friends  I was showing symptoms of Major Depression  which got developed after that to Bipolar Disorder  2nd Level   but these books kept me warm and cosy  These books kept me company The Sorcerer s Stone  or the Philosopher s stone  is simply marvelous  The main tune of the whole Orchestra If I have to take pride in one thing  it d be that I know what Dumbledore really saw into the mirror of Erisede  His dead young sister  alive I m still on the mission of the HP marathon  until the very end  It s been years  I m even afraid to count how many  But it s all still the same  Or better  At first it seems that you already know everything  since you ve read first book countless times years ago  and seen movies a couple of times   But then you start reading a chapter and time flies by without noticing it  The words just flow and you find yourself mesmerised by the magic of them  And all those small things here and there  Things that had meaning during this book  Things that will have meaning in the next ones  Oh so beloved characters demonstrating once more the reason they are so close to the heart Mayhap  it has something to do with childhood sentiment speaking  but most probably Harry Potter is just brilliant at any stage of our lives  Can t wait starting the next one  although I would love to take the spiders out of it   Feb 2015 read with Margo and it was an instant classic  She loved it  and we watched youtube clips of the movie often  and I think that helped to visualize some of the imagined details  She was totally drawn into the story  even though this book is by far the longest we ve read aloud to her  with the fewest pictures   For me  I loved falling back in love with the story and especially the Snape story  Margo HAAAATED him and I m so excited to see his story play out over the course of the books  I hardly remember the last books so as she gets older  I m looking forward to reading them together too  I can see us rereading this again this year and maybe doing a book year  I d give this 6 stars if I could  it was such a wonderful experience to read this with my daughter      Dec 2009Reread  It was adorable  still     A favorite of mine  This was my second time reading The Philosopher s Stone  but this time I read it out loud to my class  Such an unbelievable experience for both them and me  I ve never seen them so obsessed or gripped with a story  we finished it in half a term  which is remarkable  They would have sat and listened to me read HP all day if they could have  JK is a genius and I know those kids will remember the feelings they had whilst listening to that book forever  If you read HP1 when you were 11  read it again now  it will be just as wonderful   even better  read it aloud to your child for their bedtime story   let their imaginations run wild     Anyway  starting Chamber of Secrets tomorrow    They cannot wait  Such a charming quick read   I m so glad I decided to re read this book  I liked just as much as I did the first time I read it  but I suppose that great stories such as Harry Potter never get old  not even when  you  are the one getting old   This re read has also given me the chance to see more deep meaning and more plot details  I m really looking forward to re reading the rest of the series  ALL TIME FAVORITE   Even if you are gonna read this for a thousand times  you ll never learn to be bored  to lose taste and to sleep It s like a vice  a hard habit to break  J K  Rowling really stuns me and just puts an enchanting spell that let s me stick with this perfect art without doubt  without hesitation  It leaves me smiling  and at all times  inspired by the thought that there is such a great story like Harry Potter I am never going to replace this with anything Who would have thought that a hero will spring by the name of Harry Potter  J K  Rowling wrote a unique and a higher form of hero  that is realistic and has a connection to the real world  Harry is just Harry  The same boy in the streets  not even a sort of a genius or an obedient kid  He is just an ordinary man doing extraordinary deeds   If you have not read the fabulous Harry Potter yet then i have to ask you this    WHO THE HELL ARE YOU  AND WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN FOR THE LAST 10 YEARS   HOW COULD YOU NOT HAVE READ THEM YET  If it isn t obvious i LOVE the series so much  I grew up since 11 looking forward to the films being realised and the books being published  Harry Potter is probably one of the best Young Adult series out there which i would highly recommend to all ages  because every one WILL love them  Harry Potter is a story world i love to live in  and wish it was real cause that would be awesome  I mean who doesn t want to be a wizard  play quidditch and go to Hogwarts  J K Rowling has wrote a phenomenal book series which has captured the minds of so many different people Everyone should read this  Go right now and buy them  you won t regret it  This is probably one of those greatest book of all time that has grown up with my brother It s clever  it s original  it s so captivating and easy to get lost into the wizard world   it s one of those books that made you wish that magic was real  An easy read that s entertaining and one that will be remembered for a long time  Of course I knew Harry Potter before I started reading this book but I have never watched the movies so I didn t REALLY know what it was about  But the moment I started reading I found myself in this incredible world that is so full of magical things and I am so happy I finally started this series because it makes me want to go back to that world and go on adventures with Harry and his friends  Loved this so much   Re reading after more than 15 years  listened via eAudio  actually   a perfect narrator   it s clear to me that Rowling deserved everything she received for this  There s little that has come close to the storytelling  the characters  the adventure  the humor  the fantastical setting  It s just amazingly great  I was even more impressed this time around   I just love this book  Love  love  love it  It has lost absolutely none of its charm since the first time I read it  Having read it maybe 4 times now  I can really appreciate the foreshadowing  Dumbledore already tells us here that James saved Severus s life once upon a time  and the thought Rowling put into this story  I enjoy picking up on the subtle word plays that I hadn t noticed before  seems like I find something new every time I read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone  I can also deeply appreciate this original story  and not the almost but not quite the same movie version  In fact  the movie substitutes Ron in many places where Neville  in a foreshadowing role again  actually plays the part in the book At any rate  as always  I recommend this book to anyone looking for a fantastic tale  This was just as amazing as the first time I read it all those years ago If anyone hasn t read these books  is there actually anyone who likes to read who hasn t   then you really should give them a go  They re so wonderful  and they really can be enjoyed by people of all ages  My favourite series of all time  They are timeless  Rating  All the stars   obviously     3 re reading the illustrated edition of Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone makes my potter heart sooo happy  it always feels like coming home  all the illustrations are absolutely breath taking   magical  so IN LOVE with this edition   Harry Potter is amazing   Nough said I won t be reviewing this fully as everyone knows how amazing Harry Potter is  So I think I ll be comparing the book to the movie instead  I m not sure if there was Peeves in the movie but I love the fact that the Weasley twins have more appearance in the book than in the movie  And for the most part  the movie stayed true to the book and even with the changed parts  I just love EVERYTHING about it  Reading the book just gives me more insight into the Harry Potter world  On to book  2 now   D It s Harry Potter  Who doesn t love Harry Potter  I know everyone s already read these books over a decade ago but I unfortunately didn t start to enjoy reading until February of 2012  All I can say is that it s better late than never  I m glad that I decided to start my Potter journey  It s making me feel young again  reminiscing through old scrapbooks and stuff  I did see the movies so while I m reading I m picturing the characters in my mind The Sorcerer Stone was just as fun and magical as I thought it would be  I know that all 7 of these books are probably going to get a 5 star rating from me if they continue to captivate and bewitch me         He didn t know what he was going to  but it had to be better than what he was leaving behind    J K  Rowling          It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live    4 75 Es el libro que menos me gusta de la serie y aun asi mirad la puntuacion que tiene  Creo que eso lo dice todo PD  la primera vez que lo lei le puse un 4 5  y creo que es la puntuacion que tiene para mi la historia en si  pero las ilustraciones se merecian su pequeno detalle  Excellent for reading aloud on sick days  on rainy days  when you feel like procrastinating  or instead of watching TV before bed  I love the worn hardcover editions I ve re read again and again  but it was wonderful to step into the imagination of an illustrator and see how he envisioned the world and characters to look  While I d love to have the complete set one day  I do still favor the artwork of Mary GrandPre and enjoy imagining the world as it s always unfolded in my head based on JK Rowling s words  Reread December 2015 Oh my goodness  So happy I decided to reread this  I loved this amazing book just as much as I did the first and second time I read it  I felt like in some ways I enjoyed reading it more this time around and also that since I haven t read or watched any of the movies in a really long time I was surprised by some of the things that happpened  There is seriously nothing bad I can say about it  I just loved it like I always do  I think I m going to reread the whole series not all at once but once every month starting now because I can t stop and not read the rest of them  I need to experience every detail of this amazing series all over again not just a piece of it  Anyways  amazing  brilliant  just a beautiful piece of work right here  Yesssss   D This was my resolution book  and I did not realize it was a banned book  This was my first time reading this book and I really enjoyed it  The book very interesting especially in the beginning when they are deciding which house he gets into  The book was a very great read and a page turner  Super late on this train but definitely understand the massive following behind these books  Despite watching all the movies numerous times  I was swept away in the world even more and absolutely loved every moment  Looking forward to completing the entire series soon  I m 21 and now I have read the first Harry Potter book  I m embarrassed  of course I loved it and can t believe I have been on this earth 21 years and haven t read Harry Potter  I m totally blaming my parents  I gave it 5 stars  I mean how can I not  Can t wait to get my hands on the next one       To this very day there has been no book which influenced me the way HP did  I believe it made the most of what I am now   Rowling thaught me true values just like my parents did  I ve never felt that close to fictional characters and this mania also led to meeting a bunch of amazing Potterheads  it makes me laugh now to recall how I had disliked my best friend until the moment she screamed  I know what Avada Kedavra means     On the other hand  I might ve found my  Chosen One  among them   I hope he doesn t read this and feel too confident about himself   These books still manage to surprise me every time I reread them  so I don t have any intentions of stopping    And I really can t put this magic into words  so I m going to finish with this one

Magic25    Adventure20    Friendship15    Mystery10    SchoolAddictiveness  HighMovie Potential  2 Thumbs UpRe readability  HighThis is my second time through the series  More than a decade has passed since my first reading of  The Sorcerer s Stone   Both Rowling s world building and Harry s origin story remain as awesome as I remember them  The mysteries and revelations that dominate the second half of the book can be somewhat clumsy and convenient  but they succeed in raising the stakes of the plot  SO MUCH FUN  My two older boys could read this for themselves  but I LOVED sharing it with all three of them instead  Everyone loved it and reading it was a huge treat for us all  It even proved to be the most effective bribery tool I ve seen in a long time  hehe    Obviously I m way behind the curve here  but I just finished reading this with my 7 year old son  yes  my first time reading Harry Potter   I confess  I went into this book thinking there was no way it could possibly live up to all the hype  and I am happy to say I was wrong   It totally did  I loved absolutely everything about it  It really is magical  and I can t wait to dive into the next one  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone is first book of the Harry Potter s series  I think it is a fantastic book  it made me laugh  giggle  excited and keeping my fingers cross  no matter how many times I read it  I consider Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone as JK Rolling s masterpiece  it led her stairway to became the wealthiest person in England  There are many memorables scene in the book  but my favorite one is when Harry and his friends has to beat the magical stone Chess set  To be honest  the scene introduced Chess in to my life  the start of the stairway that made me become the Chess champion of Thailand  I can proundly say that the book played a little role of changing my great adventure of life in a very positive way  Procrastination  I will find you and kill you  Why did I keep postponing this book  Only God knows The book is  ofc  far more fun than the movie although it s really fun to put faces to the characters  DAwesome adventure in a wonderful world  Really hard to rate this one  Reading it again as an adult wasn t as enjoyable as I was hoping it would be  However  I couldn t give it anything other than 5 stars as it was the series of books that got me into reading in the first place  For how amazing they were when I was growing up  they will always get 5 stars I always reread these at least once a year and 2015 is no exception  I don t even know how to properly review this  There are no words to describe or fully express my feelings for this book  for this entire series  All I can do is once again thank J K  Rowling for giving me what basically defined by childhood and what continues to bring me pure joy and a strong sense of nostalgia  Because not only do I constantly relive this spectacular world  I also remember what it was like to experience it for the first time  I remember curling up in my bed  hidden under the covers hoping to not be bothered as I journeyed alongside Harry Potter  This series will always have a special place in my heart and I recommend it to everyone  11 15  3rd re read  This time I decided to listen to the audiobook  Wow  It s wonderful  I feel like the characters from the movie must have used the audiobook to make their voices sound the way they do in the AB  It was a wonderful way to re live the magic    I plan to listen to the rest of the audiobooks too  I think it will add to my Harry Potter Experience 07 12  I ve read this book before when I was younger but now that I m adult    it still gets to me  It is way better than the movie and I can t help but get caught up in the story line  I actually cried at the end of the book when Dumbledore is passing out points to Harry  Ron  Hermione and Neville  This book is timeless and I would recommend it to everyone   Well I am incredibly late to the game in finally jumping on the Harry Potter bandwagon  It s almost embarrassing to admit that I have not read this book before now  Since virtually everyone on the planet already knows what this book is about  I won t provide a synopsis of the plot  I think that is sufficent to say that J K  Rowling has a delightful imagination and a gift for storytelling  she combines the two to create something magical  I would have loved this book as a child and truth be told  I love it as an adult  I can only imagine how many children were turned onto reading as a result of the Harry Potter series  J K  Rowling has made a remarkable contribution to the world beyond these wonderful books   Book Title  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s StoneAuthor J K RowlingReview  The harry potter and the sorcerer s stone was made by J K  Rowling the book series was thought of the idea when her trip to London was delayed  I like this book especially when i read it for the second time I got to understand the things i never understood before  The main settings of the book was that Harry s enemy Voldemort but he s not that powerful to defeat harry  The main characters were harry voldemort hagrid dumbledore ron and hermione  The main conflict was that harry was old enough to go to hogwarts but voldemort finds out  I would recommend this book to my little brother because he is into the magic and wizardry type of stuff  I could reread this a thousand times without ever getting bored  Again  it was magical  exciting and PERFECT  And the illustrations  5 5  they made everything even more perfect and sucked me right back in  Just beautiful  Now back to reality   Since I assume everyone knows what Harry Potter is about I ll make this short This book is so imaginative  full of details and magical  it s just beautiful  and I see myself rereading it at different stages in my life and still find it wonderful  Recommended for  Everyone and their grandmother  and their golfishs  and blablabla I don t remember how many times I have read this book and it always feels as if it is the first time I read it  I can t help but give this 5 stars   This is one of the very few things that defined my childhood  I remember my first time reading it  in Arabic  It was my very first book to read  and it is what got me into reading   I am still reading it a decade later   I couldn t help but smile all through reading the book  I can t really review this  One thing I don t get though is how the Philosopher s Stone was not hidden well  on the contrary  it was meant to be found   All the charms and spells had a way to bypass them  a way that first year students can figure out   It sounded too easy   2nd time reading this and it was just as fun as the first time  Having been about 7 years since my first time reading  I had forgotten enough of the small details for it to still be suspenseful  On to year two at Hogwarts   Este reencuentro con Harry esta siendo increible  Encontre pequenos detalles que jamas habia notado  y en varias ocasiones me tope con guinos del futuro que me hicieron sonreir  es maravilloso ver como Rowling tenia planeado todo desde el principio   Seriously LOVED it  didn t want to put it down and the ending really did not turn out how I thought it was  Geez literally thought to myself        NO WAY ARE YOU KIDDING ME   HIM     Lol  Starting the next book right now    Officially HOOKED  Es el libro con el que descubri lo bonito del leer  es el libro con el que descubri una gran saga  es el libro que me confirmo que esa saga seria mi favorita  Nunca me cansare de leer esta saga  This book was so great  I didn t manage to put the book down because I just love every part of it  I also liked the characters  how they were all different from each other  I m so excited to read more  Review of the illustrated edition and based on a reread of the story  probably my 10th reread  This illustrated edition of Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone is probably the most beautiful book I own  The illustrations by Jim Kay are the perfect accompaniment to J K  Rowling s magical story of The Boy Who Lived  They re wonderfully detailed and beautiful and I really enjoyed feasting my eyes on his take on the story  There are many beautiful full page illustrations  and some double page illustrations  and I could reread this book over and over again  The story was just as fantastic as I remembered and the illustrations definitely enhanced my enjoyment of the story  This is my third time reading Harry Potter s first book and it was probably the best one  This time I read it in English and it added so much  The world felt a lot more real  and although the translations were very well made  I enjoyed this even more  The characters were as splendid as always and Hermione is still the one  I remember the last books better  so it was great to be back in this new feeling and watching Harry explore this new world  Also  the food in this book is on point  It made me so hungry  all the feasts  Seriously though  I need a mighty Dumbledore to redecorate my house and feed me daily  This is probably the best book ever crafted by a person in our planet  Honestly  I was kind of scared to start this re read  I haven t read the books in years  and it was a  is this going to be as good as I remember   But it was  It was as good as I remember  I m just going to put down bullet point type things because COHERENCY WHAT IS COHERENCY  Minor characters  Minor characters are always the bomb and I just   Fred   George   Lee Jordan   Oliver Wood    hey what happened to the former Slytherin Seeker is really about to get passed over for a second year   The story is just so much fun  I had so much fun with this  So much fun I can t even really do bullet points I m sorry this is just too good for me to do anything but gush about     Actual rating  4 9ish  hehe  I enjoyed re reading this  especially since the first time I ve read it was 10 years ago and a Romanian version  It is a bit fast paced  everything happens and passes so quickly  BUT  considering it s mainly aimed for children       Still  a great book  I could still feel that slight thrill of adventure as I fell into step with the three Gryffindors What else is there left to say  Because I can not review this  not in a proper way    This book is brilliant Hedwig  because I have a soft spot for her  v  How can I not give this book a five stars  This has been the first time that I completed a book in literally one sitting   no breaks  not even for food  And this is after I have watched each movie like 20 times  I know the entire stories very clearly but still I couldn t help but read this book If anyone of you has still not read Harry Potter and not reading it because you think you ve already watched the movies and you won t enjoy it  you re wrong  There is nothing that can stop a person from enjoying this book  Not even the fact that this is a children s book and you re an adult  not even the fact that you know the entire story  Super awesome book  Start reading     My second time reading this book  And my second time reading it out loud   first to his dad as we drove to Michigan for Thanksgiving eons ago and then over the past month to my sweet Finian  Swish and flick  This book is indeed fantastic  Fiction it may be  yet the story seems realistic  I can t even imagine how Rowling created such complex magical world with all those magical things  spells  places and etc  This is the beginning of it all  Harry s first year at Hogwarts  Reading the book is just like joining Harry in his quest into the world of wizardry  Adventures unknown to the human world like conquering trolls  playing a human sized wizard chess  flying on a broomstick and many more can be located almost in every chapter of the book  Indeed  the book does not only rely on magic to fascinate readers  the story itself gives a big impact to the readers   Harry Potter is ofcourse amazing  I just put all of them on here to fill up room  They re all really good and if you haven t read them then quite plain and simply    WHAT S WRONG WITH YOU   Harry Potter bogerne er hoj klasse og det har vaeret en kaempe oplevelse at laese den sindssyg smukke illustreret udgave  Jeg har laest bogen to gange for  men den er bestemt vaerd at genlaese Muy genial todo  Esto deberia ser lectura obligatoria para todos los ninos del universo  Porque quien sabe  quizas seria una persona con unos gustos totalmente distintos si no hubiese leido esto siendo un criajo  _  I love this book SO MUCH  I love the movies too  of course  It s such a good book  I am very excited to read what adventure holds this three brave characters next   I bought a box set last year but I didn t have time to read it  I m so glad I can finally do this re read  This book just feels like a long hug from an old friend   5 5 of course  there s no other rating for Harry Potter in my opinion  I haven t read it for ten years and I m glad I decided to re read the series  I loved it  I love it  and I will always love it  May or may not have been binge reading this last night   D    The Harry Potter series are always a fun and fast read  it still hooks me up  after all that time  Always  I flew through this book  it was just incredible  It took me back to when I was a ten year old watching the first movie  literally  hundreds of times  and it made me miss my childhood so much  The book was fantastic  it delved into Hogwarts in a fascinating way  remarkably starting Harry s story in an enchanting way  It was wonderful seeing all my favorite characters with fresh eyes  since I d never read the series before  only seen the movies millions of times  I can t wait to carry on with the series  I m absolutely in love with J K  Rowling s writing  and I seriously need to stop because I could gush for hours  Wonderful book  5 out of 5 stars  My 10th time of reading the start of this awesome series was just as satisfying and exciting as all of the other times before  The comfort it gives me when starting the very first sentence all over again and knowing I am going to re take Harry s journey is just the best feeling ever  I love all of the characters and Hogwarts is my favourite fantasy place  It never ceases to amaze me each time I read them how drawn into the story I get and how I still don t want to put them down even after reading them so many times  knowing exactly what is going to happen it still has the power to keep me frantically reading These are definitely my comfort books  What I love best about the Harry Potter books is how much you LOVE the characters  For all of their flaws  foibles and  human ness   even the non humans  they are so well written and endearing  Even the characters you hate  Snape  The Malfoys  even to some extent Voldemort  you begin to understand and care about  This book shocked me when I read it  I couldn t believe how engaging  interesting and compelling it was  and a first novel to boot  In my opinion they will be timeless classics that will be read over and over for years  Thank you JK Rowling for sharing your ideas  your talent and for inspiring a brand new generation of readers   Jan  2016 re read because I miss Alan Rickman but I can t bear to watch any of his movies yet   wistful sigh that simultaneously conveys sorrow  happiness and nostalgia  I knew I would love this book as I m a major Harry Potter fan  I really don t know why I haven t read the books before   maybe because I didn t have them all hmmm   But this book was amazing  I ve reread this book the most out of any book ever and it s always amazing each time I read it  This is why it s my favorite series ever     I must say that this is a fantastic start to this series  Actually  this is a re read for me but the first time I read the Swedish translation and to be honest I don t remember much  This time though I fell in love with it   I enjoyed Sorcerer s Stone this fourth go around as much as I did when I reluctantly first picked it up all those years ago and ended up reading it cover to cover   En este momento no me salen las palabras para hacer una resena en condiciones  pero la hare   ME HE VUELTO A ENAMORAR DE HARRY     _ Ok  si no cuento mal  ya he releido a Harry por onceava vez  al menos este primer libro  Aun sigo sin entender de donde saco Rowling una idea tan buena y que ha sabido conquistar a tantos lectores alrededor del mundo La magia es el elemento principal de esta historia  junto con la amistad que se desarrolla entre Harry  Ron y Hermione  El descubrir un nuevo mundo junto a Harry es fantastico  las personas  el colegio  el mundo magico en su totalidad  es una historia que nadie deberia perderse  LEANLO    Sometimes  it s just nice to read a book you ve read so many times before  It s like slipping into a warm bath  or putting on that comfortable old jumper and snuggling in front of the fire with the cat and a cup of tea Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone is just one of those books for me  Recently  I visited the Making of Harry Potter at Warner Bros Studios  As a consequence  I ve been feeling the itch to re read the books and Philosopher s Stone evoked all of the feelings I remember so dearly Fantastically imaginative  with compelling characters and a huge amount of groundwork for the future books  this book remains a joy to read  I ve always wanted to post a review of every Harry Potter books  so I decided to read it again and post a review  This is my third time reading this book First of all  I m in love with ALL the Harry Potter books  JK Rowling is amazing creating her heroes and villains  You get to love everything in her books  EVERYTHING JK Rowling s writing style won t leave you  It keeps you wanting to read more and more  By now I know everything about this book by heart  but still  I want to read more and more just like it s the first time I m reading it This book is just BEAUTIFUL and I will never forget itOne day this book will be a classic  3 It s been 3 4 years since I last reread this and I cannot belive how much I rely on the movies   or rather  how present they are   when it comes to the story  I remembered for example how the film changed the different tasks Harry  Ron and Hermione had to do before getting to the mirror but there were other details  important details for a reread  that I didn t recall and I m glad I decided to pick up the series again this month   Re read from 10 to 12 August 2015 It s a 5 star read for sure  there s no doubt about it  I need to buy the boxset so badly  but I m broke   Ah  Good ol  Harry Potter  I can t believe I ve never actually read the books  I d seen all the movies numerous of times before I read this and I have to say  I have even more respect for all the actors and directors for pulling off each and every character exactly as they are in the books  I loved reading The Philosophers Stone  Very good read indeed  Quick  fun and I actually shed a tear at the end  which by the way has never happened before  Yes  not even while reading The Fault in Our Stars  Highly recommend the Harry Potter series to anyone and everyone  whether they ve already read them all or not  Now for book 2     I was introduced to Harry Potter when I was like 5 or 6  Of course  that means I have ridden my mum s broom all over the house and shouted spells out loud  I still enjoy saying the spells tho  Harry Potter And The Philosopher s Stone is a gateway to my fantasy world  This is my book and I just have to give 5 stars  I lost count the times I ve cried watching the film and the book has a bigger effect  No  it s definitly not a depressing story  It s an entirely happy story  It s a story of my 11 year old hero who has been by my side since I know what an English movie is  And I am very grateful for it  Long live The Boy Who Lived  the book harry potter and the sorcerer s stone by J K  Rowling was an exciting  and an interesting book  the main character in the book is harry potter  Harry Potter is a very queues brave  and adventures kind of boy  a part in the book where it shows he is brave  queues  and adventures is when Harry and his friend go through all the monsters and puzzles to find out who was trying to steel the sorcerer s stone  some of the monsters and puzzles Harry and his friends got passed are a large three headed dog  a puzzle he had to go through was the giant chest game in concussion i loved this book and i cant wait to read the next one  And so begins the magical saga of rereading HP  Just working on finding someone other than Daniel Radcliffe to picture in my head  Open to suggestions    Amazing such a great way to start a series it was super fast paced and just wonderful if i wasn t so tired i would pick up the next one right now Well  of course this is a 5 star book  I thought so 15  years ago when I first read it  and with the perspective of years it seems even more remarkable that Ms  Rowling created a complex world of wizards  witches  and bumbling muggles from thin air as it were  But no matter how remarkable the Potter universe  it s ultimately the storytelling that carries the day  Even at my relatively advanced age  my visceral reaction was the same as it was years ago after first reading it    I m genuinely disappointed that this muggle will never get a chance to attend Hogwarts   I ve been always a fan of Harry Potter  It s one of my favorite series  The first book is awesome  I watched the movies  of course  more than once  but the books have their own special  and maybe different  magical touch Recommended  Originally I wasn t going to read the Harry Potter series  but I finally got convinced to read them  The first one was amazing  Acabei de descobrir que sou um Muggle e adepto de Gryffindor    J K  Roling  espero que me perdoes  andei anos a perder isto      The Dursleys would say that they are perfectly normal but  they are not they have a secret  They are taking care of the a boy named Harry Potter and he is anything but normal  He can make strange things happen when he is angry or afraid without trying  When Harry gets a letter from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry everything changes  Harry leaves his horrible life at the Dursleys  Soon Harry finds out he is famous in the this new world because of the mysterious scar on his forehead that has a story of it s own  Harry finds new friends a place that feels like home and  lots of adventure on almost every page  I read Harry Potter and I thought it was challenging but I finished it  At first I was reading this book and book and I got to the second chapter and I didn t understand the first chapter so I reread it  I enjoyed this book  my favorite character is Hemione because she is somewhat fierce  My favorite part is when Voldamore takes the teacher in Hoggwarts and turns her bad  like into a bad person   I highly recommend this book to all those Harry potter lovers  In this story I got confused at a scene but then I understood it  If you really like the Harry Potter books then you could watch all the mHarry Potter movies  Wizards   Dragons   Quidditch  oh my  Such a wonderful  magical story  It was fun to read  I can t believe it has taken me more than 10 years to get around to Harry Potter  Excited to read the rest of the series this summer   igetthehype  summerseriesread It was really amazing  I couldn t believe the end  I can t describe my feelings when I read it  I learned a lot from Hogwarts School like Curse  connecting legs           lukomutur mortisMascot  Freeze           betrefikos totalus     DThe story tolking about the adventures of Harry Potter  with his friends Hermione Granger   Ron Weasley  against magician Voldemort who killed his parents  I love this book  It s actually an easy read  now that I m older  I remember thinking these were so long and wordy when I was in Junior High  Anyway  this is brilliant and simple  Simply brilliant  brilliantly simple  I always tell people that JK Rowling is the best author because when she writes  even the descriptions and things that tend to be boring in other books are interesting in hers  Harry Potter will always hold a special place in my heart because of how much a part of my childhood it was  but I would like to think if it hadn t been then I would still have loved it if this was my first time reading it  Rereading one of my favorite books of all times with such amazing ilustrations was a delight  I could only marvel at all the beautiful drawings everytime I turned a new page  stoping to stare at the details for minutes to end  I ve relived my childhood and it was even more magical than the 10000 other times I ve read this book   I don t know why it took me so long to pick up this book  Also  I think it would have been so great to read this when I was a kid  but unfortunately  it hadn t been written yet  I found it funny  and witty  and magical  obviously   Here are some of my favourite quotes   I hope you re pleased with yourselves  We could all have been killed    or worse  expelled     Hermione There are some things you can t share without ending up liking each other  and knocking out a twelve foot mountain troll is one of them   It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live  remember that     Dumbledore I like this book because it has a lot of action in it and it has a lot of similes  bold and big words  How have i not written a review for this yet    There s really nothing to say  except this is the book that started it all for me  Sure  i had read a couple of small books in my childhood  but Harry introduced me into longer chapters  intriguing characters and an amazing story of good versus evil  Without this series i wouldn t have read any of the books i love today  i owe Mrs  Rowling and Harry everything  There may have been books that were better than others   Goblet of Fire is still my favorite  but for pure memory and the world it opened up to me  i give the whole series a 5 5  Pure magic  Si durante anos me negue a leer la tan conocida saga de Harry Potter  Me regalaron el libro hace mas de 10 anos  Pero este ultimo tiempo una amiga  sobre todo y las duras palabras de un amigo  me hicieron reconsiderar mi idea  Y un Sabado a la manana me levante mas temprano de lo habitual  saque el libro de la biblioteca y lo comence  Es muy bueno  Me hizo sentir como si tuviera 13 anos de nuevo  es magico  Si es muy cursi  odio lo cursi  pero a veces es necesario  que se le va a hacer    Un libro cortito  con personajes interesantes  con un final genial y con un valor humano unico  Me encanto   Absolutely beautiful artwork  I originally borrowed it from the library  but it s definitely one to buy   This was so beautiful  As Harry Potter was always a children s story first  this is such a beautiful way to present it  The illustrated version of this was absolutely stunning  It s the perfect beginning to a year long love affair with Harry  If I honest I have never finished the books  started all of them back in the day but never finished them  This year is my goal to do so  What a beautiful start to such a timeless and special series  I ll probably end up re reading book one again before I continue on because it s just so fun  and the gang is just too cute  10 points to Gryffindor   Ya dije tanto de Harry Potter que creo que no me quedan mas cosas que decir  Fue una experiencia increible volver a leer La piedra filosofal por primera vez  y que este ilustrado lo hizo mil veces mas entretenido Cosas a tener en cuenta sobre las ilustraciones  En la del partido de Quidditch hay un Gryffindor en silla de ruedas Fluffy es un border collie Hermione no es horrorosamente blanca  y sus dientes son como deberian ser Hagrid lleva un llavero con un mono a todas partes El trol del bano de chicas tiene una oreja mocha  aw  Los trols piensan en gatitos y nunca saben que dia es I don t know why I ve never read the Potter books  but I m glad I finally did This is one of the best books I ve ever read and it s worth all the hype and more The story of Harry Potter is very intriguing and heartwarming  There s a great deal of suspense and you re just waiting to know what happens next   and what happened in the past  There are a lot of secrets and twists and turns  The best part of it is that J K  Rowling is superb at describing everything  The world she creates is fascinating  So  really  the only thing that can limit your enjoyment of this book is your imagination  The first time I read this book was in 2001  I had almost forgotten how much fun it is to read the Harry Potter books  It s like a modern day fairy tale and I have always loved fairy tales  Rowlings writes in such an entertaining way and I absolutely love the magic world she has created  I don t have just one favorite character  because they are all great and the most of them have such funny names  Of course I have seen the movie too and most characters in the movie look like the characters I had in mind reading the book  but without a doubt the book is much much better than the movie  I loved the book so much  It has a bit of everything  It has frienship  family  fantasy  magic  etc   AND DUH IT HAS A SCHOOL OF MAGIC  I will defintly continue the series  Ps  HERMIONE IS LIFE  2015 re read going on right now   it is a testament to how well done these books are that I found myself gasping out loud at a plot point like it was my first time discovering it  ALAS  EAR WAX   Al principio no estaba convencido de leer este libro  pero desde que lo empece no pude parar Un libro muy bueno  Me gusto mucho Re reading this series from the beginning for the very first time since I started the books almost 15 years ago    Still some of my very very favorites ever    Perfecto inicio de 2015 con una lectura increible   Por que no habia leido esto antes  Loved  Loved  loved  I now need to read all of them  and I can t believe I waited this long  This first one is basically one giant wish fulfillment fantasy  but it s written in such a charming and original way  and the characters are great  and the plotting is really clever and careful  Just so good  It deserves to be as famous as it is     Ahhhhhh  just started this on the train this morning  I was expecting to be underwhelmed because of all the hype and inflated expectations and all that  but nope  It s marvelous and magical  and I can not believe I haven t read it until now   No importa las veces que lea estos libros  nunca van a dejar de maravillarme  En mi opinion  las peliculas de Harry Potter son una de las mejores adaptaciones que se ha hecho de un libro  sinceramente  Aun asi  hay ciertos detalles que yo no hubiera omitido y que los encuentro bastante esenciales como para que no los mencionen en la adaptacion cinematografica  Pero en parte  eso hace que aunque hayas visto mil veces las peliculas  los libros te sorprendan y merezca la pena leerlos  Ya que sino no te enterarias de muchas cosas que solo puedes saber leyendo los libros  Our first installment of the Harry Potter book club was a success  We had some first time readers and some nostalgic re readers  It was agreed that this was a whimsical tale of fun and friendship  though we are all anticipating digging deeper into the characters and continuing on their adventures with book 2  what is better than harry potter and the philosophers stone  harry potter and the philosophers stone THE ILLUSTRATED EDITION  I purposely took a couple of day to read it  partly because I didn t want it to end  partly because I just kept staring at every drawing for hours  The only bad thing about it is that the chamber of secrets edition won t be in stores until the end of 2016     and this is my third copy of this book now  Some books are made to own multiple times  Also  I might have a problem with spending money on books  the problem being that it happens a lot   HAHAHAHAHA  It s Harry Potter  bitches  Obviously it s amazing Seriously  though  The Sorcerer s Stone was actually better than I remembered  TBH  it had been so long since I read HP that I was afraid maybe I d only loved it so much because I was young and stupid  I mean  not that they would be bad  because I m not that ridiculous  but I feared they wouldn t be as amazing as I thought  as perfect  Even the first one really is fucking perfection  I will never understand how there are people who do not like these books or don t want to read them   glowers at boyfriend  I can definitely read these books for million times and still they ll be simply the best  Ame totalmente la forma de escribir de J K  Rowling  Tengo muchisimas ganas de seguir con la saga  Originally read this in 2002  2003  Re read in Spanish 2005  Re reading in 2014 again in English to daughter  I am finding that the begining of the story is a little long with the Dursleys and as a re read is dragging for me  My 9 year old is very invested though so it is just the re read After my re read  my daughter and I watched the movie  A lot is left out of the movie  and some things are changed just a bit  Some of the things that are changed just slightly  made more sense in the movie  Still the stuff that was left out made the book a better read  This was such an amazing book  I didn t expect to have this feeling of accomplishment that I was so proud to read my first ever Harry Potter book  I was planning on reading another book and then going back to the rest of the series  however I think i m going for the next one now I m so excited   This is beautiful  Incredibly breathtaking and I love it to death  3 J avais oublie combien les livres etaient droles et detailles par rapport aux films   Cannot believe it has taken me this long to pick it up to read  I love the characters  along with the plot  First time reading this  Shame on me Definitely not going to be the last time  though  Thank you  J K  Rowling for this amazing first book  3  3 Maybe I should get myself a very bad concussion to erase all of my memories of Harry Potter  just to experience everything like it was the first time  YES  I M GOING TO DO THAT  Ooooh my love for these books hasn t changed a bit  The feels while reading it  feeling like I m in Hogwarts too and even dreaming about having Harry  Ron and Hermione by my side while wandering around the hallways with the invisible cloak wrapped up around us  trying to escape from Filch   I really had that dream the other night   WHEN DO I FINALLY GET MY LETTER FROM HOGWARTS   Ya se que ya son muchos five stars en poco tiempo  pero cada estrella esta mas que merecida   Todo un clasico  As good as advertised  The ending was a bit sketchy though  4 1 2 stars  Lo ame desde principio a fin  3Ya quiero leer el segundo  3Gracias Club Cuando Leo Me Enamoro  3 Reread for the 3rd time and it still feels like the first  this series will never get old  Listening to the audiobook as well  thank you Audible   What is wrong with me    A few years ago I didn t even get past the first few pages  I didn t understand the hype about Harry Potter  I haven t even watched a single Harry Potter movie  I m weird  I know But let me tell you this I finally decided to give Harry Potter a last chance  AND I M SO GLAD about that  I get it know  You can t help but get whisked away by Harry Potter s magic  I just don t get why I needed so long to figure this out  Re read    Who knows how many times    It s turned into an annual tradition  though  Si hoteli i BehXhetit  Sfis Dijamonti    5 yje      This book was a re read for me  I loved it just as much as the first time I read it  I didn t realize that in the book that the Dursleys s are blonde since in the movie they are not  Even though the book says they are I still picture them like they are in the movie  Same with Harry  In the book he has green eyes yet in the movie they are blue  The changes from book to movie don t bother me too much because it is still a great and easy book to read    a way to escape reality for a bit  How cool would it be though if Hogwarts were real     All the stars for Harry Potter forever  I didn t think that I could love this book series anymore than I did  but I totally do now  I appreciate everything so much more the second time around and really can t wait to get going on the rest of the series again  Harry has the craziest best character development over the course of a book series that I can think of  He was so down on himself  self conscious  and worried about everything through most of this first book  Just think about how he is at the end of the series  Can t even deal   3 I never thought I would like a book like this  I even resisted the movies  I always thought it was so lame that serious  normal adults go crazy over these books   I mean they are about a wizard boy  YAWN  Written for children   YAWN  And apparently not well written  critcis do say so  WRONG on all accounts I honestly don t know how I picked up this book but a hardcopy suddenly ended up in my hands and I couldn t put it down  I should always go with the majority  I am conventional like that Can t wait to read the rest of them   I m going back and listening to these at the gym   I think I loved reading this book even more than the first time  I ve definitely waited too long to re read this series  It s absolutely amazing  over and over again  Reread 2015  Never wrote a review for this because it was something I d read long before  But we all know how awesome HP is  I don t feel it necessary to go into a bunch of detail  Honestly  it has been at least 6 or 7 years since my last reread of any of these books    and I ve only reread the first four a few times  Books 5  6   7 I ve NEVER reread at all since reading after their release  I m so glad to be visiting this series again  and finally having the time   It s like reuniting with a cherished life long friend   3 this book thIS BOOK THIS BOOK I loved it sooo much  Without a doubt  one of my favourite fantasy series  I m kind of ashamed to admit that I couldn t guess the plot of a middle grade novel  and seriously  What the heck was I reading all these years when the first book I should ve read was this one The characters  3The plot  3The writing style  3EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS BOOK SCREAMS PERFECT And if you don t like it  well then   Ya estamos en el segundo mes y ya tengo un favorito del ano  ME ENCANTO  Una historia hermosa  la narracion hermosa  todo es hermoso  Pensaba que no me acordaba de nada  pero no  era vivir mi infancia  lo voy a decir  algo que jamas pense  creci con Harry Potter  segun mi mama  me encantaban las peliculas  Mientras leia el libro  sentia una ternura enorme hacia Hagrid  un carino pero cierto respeto a la profesora McGonogall y un carino super especial hacia Dumbledore  Amo Harry Potter y espero obsesionarme como muchos  Reading this book again was like coming home     I don t need to write a review do I  Delightful story  I laughed often  but Rowling still held my attention the whole way through  And now I m looking to get my hands on the second book   LOVED IT  I didn t expect to love it so much    but WOW  Sad it took me so long to read it  If you haven t read this series yet  do yourself a favor and READ IT NOW  We have finished the first Harry Potter book  wohoo   What can we say that haven t been said  nothing really We think Harry Potter is awesome and we are looking forward to starting the second book tomorrow evening My son said  I like that Harry Potter can fly on brooms and can do magic and was the hero and Dumbledore saved him  I don t like Snape and Dudley  they are mean to Harry Potter  Voldemort is very scary   Patrekur 7 years old  I have read this book MULTIPLE times and this was probably my 3rd time listening to it on audio book  And even though this book is over 10 years old I still find it amazingly charming  The kids are a fantastic blend of brave  smart  stupid  and reckless  The tasks they need to accomplish through the book are a good blend of challenging and easy  although overall easy in comparison to future books   What can I say  I won t say anything bad about this book  I love the series too much       Audiobook  July 2011 This was obviously a reread  and since I haven t read these books for about 6 years  this was well overdue  Sadly I have never read the last two books in the series  as they were spoiled for me because someone basically told me everyone that died throughout those two books  so am now reading through the series from the beginning This book has all of the magic and wonder that I remember from first reading it and I really can t wait to carry on with the series and experience it again so long since I ve read it before  Even though I had already read the Sorcerer s Stone multiple times  Jim Kay s illustrations took me back to my 11 year old self and the excitement of reading it for the first time   Read the illustrated edition I got for Christmas   marvellous  I first read this series about 2 years ago so I decided it was time for a reread     a winter re read  Reread  fourth time reading I think  Nice beginning  Awesome start to the wonderful series  While I m reading the book I felt that I m already in that story  Because J  K  Rowling wrote that story in to our heart  There are funny scenes as soon as horror scenes  Thought the story had realized before few years it is very famous now also  I think it is better that this story will be continued for more series without stopping the Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows  This is a great story book  I will certainly read this again and again    Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone is about a normal family that has a surprise when a baby  appears on their doorstep  The baby has a note on has that said that their had aunt and uncle died fighting you know who  that is what the note said  little did they know who you know who was  Harry grew up to be 11 until things started happening  Envelopes to him were sent  no one knew who sent them but once Harry s uncle and aunt grabbed it and read it  they burned the notes  Then the next day notes came from everywhere even the door  They left the house after that  They went to a small shed to sleep  Harry s birthday was in a hour  Harry was about to go to bed thinking that he would not get any presents because he had not got any presents for his birthday ever  Then the door crashed down and a big hairy man appeared  Harry s Uncle yelled  Don t come in I m armed  holding a rifle one last time  I have to go run and do some community service  I will finish this later  Sam  I can t believe I ve never read these books before  Seriously  I guess better late than never   Read it for the 3rd time  never gets any less magical     It was a treat to reread this book with this lavishly illustrated edition  The illustrations are gorgeous  and I m hoping the rest of the series will follow  While I have read this book at least a dozen times in the sixteen years since I first picked it up  this is my first reread of the series since 2008  I ve been hoping to do a reread for a while  but I was also nervous  Would these books stand the test of time  or was their magic for only my younger self I still found this book relevant and hugely enjoyable  even though there are parts I can quote from memory  The story telling is superb  and I still love that the truth of what s going on at Hogwarts is so much more complex than Harry believes  It s such a good picture of the beginning of Harry s coming of age  starting to see the world for what it is and understand what his place in it will be  Also interesting is seeing the characters through the eyes of a teacher  which maybe anyone can do after they become and adult and read this book  I am a teacher  so maybe I m biased  I spent a lot of time thinking about Harry s interactions with his teachers  mostly Dumbledore  McGonagall  and Snape in this book  and how the things they say and do impact his thinking  Particularly  at the end  I thought a lot about how Dumbledore tells Harry that the his relationship with Draco mirrors James  relationship with Snape and how that might legitimize to Harry the dislike between them and set the stage for their relationship to continue to deteriorate throughout the series  In the past  I gave this book only four stars  mostly because there are books in the series that I enjoy more than this one  However  upon further thought  I can find nothing to complain about that might reduce its rating in my eyes   OMYGOSH  Did I just watched HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER S STONE   WHAAAAAAAAT   Just to make things clear  I just watched the first movie in the Harry Potter series  I thought it was just an ordinary witch craft story and omg    Didn t expect it was really good  Too lame I didn t watch slash read Harry Potter earlier  People saying Harry Potter s good aren t lying like seriously  Now I understand the feels of a potter head I m currently reading How to be Brave now but to let you know  I don t know if I m still going to continue reading such  cause tbh I BADLY WANT TO START THE SECOND BOOK  I ll either watch or read it but I prefer watching  Buuuut if I have the time  I ll definitely read it Just a fact  I don t read books that are made to movies  specially in series  I usually start a series by watching the movie then after watching such  I ll start the 2nd book  I don t know why but it s a weird hobby isn t it  HAHAH  Harry Potter made my day  I can t wait to start the second one         is it even fair for me to rate this book   This book was the book  or  rather  the Harry Potter series was the series that started me reading independently as a child  A lot of other books my mother read to me  or I read because I had to  This book was really the first book that I read and didn t want to end So  in the usual fashion for my particular generation who grew up with these books  thank you so much  J K  Rowling  You got me reading  and I owe you so much I learnt the other day that my brother in law s little sister  who is ten  hadn t read the books  And I resolved  instantly  that I must give her a copy  But now I have a choice  the paperback or the illustrated version          A few years ago  my dad turned up with a pile of books for me from storage from our old family home  I gave away most of the books  but I found my original copy of this book  and just melted  I m so excited to keep sharing this book and it gives me such pleasure  as a teacher  to watch other kids in my class pick up the books and improve their reading because they want to read books like this This is such a biased review  but honestly  this book started me reading  and to get a child to read for the love of reading is a feat in and of itself  P S  Does anyone think Harry s a bit of an annoying twat in this book  I did  Still probably do  I d love to reread it  though   Holy shit    This is amazing    I wanna punch myself for not reading it sooner    I can t stop using question marks    Help    I m in a daze    Now i know why people love harry    Few realisations Hermione should be a med student  the poor darling And Ron is still my favourite side character and my favourite redhead And I hate movie Harry  but book Harry is so amusing  gives Neville a hug I don t remember much about when or where I read the first Harry Potter book  whicb means it was a while back  But here I am  almost an adult  rereading it for the first time  It had me laughing and giggling like I can t recite the movie scene by scene and word for word  This is love   I will never not give this 5 stars    Re read  Review published on my new blog also  https   numerousreasonswhy wordpress comHere I came up with 5 reasons why I love Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone so much Reason 1  The first line Sometimes we put down a book after reading a few pages of it  saying we will continue later or just give up on it  It doesn t mean the book is bad but it just probably didn t look quite promising as we expected However  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone begins with a line that pulls us into it immediately Mr  and Mrs  Dursley of number four  Privet Drive  were proud to say that they were perfectly normal  thank you very much This is magic We already see the two characters and a place and also that there must be some kind of abnormality in it  This makes people interested and we read on to discover that there s much more to be surprised about It is not only the first sentence but the first page itself too that doesn t let us to put the book down Reason 2  HogwartsI am sure a lot of people like me would love to receive a Hogwarts letter of their own  Who wouldn t love to go to a school of witchcraft and learn to do proper magic The castle is located in a beautiful place  somewhere in Scotland  near a loch  the Black Lake  and is surrounded by a forest  It is a really gorgeous castle  with its moving staircases  numerous rooms  secrets and ghosts  Sometimes I feel like I have wandered those halls myself and experienced magic which is another reason why I love HP Reason 3  VoldemortYes  I love Voldemort because he is a worthy antagonist  You can surely create amazing characters and heroes but if you don t have a powerful anti hero  the story becomes dull  Voldemort is so powerful  horrendous  spine chilling and bloodcurdling that witches and wizards won t even call him by his name  This is an amazing villain  Just having such a powerful enemy makes your story more enticing and keeps you on the edge of your seat Reason 4  The Mirror of ErisedThe Mirror of Erised is a powerful magical object that Harry encounters somewhere in the beginning of the story  Later on  he realizes that maybe he didn t find the mirror by accident  This is one of the well planned things that I loved about the first book The mirror shows you what you desire most and what Harry saw the first time was a boy who wanted his parents alive and by his side  However  later he had to question his own desires and what he saw was him finding the stone to prevent from Voldemort coming into full power  The mirror made him grow as a person in that moment and also made us see that Voldemort s egoistic desires did not help him  The mirror showed that our desires shape who we are Reason 5  Harry  Hermione and RonThere is a really good villain in the book but there s also a brilliant team of wizards and a witch to fight him  Harry  Hermione and Ron s friendship is one that I actually envy and they are one of the best characters an author can have in their story  This was the first time reading this book for myself if that makes sense during my early childhood my father read these books to me and my brother And having grown up watching the movies I felt I d held back reading these books and so at long last I now have the complete series and I m now for the first time reading them myself and I found myself extremely hooked on this book I got so distracted with it I had to force myself to stop sometimes but I loved it and I wish I d read this book sooner  As a young boy  Harry Potter was raised by his aunt and uncle misleading him about the truth about his parents  death  Forced to live under stairs until finally letters coming in to lead him to the truth about who he really is  After many years of confusion and lies he is determined to find the truth and who is responsible for the killing of his parents  JK Rowling s Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone was amazing book  Rowling s writing style and characters make the story unique compared to all other books I ve ever read The author s style is great because she makes the reader not want to stop reading  I like that the author keeps the reader motivated to read more of the author s books  The story has everything you want to find in a book  It is funny has great action and many more things too many to count Yes it does make me image the picture that the author is reading in the book  The author s voice is amazing its like you re in the book with the author  Every word I read it feels like she is right beside me reading it to me it is incredible  The way the author makes the words in the book it makes it sound more proper There is so many characters in Harry Potter that is way it is such a great book  The way the author describes the characters in the book makes me feel like there right beside me when i m reading the book  The way she does is like a secret and that is way she such a great author  The characters in the story are all great because it is like there right in front of me and like i m in the story so it is like I know them  The way she makes all the characters having different personalities is what makes the book great  If they were the same then it would probably be a boring book  The characters like Harry Potter are great because he is brave and is like a nature although he knew nothing but muggle people  Also like Neville always losing is toad it is very funny  At the age 11 Harry Potter world was turned upside down and he finds out he is a wizard  Harry potter attends a school of wizardry and witchcraft  Later finding out that he is a true hero  He quickly becomes friends Ron and Hermione  Later that year Harry and his two friends set out to solve the mystery of a three headed dog  Only to find out that the dog was guarding the Sorcerer s Stone  Harry must go alone to uncover the truth when he finds out that Voldemort was the was one he must battle to save the sorcerer s stone and there school  If you are interested in curious or brave characters  this would be the book for you  This book is filled with adventure and braveness  My favorite part would be when Harry  Ron  Neville  Malfoy  Hermione and Hagrid enter the forbidden forest  as they enter the gloomy forest they split up  Harry and Malfoy come across a dark figure drinking unicorn blood  This causes great suspension and a very good ending for the book  This book is very unique and interesting  It creates suspense as to what may happen next  Just when you think the book is getting boring  something big and surprising happens which keeps you on your feet  I think this book shows some real life characteristics but at the same time fantasy characteristics as well  For example  we have sports and quidditch is considered a sport at Hogwarts but quidditch involves flying brooms and we don t have flying brooms in real life The characters in this book also show some real life characteristics but also a little fantasy  Students in the real world study for tests quizzes although we don t study potions  spells or famous wizards  Harmonie comes off as the  good girl   meaning she follows all rules and never disobeys teachers  but slowly Harry and Ron influence her to try new things and she becomes a dare devil type  Ron being that he grew up with 3 brothers is already very adventurous and isn t afraid of getting caught  Harry is brave and curious so he and Ron are very much alike  Harry Potter And The Sorcerer s Stone is a very good book  I recommend that if you like adventure and curiosity READ HARRY POTTER  The author has a great choice of words and detail which makes it an awesome book  I could picture every event in my mind  thats how much detail this book has  It is a lot of reading but its worth it   Harry Potter and The Sorcerers Stone       Jordan Atkinson        3 4 1Have you ever wondered about what your life would be like if you were a wizard  Harry Potter was living two lives  He was a regular person and later on he learned that he was also a wizard  Does this interest you  If so  continue to read this book and the rest of the series  To learn more about this book  read the rest of my book review  The theme of this book is to always have courage in yourself no matter what is going on  Harry Potter was not afraid of any of the challenges that he faced in this story  His friends stepped up and were very brave in this story also  they took up for Harry and in return Harry took up for all of his friends  This book demonstrates the life lesson of courage  It shows this lesson by having none of the main characters in this be scared to take up and to stand up for eachother  That is the theme of Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone in my opinion The author s style in this book was very good and very active  The writing style about this book is very exciting and it keeps you thinking about what s going to happen next  It is very funny in some parts of the story and then in other parts of the story it would be serious or exciting  J K  Rowling did a very good job making this book he made sure to include all of the emotions into one book and that is what makes it so good  It helps you think that you are there in that book right along with Harry  Hermoine  and Ron  The authors tone is very strong in this story as if he is there and is telling us what is going on as he sees it  It is just like the other books that I read or maybe even better because I read very exciting books that have a lot of mystery and suspense  This story keeps you on your feet wondering about what is going to happen next  It has a lot of mystery and adventure   That is the style of Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone in my opinion Do you want to read this book  Harry and his friends show people that you should stick up for eachother no matter what happens  Your friends will always be there no matter what happens in the end  You should really go read Harry Potter and The Sorcerers Stone  This book will teach you how to be true to yourself and to have courage and faith in what you believe in  Do me a favor and go read this book  you won t regret it   The book that i did was Harry Potter ans the Sorcerer s Stone  I liked this book because i liked the movies but also wanted to see the differents between the book and movie  I liked the book better because it was more descriptive to me  Another reason i like it because of the magic it seen cool and weird too me and always has some mystery to it  I gave the book 5 stars because i really liked it with how harry potter started out and the first mysterys   The book i read was about a little boy named Harry Potter  and he is a wizard but doesnt know it in the begining  A evil wizard killed his parents so he goes to live with his anut and uncle who are mean to Harry because they know he is a wizard  He gets invatations to go to a magic school named hogwarts but the anut and uncle dont let him find out about it until a giant name hagrid comes to tell Harry and he goes to the school  He was amazed that he was a wizard and that wizards are even real  When he get to the school he makes friends and he is really famous becuase of the scar he got from the evil wizard that tried to kill him but couldn t  Later in the book there is a stone called the Sorcerer s Stone that could make any wish or use its power for many things  The evil wizard valdimort is very week and needs the stone to come back to life but harry fits to gte it back from him and gets it  Dumble Dor the professer of the school was proud of haryy and knew he had alot to go and deal with     Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone  is the first of a seven book series written by J K  Rowling and has become a very popular series  This novel tells of a child who is living with his Aunt and Uncle who deprive him of many things such as a real room  proper clothing  and also just overall freedom  This all changes when Harry receives a letter from Hogwarts  the School of Witchcraft and Wizardry telling him he is accepted to come to the school  Characters in this novel are Harry Potter  the main character of the story and is also The Boy Who Lived  and by this means he is the only person that Lord Voldemort could not kill and was defeated by though he was just a baby at the time  Voldemort is the main antagonist throughout all of the books and constantly threatens to rise to power again  Albus Dumbledore is the headmaster at Hogwarts and often helps Harry throughout his time at Hogwarts and becomes his good friend  Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger quickly become Harry s best friends at Hogwarts  Ronald comes from a very large but not quite so famous family of wizards and Hermione is a  mudblood  which means one of her parents was a wizard witch and the other was not  Draco Malfoy quickly becomes Harry s nemesis at Hogwarts always insulting him and competing with him   This story mainly takes place in Hogwarts but also has times where it is at Harry s Aunt and Uncle s house  The time period is somewhere close to ours though it may be a little bit earlier judging by older streetlights and seemingly older vehicles  Hogwarts is a mystical place filled with many secrets some of which are uncovered throughout the story  though many remain untold  possibly for a later story   Harry is constantly fighting against evil forces and also just doing the right thing  Draco is constantly influencing him in a bad way and Harry is fighting against the clock while Voldemort tries to return to power  I would say the recurring theme in this novel is the fight against good and evil and right and wrong  Harry is faced with many choices throughout the novel and must make the right ones to make it through the fights with Voldemort present and to come   I would recommend this novel to anyone who has a liking for the fantasy type story and enjoys a well written book that is always keeping you interested  I have read all of the Harry Potter books and love what J K  Rowling has done with this series  Harry Potter is fun  intriguing book filled with mystery and action  A great read  I fell in love with this book as soon as I laid eyes on it I m 22 now  but I picked up this book when I was 12  And love at first  grew into something more deeper  Everytime I turned the page  I was entering another dimension where I didn t want to get out  This book was a definite pageturner  I was in awe by the magnificent way J K Rowling wrote this book  I was secretly wishing I was studying in Hogwarts too  It was silly  but I was simply enraptured by Harry Potter Honestly  I still am    I think that harry potter was in for a big surprise when he found out he wasn t a  muggle  any more  With his abusive family and his lack of social life Harry Potter didn t think he would get a letter in the mail  When he did it was a very abnormal thing that he received  His family saw this so they immediately took the letter away from him  Harry Potter was a inspiration to me  he was a nice kid with the best intentions  Sadly there are some people without the best intention  On his mind blowing journey he saves the world    more than once  From being a world famous wizard and not even knowing to saving the world from This a very great wizard that had the worst intentions this book is one of the greatest of its time Harry potter was a kid that was a humble and nice  He was always doing what he was told and he wasn t nosy and he didn t  But he was nosy and broke the rules when he had to  like when he was saving his school from an evil wizard that wanted to live forever and destroy all good from the world  Than and only in those crisis s will he ever break the rules  He is a good kid    unlike me     re read Finally reading this series   Hay muchos tipos de valentia   Hay que tener un gran coraje para oponerse a nuestros enemigos  pero hace falta el mismo valor para hacerlo con los amigos    Maravillosa novela   Definitivamente las paginas de este libro hicieron que me sintiera nina de nuevo  Es sumamente divertida  los personajes son tan variados y maravillosos  la creatividad de la escritora impacta Me enamore de los hermanos Weasley  de no ser por la hora correria a la libreria a comprar la camara de los secretos   5 0 StarsI absolutely love Harry Potter  The tone Philosopher s Stone is significantly lighter than the later books in the series  I forgot how important house points and quidditch were in this first book  Reread  July 2015  There were a hundred and forty two staircases at Hogwarts  wide  sweeping ones  narrow  rickety ones  some that led somewhere different on a Friday  some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to jump  Then there were doors that wouldn t open unless you asked politely  or tickled them in exactly the right places  and doors that weren t really doors at all  but solid walls just pretending  It was also very hard to remember where anything was  because it all seemed to move around a lot  The people in the portraits kept going to visit each other  and Harry was sure the coats of armor could walk  Honestly  I don t know anybody who d refuse to even entertain the thought of attending a school for wizards  Yes  the experience itself may be daunting and scary but really  most of us would welcome an opportunity to escape the mundane world and enter one of the fantastical  And such is what  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone  is  an introduction to world that you could never have imagine may possibly exist I ve already lost count as to how many times I ve re read the Harry Potter series  The plot and characters are well known and described in many reviews  so I will not address them  I don t even think I need to convince anybody to read these books and or watch the movies  Harry Potter and the magical world that J K  Rowling has creating  Leaky Cauldron  Diagon Alley  Hogwarts  in the first book alone have already become household names the world over that you have to be living under a rock if you haven t been aware of this phenomenon   Welcome   said Hagrid   to Diagon Alley  Harry wished he had eight more eyes  He turned his head in every direction as they walked up the street   trying to look at everything at once  the shops  the things outside them  the people doing their shopping There were shops selling robes  shops selling telescopes and strange silver instruments Harry had never seen before  tottering piles of spell books  quills  and rolls of parchment  potion bottles  globes of the moon   I believe that I maybe counted as one of the millions of readers worldwide who wished something better for Harry Potter  especially being made aware of the miserable treatment done to him by his Muggle relatives  I too wish to know the contents of the mysterious letters which were detailedly addressed to the exact location of Harry  I cheered when Hagrid finally got a hold of Harry and conveyed to him the message that he ll be attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry that coming term   Harry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place  It was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four long tables  where the rest of the students were sitting  I was looking forward as well to the process of selecting a wizard s wand and what exactly it is that aids magic  Every Ollivander wand has a core of a powerful magical substance  Mr  Potter  We use unicorn hairs  phoenix tail feathers  and the heartstrings of dragons  No two Ollivander wans are the same  just as no two unicorns  dragons  or phoenixes are quite the same  And of course  you will never get such good results with another wizard s wand  Instead of retelling the plot of which most people are already familiar with  I d like to post here my favorite scenes and quotes from the book itself  One treat was finding out the type of delicious treats available to those who travel aboard the Hogwarts Express  What she did have were Bertie Bott s Every Flavor Beans  Droobles Best Blowing Gum  Chocolate Frogs  Pumpkin Pasties  Cauldron Cakes  Licorice Wands  and a number of other strange things Harry had never seen in his life  I didn t expect the fast and true friendship that would form between Harry  Hermione and Ron  Early on we ve managed to catch glimpses of the personalities of the two boys but of Hermione  I snickered  I hope you re pleased with yourselves  We could all have been killed    or worse  expelled  One item  aside from a witch s wand  that I d like to have is most probably Harry s Invisibility Cloak  Just think of the possibilities  And yes  I wouldn t pass up the chance to stand in front of the Mirror of Erised   I show not your face but your heart s desire   No matter what Dumbledore may say that  It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest  most desperate desire of our hearts  The best laugh out loud moment of the entire book would be  Devil s Snare  Devil s Snare   what did Professor Sprout say     it likes the dark and the damp     So light sa fire   Harry choked  Yes    of course    but there s no wood   Hermione cried  wringing her hands  Have you done mad   Ron bellowed   Are you a witch or not  But what would make one continue reading and ultimately finishing the Harry Potter series  It s because  like Harry and the rest of the magical world  we all want to know what exactly happened that night when Voldemort tried to kill the Potter family  How was it possible that Harry  as a mere baby at the time  survived  Would the friendship between Harry  Ron   Hermione survive the test of being constantly thrust into the limelight fraught with dangers  Why does Prof  Snape hate Harry so much  that you couldn t help tagging him as the one trying to steal the Sorcerer s Stone all this time   The truth   Dumbledore sighed   It is a beautiful and terrible thing  and should be treated with great caution   Book Details  Title Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s StoneAuthor J K  RowlingReviewed By Purplycookie Despues de un pedazo de paron por culpa de examenes he podido acabar el libro   mas bien me lo he bebido hoy   que basto  me ha encantado  la forma de escribir de JK es super amena y yo ya que me habia visto la pelicula y pensaba que mas encarinada y mas conocimiento sobre ellos no podia tener   y con el libro se ha incrementado esto  los he podido conocer muuucho mas y me he encarinado de ellos una barbaridad  No se como he podido esperar tanto tiempo ha leerlo  Que pasada   This book came out some 19 years ago  I remember growing up around that time and hype they generated  yet I was one of the many who never read it or was  allowed  to  anyways   Well  here I am  19 years later and in my senior year of college  reading Harry Potter for the first time And I absolutely love it  I can see why this series is beloved and has such a loyal fanbase  Pardon the pun  but this book is truly magical  It is filled with such a rich cast of wonderful  and colorful characters and lots of emotional moments  I truly sympathized with Harry while he was miserable with Dursleys  and felt his elation in his happiest moments at Hogwarts  I was almost in tears as he received the magical photo album from Hagrid  or when he celebrated his first birthday and Christmas among loving friends  Similar to Harry  I was with wide eyed amazement at this new  strange  bizarre and wonderful magical world was I stepping into for the first time  Despite the series having been around for a long time  there are some plot details I m somewhat aware of  but I don t know the specifics  so there were a few twists that surprised me The version I  read  listened to  was the voiced by Stephen Fry  who did an excellent job with the voiceovers  I m eager to read the rest of the series   Well duh    RE CATALOGING WORTHY BOOKS THAT DESERVE TO BE ON THIS NEW PROFILE OF MINE   REVIEW MADE ON DATE OF BOOK FINISHED Duh   Okay  I started writing an in depth review about this but realized how much people already know how good this is  so    I refrained from doing so  Of course  you can spare yourself all the lectures  I know it s a shame I haven t started this sooner  I never grew up with the novels like I did the film s    YES I WATCHED THE FILMS FIRST BUT MY MEMORY IS SOOO BAD WHICH IS BITTERSWEET BUT SWEET IN THIS CASE SO I CAN KINDA START OFF WITH A CLEAN SLATE   unfortunate  but honestly I wish I read this before I read the Percy Jackson series which I did grow up with  This is so much better  But I can t deny that the two series are definitely my favourites  And of course  I usually rate the first of a series 5 stars because of its initial intriguing factor  and rate the rest 4 but we ll just see how the rest of the series will go  If I happened to favour a later book in the series  I might swap the ratings because I usually like keeping 1 favourite out of the series  That s just the rule for me   Magical  You can find this review on Astronomical Books 2016 is the year I return to Hogwarts  It is my final year of high school   the year where things become hectic and studying intensifies  With everything changing  re reading the Harry Potter books just felt right I fell in love with Rowling s world of magic much later than many of my friends  I did not read all the books until a few years ago  But somehow Harry Potter still had enough magic to captivate even a latecomer such as myself Harry lives with his aunt  uncle and cousin  who like to pretend he doesn t exist and force him to live in a cupboard under the stairs  But when a giant visits him with an important letter and the truth about his past  Harry is whisked away to Hogwarts  a school for wizards With a premise like that  it is no wonder people fell in love with the book the way they did  Every child dreams to live a life of magic and to be unique in some way  and Harry Potter has that  It was this focus on characters was what made this book special for me  Every character  even Neville  turn out to be a vital part in telling this story  The Philosopher s Stone shows that heroes don t need to be dashing knights in shining armour  because the most ordinary people can do the most extraordinary things  Part of the reason The Philosopher s Stone is so well loved is because people can relate to it  The loyal friends  the nasty teachers and learning to be part of a team are all things that come into the high school experience  regardless of whether your head teacher lets you fight dark lords of wizardry or not I adore Rowling s classic style and how she drifts from different perspectives in a 3rd person  past tense narrative  my favourite writing style   Refreshing and filled with optimism  The Philosopher s Stone has the magic and adventure of any good children s novel  but a seriousness and maturity that makes it a lovable read for adults as well  I first read this when I was a child  and the whole series is a definite 5 for me  I grew up with this  Heck  my parents loved it so much we used to watch the movies together This was the book that started it all  Honestly  I read it so fast that it was a breeze  I don t remember the specifics now since my last re read was some time ago but I definitely recommend you to take a second look back at this book as there will bound to be things that you ve never noticed before  Rating 4 5 starsThis is going to a little difficult because I have seen all the movies first and now have read the book  I didn t read the book before now because it was not published on E books  I did not really start reading for pleasure again until a couple of years ago and by that time I had already seen all the movies  Most of my books were on my I Pad which allowed me to take them anywhere easily  Now that the books have come out on I tunes I finally get a chance to read them  For whatever reason I actually thought this book would be much longer than it was  It really did not take much time to read at all  I have no real complaints about this book  It actually made me appreciate the movie that much better because of how closely it followed the story  Of course no movie can be exactly like the book  but the movie followed the book much more closely than any other movie that was based on a book  Not much more to say  I can t imagine anyone who does not know the story of Harry Potter   4 5 I m surprised  quite frankly  that this wonderful story wasn t illustrated before now  because this worked so well  Kudos to Jim Kay for taking on such a beloved series  and for doing it justice with such beautiful artwork  It really did add a whole new dimension  providing readers with visuals to the story they re reading  without completely taking over how it s all constructed in the reader s imagination I eagerly await the rest of the series in this lovely new edition  Love it  Snape   Snape  Severus Snape Snape   Snape  Severus Snap  DUMBLEDORE  There haven t been many books that I have chosen to read after seeing the movie  This was one of them  and I am sure that there will be at least six more to follow  I will let you guess which those might be     There probably is not much to add to the countless number of raving reviews for the work of J K Rowling in this book  Therefore  I will steer clear of adding to the overflowing cauldron of traditional praise and instead veer off in a slightly different and more personal direction This book was first published in 1997  seventeen years ago  It was impossible not to hear about it  The praise  the cult like following  the merchandise  the movies   it was all there readily available for the mind to consume  And yet  for seventeen years  I pushed it away  It s not my style  it s not what I read   dare I even say  I thought it was a kid s book  I now label my former self as silly  naive  and downright obstinate Only through the eyes of my own eleven year old son  hmmm  Harry was eleven at the start of this story  wasn t he   and his utter fascination with this story  he consumed all seven books in a month and a half period   the first piece of reading he has done for pleasure in his life  that I finally decided to pick up the book and find out what this fascination was all about  Now  I know I used to be what some would call a realist  Stories had to be believable  Stories had to have the possibility of occurring in real life  Fantasy wasn t real life therefore it wasn t on my reading shelf   until now  I have learned that a little bit of fantasy in our lives  okay  maybe more than a little  is just what we need to stretch the bounds of our imagination  to push the envelope on the traditional perceptions of reality  and to allow our wildest dreams to take shape Will I ever be chasing a golden snitch on my broomstick  Will I ever wave my wand with precise strokes to invoke levitation  Will I ever walk through a wall to board a magical train  Maybe not  Others may call this fascination with fantasy worlds a frivolous use of one s time  I even perhaps thought this at what time even if the thought only resided in my subconscious  Alas  the real value of a book like this  for me at least  is not what s real or not real  It s about thinking beyond what we already know  It s about exercising the mental muscle of our imagination and giving it a chance to come out and play  Carl Sagan states  Imagination will often carry us to worlds that never were  But without it we go nowhere  Me  I still hold out hope that this Muggle world of ours is just a glimpse of what really exists  Magic potions  charms  and spells   what an intriguing world that would be   and why not  I m ready to jump back into that world even if it s only in the pages of a book   for now at least     I ll see you all in the Chamber of Secrets  Simply one of a kind  I feel so ignorant for avoiding reading such a magical and light hearted story for a long time until now  Definitely going to continue reading the whole series  I recently read the Harry Potter series by J K  Rowling  and immediately after I went through the entire collection once  I re read all of the books    twice  My favorite out of the seven books was Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone  This book focuses on friendship  courage  and the concept of home  which are the themes  Rowling  the author  published the first out of the seven book saga in 1997 and it became very popular in the early 2000 s  Continuing the story of Harry Potter  Rowling wrote Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban  and 4 more sequels  In my opinion  this is Rowling s best publication  and a great book for any reader who enjoys thrilling and attention grabbing stories Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is about a young orphan who always felt different and did not fit in  until he turned eleven and found out that he was a wizard  Harry gladly left behind the only family he had left and traveled to the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry  There  Harry Potter finds out that he famous for defeating the evil wizard  Lord Voldemort  and that he might have to do it again  While trying to save his school  his friends  and himself from the hands of evil  Harry discovers the true meaning to family and friendship  This book takes you through everything with Harry  from joining the Quidditch team to fighting The Dark Lord  himself  Throughout the book  there are many surprises and interesting situations that are sure to keep the readers reading  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone gives you a glimpse at a world completely different from our own and provides you with characters  such as Harry  Ron  and Hermione  that you can t help but fall in love with  My favorite parts of this book were when Harry discovered that he was a wizard and how he had to adjust to such a big change in life style because these revelations capture the readers  attention and prevent them from getting bored with the book  In this book  Rowling is very descriptive  but not so descriptive that the book seems like it s a slow read  This detailed language allows the reader to imagine all the situations and events with ease  This novel was meant to be set in present day  but since it was written 18 years ago  it could be considered that it was set in the late 1900 s  In this time period  there are two different types of human   muggles  and wizards  both of which exist completely separated from each other In conclusion  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone is an incredibly written book that should be a must read for everyone  This book gives you the opportunity to escape your own world and exchange it for the magical one where Harry Potter exists  The details and descriptions allow the reader to envision the world that J K  Rowling created and the unique plot supplies readers with a story like no other  The only negative factor in this book is that it is not realistic  which does not permit the reader the ability to relate to the story  but it does enable them to dive into a different world and culture  In spite of this one negative factor  this book is one worth being read by anyone  Allen RenAs Old As TimeJ K Rowling does a great job revealing her creativity throughout the book  She reveals her originality and the importance of the word Muggle  meaning a human without any magical powers  by repeating the word  She uses the words You Know Who to replace a dark wizard s name called Voldemort who tried to kill Harry when he was a kid  but You Know Who was unsuccessful which made Harry a legend  I enjoy how she replaces Voldemort with You Know Who to tell us how truly terrifying and important this dark wizard was As Clear As CrystalIn the book  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s stone  by J K Rowling the theme is shown clearly throughout the story  I have concluded the theme to the book is  The bonds between family is unbreakable even with the strongest force   The author s word choice and the way she plots everything makes me want to read it even more  The author does balance internal character development and external actions in the story Personally  I am very interested in medieval times  such as knights  kings  wizards  goblins  and reading this book makes me even more curious on what will happen next    First  I d like to say that this book was awesome  It led me into a whole new magical world of wizards  witches  friendship  and courage  Before I read this book  I thought that witches were just green  mean  and ugly  but this book was the start of something else  It starts off with a boy named Harry who was often bullied by his cousin  Dudley  Harry is an orphan who lives  in a little cupboard under the stairs  with his aunt  uncle  and cousin  However  there was a secret that his aunt and uncle tried to hide from Harry  After turning eleven years old  Harry finds out that he was different  He was a wizard and a famous one  too  As Harry goes off to school  he will meet many different people and make many friends  However  he meets two certain students that will eventually become his best friends  The first friend is Ron  He is poor  but he s also very kind and loyal to his friends  The second is Hermione  She s very intelligent and bright  but she can be stubborn sometimes  Together  the three young friends go on many adventures that you wouldn t even dream of going on  They learn about many different spells  creatures  and other magical things  As time goes on  Harry learns about his past  faces many challenges  including going against a troll and dealing with bullies other than Dudley   and finds himself facing the greatest villan of all time that was said to have disappeared   Yer a wizard Harry   The book Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone by J K Rowling is an adventure seeking story about a young boy named Harry going to a school for witchcraft and wizardry  In this book Harry s parents are killed by the most powerful wizard in the world  Harry is sent to go live with his Aunt Petunia  who was his mom s sister  and her husband and son Dudley  With them he lives a Muggle  non wizard  lifestyle and gets bullied a lot by his cousin  One day Harry starts getting letters from a place called Hogwarts  Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia don t want anything to do with magic  so they throw away the letters  More and more letters keep coming  Uncle Vernon decides to take the family and run away  Uncle Vernon takes them to live in a house on top of rocks in the middle of the water  A giant then barges in at the stroke on midnight of Harry s birthday  The giant takes Harry to a place called Diagon alley where they have shops to get robes and wands  That is the start to an incredible journey this young boy goes on  I give this book 5 5 stars  I thought the author did an incredible job writing this book  She put in many words that kept you interested  She also added magic in the book without making it too cheesy  I really liked this book  I was always on the edge of my seat  It was hard to put the book down  I recommend this book to anybody who likes books with magic or to anyone who likes fantasy books  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone was honestly a lot better than I though it would be  If you like Percy Jackson books  you ll love Harry Potter  It gave me the same feels I felt from Percy Jackson and the author J K Rowling is really good at describing the setting to make it feel like your there  her descriptive words transports you to a world of fantasy and magic  The characters in this novel are really easy to love and also hate  but the characters are all really different from each other and they are all sorts of quirky which I love  because it gives the book a very interesting flare to it  and the characters act like normal everyday human beings and are easy to relate to  So what this book is basically about is a boy named  Harry Potter  who is treated very badly by the family he was passed down to as a small baby  They are all very nasty people and horrid little devils really  but then Harry discovers something through letters that are being anonymously sent  that he is something absolutely extraordinary  something very out of the ordinary  He is a wizard  He is then sent to a school full of people just like him  a school called Hogwarts  where he goes through all sorts of adventures  meets new people  and tries to unravel the mystery as to what happened to his parents  If you want a fantasy filled book with many twists and turns  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s stone is for you It will make you feel as if you are apart of the book and it will make you crave more and want to read the other books in this series  I highly recommend this book and cannot wait to get my hands on the second one              There is no good and evil  there is only power and those too weak to seek it   These books are gonna be so hard to review Best selling  award winning books and blockbuster films   I ll try to do my best Okay  what isn t there to say about the Harry Potter series  they re golden  The backstory behind the book is brilliant as is the back story behind some of the characters All the characters feel so close to my heart so reading the books makes me feel even closer  okay  I m gonna try now   Mr  and Mrs  Dursley  of number four Privet Drive  were proud to say that they were perfectly normal  thank you very much   Mr  and Mrs  Dursley live an ordinary life  Mr  Dursley goes to work and Mrs Dursely stays home to nurse the growing baby monster Dudley Life seems normal But they have a secret   There will be books written about Harry  Every child in the world will know his name   Harry is an orphan  He is delivered to the Dursley s house  To live a muggle life away from the extremity of his status He grows up and into his cupboard under the stairs  Until a letter arrives  Harry never gets letters  So when the letter is ripped out of his hands and his uncle goes through lengths to make sure he doesn t get one Until the truth is revealed Harry is Wizard  but not just any wizard  the boy who lived   It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies  but just as much to stand up to our friends     Harry goes through the year and meets two people he may begin to call friends Ron Weasley  a pure blood  Ron is the sixth Weasley out of seven and lives in a family that doesn t have a lot of extra money to spend  but they get by  Hermione Granger is a mud blood  Her parents are Muggles   non magic folk  Hagrid   We met her on the Hogwarts express and we quickly knew her as someone who is a know it all  Harry has never had friends before  And they all quickly become thick as thieves  To have been loved so deeply  even though the person who loved us is gone  will give us some protection forever   Everything looks like it may be turning around for Harry  He finally has friends  He has a home But what if that home is threatened Someone may be threatening to take one of Hogwarts treasure and Harry is determined to save it  It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live  remember that    This book is so hard to review and I know the rest will too  I hope I did this justice  Anyways  these books are going to be better then the movies  which is obvious  Neville had a bigger and stronger part and the parts and pieces of dialogue I recognized from the movie I had to read the proper way It was so worth it though  So so worth it  Can t wait to read the rest  I think that  Harry Potter The sorcerer s Stone  was AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE                                                                                                                                                                                                it was really cool and I think you should read it  Yes  this was my first time reading this  yes  I loved every word of it and yes  I wish I read this when I was younger  I was late coming into the game of Harry Potter goodness  I was working at Barnes and Noble and people kept requesting the books and talking about them and I was all  Is this like the Cabbage Patch kid craze but with books   Which it was only it was for a good product  books   rather than a crap doll  So I bought the first 4 books and took them with me to a camping trip  And that is all I did that trip  I read and read and read  It was awesome   This was a completely different experience for me  Not only it was my first time reading Harry Potter in english  since when I first read it I was too young to adventure myself into english books as normally as I do now   but it was illustrated  which is a sort of book that I am not used to reading  I might started this off saying that I loved this experience and I am looking forward for the other releases  My main complain about the illustrated part is that it didn t completely run out of the visual characterisation of the movies  and that part did disappoint me  since I was expecting to have it a bit more different  Seeing that I read the books after watching almost all of the movies  I didn t get to imagine the character myself and I was excited to drive my mind off of the visualisation we had from the movies  which  in the end  didn t occur for most characters  Ron was the one that shocked me the most  in terms that it was the only one you could really tell the difference  Besides that  I felt very heart warmed by big pictures and even the small little details  like the pages with the winged keys   It did feel like the very first time reading it and it hooked me up  surpassing my reading slump craziness  What can I say    it s HARRY POTTER I m 19  I ve read books before but never finished  except like 1 or 2 books      This is THE BOOK  The book that made me want to start reading  My interest in reading starts here  when I m 19 years old  I know it s 2016  and this was published yeaaaars ago   but it s never too late for Harry Potter  I believe This story is so magical  it s so awesome  it s so everything I put my hands on fire as this is the best story ever told I just love it It s a mistake not having Harry Potter in your life  I m glad I made the right decision  that day when I decided  I should start reading   but what should be my first book    hmm Harry Potter sounds fun since I love the movies  I never thought a book could be as equally good  or better  as a movie But I m glad now    that this book changed my point of view  I regret NOTHING  J K  Rowling is the best for writing the best story of all times  i flew through it mainly because it s short and i listened to the audiobook like 70  of it  D wow ich habe das erste mal harry potter gelesen und omg   ich habe soeben das Buch beendet und bin einfach nur sprachlos  begeistert  geflasht  diese welt   mir fehlen echt die worte  wie durchdacht diese geschichte ist und was j k rowling da erschaffen hat ist grandios  vor allem gegen ende wurde es nochmal so spannend und der plottwist am ende aahhhh   ich bin so aufgeregt wie es weitergeht  jetzt weiss ich auch wovon alle bei harry potter sprechen   _  This book warms my hearth  Ohh yyeahhh    4 5 5 Am giving a half stars less because I had already seen the movie and it took away some fun of the novel  but I still enjoyed reading it a lot  It was like reliving the movie  and being a part of it I was surprised to see the writing and creativity as the book was written in 1997  and Rowling has incorporated so many characters and built such a big and wonderful idea of a world  in this book  Loved it  Hopping onto the next part soon  LOVED IT Mi ero dimenticata che Harry Potter fosse cosi skdmndkdndnsks    non so se sono stata chiara  The very first book that changed the world forever  the begging of an era  One of the most amazing books I ve ever read  I remember I read this one when I was ten in my cousin s house and it only took me a few days to finish it because I was highly focused on it  I recommend this book to everyone who likes a well written book  that shows the values of family  friendship and also provides you a lot of entertainment with a touch of magic  AwwwHAce muchos anos que no releia HP Hermoso volver a encontrarse en Hogwarts    I have already watched the movies    My girlfriend forced me to begin reading the books    One thing to say  I DID NOT REGRET IT    ONE OF THE BEST SERIES I HAVE EVER READ    Getting more serious now    The story is quite different from the movie  with that meaning that it s far more detailed    If you have not read the books  what the hell are you doing with your life     Go  grab the first book and start reading       3  3 Do you really need for me to tell you what this is about  Do you need for me to explain why I  and millions of others  love this series so much  Do you really  I loved Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone by J K  Rowling because it has a lot of suspense and adventure  It leaves you wanting to read the next one  Harry Potter is a boy that lives with his aunt and uncle who have been keeping a secret from him  But this secret isn t going to be kept for much longer because on Harry s eleventh birthday  he gets a lot of letters addressed to him  These letters are telling him that he has been accepted into Hogwarts  a school for witches and wizards  His uncle takes the family far away from the house to get away from the letters  and it works  sort of  They stay at a hotel in the middle of nowhere and in the middle of the night a giant of a man knocks down the door  He tells Harry the big secret  even though Uncle Vernon forbids him to  and gives him the letter  The man s name is Hagrid and the very next day he takes Harry to get his things for school  When Harry gets to school  he is introduced to things he can t imagine are real  Dragons  ogres  three headed dogs   Not really a proper review  Airplane rides are often boring and on the way home from a short compulsory trip to Kuala Lumpur  I thought re reading Harry Potter would be the most perfect solution to this problem  So years later  I still find this fun  interesting and I still love it  I also got reminded as to why I loved it so much in the first place  The feeling of experiencing something you might never get to in real life  a brilliant made up world  fun and interesting and quirky characters  an absolutely fun education system  it s just awesome  The magic  the uniqueness  the possibilities  My best friend used to try so hard to get me to part with my Harry Potter books so we could do something else  WELL  NOT UNTIL I M DONE  LADY  Harry Potter marked the beginning of my love affair with books  I miss being a kid  I also miss holding a book that I truly find interesting and amazing that I didn t even have to  try  to like  Inspired to start reading Harry Potter by both of my sisters  my goal is to finish them by the time I graduate college  I don t think that ll be too hard because THIS FIRST ONE MADE ME SO HAPPY if I already cried over this one I can t even imagine what the next ones will do to me  I am not disappointed  I cannot believe it has taken me this long to get into it  I loved it so so so much and I m so excited to read the rest  33333 I read this book because I saw the movie and really enjoyed it  and because people that I know have read it and they ve said it was a great read  I ended up reading the whole series because I love the idea of an alternate world and magical beings being real  I read this book really quickly because I really enjoyed it A character that I found interesting was Hermione  I found her interesting because she was practically perfect and the top at everything  except Harry beat her at Defence Against the Dark Arts   She works hard for what she gets and I admire her for being such a great student  I also find her interesting because she s a brave girl who knows what is right and wrong and will do anything to help those in need   It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies  but just as much to stand up to our friends   Something that I learned from this book was that you can count on your true friends and that you can trust them  Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone  J K  Rowling2  This novel has excellent character development  from developing a back story for the current state of the wizarding world to watching the characters grow more mature and learn to use their powers  Their speaking habits are believable because Ron will say something offensive to Hermione without even realizing it and she will be horribly offended  Such as the time in the novel when Ron insults Hermione and she goes running to the girls room to cry  and a  view spoiler   troll attacks her   hide spoiler   and then Ron and Harry have to save her  I feel this whole situation fits very well with all of the characters personalities  The stories ending does flow naturally with what the reader learns from the characters because the  view spoiler   Sorcerers Stone appears in Harrys pocket because he wants it but does not want to use it  Also the fact the  Dark Lord  was not strong enough to kill harry fits very well into the character traits  He Who Shall Not Be Named  was given    hide spoiler  3  The book roughly follows the plot structure outline because it has all of the basic elements  exposition  rising action  climax  and falling action The exposition of this novel is a key part of this book because we meet the main character and we learn that he is a wizard and so were his parents and that he is going to Hogwarts  The Author really elaborated on this part and made the reader get connected to the character  the author also keeps the rising action going for a solid part of the novel  This novel can also have similarities drawn to it with  Star Wars A New Hope  because the main character is an orphan and both of the main characters defeat the villain who has killed more than one of their family members  So with that being said  I would say the novel is very unique with certain characters and details about the story but the overall plot is very similar to some thing that came out before it   This book was really good  I love Harry Potter now   I was so wrong by thinking that Snape was the bad guy and worked for Voldemort  It s ended up being Quirrell  Also  he had Voldemort on the other side of his face  Well  Quirrell s dead but Voldemort still lives  I m so excited   I loved the friendship and teamwork between Harry  Ron and Hermione    Can t wait to read the next book and find out what adventure comes next   Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s stone is a book about a ten year old boy named Harry Potter  Harry lives with his mean and cruel aunt Petunia  uncle Vernon  and his annoying cousin  Dudley  Harry thinks he had reached rock bottom  until he gets a mysterious letter from a mysterious messenger that says he has to go to a place that Harry has never even dreamed of before  He finds amazing friends  strange sports  magic around every corner  and danger  Then Harry encounters an amazing  dangerous  breathtaking  and a magical destiny that he will never forget I thought that Harry Potter was an astonishing book that changed the way on how I read books  It always had dangers around every corner that would keep me off the edge of my seat  There was always something happening  and I couldn t put it down  I would definitely want to recommend this to others if you like mystery  danger  adventure  and a little magic   80  kinoda yoxdur  Az rbaycan dilin d  goz l t rcum  edibl r   hs n     n knt qr t lqS  d

Rowling  J  K     GrandPre  M   1997   Harry Potter and the sorcerer s stone  New York  Scholastic Review  Harry Potter was an orphaned boy who grew up with his uncle  aunt  and bully of a cousin  They constantly made him feel unloved and treated him as if he wasn t family  Turns out  Harry is an extraordinary boy with powers of wizardry  The book takes you through Harry s eyes as he tries to adjust to life at Hogwarts  a school for magic  To make matters worse  Harry has to deal with being one of the new kids on the block and battling the evil Valdemorth  his parents  murderer  from getting the Sorcerer s stone  As I read the book  I think the story s strength were in the characters  description  Although these kids were a fantasy and went to a school of magic  children these days could relate to the struggles  difficulties  and pressures of everyday schooling  As for weaknesses  I think the Sorcerer s stone could have been better protected  It was utterly important to keep Valdermorth away from the stone  He is this famously known villain in the book who made people afraid to even whispered his name  If that is the case  how did 3 kids around the age of 10 get pass all those obstacles  Recommendation  As of right now  I would not recommend this book to my first graders just because it is not on their reading level  However  I would recommend this book to the students who are in the fourth grade or above  This book takes you to a world of fantasy where kids wished they could have magical powers as in Harry Potter  It also gives students the chance to see themselves in a more responsible role  Harry Potter is around the age of 10 and he has all these hard life choices to make throughout the book  Students with difficult home situations can relate to Harry Potter  not necessary in the magical sense  in ways they could have never imagined  Grade Level  4 8  middle school Genre  Fantasy FictionAwards Honors  Carnegie Medal Nominee  1997 National

was surprised to find I absolutely adored this book I was behind on the films  only watching them up till the goblet of fire   and to be honest  for a lot of my life I didn t really want to get into the wizard world  it didn t entertain me But  after reading the philosophers stone  I regret all my life choices on not reading Harry Potter  It was incredible  it had me hooked on the first page Harry Potter  if you didn t know  is a young boy who lives with his uncle and aunt due to his parents being murdered by an evil wizard  To his great surprise he gets told by Hagrid  groundskeeper of Hogwarts  he s a wizard and he will soon attend Hogwarts  school of witchcraft and wizardry  The suspense of the book had me keeping on turning the pages  as I haven t seen the first film for over 3 years   I highly  highly recommend picking up this book if you haven t  The writing is very easy to read  and the characters are so loveable   even if you weren t a fan on the films the books are so much better  This book is a well deserving 5 stars and I can t wait to continue on my journey in the wizard world  I just fell in love with all over again  3 Sara che la mia stravecchissima edizione ha ancora  Pecoranera  al posto di Corvonero e  il professor Sprite  al posto della  Professoressa Sprite   ma Harry Potter e Harry Potter  poco da farci  cocchi   Rereading this book and I remembered how very much I liked it   The details of this totally imaginary setting are so complete and believable  The characters are likable and I cared about them  The eternal good versus evil battle reminded me why this book stayed with me the first time I read it  This time I listened to the audiobook and felt that the reader s voices gave the story another whole dimension   I don t think I ve read through the Harry Potter series since library school  There s always so much to read  I never really have time to stop and reread my favorites  Well  there s been a Harry resurgence among my students this year  so I thought that I could go through the series again without any guilt  I mean  my students are into it and I need to be fresh on my Harry  It s good to be home at Hogwarts again  Every time I re read this book I am once again astounded by the magic and scope of this story  This illustrated version offered EVEN MORE magic to this fantastic story and I can t wait to collect them all over the coming years  This is the best treat a Harry Potter fan could ask for  besides maybe a flash forward additional novel     Creo que es un libro excelente  aunque me pilla un poco mayor  Con lo que ahora se  veo que es un libro muy bien pensado y estructurado  que te va dejando pequenas pistas y chicles en la repisa  que luego sabe conjugar muy bien y reunirlos de forma que las piezas encajen  He visto que pasa por encima de algunos problemas que podria traer una resolucion mas  real  de las dificultades  y el enfrentamiento al final podria haber sido resuelto con magia por parte del antagonista  pero bueno  no hay que olvidar que es un libro que esta pensado para lectores jovenes y que no se plantean cuestiones complejas y formas de resolver conflictos  El protagonista sigue un clasico viaje del heroe  algo esterotipado cuando se tiene mucho bagaje  pero que sabe apoyarse bien en sus aliados  Ron y Hermion  Se ve una evolucion incompleta  pero entendible viendo que se trata de una saga Voy a seguir con los siguientes hasta completar la coleccion   Hogwarts  Hogwarts  Hoggy Warty Hogwarts Teach us something please Whether we be old and bald Or young with scabby knees    Everybody has read the Harry Potter series  if you haven t  you are considered an embarrassment to you and your family  Well  I must admit this situation is rather awkward  I m seventeen years old and I ve just read the first Harry Potter book  There s no need to be cruel towards me though  I ve heard them all  yes  I know what I was missing  yes  I know I m an  uncultured swine  and I now know what people mean when they call me a mudblood  No more can these insults affect me though  I can consider myself a wizard expert  a transfiguration genius  or a potion master  When Harry Potter was a baby he was left on his perfectly normal Aunt Petunia s and Uncle Vernon s doorstep  his parents died in devastating car crash  Petunia  Vernon  and their pudgy son Dursley were perfectly ordinary  which explains the horrible treatment they gave to the boy who slept under the stairs  From the beginning Harry knew he didn t belong to this family  he always longed for friends  adventure  and love  which is exactly what he got on his eleventh birthday in an envelope addressed to him   Dear Mr  Potter  We are pleased to inform that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry   This explained everything to Harry  why his family hated him  why strange unexplainable events occurred all around him  why he always felt more than just normal  Harry Potter was a wizard  a full blown spell casting wizard  What adventures lie at Hogwarts  What kinds of people will Harry meet  And what dangers lurk at this magical school  I picked up this book purely out of peer pressure  I am full of regret for not reading this as a younger child who would have enjoyed this book a thousand times more than I did  Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Philosophers Stone is a book anyone could find themselves reading in one sitting  Action packed and drama inclusive  Harry Potter delivers to every possible out there  J  K  Rowlings Harry Potter teaches her audience that sometimes in life  even though things may seem tough  you have to keep your head up because there is always someone casting  lumos  at the end of a dark tunnel     our heads could do with filling With some interesting stuff For now they re bare and full of air Dead flies and bits of fluff So teach us things worth knowing Bring back what we ve forgot Just do your best  we ll do the rest And learn until our brains all rot   First read in 1999  thanks to my friend Laurie  an early discoverer of HP  She also lent me the second book  I don t think the third book had been published  I have the series in hardback  cause I just loved them and knew I would want to read them again  I ve wanted to reread the series for the past year especially I imagine I know everything about HP but I ve forgotten a lot  Reread January 2015   Wow Firstly  I can t begin to express how much I regret not having read this book sooner  seeing as it s been around now for a long while  but better late than never  I suppose Secondly  what can I say about Harry Potter that hasn t already been said throughout the millions of reviews preceding this one  I found the story so engrossing  even though I ve seen the films  and am a big fan of the writing style  too  It s very engaging  and I can see how the book appeals to readers of all ages  I loved the characters even more in the book than I did in the film  as well  which is always a good sign  and I m really excited to crack on with the second in the series  If the rest of the books are anything like the first in terms of pacing  flow  and engagement  then I fancy I ll have the entire series done and dusted within no time To conclude  one of the easiest five star ratings I ve given this year  Harry Potter  it s been a pleasure  I look forward to seeing you again soon in the Chamber of Secrets  Siempre es bueno volver a formar parte de un mundo tan maravilloso  lleno de risas  despreocupaciones  amistades verdaderas  sorpresas y peligros a la vuelta de la esquina    sin mencionar todos los comentarios de Ron  Fred y George Weasley  y las narraciones de los partidos de Quiddich de Lee Jordan custodiado por la Prof  McGonagall  En lo personal  me habia olvidado de la gran participacion y la gran valentia  aunque demostrada de forma totalmente personal  de Neville  fue una sorpresa que se me hizo muy grata  Bueno  puedo decir que este es el personaje que mas me sorprendio  pero siempre teniendo en cuenta que todos los personajes que se presentan son vibrantes y expresan detalladamente lo que la escritora desde un principio quiso que expresaran  Dudo que exista alguien que no quiera formar parte de la familia Weasley y recibir un sweater para Navidad  Pero por otra parte  odio a Malfoy   Re Reading this book  as always  was amazing  Also reading it with a friend made it even more fun  I have read this one the most out of the series probably because it really makes me remember how much I love this series  I think watching Harry gain hope and experience love in a world where his hope and love was ripped from him makes me remember that words are just as magical as the spells in this book  The Mirror of Erised chapter always makes me a blubbering mess  Every time I ve read this book as an adult I m reminding how ABSOLUTELY ANNOYING Hermione is as a character which is perfect because she grows up to be one of my top favorite characters in the series  I love seeing these characters as little kids because you know how amazing and inspiring they are going to turn out to be  I cannot wait to read the next book  It s been a few years since I ve read the other books in this series so im excited to go back to Hogwarts   re read October 28th   29th 2015 Loved participating in  HarryXmasToYou last year and decided this year I would listen to all the audio books  In order to do this I decided I should start early to prepare for wait times  Love rereading these books  I always notice something new  I never realized how many foreshadowing points there were in the first book  Just love this world so much   I read this series over several years  quickly picking up the latest as it came out  By the time I got to the Deathly Hallows  I realized I needed to read them again  Everyone was talking about all the clues that were in the books that led to the final conclusion and I felt like I would enjoy going through the series all over again  I m listening to them all in audio and loving them   The Potters smiled and waved at Harry and stared hungrily back at them  his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall right through it and reach them  He had a powerful kind of ache inside him  half joy  half terrible sadness Still 5 stars the second time around       rereading JIT for GR TFG Christmas book discussion on the 21st    Adorei ler este livro e passar por todas as ilustracoes  foi mesmo fantastico  O livro foi sem duvida melhor que o filme  mas agora fiquei com vontade de o ver novamente  Nao pensei que a historia em certas partes fosse tao diferente e  tao boa   Love the illustrated version of this book  These pictures were fan freaking tastic  I really love this story  I can t wait to see the second book    Una edicion preciosa  3 Siempre es un placer releer a Harry Potter  pero asi mas aun    Inhalt  Als junges Waisenkind wird Harry Potter von seinen Verwandten  den Dursleys  aufgenommen und aufgezogen  Doch eine schone Kindheit sind anders aus  Er wird lediglich geduldet  von seiner Tante als Kuchenhilfe missbraucht  von seinem Onkel grosstenteils ignoriert und von seinem Cousin Dudley regelmassig gepiesackt  Kurz vor seinem elften Geburtstag erhalt Harry einen Brief   den ersten Brief seines Lebens aber auch den wichtigsten Brief seines Lebens  Er wurde an einer Schule angenommen  von der er noch nie etwas gehort hat  Hogwarts  die Schule fur Hexerei und Zauberei  Und der Uberbringer seines Briefes  der Halbriese Hagrid  verrat Harry das grosste Geheimnis seines Lebens  Harry Potter ist kein gewohnlicher Junge  nein  Harry Potter ist ein Zauberer  wie schon seine verstorbenen Eltern  Trotz grosser Proteste der Dursleys begibt sie Harry endlich in seine Welt  die Welt der Zauberer  und das Abenteuer seines Lebens beginnt        Zitat    Auf Harry Potter   den Jungen  der lebt    mein Eindruck  Leider kam vor 20 Jahren bei mir kein Brief an    ich geh also davon aus  dass ich irgendwie durch das Raster gefallen bin  Ich bleibe also weiter eine geheime  wilde Hexe   hehe  Aber nun zum wesentlichen    Dieses Re Read ging mir so einfach von der Hand  Ich liebe die Geschichte um Harry  Ron und Hermine noch immer und hore unheimlich gern die Horbucher  gelesen von Rufus Beck   So kam es auch  dass ich wahrend des Lesens die markante Stimme von Rufus Beck im Kopf hatte  aber das war nicht schlimm  denn er schafft es aus einem Horbuch ein Horspiel zu machen  falls noch nicht geschehen  unbedingt anhoren   Geschrieben fur junge Menschen  ist es aber auch fur   Altere  noch immer eine  Lese  Reise wert  Die magische Welt verzauberte mich erneut und ich habe das Buch quasi verschlungen  Viele Kleinigkeiten sind mir wieder aufgefallen und das mag ich besonders an einem Re Read  denn oft hat man doch die Filmversion vor Augen und im Buch ist vieles genauer  detaillierter und auch ein wenig anders beschrieben Wer es nicht kennt  muss es lesen  sorry  aber gibt es diese Menschen wirklich noch  die Harry Potter nicht kennen       muss es horen und am Ende die grossartigen Filme ansehen     What a fantastic read   I give this book 5 stars The book is about Harry  a little of his life before he discovered he was a wizard  and then his first year at Hogwarts  He goes on many adventures at Hogwarts  but his biggest problem is getting the Sorcerer s Stone away from Voldemort  In the end he succeeds and becomes the hero   Harry  Nasty  common name  if you ask me   7 This quote shows how Harry s fake family treats him throughout the story  It also shows that Harry will live a tough childhood  Also it helps to remind the reader that he isn t living with his real parents   We couldve all been killed  or worse  expelled   162 This quote shows that the characters love their school and would never want to leave  In other words she s saying she d rather be dead than be alive if she can t be at the school  It also shows the continuing occurrence of problems they ve had while being there  It s probably a waste of time to review the most reviewed book on the planet  but why not  It s easy  HP is well written  The characters are colorful  different from each other  and well developed  The story is second to none  and the world J K  Rowling has creating is magnificent  If there is no such thing as perfect  this first installment of HP deserves a very modest 4 99  Nuff said  Finished reading this to a class of 7th graders this week  Only one kid had read the book and only half had seen the movie  They absolutely loved it  How wonderful to be able to turn a new generation onto Harry Potter  And how completely gratifying to hear a kid say   This has so much more in it than the movie   Yes  yes it does  my young friend  Welcome to the world of books  This was a reread  of course  made so much more magical with the incredible illustrations by Jim Kay  It was so much fun to visualize the world and characters in a new way with the help of the illustrations  I am excited for this series all over again as I eagerly anticipate the rest of the books to be rereleased with Jim Kay s interpretation of the HP universe 5 stars  Todo nino de 11 anos deberia leer Harry Potter Como a muchos en mi generacion este fue el libro que hizo que me gustara leer definitivamente  J K  tiene la habilidad especial de atraparte en una historia y no soltarte  de hacerte decir a las 3 a m  un capitulo mas no mas y juro que me voy a dormir  que manana me tengo que levantar temprano El resto  todos lo sabemos  P  I have read this book already and loved it but now  it s time to introduce Molly to the wonders of HP  She already likes the first few films but didn t know they were books  Excited much   I am SO glad I was pushed into reading this  I don t know why I avoided it for so long  Perche ancora nel 2014 abbiamo bisogno di Storie  perche una lettrice di 23 anni non e troppo vecchia per entusiasmarsi per immergersi nella magia di un Avventura  di quelle che fino all ultima pagina ti lasciano con il fiato sospeso  http   justanotherpoint wordpress com    Para mi  cuando estaba mas joven  los libros de esta saga  no me llamaban la atencion  Y las peliculas tampoco  Pero hace unos dias  decidi  ver la pelicula  me gusto bastante  Entonces fue cuando decidi  empezar a leer los libros  Cabe decir que la pelicula esta muy apegada a la historia de el libro  Es una lectura super facil   ligera 100  Recomendado 5 5 Estrellas  As if I needed another reason to reread Harry Potter The artwork in this edition is beautiful  and I thought the layout of the art was really well done  Nearly every page had an illustration of some sort  from small drawings that were scattered around the paragraphs on the page to huge two page paintings that made me pause to enjoy the detail of the work  There was the occasional full page illustration that stood alone with no text from the story occupying the same space  but most of the pages featured interwoven elements of story and art Aside from keeping the American  Sorcerer s Stone  title  the rest of the book kept the British English of the original publication  with all of the mentions of jumpers  sherbet lemons  colours  and flavours intact  This is the first time I ve read the book this way  and I liked being able to notice where changes had been made to the American version  It is a bit of a head scratcher though as to why the original title wasn t used as well I have to admit that when I heard this version was coming out I was a bit skeptical  that is to say sceptical  about this being yet another cash grab by Scholastic to get Harry Potter fanboys  read  me  to buy another copy of a book they already own  The last reissue of the trade editions featured new cover art  but were hardly worth the extra two bucks they were charging for them  This edition however  is well thought out and worth buying  JK Rowling s first book in the Harry Potter series  Harry Potter and the Philosopher Stone  is truly a magical story that never fails to attract me to read over and over Harry Potter s parents passed away when he was a baby  and his Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia tell him that it was due to a car accident  He was living with them both  and his cousin Dudley  ever since his real parents passing  Everyone in his household treats him poorly  they make him sleep in a small room under the stairs  make him do the most chores  etc  Harry started receiving letters  surprisingly  as he never does  He was soon brought to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry  due to the fact that his parents were wizards  as well  Not has his Uncle and Aunt have been keeping things from him  like that he s a WIZARD   but they ve also lied about events in his life  ex  his parents passing  Throughout the book  Harry learns more about himself  he meets new and different people in the wizard world  he learns what REALLY happened during his parents death  he learns about the one who shall not be named and so much more This book is perfect for anyone  Its a brilliantly written story that still seems to interest me no matter how many times I ve read it   I also recommend the whole book series  of course   So great to finally reread this series from the very beginning again  I used to reread before the release of a new book but I haven t gone all the way back to book 1 since the release of Order of the Phoenix in 2003  That s 12 years you guys  I haven t read this book in TWELVE years  That s insane and it was just as good as I remember  On to Chamber of Secrets     I love this series  It maybe my favorite book series of all time  I ve been reading the Harry Potter books since they came out  I grew up with Harry Potter and that is something special  What s also special is now sharing these books with my children  I LOVE that my sons LOVE Harry Potter too  I can t wait to read or listen to the rest of the series with them      I had previously written a review for this but apparently Goodreads decided that it has to disappear since I read it again Anyway  this is my fourth time reading this book and there really isn t much to tell The basic thing to say is  no matter how many times I read this book  I will forever enjoy it and perhaps enjoy it even more than the previous time I really appreciate EVERYTHING J K  Rowling has done for our generation  These books will never ever leave me and I will always go back to them The characters grew up with us  This book will just make you nostalgic over and over  One thing I particularly LOVED reading this time was the humorous moments in this book  I love the natural connection between the characters and their funny moments  J K  Rowling has a unique sense of humor that can save lives Once a Harry Potter fan  always a Harry Potter fan  I m a Harry Potter addict  Loved every single movie and watched them all more than 10 times and if they re on  I wouldn t mind watching them again  That s how much I love  Harry Potter   And now that I ve read the first book I m more in love with story  Witches and withchcraft are things that ll automatically pull me into reading a book or watching a film   I read this book for the first time when I was 10  I m now 24  I ve read the book hundreds of times since and the feeling I first got when I read it still remains  I waited for my acceptance letter  It still breaks my heart  This book started a lifetime of love for this story and the characters  I will forever be a fan  I wish I could give it a million stars  Sure  I ve read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone previously  And yes  I am 28  BUT WHAT A GREAT BOOK  I realized that I didn t remember as much of the plot as I should  and with the announcement of the new book  and finishing my written comprehensive exams   I thought it was an appropriate time to reread the first Harry Potter novel  On to number 2  All the Harry Potter books are equally wonderful  However  I think the earlier books are my favorites as all the magic and strange and wonderful things are new to Harry and also the reader  We get to experience this just as Harry does  Later on the books become darker so the innocence of these earlier discoveries is lost  But for now  they are alot of fun   I think I ve never been that excited to read a book  I ve been waiting for years to read Harry Potter and my patience was worth it  even though I currently own only the first book of the series  I m surely going to buy the boxed set in April   May   It was such an easy read  though I have finished the book pretty late because of my bloody lack of motivation  Ignoring this  I have found one word to describe the lecture  AMAZING  Although I hated the Dursleys so freaking much  I was very relieved when Hagrid took Harry away from them  because they were one hell of a really bad family  I really liked the way Harry was brought into the world of wizardry and witchcraft  with all those strange but mysterious places  wands and potions  purebloods and mudbloods  students and professors  everything was purely amazing  To be honest  Quidditch is one of my favourite things from this magical world   The conflict between the characters was impressing  J K Rowling succeeded into giving you the wrong idea of who the real enemy was  and I find this wonderful  I never expected such a plot twist  About the little conflicts  I would say that I LOVE the  I may say  hate between Harry and Draco and I laughed my heart out when Ron fought with Malfoy and Neville with Crabbe   Goyle   The houses were a thing that I really liked  I mean  you get sorted into a place with people that are like you  isn t that awesome  But I kind of disliked how easily you could ve lost points  Let s not forget about Snape who would take off points from Gryffindor everytime he had the ocassion  Man  I underestimated him  even if he is still a bad person  Another thing that I LOVED was the Weasley family  please adopt me  Mrs  Weasley   Aren t they great  Wearing matching sweaters every Christmas and every single one of the gingers being such an amazing and wonderful person and can I be a part of that family  pretty please   About the ending  THAT WAS NUTS  And I m not talking about the Philosopher s Stone and stuff  I am talking about HOW SLYTHERINS BECAME THE FREAKING LOSERS IN JUST ONE SECOND  thank you  Dumbledore   I think that s enough   cause if it was to talk more about this  I would never stop  c   Joprojam 5  gan no manis  gan mazajiem klausitajiem This series is my favorite series of all time  I love it  It takes place at Hogwarts School of Witch Craft and Wizardry  My favorite character is Hermione Granger  She is smart and helpful  This book would have had to be THE book for me  The one that started my thirst for reading  It was read to me when I was young by my mother  and from that moment on I have never looked back  Today  this book is still as awesome to me as it was all those years ago  Definitely one of my most favourite reads  and definitely recommended to EVERYONE  Rereading po dvoch rokoch a prvykrat po anglicky  Malo to v sebe nejake caro  aj ked sparne leto citil som sa ako pred trinastimi rokmi pod stromcekom  ked som objavil HP   Bolo to krasne citanie  a tie anglicke hardbacky zo signature edition sa citaju bozsky  Esteze mame so Simonou pakt a tak mozem s cistym svedomim pokracovat dalej     No hay palabras para describir este libro tan maravilloso y perfecto  por su historia  sus personajes  sus valores y todo el universo que hay detras de el y se esconde entre sus paginas  La unica que podria acercarse un poco seria MAGICO  I choose this book to read because it had nice cover  This book is called Harry Potter and the sorcerers stone and the author of the book is JK Rollin and this book is about Harry s adventure The story is token in the school Hogwarts  The main character is harry and his two friend Hermione and Ron  Harry is the only guy who was not dead from the curse of boldimorts and he has a scar on his fore head  Hermione is a really smart girl and she has mugle parents  Ron has a red hair and he has a rat  The book is mostly about harry potter having a adventure or escaping from Boldimort This book is the best book because it makes me feel the way the character does and because it makes me exciting  My best part was when Harry was playing the chess at the last I think this book is for kids because it has many unbelievable things happening and i would rate this book 9 10  Non ho nessunissima intenzione di dire qualcosa di spiacevole nei confronti della Rowling o di Harry Potter  Harry Potter  1 e stato il primo fantasy che ho letto in tutta la mia breve vita  se non ricordo male  e devo dire che non potevo fare scelta piu azzeccata ADORO questo libro piu del film  se devo esser sincera  I purchased the book series for my children  at the time 4 of the 7 books had been released  I will admit it took a bit to get through the first 3 or 4 chapters  but once I got past that point I was hooked J K Rowling re ignited my flame for reading  She not only makes it fun but transports you into the magical world of Harry Potter  This is one of my all time favorite books  I reread it for my reading challenge and it has made me want to read the entire series over again  It is one of the best young adult books out there in my opinion and I hope that everybody picks it up to read Reading Challenge 5 pts  read a book you haven t read in more than 10 years  At the beginning  I was like  Harry Potter  Absolute rubbish  After devouring the first book  however  made me feel guilty for not reading it ages ago Anyway  I recommend this book to everyone I am genuinely at bliss to say that J K  Rowling made a job very well done for the writing was simplistic  yet satisfyingly full of life  What else needs to be said about these books  JK Rowling created a wonderful world that was magical AND believable  I am always appreciative of her bread crump style of story development  Every time I re read these books  about 8 or 9 times now   I smile at the quick and casual mentions of what becomes important details 3 5 books later   So my parents got me the illustrated edition of Harry Potter for Christmas  and I of course I just had to read it  This is very likely the book I ll be reading to my future 1 5 children  because  obviously  they are going to love reading  and they are going to love Harry Potter The illustrations are really something  and not at all what I had originally expected  They are super colorful and extremely detailed  A couple of them are a little creepy  admittedly  but still  very well done What was really fun was finding little things hidden within the images  For example  I found the Deathly Hallows symbol in 3 different pictures  as well as J K  Rowling s initials  along with a few other notables  scratched into the door frame in the picture of Hermione Granger  Seriously  these pictures are incredibly creative If you are a Harry Potter fan  you must check this edition out  It was very enjoyable and so worth it  Projekt Harry Potter auf Deutsch  1Ik heb nu Harry Potter boeken gelezen in 3 verschillende talen  krijg ik nu een sticker   Ik lijk niet op Hermelien  Ik lijk niet op Hermelien  Ik lijk niet op Hermelien  Wat zou ik dit boek weer graag voor het eerst lezen  als klein meisje werd ik bijna letterlijk betoverd door alle magische dingen die in dit boek gebeuren  Het is erg jammer dat een deel van die magie verdwenen is  en dat ik nostalgisch en oud ben geworden  POndanks dat blijft het een geweldig boek  Aangezien het toch al weer  kuch  echt  neeeeee  zo n 17 jaar geleden is dat ik dit boek las was ik veel van de gebeurtenissen uit het boek vergeten  dus dat maakte dat het nog altijd leuk is om te lezen  Soms is het geen goed idee om je op iets uit je kindertijd te storten waar je goede herinneringen aan hebt  je beoordeeld boeken en verhalen toch anders als kind  maar dit boek is het herlezen meer dan waard  Op naar deel 2  Harry Potter and the Philosopher s StoneBY  J K  RowlingPAGES  352Believe it or not I have only read this book for the first time in 2015 To be honest  Harry Potter never really caught my attention  I never read the books   I was not that interested in magic  LOL  and I only watched the first movie on DVD at a friend s house   Then on 2015 I made this bet with a male friend if I won he would have to read a book by Nicholas Sparks and if he won I would have to read the first Harry Potter book Needless to say    He won and I lost   I was not sure if I wanted to read the book in physical form or digital  since I was not sure I was going to like it     but I went to the bookstore just to browse     and I found this UK new edition with this GEORGEOUS cover and I coulnd t stop myself from buying it That being said  I read the book in 3 days and LOVED it   After years of refusing to read hArry Potter and thanks to a bet  now I am planning on buying the rest of the books on the upcoming months and read the whole series in 2015  There are some things you can t share without ending up liking each other  and knocking out a twelve foot mountain troll is one of them   SOMEONE PLEASE PUNCH ME IN THE FACE  What is wrong with me  I was never interested in reading HP I was so stupid Thanks God my friends persuaded me to open this book J K  Rowling created an awesome world  awesome characters and an interesting plot  Reading HP is like travelling to a magic place  I loved this soooooo much  This is the second time I read the book  the first time out loud to the kids I just love this book  The characters are so well developed  The world Rowling creates is interesting and fun  And I love how it ends  I just love it  This book is moving  and I m grateful for good literature that both my children and I can enjoy  I loved this book  Even more magical than the movie    can t wait to continue the series  I m glad I decided to reread the series this year  It s been a long enough time where things aren t as fresh in my memory  I find myself falling in love with the world  story and characters all over again  Even more is knowing the secret Snape has  He s not as sinister and is easily my most beloved   next to Neville   Hacia muchisimo que no me releia la saga y no recuerdo cuando fue la ultima vez que lei  La piedra filosofal  por lo que mi inseguridad para comentar ciertos temas me hizo proponerme leerla antes de que acabara el ano y la experiencia esta resultando de lo mas curiosa  Regresar como adulta a Hogwarts  ese lugar que se sentia como mi propia casa de pequena  me ha parecido  efectivamente  como volver a un lugar seguro  Hogwarts y el universo de Harry Potter en general forman parte de mi vida  de mi infancia y tengo muchos recuerdos relacionados con ello  por lo que solo puedo tener halagos hacia este inicio tan magico  La piedra filosofal es un comienzo magnifico para todo lo que viene despues  Explica a la perfeccion como es el mundo de los magos y te sumerge en el con el mismo carino con el que sumerge a Harry  Es inevitable emocionarse al entrar en el Gran Comedor o asustarse cuando Harry y Ron tienen que salvar a Hermione del troll  Inevitable es  tambien  ser un poco mas critica con los personajes ya que en mis lecturas anteriores ni siquiera me interesaba entender por que hacian lo que hacian y ahora si que puedo decir que Harry desde el comienzo es un poco egolatra  Pensaba que esta caracteristica se desarrollaba a partir del cuarto libro pero ahora me doy cuenta de que lo tiene desde el mismo momento en que se entera de que es mago  Por otro lado la amistad que forja con Ron y Hermione si que se ve de una manera especial con la edad ya que estos chicos se hacen amigos de una manera que los adultos  por desgracia  perdemos  El resto de personajes y escenarios se nos presentan de forma correcta aunque breve  una simple introduccion para que los eventos futuros no nos pillen de nuevas  En resumen  por si quedaba alguna duda  J K  Rowling escribio un mundo maravilloso en el que ninos y no tan ninos pudieran refugiarse cuando el mundo muggle parece demasiado desolador   It was a blast rereading this book  It s certainly much different coming back to it 15 years later  I think I will be putting myself on a constant schedule of rereading this series Read my full review  and discussion  here  http   voguishatbest blogspot com 201    OK so before I start  I know I m super late to this party and what I say has been said a million times before  I don t know why I haven t read this book before  I just didn t for some reason   start   This book is amazing  it manages to keep its charm  while staying serious and building up to the huge climax  With all of the characters that have completely different personalities  it s hard not to stay fascinated by this awesome book  What I love most about this book is the characters  especially the side characters  there is such a wide variety of characters  There s a fat lady on a wall  there s Hagrid   who I personally think is the funniest of most characters I could go on and on about how interesting everyone in this book is  Other then characters there is also a very good and interesting plot line  I love this book and anyone who hasn t read it yet should  Wow    I have wanted to reread these books for forever and I am now doing it  Rereading Sorcerers Stone is like coming home  All the characters welcome me because this world is where I grew up  I can t even put into world how much this series has influenced and will continue to for as long as I am alive  Just  WOW  I read this book because I saw the movie first  so I was intrigued about the Harry Potter phenomena  First I thought it was going to be one of those strange cases in which the movie is way better than the book  but as I went through the pages  I fell for this little wizard kid  An since then I m totally addicted    So      Excited to discuss this with people who also worship  the Queen  as well as people who are just beginning to be entranced by the magic of this world   Not a proper review   just a great read  Couldn t put it down  I m so glad I waited until now to read these  I m not stuck waiting for months for the next book in the series to come out  I m in love with this alternative universe created by Rowling  and rather sad I m a muggle and can t go to Hogwarts myself   Readers will be taken on a magical journey with lots of up and downs as they enjoy Harry Potter and The Sorcerer s Stone  Even with Harry s rough upbringing and terrible luck  he manages to find great friends and people around him at Hogwarts  What I liked about this books is that they made Harry Potter  the main character  such a lovable person  The setting in this book was awesome  they described Harry s school in such a cool and beautiful way  There was so much irony in this book with Harry and his teacher that it always kept you on your toes  Even though this is a serious book  it is actually very funny which made it enjoyable for me  I recommend this book for people who enjoy magic and childish humor  However I do not recommend to people who need something exciting to happen at the very beginning of the book to get into it  I teared up when finishing this   It was truly very beautiful  Rereading this book for the  what  fifth time  Each time I look back on  Harry Potter and the Sorceror s Stone   I love it more and more  I really enjoy watching Harry grow and mature as a boy to a wizard to a young man throughout the series  and this book was the start of it all  I love it so much   This is the book historians will point out and say  Here started the change   This is the gateway to torrents of YA and child heroes  This is also my first novel  that I can recall  Through the years  it stayed there  through mathematics  Jules Verne and Asimov  to remind me that there is always more  Lived up to its fame  I really loved it  the humour  the friendships and the adventures all tied together with flawless literacy skills   This edition is so beautiful and I loved the illustrations they really made the story come alive in a different way and I really enjoyed re reading this again  I can t wait until all the other books are released its nice to have the experience of waiting for the next hp book to be published again   4 5 5It s 2015 and I just now decided to read Harry Potter    pathetic  I know  For the first 100 pages or so  I was really hesitant about whether I would enjoy the book or not  But once more things started happening  I totally saw what the hype was about  Loved it and can t wait to continue  I decided to reread this book  because I never finished this series and just wanted to read it in english  Especially since I m Slytherin I really emphasized with the those  bad  characters  even though Draco und the rest are hard to identify with  especially at the beginning But seriously  Hermoine  In the german version Hermoine is called Hermine  which is  at least in my opinion  way better  But this was me during the book  When I started the book  When I finished the book and got the second one   image error My favorite character was and will always be Severus Snape and because of the actors death  Let s raise our wands   An ultimate sacrifice for a single  innocent life  The love of a mother and her baby knows no bonds  even stopping the most powerful of dark wizards    Harry Potter  treated like an unwanted dog  he lives in his closet under the stairs  He must live with his cousin  and aunt and uncle  who hate everything about magic  His life gets thrown upside down when Hagrid brings him to Hogwarts  His life is better than living with the Dursleys  He learns how to perform magic  at a basic level  and must discover what a large three headed dog is guarding  He meets his best friends here  Ron and Hermione  There are so many climaxes  you can barely tell when falling action ends and where rising action starts  There is a definite air of mystery going on  and there is action everywhere  J K  Rowling did an amazing job with the entire book  she carved a world out of the pages  Every time I flipped the page  I couldn t wait till I could flip to the next one  I wanted    no    I needed to find out what was going to happen  Any age  Any age can read this  Adult  child  teenager  They will all love it the same  Unless they are a muggle  It is a magical adventure that I loved to embark on  let s do it again  I ve reread these books a few times and it just baffles me how they hold up after so many reads  Love the foreshadowing Rowling puts in this first installment and really sets the scene for the rest of the series  The world  the characters  the humor are just as excellent as I remember   What a wonderful world JK Rowling has created  and it s ingeniously interconnected with our own  Set partly in London  a dull suburb and the magical and exciting Hogwarts  Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone truly ignites and engages the imagination  for a huge range of age groups  myself included  This book has something for every age group and the pace and excitement are sustained throughout  The characters are wonderful  from typical spoilt brat Dudley to the wise wizard that is Albus Dumbledore  they are brought to life by Rowling with her wonderful descriptions and the injection of sharp humour that she uses so a very well  The triad of Harry and his new found friends is wonderful as well  Stereotypical characters  for example the bookworm  Hermione   and Ron the unfortunate  hand me down middle child  all have unexpected traits that really bring them to life  This book is a real page turner  and every child  muggle born or not will want to attend the magical Hogwarts school of Wizardry   Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone Harry Potter lives a miserable life with his aunt and uncle  the Dursleys and his cousin  Dudley makes his life even worse  Until one day when a special letter arrives from an owl for Harry to join a wizard school  So Harry s journey begins with magic every where  He makes friends and is welcomed to a new sport that helps him become a star  But Harry finds some secrets of his past life  Will he face the encounter   and survive Read to find out  I would totally recommend this book to others  especially to people who enjoy fantasy and reading  I agree with most of the other reviews about this book and how it is in my opinion the best fantasy book that anybody will ever read  Enjoy   J K  Rowling is one of my favorite author  so this book got ten stars in my book  I love to read young adult books  and when you add in adventure and magic  they re even better  Harry Potter is a classic story in my house and when I had the chance to read it I was thrilled  This was a good book don t get me wrong  but me as a teen would have liked to see a little more action and high risk behaviors  Another problem I had with this book was it did not give much background knowledge  In the book it talked about how Harry Potters parents were killed by Voldemort  But little background is given on that subject  You also are kind of left hanging on his whole family before that event as well  Besides from these minor flaws I loved this book and would recommend it to a friend   It s so amazing that this book gets me excited and awed even I ve read it for about 5 times  Truly one of the modern classics that everyone should read Love the plot and all the magical stuff  especially Quidditch  Favorite characters go to the Weasley Twins and Hermione and Wood  Obviously still a 5   obviously still amazing  I don t think it needs a proper review  I mantain my usual statement  no one is too old to read this  Thank you to Ms Rowling for giving us an awesome world where to go  when the real one lacks the magic we need in our lives   3 It doesn t matter how many times I read these books  how many times I dive into this world  it keeps on being my favourite series of all time  it will always be  I guess all I can say is thank you Jo  Thank you for the wonderful memories  thank you for my childhood really      Love  love  love this book  It s a classic and it never gets old to re read  As soon as I see the the start on the first chapter I get shivers  Can t put it down till I finish the last sentence on the last page    I m going to have a lot of fun with Dudley this summer        What more can I say other than ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS I VE EVER READ      Everything was top notch like the world we ve been introduced too  every single one of the characters  and the plot  I can literally find nothing wrong with the book so I ll just leave it at this  wow   I ve already re read it a few times  but not for a few years  I can t even possibly describe how much I love this series  I ll be forever grateful to the author  who showed me the power of imagination  made me love books and made my childhood better  growing up with Harry  funny that it took me just last week to read J K famous book harry potter  im not the usual follower of a series type book but to tell everyone  i guess i d better give it a 5 star  i m truly amazed with Rowling s imagination looking forward in watching the movies too  LOL  ndm shhdt lfylm lm y jbny kthyr wj lny krh lqS lhdh knt thrb dy m mn qry

the whole series by listening to the audiobooks and it was the beeeest  It was my first time listening to an audiobook  and it was  by far  amazing  It was more real and magical hearing the characters  voices and it feels like they are with me  This was amazing  It was like reading it for the first time  All the illustrations were so beautiful  Every time I saw one it was my new favourite until I saw the next one  I cannot wait for the rest of them even though I ll be at least 27 before I have them all   I began this series hesitantly when I was 14 and continued on as they were published  Now at 26  I am going back and listening to the audio books  or reading as time permits  and I may be more enthralled now than I was then  No one is too old for Harry Potter  O  I loved going back to Hogwards  It was also lovely to see how Rowling s style of writing has changed over time  this first novel clearly being meant for younger children than the last three volumes  I guess the writing sort of grew with the audience of the series  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s StoneJ K  RowlingScholastic  1997Summary  Harry Potter is an orphan living with his cruel uncle  aunt  and cousin on Privet Drive in England  Shortly before his eleventh birthday  he receives a flurry of strange letters  Despite his uncle s attempts to circumvent them  these letters keep coming until one night when a strange man called Hagrid appears in their doorway  He tells Harry that is a wizard  destined to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry  Escaping his life with the Dursleys  Harry goes off to school and finds himself quickly plunged into a world of magic  mayhem  mystery  and no small helping of danger Genre  Modern FantasyContent Warnings  Some scary imagery  character death  child endangerment  child abuse neglect My Opinion  Well  This is the book that started the entire Harry Potter phenomenon  It s interesting reading these books sequentially  because you can tell that Rowling evolved her writing style in order to fit the aging taste of her initial readership  This book has a much simpler style than the books in the series that follow  and is fairly lighthearted compared to the final books in the series  Even though Sorcerer s Stone is much  fluffier  than the rest of the series  it will always be one of my favorites  second only to Order of the Phoenix  which I adore for reasons I can t fully explain   This book WAS my childhood  and re reading it  it has become my adulthood as well  It s timeless and I will always love it for that  and for a million other reasons   This is just the beginning of a great series I look forward to reading    I wish I would have liked reading when I was younger but it s never to late to start a good book  am I right  I can t think of any words to describe how amazing this book is just PERFECT  D What can I say about these books that hasn t already been said  Definitely worth the read  and I love how the author set everything up for the next books  That s how a series should be  not a made up as you go along type of thing  Love the plot execution as well    I haven t read this in such a long time but it s  harryxmastoyou  I forgot how many things were in the book and not in the movie  absolutely loved it of course  Brilliance from J K Rowling this world is magical and I love how funny Ron is his comments are too good   I did not read this book at first cause it seemed like everybody wanted me to  but after a while I decided to try it  After I read it I loved it and can not wait to read the next one  I think everybody who has not read this book should  It is a great book  There s really nothing more I can say about Harry Potter that hasn t been said a thousand times  I just love to re read this series  to get back into the wizarding world is so easy and pleasant  I could read these books for the rest of my life and never get bored  In my opinion  there is no better book than the Harry Potter series  Not for the grammar  not for the world building  creative twist on old things  or anything like that  But for the values that were instilled in this book  the value of family and friendship   In this first book we re introduced to all the amazing characters and this magical world  It s such a cute and charming book  It s the beginning of it all  I love love love it I m always either listening to the HP audio books or re reading the books  Love them  It s been 2 3 years since my last reread and of course it still deserves five shining stars  The illustrations in this are so beautiful and it s been a really great and different reading experience  Can t wait for the other books to come out in this edition  It s been 17 years since I first read Harry Potter and I have forgotten a few things that happened in this book  but it s still a fun and brilliant read  Re reading the entire series this year because I can and also because I miss this world so much    AMAZING    Loved it  Obviously  rereading Harry Potter to spoil myself with the feeling of coming home and christmas and just plain old warm fuzzy feelings  was one of the best ideas I had this year  It s crazy  but it s true   just opening this book up feels like magic  The illustrations are beautiful  Can t wait for the other books     Pre ordered it and got it on the 6th itself  Jim Kay s illustrations are absolutely gorgeous  I have been drooling over this book ever since I got it and looks like I ll do nothing better over the weekend as well  A must have for every Harry Potter fan  Oh my god  My Favourite  I m loving it  Looking forward for the next book        So light a fire   Harry choked   Yes    of course    but there s no wood   Hermione cried  wringing her hands   HAVE YOU GONE MAD   Ron bellowed   ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT   It s perfect  it s just so much perfect that i cant wait to read the next book I am already obsessed with this author and what she had done to me  Omg I forgot to update on this i finished this weeks ago AND TOTALLY A 5 5 STARS So I had this overwhelming feeling to re read the series for months now and finally I started It always feels great to get back to how it all started  I really have no idea why I rated this book 3 stars before  this is definitely a 5 stars book      I ve done it    This was so much fun  It was a simple story but so magical all the same  You definitely get a better feel for Dumbledore in the book  There is also a much larger showing of Hermione s cleverness and need to succeed  Loved every second of it   So I ve re read this for about the 3rd of 4th time and it amazes me that even after all those times of reading it  I can still feel as passionately about this book as I did the first  second  third and forth time J K Rowling is quite honestly a genius  This book is totally unfaultable  lacks in nothing  excels in everything The characters come to life  the location comes to life  everything in this book comes to life  it s as though you ve been totally swept into an alternative lifestyle  one that could almost be believable due to JK s ability to transport you so effectively I will keep on reading and re reading this series  This is the best series in the world and I could read this book one hundred times and it still wouldn t be boring  Such a great introduction to the world of Harry Potter  I don t know why it has taken me so long to start this series  but I m glad I have  I truly felt like I was a part of Hogwarts alongside Harry  Ron  and Hermione  I ll be starting year two immediately  I didn t expect to like Harry Potter this much  I have watched the movie and I liked it all right  so I thought reading the book wouldn t be that much fun  since  like  I know what s going to happen and junk  But it wasn t like that  I did know what was going to happen  yet I couldn t put the book down  I read it in  like  couple of hours  To the people in Tehran subway system who saw me reading this book and looked like  you re a grown up for whatever s sake and you re not supposed to read children s books   I DON T GIVE A   a heck  what else   about what you think  Okay  And I m going to buy all the other 6  or 7  no sure  Harry Potters and read them all  thank you very much  Okay  I don t have anything else to say Goodbye  When I first read this book  I had no idea what I was getting myself into or how it would influence my life  Reading the illustrated version of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone is likely the closest I will get to experiencing this story for the first time again  and I am so happy that they re rereleasing the entire series in this way  Admittedly  part of me was afraid that the book wouldn t live up to what I remembered  This was foolish  It exceeded all of my expectations  and I found myself getting emotional when characters were introduced  nearly lost it when Molly Weasley walked up  or during moments that I had forgotten happened  Neville took on Goyle and Crabbe    Reading this felt like visiting friends I had not seen in a very long time  It was a long overdue reread  The storyline went much faster than I remembered  and I found myself literally flying through the chapters  Knowing what this book is setting up leaves me in awe of J K  Rowling and how intricately plotted this series is   British literary Dame A  S  Byatt s bitter criticism of adult Harry Potter readers has caused a lot of controversy  Before I had actually read the Potter books  I shared some of her sentiments  to be sure  But then I started reading  and got to the point of no return  Traditional fairy stories  tales of secondary worlds  extraordinary and improbable tales of adventure  fables  legends  and myths   which have their roots in oral tradition and possess layers of traditional wisdom and primal undercurrents  are what Byatt calls  real magic  and  mystery   And they are admittedly wonderful things  However  there is room for peaceful coexistence with the new light tradition mix   which she terms  ersatz    if only for the reason of knowingly escaping or dodging the bullets of the seriously  wild  traditional  The appeal shared by all these forms light and tamed or deep and untamed as they may be   is the underlying romance pattern which will work its powerful magic time and again  Quests  battles between good and evil  a circle of friends and helpers  the all conquering hero  the pursuit of vengeance  the overcoming of difficult tasks etc  are addictive and carry an inherent universal message in their own right  Rowling s stories may not possess the complexity Byatt would wish for but they are quite well written and engaging  So go ahead and enjoy the Harry Potter tales about the boy wizard s quest  I know I did  I cannot believe i missed out on this book for so long This was such an entertaining read  I am starting to understand what the hype was all about   3 Here s my confession  I only read the first four Harry Potter books as a young kid  and remembered next to nothing about them  I was a straight up Lord of the Rings nerd  still am  big time  so I completely ignored Harry Potter  didn t go to midnight premieres or wait like crazy for the next book  Now  as an adult  I ve decided to start over and give it another go  It s not that I ever hated this series  I just had other things I was interested in  I enjoyed it  though  More than I thought I would  I flew through it  of course  The friendship and immersive magical world of Hogwarts is so comforting  and it feels like you re involved and living there yourself  I m going to attempt to make my way through the series back and forth this year   for some reason the app isn t letting me specify that this is the Jim Kay illustrated version  but if you can get your hands on that copy I definitely recommend it  the art is so sweet and heartwarming  it feels very true to the Harry Potter world   OH  MY  GOODNESS  Why had I not read this book sooner       A    goes to this novel  I was engulfed by this book from the very FIRST page  AND OH MAN  I laughed SO MUCH  my parents thought I was going insane    A     that s all I have to say   You know a book is really good when you read it many times  watched the movies even more time  discussed it over and over again with friends  went around Edimburgh to see what inspired JKR and you are still amazed and you still can t put it down   Po anglicky je to tak trochu citat ako po prvykrat   take drobne rozdiely  ale hned to clovek vnima uplne inak    Poznamka  Ci ma clovek 25 te alebo 100  narodeniny  Harry Potter je vzdy skvely darcek  hlavne s takymi krasnymi obalkami   D   E com 20 anos nunca e tarde para comecar a ler HP     The first time I read this  I was not yet old enough to understand the magic and goddess that is JK Rowling  I re read the book today and finally understood why it s a modern day classic  5 STARS FOR YOU JK ROWLING  YOU GO GIRL luv these books  3 I can t believe I never read these books as a child  This is my first time reading the series and even the first book blew me away  Rowling is quite the author  quickly becoming one of my favorites  I can t wait to read the rest of the series   Harry Potter re read   perfect way to start the New Year The illustrated edition of this book is GORGEOUS  I loved it   It s Harry Potter and it s illustrated   I don t really need to say much more  I love the illustrations and I grew up loving story     Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone by J K  Rowling is a book that took me on a roller coaster of emotions  With every turn of the well written pages I was more and more eager to get to the ending of the story  Like the other six books in the series  this novel is about a wizard named Harry Potter  In the first book  Harry doesn t know that he is a wizard so he lives like a human with his aunt  uncle  and fat spoiled cousin  When Harry finds out he is a wizard he is sent to a school for the best wizards and witches  Hogwarts  A few weeks into the school year Harry and his friends begin to notice suspicious things going on in the school  I loved reading along with Harry and his friends as they solved the clues and saved the day  I would definitely recommend this book to anyone looking for a funny  exciting series   My favorite part of this book was hands down when Harry met Ron Weasley  Harry showed his true colors when he shared his bountiful amount of food with poor Ron who had a very poor family and only had a corned beef sandwich    Go on  have a pasty   said Harry  who had never had anything to share before    Rowling 123   Harry had just found the money his parents left him and had bought tons of food for himself but gladly shared when he saw the boy  Ron  had no food  After meeting Ron on the train  Harry and Ron became the best of friends  Ron  Harry  and all of the other characters in the novel are written unbelievably well  The story is witty and inspiring while maintaining its fantasy plot line  You will find yourself laughing through funny moments  and trust me there are tons  and biting your nails in suspense of the ending  You might even catch yourself using Harry Potter Terms  or quoting the great wizard himself  Dumbledore    Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself     Rowling 350   This book was written beautifully  The end is unexpected and every part leading up to it is magnificent  Once you read the first book you won t be able to stop  I have no criticism for this book  and would give this book five out of five stars  Get in on all of the Harry Potter jokes and pick up this charming  witty  and inspiring novel  This was my third time reading this book and second time this year  The more I read this book  the more I enjoy it  The new illustrations in this book from Jim Kay are sensational  I can t wait to see how he illustrates the next six books  This was just as delightful as I remember it being  It was also a lot funnier than I remember  too  I was so nostalgic  Additionally  knowing things that come after this made some of this a bit sad but oh my gosh am I glad to reread  Tengo anos siendo fan de la peliculas de Harry Potter y entonces llegue a un momento en el que me pregunte por que no habia leido los libros  me propuse hacerlo  ha llegado el momento y nunca habia sido tan feliz Este libro se merece 5 estrellas y mas  si fuera posible  Ame cada minuto de la historia y creo que no hay mucho que decir mas que recalcar que creo que me he tardado mucho en comenzar esta serie y ya era el momento y no me senti defraudada en ningun sentido JURO QUE ESCUCHABA LAS VOCES Y PODIA VER LAS EXPRESIONES DE LOS PERSONAJES DE LA PELICULA MIENTRAS LEIA  HERMIONE ES TAN SASSY LA AMO  So this year I started reading the Harry Potter books  I know  I am very   very late but finally I did it  Oh boy   I completly fell in love with everything  I own the illustrated edition and I am so excited to reread this edition   Seriously gets better every flippin  time   3A look at some deeper themes parallels in the book  http   youtu be FwzV XOYs1Q Seriously  This is good literature  Mock all you want but I will go to my grave defending it as such    I ve never really watched harry potter so i thought maybe i should read the books then watch the movie  I thought J K Rowling did a fabulous job with her imagination in creating the story and characters   One word amazing   HEY give me my money back this is the American version       L etoile manquante a l edition de base est conferee par ce merveilleux illustrateur qu est Jim Kay   Magnifique livre    Que je compte bien m offrir pour Noel    Absolutely gorgeous illustrations by Jim Kay that brings the book to life most wonderfully  Very much recommend this illustrated version  well worth getting a duplicate volume  Great gift for any HP lover  Very well done  CANT BELIEVE I JUST STARTED THIS NOW  Lembro  como se fosse ontem  da primeira vez em que fui apresentada a este mundo  Na altura  possuia um leitor de VHS  ainda existe em casa   e o meu pai  volta e meia  comprava algumas cassetes de video para puder ver  Certa vez  trouxe me uma caixa do filme Harry Potter  e nos os tres dedicamos uma noite a ver o filme e todos nos o adoramos  A partir dai  soubemos que fazia parte de uma colecao de filmes que iriam sair ao longo dos anos e so mais tarde e que descobri que estava a ser baseado numa serie de livros  Nessa altura  nao possuia habitos de leitura tao regulares como agora e nao lhe dediquei a leitura  Varios anos passaram  e desde que comecei a ler regularmente sempre fiquei com a ideia em ler toda a esta serie e acabei por aproveitar estas edicoes especiais para puder ler toda esta serie  E  em cada virar de pagina  arrependi me de nao ter lido mais cedo  Mas tambem  se os tivesse lido antes  nao estaria a saborear a historia como estou neste momento  O livro e demasiado bom  E certo que nao consegui impedir me de  em alguns momentos  compara lo com o filme  mas tentei manter me fora dele  E nao consegui dar lhe menos do que 5 estrelas  Assim que comecou  nao consegui parar   sempre mais  mais e mais  Estou completamente rendida   There are spoilers in my review  Read only if you want to   Jocelyn Kuntz Harry Potter is a young boy who s parents have died  He lives with his Aunt  Uncle  and cousin  Harry is a wizard who get s an envelope that his Uncle doesn t let Harry s Uncle never lets Harry read the envelopes addressed to Harry  Eventually they have to leave the house because of how many envelopes there are in the house  They own a boat and expect that no more letters will reach them  Instead they meet someone named Hagrid  He takes Harry with him and they get supplies for Harry to go to Hogwarts  a wizard and witch school  Harry meets many new people three of which he becomes friends with  Harry learns many things and play Quidditch  a game with many balls  He learns about a stone that gives endless life to any person that touches it  he also learns that someone is trying to steal it  With the help of two of his friends he makes it through to the chamber  He discovers that one of his Professors is trying to steal it  The Professor had always worn a turban that smelled like rotten garlic  Harry knows now that underneath the turban the remains of his parents killer are hidden  The Professor tries to kill Harry  but he burns his hands when he touches Harry  Harry kills the Professor and saves the stone which gets destroyed afterward  Harry s house wins the House Cup  the award given out each year to the house with the most points  Slytherin a different house always won until Harry arrived  In the end Harry goes back to his Aunts and Uncles for the summer  Harry can t wait for next year  This is a great book for those who like magic  I really enjoyed it   Jocelyn Kuntz  Even better the second time around     Cant wait to reread all of them   I feel deep pure joy reading through joe s words and I simply want to sleep and wake up in Hogwarts  I was smiling through out the whole book  Illustrations were incredible I would stare at them for ages  the story itself was magical  no surprise there  but the illustrations definitely add so much to the story   One of my favorite re reads of all time  I always forget how amazing these books are  The story combined with the beautiful illustrations just made for a stunning book  I just wish the rest of the collection was out now because I would already be buying them   It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies  but just as much to stand up to our friends  So magical  So extremely fantastic  I loved absolutely everything about it  Every single detail   Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone  by J K Rowling in an amazing book for teens that are interested in genres ranging from action fantasy horror adventure  Being the first book of it s series  it must fulfill high expectations set by the audience in order for the rest of the series to be popular  The story follows a boy named Harry Potter and his journey in becoming a wizard with the help of his companions  J K Rowling creates an addictive story line that catches the audience like a fishing rod catches fish as she inputs a sense of fantasy and also reality throughout Harry Potter s journey  I felt that this book was very original and that the concept was very unique and different compared to the literature of that time  Overall  this book receives a whooping  one   one  golden star because how amazing it is and that it certainly deserves a golden star I recommend this book to everyone except for people who hates wizards I do not recommend this book to people who don t know how to read  I am rereading the series and for the first time  I will be putting up a review for each book  I cannot believe I haven t done this  But hey  10 years ago  I haven t figured out how to make book reviews yet  so  Haha  So having never read the books or watched the movies I am happy to say I am pleased with Harry potter and the sorcerers stone  Though the stone itself does not make itself known to the reader until later in the book I must say I was never bored in this story  A good amount of background information about Harry s life as a  muggle  starts the story  Once Harry s birthday hits and we find out who he really is the excitement begins At hogwarts we meet lots of characters but it is never confusing or difficult to keep track of them  We see relationships build  both good and bad  we get a glimpse of teenage mischief  adventure  and drama that keeps the reader wanting more  Once more information is coming out about the stone and the characters involved the reader gets thrown for a loop when the truth is revealed about who is good and who is evil  I loved the surprise about who is working with  you know who  The story ends with everyone heading home for the summer  which leads the reader hoping for more to come next school year at hogwarts  Can t wait to start book two tonight   Une lecture nostalgique qui m a ramenee quatorze ans en arriere et qui me rappelle a quel point cette saga reste importante dans ma vie  Relire Harry Potter  c est comme se saisir d un retourneur de temps  3  I absolutely love the Harry Potter series  Ravenclaw  and partially Slytherin  all the way  I loved experiencing the magic of Hogwarts all over again  I can t wait to read the second book next month   In sticking with my goal to always review the books I add beginning in 2014  I guess it s time I provide a brief review of one of my favorite re reads  This book is a brilliant start to the sensational Harry Potter series  What I love about it is its creativity  its characters  and the captivating moments of profound wisdom and beauty encased in a single phrase  Upon this latest listening  as I  read  the audiobook via Overdrive   I was moved to tears when Dumbledore tells Harry very near the end   To the well organized mind  death is but the next great adventure   Every time I read it  I find something new that makes me fall in love with it all over again  Thank you  JK Rowling  for making the world a better place by giving us Harry Potter Overall grade  5 stars  Wowza   I loved this book and can t wait to read it again  Just what I needed at this time  Loved it just as much as the first couple times I read it      Jim Dale is amazing as the narrator  It s been a long time since I ve reread this book  and I read it many times as a tween  Rowling is a good writer  She gives excellent descriptions briefly  Like how the teachers pretend to smile for the Hogwarts school song or how the troll s legs were like tree trunks  In this first book it feels like nothing is extraneous  every chapter was necessary for one reason or another  Yes  the way the ending challenges matched up neatly to everyone s strengths was really unlikely  but I can forgive that in a YA book  I m pleasantly surprised that I still liked reading Harry Potter now  I enjoyed looking at Snape as the misunderstood tsundere and Doubledore as future Ron  a fan theory I quite like    REREAD 2015I forgot how much I loved this series  My favorite part of rereading books is to see the subtle clues that elude to the ending  as well as picking up on things you ve missed the first time around  Harry Potter will forever be my favorite series  Describing this story without giving it away is almost impossible  Harry  on his 11th birthday learns he is a wizard  He gets this news from Hagrid  game keeper of Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry  Harry goes to Hogwarts to learn magic  Here he meets his best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Grainger  The battle of good and evil commences  Harry struggles against the trouble he blunders into  and the trouble he gets himself into by following his instincts  He makes mistakes  and finds his stride  He goes through many of the same things all children go through with teachers that like them and teachers that don t  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Philosopher s Stone is an all round feel good kind of book I recommend this book to anyone looking for books they can read to and with their children  I believe the first time I read this book with my son he was 8 years old  He is now 22  It has continued to be a favorite as I have now read it with each of my children  and look forward to when I get to read it to my grandchildren  Finally letting Mia read the Harry Potter series  She s been asking for ages  I m excited to re live all the adventure and excitement for the first time with her   I am going to start this book series for the 9th time now   God  I LOVE THESE SERIES more than anything  Give me harry potter and dump me on an island  i wont complain  The best literary work EVER     I thought this book was good because its about a boy who doesn t have a great life until he finds out he s a wizard  My favorite part is when harry first visits Hogwarts because that s the place where he actually feels like he belongs  I also like the part where harry finds out that Snape wasn t actually the person who was after the sorcerers stone  I thought it was snape but it was actually professor quirrell  I didn t really like the ending because he actually goes back to the Dursley s home for summer and I was expecting him to stay at Hogwarts  I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read fiction because everything about this book is like nothing you ve ever read before  Overall I thought it was a really good book and if anyone who reads it will love it  I don t know how I managed to spend so much time without reading this book  It is by far one of The best ones I ve ever read  even considering it is a children s book   Now I need the rest of the books ASAP  This is  obviously   a re read  I m going back through them  and I m probably going to give them all five stars because who am I to come to the queen  But it s interesting to see how much the world changed  what still works and didn t  especially after the whole series of books and movies is over and Rowling has continued messing with the world in Pottermore  I still think no one can match the creation of a textured world and beautifully sketched side characters  The descriptions of Hagrid in this one bowled me over  Also interesting  I found Vernon Dursley s fear really poignant and Dudley more pitiable than I remembered  and it was really easy to see why they found wizards monstrous  Harry Potter dunyasina bambaska bir bakis  Bu seri bir efsane ve hepimiz bunu biliyoruz  Ortaokul donemlerinde bir arkadasimdan alarak okumustum Harry Potter serisini  Sanirim filmiyle daha once tanistim  Sanirim diyorum cunku filmi izledigim zaman kitabi okudugum zaman kadar net degil  Bunun da sebebi kitaplarin gercekten de sihirli dunyalara acilan kapilar olmasi Ve muhtesem  macera dolu buyulu dunyaya da adimimi attim  Gercek su ki hemen hemen herkesin cocuklugunda yer etmis bir kitap vardi aklinda  sizi bastan sona degistiren  hayalgucunuzun sinirlarini zorlayip  yepyeni ufuklar acan kitaplar  Eger boyle kitaplar okuduysaniz muhtesem bir cocukluk gecirmissiniz demektir  Ben sansliydim  Suan belki de fazlaca hayalperest olan tarafimi o zaman okudugum kitaplara borcluyum  Ozellikle Harry Potter a Jim Kay in muhtesem illusturasyonlariyla bezenmis yeni eski okurlar icin essiz bir firsat bu  Her bir kelimesini zevkle okudum  her bir illusturasyonuna hayran kaldim  Sanirim 2016 Kasim inda da Harry Potter ve Sirlar Odasi nin illusturasyonlu versiyonunu okuyacagiz  Sabirsizlikla bekliyorum  I read this for the first time  because I was always avoiding it  I really loved it and I just watched the first movie too  Definitely going to read the rest of the books and the movies afterwards  No matter how many times I read these books  they never get old  and never disappoint  Rereading them again is even better now that I have my kids to share them with  and they love then just as much  everyone s read this  so   suffice to say i loved it to bits and i realize i m probably the last literate human being who has read it   but  just  wow so good i cried a bit at the end  sigh  Definitely still a 5 stars  I loved it  flew through it  Everything was awesome  And there was so much foreshadowing that you didn t notice  This just brought me back to a world I loved so much     i love love love love harry potter so I started to read the series it is so so so so so so so so so AMAZING               you should totally read it        plus i have just read it again      This book was just amazing  I have seen all of the Harry Potter movies and have been a huge fan since the movies came out  I never read any the books because I thought since I have seen all the movies I would know what will happen in the books but I was wrong  I read this book and there are so many differences  There is like a whole chapter not in the movie I mean a whole chapter  It was also fun to read the book and find the differences in the movie  This book was a good read because it had action  relatable school experiences  and friendship  This books is about an eleven year old boy who was left on his aunt and uncles porch on Privet Drive when he was one  after his parents were killed by an evil wizard named Voldemort  His life was horrible with his aunt and uncle because they hate him and only loving there child Dudley  But one day Harry got a letter in the mail to go to a magic school called Hogwarts  His aunt and uncle wouldn t let him go to this school they even burnt all his letter from the school  They even left there house not get any more letters from Hogwarts  Then one day a big tall man named Hagrid came to get harry and take him to Hogwarts where he meets his best friends Ron and Hermione  Together they try and get through the school year  They also find this three headed guarding something so they try to figure out what it is  To know more you have to read the book  This is a great book and if you have seen the movies the books are so much better   MARAVILLOSO  no recordaba lo bien escrito que estaba  lo magico y lo bien que te hace sentir  Aparte me hizo viajar anos atras cuando las cosas eran mucho mas faciles xD  3 Mucho amor para el  Why wouldn t I give five stars to a book I have read approximately seven times  Each time J K  came out with a new one  I had to do a marathon of the previous ones   so I must like them a LOT   I read this book nearly 11 years ago now  but never went on to finish the series  I want to finally do so  but need to start over as I don t remember who anyone is  except Harry  of course   How could I give this any less than five stars  You don t need me to tell you that JK Rowling has created an amazing universe  All of the characters are rich and meaningful  This is a must read  I have finally made my way around to read Harry Potter  I ve been hearing for years  I can t believe you  of all people  haven t read Harry Potter   When HP was beginning to get so hyped up with everyone and their uncle picking it up  I was reading things like R  Scott Bakker s Prince of Nothing and John Marco s Bronze Knight series  Harry Potter was for kids  I was reading adult stuff  Still    I d get to it in due time I told myself  And here I am at least a decade later finally getting to them  In a short amount of time Harry Potter has become as much a fantasy classic as Lord of the Rings or Chronicles of Prydain  It deserves to be in that company too  having become a springboard for genre exploration to an entire generation of children  My third or possibly fourth read of Philosopher s Stone and it is still so damn magical  DI took my time with this one in order to savour the illustrations  they are just amazing  No amount of re reading can erase that magical and warm feeling from reading Harry Potter  This illustrated edition makes it even more enjoyable  A must own for all Harry Potter fan   Finally posted my  Then Now  reactions to Harry Potter  1 3 all compiled into one post   Check it out  https   avidreadersmediocrewriters wo    Watching my kids fall in love with this book the way I fell in love with it has been truly priceless  Kid A cheering as Dumbledore handed out points at the end was pretty darn perfect  finally  am I right  thoroughly enjoyable even if Harry tends to be a tad obtuse  p Decided to reread it  but this time in Portuguese  The translation isn t very good  which bothered me a little  However  I was still able to enjoy again the magical world of Harry Potter   LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT Oh my gosh it s so good I m not even going to describe it     a million stars      After 10 years  I have finally re read the first book that made me fall in love with reading  And by gosh  I couldn t help my eyes from tearing up at the end  First read  May 2005  8 14I had a hard time picking out an audiobook I wanted to listen to and passed by Jim Dale s narration of this book  I ve listened before and I ll do it again and again  Pure magic  Listen the audio bookI had the book for Christmas when I was seven or eight  but never read it till the end  Of course  I have watched the film and I totally love it  I still remember watching it with my dad while school holidays When I found the audio book I thought it will be perfect for time on the beach  This is my first ever auidio book that I ve ever listened and it s pretty fun  I ve already known the plot of the book  so it wasn t such a surprise for me  but it was that the film is totally fowlling the book which is amazing  There are not a lot of film that are made just like the book  In conclusin  I love the book and can t wait to start the second one  I don t know what I were doing before these books  THank you J K  Rowling    Yay I finished the audio CD for this book  LOVED IT as always Stephen Fry imo does a fantastic job of telling the story It was over so quickly  but I loved every moment  all I have to say is  god bless for J K  Rowling Voor kerst heb ik de hele box in het Engels gekregen dus ik ben maar weer opnieuw begonnen en ze blijven goed  De Engelse versie is trouwens ook veel leuker dan de Nederlandse    Now that I have a newborn I can t focus on reading something new and need to read something comforting and familiar     OMFG   I don t know how I don t read this book before  I ts my first meet with Harry Potter because I never seen the movies in all my life  I am anxious to read the next book  It was rather hard for me to read Harry Potter in Spanish since I only started to learn it 6 months ago before starting to read my first Book  When i started i was horribly slow  so the first Chapter took me 5 hours and I had to look for words every 10 seconds  Then i wrote the word down  At the end of the forst chapter I had a lot of new words so I tried to pick out the most important ones which I could need later in the book and the basic ones that I can use in every day life  Even so I had still more than hundred in the first chapter  But I got better and better with every Page and it was a delight to see my progress  I could feel the Language becoming clearer to me with every Chapter and now I have a feeling for it  It was a lot of work but it was even more fun Harry Potter is fabulous in every Language I liked the Spanish Version of it a lot but it was better in English  I m going to read the second book now    I forgot how good the first book is  Obviously it reads more child like than the later books  but it s still just as charming and magical as I remember it was as a child  I missed the train September 1st  but better late than never  Oh Hogwarts how I ve missed you Reading this for the billionth time  and it still brings a smile to my face   I just can t sum up the pure 100  amazing ness into 19940 characters  All I can say is  BEST  SERIES  EVER I m 14  and I ve been recommending this book since I was 5   This was the best book I ever read  Once I got started it was hard to put the book down  I never watched the movie  so the book didn t have any spoilers for me   Harry Potter and his friends Ron Weasley  and Hermione Granger are all on their first year at Hogwarts  a school for wizards and witches  With Ron s and Hermione s help Harry passes through several obstacles to find the Sorcerer s Stone  However he finds Lord Voldemort who is also looking for the Sorcerer s Stone   Lord Voldemort was the wizard who tried to kill Harry when he was a baby   Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone is a very exciting book although it did get a little scary once  Loved it  Took us forever to finish but these chapters are really long when reading to a 7 year old  Can t wait to watch the movie this weekend and then start book 2   This was a fantastic book with tons of mystery  misconception and fantasy as Harry finds out he s a wizard and he and his friends try to rescue the Sorcerer s Stone  Listened to audiobook read by Jim Dale  which is extraordinary  We listened after Fisher read the first book  in case he had missed any of the details  Now  movie  It took me this long to finally read the first book to the Harry Potter series  I really did enjoy it even though it is a middle grade book  and it s not what I would typically read  It was fun and funny  I was presently surprised of how much I enjoyed it  The world was so amazing and creative I would have pictured a younger version of myself loving this world  and even now I think it s magical  I won t write what the book is about because even people who have not read the books know all about it  I finally understand what all the hype is about  No matter what age I am  I see myself enjoying these books  I can t wait to get started on the next book  I love the harry potter stories  it s really kind of sad that they are done  The first book is always great because of the lighter more innocent feel of the story  For Christmas  I was lucky enough to get the beautiful new box set of the Harry Potter series as a gift  The childhood copies I read got left at my parents  house when I went off to college  but they mysteriously disappeared off of their shelves a few years ago  a fact I may never be able to forgive  so I needed my own set  The box set is so beautiful that it took me over a month to get up to courage to reread the first book but I finally couldn t wait  and a couple of days ago I picked up and quickly finished Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone by J  K  Rowling  There s not much to say about this book that hasn t already been said  I thoroughly enjoyed my reread  though I was disconcerted during the first few chapters by the debilitating wave of nostalgia that hit me once I started reading  It was more difficult than I would have liked to just lose myself in the story when my mind was clouded with the entirety of the series  the movies  A Very Potter Musical  the wealth of internet memes surrounding Harry Potter  and my own warm feelings  I finally got lost in the magical world again  but it was interesting to come up every once in a while and notice little things that had escaped me the first couple of times around  For example  Dumbledore is crazy manipulative  I still love him  but his actions are certainly far from sparkling white  Rereading the Harry Potter series post completion is an entirely new experience but so far it s been very enjoyable and I can t wait to pick up the Chamber of Secrets this month   So strange to read this with my son    It seems like only yesterday I was reading it for myself  bated breath and all    My son inhales every word  Great stuff  I loved revisiting the book and I m sure I enjoyed it even more this time around  I can t wait to dive into the second one   Who doesn t love Harry Potter     So after being mocked and shunned for years for not reading the Harry Potter series  I finally started it and I did not know what I was missing  J K Rowling does a fantastic job with many things in the start of her 7 book masterpiece  A key element to any fantasy book that takes place modern day  has to have an explanation as to why the regular humans don t know about what s happening in said fantasy world  J K Rowling explains it beautifully  and after not to long  we know everything we need to know about the wizard world and the story continues  Another great thing that this book accomplished was explaining everything happening  I do not believe there was one point in this book where I didn t know what was going on   He survived  Harry Potter And The Sorcerers Stone by J  K  Rowling is the first book in the Harry Potter series  this book is one of the best fantasy book for people who like wizards or just want to be a wizard  and it has lots of detail that help describe how the Wizards have kept they re secret from the non wizards  It s fun to know how the Wizards can keep a secret like that and Potter is still discovering secrets to but in Hogwarts castle  Harry and Ron have had so much fun figuring out the truth behind the school  this book has so much adventure and mystery  It has an ending that would make you want to read the second BR4 pages 309 Die Illustrationen sind wunderschon  und obwohl ich die Geschichte kenne und schon einige Male gelesen hab  war es ein neues und schones Leseerlebnis  I WAS HOOKED FROM THE VERY START  It was just so beautiful  Unfortunately I am barely reading this series now and I ve already watched all of the movies  I was determined to finish the book because I really wanted to start reading the following books of Harry Potter so I stayed up until 2 am to finish it  Five stars will never be enough to describe my love for this book  It s different from all other books I have ever loved and cannot be defined by stars    I couldn t put the book down when I started it and now I can almost not help but pick up the next book instead of homework  Why haven t I started it earlier  Haven t read Potter for about 3 years  Shame  I m glad I returned to my very favorite book series  This time I m going to collect my favorite quotes    Starting it very late    but this grips you every time  Movie perhaps doesnt capture the aura as well as the book  A perfect start to the new year     my last book of 2012 feels like an emotional time travel   all the time I remembered the first time I read it  9 years ago    oh sweetness  love them  I am rereading this book  Who doesn t love Harry Potter  The world is just   magnificent and the characters are multi dynamic  I am off to the second book  rw      rw      rw   bd m twq t nw hary bwtr jmyl ldrj  mw Tby   lHdth lry       khlStwh tqryb b3 ym    mtHms bd  bljz lthny       awalnya msh blm tertarik sama buku ini   banyak yg pd heboh  akhirnya coba2 baca   daan   ga berhenti sampai kelar   br baca pas buku ke 3 keluar   I have had the first 3 books in a box set in its first edition  the one with the crappy illustration where harry is confusingly searching for Platform nine and and three quarters not the harry in a broomstick chasing the snitch  since it was first released I was delighted back then but not that ecstatic enough since I was still into reading sweet valley high and the kind of books that you can read in one sitting  I ve read it wasn t eager to finish it when I learned that there would be four more addition to the series so I keep it in my shelf and kept it there not until now I ve reread it for the 1st time and now I m more than willing to finish the remaining six books  First time reading this book why did I wait so long to read it   It s so awesome beyond extraordinary and very magical absolutely loved it     I really liked this book because it is both interesting and very descriptive of both the setting and the characters  Another reason for why I like this book is how it always ends its chapters on cliffhangers  This book really emphasized what Harry was feeling and thinking  I like how the author included a lot of mythical creatures and the different capabilities of a witch and wizard In addition  I loved how the author included a part that made Harry and his friends believe that Snape was the bad guy while in the end Quirrel was the criminal  This book didn t really have any weaknesses and I really advise everyone to read this one of a kind book  Ok so you may hate me for what I am about to say  Before this  I only read the last Harry Potter book  I basically just watched all the movies until the final book came out and then read the final book  I know I know I am an awful human being   Anyway  I thought it was time to finally attack this franchise head on  I listened to the audiobook read by Stephen Frye and it was INCREDIBLE  The hype is real  I finally get it  The movies were great but the books absolutely blow it out of the water  I am so sad that it took me this long to truly experience the magic that is the Harry Potter series  How JK Rowling came up with this brilliance is beyond my comprehension  Already started Chamber of Secrets    Was nice to reread the first book and bring back feelings of being young and broaden my imagination all over again  Can t wait to re read book 2   First time I read this book as an adult    it s way more depressing I remembered  I just want to go and hug Harry and adopt him Amazing  as always  This is ADORABLE  Glad i read it at last    The movie is great but obviously the book greater  Love it and can t wait to re read it in the future     Re read  5 December 2014There is not much that I can say except that it s Freaking Harry Potter and it gets infinite amount of goodread stars   I refuse to write reviews for these books because there is just too much epic awesomeness for me to do it justification  Just read it  damnit  1st book of the series always the bestI love the magical world of Harry Potter and was my 1st reading in arabic to practice reading long novels Harry Potter has no idea he is a wizard  In fact  if it were up to the Dursley s  Harry would believe he is nothing more than a blight on life that should stay as quiet as possible and pretend he doesn t exist  However  when Harry receives his letter from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry  everything Harry thought he knew about himself and his past is about to be turned upside down  In Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone  The Illustrated Edition artist Jim Kay brings life to J K  Rowling s characters with new artistry that is just as magical as the world that was originally created  Teens will be able to discover themselves in the fierce friendships  awkward social moments and brave encounters that Harry  Ron  Hermione  and Neville also experience in the first installment of this timeless series   This book has aroused the Harry Potter fever in me  I wasn t really interested in this series for years but since last year I planned to read it in summer fifteen  A week ago  I saw the first book of it at the bookstore and I couldn t leave it behind  And I immediately started reading and fell in love with it as with every book  Slowly at first and then all at once  I m damn in love with the little Harry  He s such a cutie  woah  I RECOMMEND this book to everyone who hasn t read it by now  It s just like every book addict has to read it  This world of magic is unique  I just think that everyone has to read it at least once            I m so glad I ve finally read this  Once I get all of my other must reads out of the way I ll DEFINITELY be picking up the next book  OMG I loved it as much as the first time I read it  what is this story amazing  can t wait to continue with part two of the series again  OK  I know I m probably the last person to read this book with two kids and wife having read the entire series multiple times  but hey  how s this for a coincidence  we re on a plane home from Puerto Rico  I m heading down the aisle to the bathroom and there s a mom reading the exact same book and virtually on the exact same page    and we talk and husband is starting on  2  so I m not the last one   For some reason I could always think of some other book I  should  read first  So I finally get to it and what pure reading fun  and as a writer I marvel at the amazing inventiveness and taut storytelling ability  Wonderful  I will now devour the rest  I honestly don t think that I could ever make a review worthy enough for Harry Potter Read for the third time April 9 20  2014 A perennial favorite     and it only gets better  I love this story   lots of fun and adventure  Read Oct 22 12   Oct 27 12  I love it more and more and more every time I read it And it s wonderful to see all the foreshadowing for the rest of the series  I always wonder how different it would have been if Harry had thanked Snape for saving his life this year Completed Audio  14 12 15 Awesome book that started a legendary series of books and movies   I can t wait until Rowling comes out with another series of books  Wow  it s so funny how I have an entirely different view of these books as I read them with my kids  compared to years ago when I read them myself  Actually I ve only ever read the first two  For some reason I never got into the  Harry Potter fever  that so many people did back when the books were new  I was in college when this first one was released  and I thought I was too cool for  kid books   I did end up reading the first and second one around the year 2000 or so when I was in my early 20 s  and I liked them ok but didn t really feel amazed and somehow I never got around to reading the whole series Now my 9 year old Emma had been begging to read them and I told her it would be fun to read it together  I wanted to be able to discuss it with her as we go along   She didn t want me to read it out loud to her  as she s too grown up for that and gets impatient and just wants to read it herself  So both read the book for our own little  Harry Potter bookclub   She absolutely loved it  though she got a little scared in the chapter in the forest involving the unicorn blood  So we read the last few chapters together out loud to each other  At that point  my 7 year old  who had up to this point expressed no interest whatsoever  heard us reading those few chapters and she got majorly into the story herself  She begged to be able to read the whole book  I was a little nervous because I thought she might be too young for it  but I started over from Chapter 1 and have now spent the last several weeks reading it out loud to her every night before bed  She loves it and gets so mad every time I stop and tell her it s time for bed Seeing it through my children s eyes I fell in love with the story and the world in a way I don t remember doing before  It s such a great story  with fun adventures and great characters  We haven t started the second one yet because I want to go slowly  I know that after the first few books  the story line will get much darker and I don t want to rush them into it too fast   though I may need to read ahead of them for my own benefit  haha   The illustrations are just so awesome  And the book is simply amazing  I kind of wanna restart it all over again                  Reread on 9 9 14  Love rereading this series and coming upon all the little details I ve forgotten  Obviously  ALL THE STARS Harry Potter  un nino huerfano criado por sus tios que descubre cuando cumple 11 anos que es un mago  En sus primeros pasos en la comunidad de la magica  en ingreso en el Colegio Hogwarts  comienza hacer enemigos y amigos  que solo los amigos lo ayudan a enfrentarse a lord Voldemort  el brujo tenebroso que habia asesinado a los padres y cuyo espiritu busca un antiguo objeto legendario conocido como la piedra filosofalA mi me gusto como la autora mezcla la ficcion con la imaginacion  es muy importante como resalta en mundo imaginario  todas las aventuras que tiene harry me las imagino que me estan sucediendo a mi  Me ensena que siempre hay en todo lo que nos pasa algo de aventura y que te vaya bien o mal tus amigos te sostiene  acompanan  y alientan  This series gives my life meaning and texture That isn t an exaggeration    And that s all that needs to be said  really  read count  2  but hopefully infinite  after three years of not visiting harry s world  it s even better the second time   it feels so good reading the book again after watched the movies multiple times everything makes more sense lol  Love the story and the illustrations  It s cool to see the characters and things from someone else s perspective     listened to the audiobook  so much love for this book  it was excellent reexperiencing this through a new format   Brilliantly crafted masterpiece  Equally strange and mystifying  One question though  where is my letter to Hogwarts   I loved this book it was BEAUTIFUL  The characters were so realistic and lovable  Enjoyed every bit of it 5 5 stars   E oficial  nao importa a idade  nao importa quantas vezes voce tenha lido  ler Harry Potter sempre sera incrivel   re readlistened to the audiobook and it was WONDERFUL  It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live   This is the only series of books that I have read multiple times   this is where I fell in love with Harry Potter     I  Really  liked this book  This book is very much worth the fame  I really think you should read this book   Que voy a decir si estoy esperando la carta de Hogwarts desde los 11 anos  Bonito  interesante y lleno de magia   Review Here Still astonishingly fabulous Review to come if I am successful in knocking down the rabid fangirl in me   D  D  D Click here for the Midnightfaerie s Review Rereading Harry Potter was fantastic and it was even more with the illustrations  Magical once again 2016 Reading Challenge  A book   its prequel   loved it   So happy to finally be reading this series   It doesn t matter how many times I reread this  it still affects me the same way it did the very first time  I ve said it before and I ll say it again  anyone trying to write YA has something to learn from Ms Rowling  My biggest regret was not starting this earlier  Yes  this is the first time I m reading Harry Potter   shame This illustrated edition of my favorite series is like rereading it for the first time    It was amazing  My sixth re read  but this time with the audio version  I always enjoy reading listening to Harry Potter  AAALL THE FEELS Que alguien me aiude  Amoamoamoamo este mundo  los personajes  quiero ir a Hogwarts D  Adore the series so much  I believe I will reread the books many times more because they are so good    Hard to comment on this one   as part of our summer reading challenge with Liv I needed to do my write up and even though I d already read this 3 times  I couldn t remember enough to write and discuss it  SO    I can t believe how well this story holds up after 4 readings  I think the first time I read it was 2002  Because the movie now plays so prevalently in my mind  I had lost sight of some of the smaller details  It was good to reconnect with just the first book  as now the epic series all blends together in my memory  Thank You  Thank You J K  Rowling for creating this wonderful adventure  Excellent  I was one of those who saw the movies first  Actually  I really didn t have a whole lot of interest in reading the series  but my son is reading them and I decided to read along with him so we can buddy read  I thought that the movie followed the book quite a lot  but there were some differences that were kind of big that I didn t realize were there  Now I see what the HP fans were complaining about when the movies came out I m going to continue with the series  it s fun and interesting and most importantly  I can spend some quality time with my son doing what I love the most  reading  Read my review of the entire series here  Bueno pues he de decir que me a gustado mucho El libro me parece muy bien escrito y tiene un buen balance en cuanto a objetos magicos se refiere  me a gustado sobre todo la manera de tratar al mundo magico  es un mundo bien organizado  que funciona paralelo al de los muggles pero que no se nota forzado ni falso  respira y es creible Algo que me llamo la atencion especialmente fueron las ranas de chocolate y las grageas de todos los sabores  suenan a dulces que el propio Willy Wonka abria creado De entre todos los hechizos  pociones y trucos  a mi parecer el truco mas grande  el hechizo mas poderoso que logro Harry fue el de hacer leer a los ninos y por eso se merece un lugar especial dentro de la literatura  I can t believe it has taken me this long to read this book  Fantastical  Look forward to book 2  I LOVED IT    I am a total Harry Potter fan   Even though I read the series 8 times before    Hablare de esta nueva version de Harry potter  y no  no me refiero a la historia   porque obviamente es perfecta    si no a las ilustraciones que en esta ocasion le acompanan  La version ilustrada es el doble de alto y angosto que la original  Es siemplemente hermoso  la primera vez que escuche de el  supe que tenia que tenerlo y cuando lo vi    lo compre con desesperacion y locura  Y es que ya que uno posee este valioso libro en sus manos  lo lee  lo hojea  lo presume  lo abraza y muchas cosas mas  no importa el precio    vale cada centavo   Amo este libro y cada una de sus ilustraciones  Omg I looooooove this book  Now I have to find platform 9 3 4  Up next the Chamber of Secrets         First Time Read  November 16  2014  November 21  2014RE READ  October 17  2015  October 21  2015 I absolute love Jim Dale  he did an amazing job with this book   Ich liebe es  wie Rufus Beck das liest   D Besonders die Zwillinge und Lord Voldemort  So toll   Originally read January 2013Re read August 2015 My love for these books knows no bounds     Que tenia en la cabeza para no haber leido estos libros hace mucho     QUIERO TODOS       You should know that Harry Potter series is my childhood  Not kidding  It always is my childhood   The First book was really interesting  it can be read by teens  children or even adults     2013  8 January 12 January 2013 14  28 December 2 January 2014 15  30 December 5 January  So I finished Harry Potter in Greek  And it was awesome  Can t wait to read book 2  A delightful rendering of a wonderful taleThis book is a must have for every serious Harry Potter fan  Jim Kay s illustrations are mesmerisingly beautiful and wonderfully detailed  They abound with hints and nods to the Harry Potter canon  such as the deathly hallows symbol cleverly concealed in one of the illustrations  that will delight fans of the series  Despite the prior presence of the movies and abundant other related media the illustrations of Mr Kay do not seem to borrow or be influenced by them  The character portraits in particular are very distinctive and bring a great measure of freshness to the book that makes it a pleasurable read  For adults and children who have not read Harry Potter before this will serve as a captivating introduction into an enchanting world  This definitely got me out of my reading slump  chamber of secrets here I come    Beautiful illustrations by Jim Kay really add to this  look forward to the other books  Finished  and it s still so beautiful  Ps  I say this every time I reread it wow  Every time I read this I find new details that I missed the first hundred times  I really don t think this book needs a review  it was just as wonderful as always    Certamente vou passar o resto da minha vida a culpar me por nao ter lido mais cedo  I mean  it s Harry Potter  You either love it or you hate it  I happen to love it  This book will mark my childhood  I pity all the people who haven t read the series yet  My childhood seems so miserable now that I realise that I had been missing  I m in love  Finished it two weeks ago though   the review is coming soon unless I don t have time This was my first time reading Harry Potter and it was so good  Now I get the hype  Harry Potter has never played a sport while flying on a broomstick  He s never worn a Cloak of Invisibility  befriended a giant  or helped hatch a dragon  All Harry knows is a miserable life with the Dursleys  his horrible aunt and uncle  and their abominable son  Dudley  Harry s room is a tiny cupboard under the stairs  and he hasn t had a birthday party in ten years But all that is about to change when a mysterious letter arrives by owl messenger  a letter with an invitation to a wonderful place he never dreamed existed  There he finds not only friends  aerial sports  and magic around every corner  but a great destiny that s been waiting for him    if Harry can survive the encounter It s been years since I first read this book  This book was originally four stars  but by the time I got to the fourth book I had to go back and change it because it was then I was officially obsessed with Harry Potter Harry was an amazing character that immediately had my heart  I felt bad for him and and felt joy with him  Rowling made an awesome character that will be remembered in readers  Hearts forever  Hermione was a relatable character for me  She was very smart  and loved to read and study  I do love to read  but am not half as smart as she  I loved her character and the way she cates toward everyone Ron Weasley was one of my first book boyfriends  I loved how he was funny  cute  and he was a redhead  I don t know why  but I love redheads  He was very kind to Harry and gave him a friend  I loved all of the side characters  too  There was Dumbledoor  Ron s family  Neville Longbottom  and Professor Mcgnagall  They all were a good part to the story and I love them all  The story had unexpected parts that came with excitement and some sadness  There were parts during the series where I was just upset about everything that happened  but Rowling had a way to keep you in a story and not let you get away  I have this book five stars and hope you put them into consideration  I love the story and the characters  Please read this series because I know you will love them   One of my all time favorite books  Reading for the umpteenth time  Loved it as usual  Potterhead Forever 3First read  2008Reread  2009  2011  2013 July  2013 December Just like the first time   Amazing    And the illustrations  OH MY    I loved rereading this it was so great and the illustrations are beautiful  I absolutely loved every single Illustration and I m hoping for a sequel    Auf ein Neues  Ich brauch nur einen Satz lesen und ich bin erneut begeistert  I was mind blown when I finished reading this book  My best friend had told me that she absolutely loved this book  and I knew that if there was something that she loved to read  it was probably good  After all  it wasn t everyday my best friend would say   I absolutely love reading Harry Potter   Any who  the plot twists were the thing I was really into  And if there was anything I loved more than plot twists were the characters in this good  You could already tell that Harry was that humble boy  or Hermoine was that know it all  Rowling doesn t just tell you their personality  She shows it   I think I could re read these books a 1000 times  and never get bored   3 I have started re reading this series again and it is still WONDERFUL   Slowly rereading this series for the umpteenth time and it s just as good     I m not sure I can really review something like Harry Potter  Never reading it as a kid  I m just now beginning the series at the age of twenty four  I didn t think I would enjoy it as much as an adult but it s really a fun read  I tried to find things I didn t like or didn t enjoy and there s really not much  I was personally shocked at the lack of details or descriptions in the writing  After seeing so many images from the movies  my mind easily created the environments but realized those creations were not actually from the text  Overall  it s a great young adult book and I m looking forward to completing this series  As awesome as ever  of course    And what an amazing narration by Stephen Fry   This book starts off with a boy who doesnt know he has magical powers  An orpahn who lost both parents to who shall not be named Voldermort  I recommend this book to people who are interested in sci fi fantasy Harry Potter has to be taken care of by the Dursleys and his spoiled cousin Dudley who is about his age  Harry has to live in the staircase room and be hidden by the world not knowing that he is one of the biggest lengends in the magical world  This book explores the plots he faces and the friends that are alike to him  And I guarentee that you will be satisfied with the ending  Going to make it my mission to re read all the Harry Potter books this Fall  I love this book  It is everything a kid and an adult alike would like to read  Re reading one of my favorite series of all time  I still love it  Thinking I was too adult to read Harry Potter  my first exposure to Rowling was  Casual Vacancy   I totally enjoyed its drama  Then I moved onto her Galbraith series  love them also  The books are wickedly good  All the while I kept thinking this is the woman who wrote the children s series  Harry Potter  How could this be  So let me say I was pleasantly surprised when I read the first book of the Potter series  It was pure fun  fantasy  and with a bit of terror thrown in for good measure  I am so looking forward to reading the rest of the series  After which  I will continue by listening to the audio versions narrated by none other that Jim Dale and then and only then  will I watch the movies  El mejor libro del planeta  Las ilustraciones son soberbias   After many many reads of this book still love every single page Just as amazing as I remember  This book will never get old   It just gets more and more magical the more times you reread    HAVE YOU GONE MAD   Ron bellowed   ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT   First read jan 2014   reread in sept 2015   still amazing     OF COURSE I LOVED IT  AS ALWAYS     ALWAYSSSSSSSSSSSSS         I have re read this book so many times that it never gets old  reread this last month and decided to add it to my reread shelf     I will never hesitate giving this book more than a hundred stars   To the well organised mind  death is but the next great adventure   this book is the best book i ever read  i could nt even put it down Harry Potter is to books  as marijuana is to drugs  a gateway   FIVE PERFECT STARS  3 Or I d rather say  INFINITE STARS  3    This is probably my favorite book I ve ever read JK Rowling  Recientemente  en diciembre  vi la saga completa de de Harry Potter  Disfrute muchisimo las peliculas y esto desperto mi curiosidad por leer los libros  Lo cierto es que no me imagine lo mucho que me iban a encantar y que me iba a enamorar de los pequenos detalles del universo construido por J  K  Rowling  La historia  es decir  la anecdota de este libro  es mas que conocida  Los hechos que van ocurriendo en la narrativa los se por haber visto las peliculas  pero lo que encontre es justamente lo que no puede pasarse al cine  ciertos guinos  ciertas peculiaridades  pequenas costuras con que esta zurcido este mundo imaginario y que lo convierten en algo entranable y adictivo  Amo a Harry y por su condicion de huerfano me siento muy identificada  Amo a Hermione por su nonez  Amo a Ron por su torpeza  A Dumbledore y a Severus no los amo  pero son indispensables y siempre estan llenos de sorpresas que me hacen que me resulten cada vez mas fascinantes  Amo a Rowling  en definitiva   Once again this book has kept me glued from page to page  I know for a fact that I will forever love the Harry Potter series and will be re reading it in future years  I love the characters and the world that has been created  Even now so many years after its initial release it is still so different from other books  I enjoy how this series isn t targeted at one individual age market to  Granted this book is light and almost care free but you can tell even without having read it before the dark lord will play a more prominent role keeping it appealing for older readers  I swear  this book just got better the second time around  This was amazing   magical  I loved every bit of it    Love this every single time I read it  What a pleasure  Mein erstes Mal  Harry Potter    ich bin begeistert  A childhood favorite that s still just as good as always  Read it for the first time in my life finally       Harry Potter and the Sorcers Stone is the first book of the amazing Harry Potter series  It was a fantastic read and I definitely recommend this book to anyone who likes Percy Jackson or any other fantasy books that are adventurous  This book started out when Harry was a little boy  He was delivered to his aunt and uncle s doorstep when he was a baby  his parents died days before Hagrid delivered him  He went through years of following the Dursley s rules and he decided that he was done with it  He was very sad about that  On Harry s 11th birthday  after receiving hundreds of letters from Hogwarts  Hagrid came to his door and told Harry he was a wizard  That is when Harry made the choice to go to Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry  That is when his friendships are started  the train ride is adventurous  and he meets new people and lives in a new place  Harry  Hermione and Ron have many adventures together at Hogwarts  But to learn them all you will have to read the books  This book was one of the best books I ve ever read  The Harry Potter series is definitely worth reading  I hope you enjoy my reference  I have no words  This book is so great  Splendid   Nothing needs to be said for this entire series   D Took my Love for Harry Potter to a whole new level    D Todo empieza aqui  La saga que cambio mi vida por completo  nt bts lny  n r yy f ktby lmqds  D yrjl  yb kd   D This book is my safe place  Makes me feel at home  This was my first time reading Harry Potter  I m probably the only one left  besides my husband  who hasn t read all of these  I decided to read it because I m sure one of these days the girls will come across the Harry Potter books  so I figured I need to know what they re all about   Plus  I ve heard the books are good    Oh  And this satisfies the category of  young adult bestseller  for our local library s book challenge  The book got my attention at the get go  a wizard desiring power  turning to the dark side  gaining followers  trying to take over  killing good witches and wizards but  curiously  cannot kill Harry but instead leaves a mark on his forehead   hmmm  sound familiar    and kept my attention throughout  It was enjoyable and I will be reading the rest of the series   Listened via Audible  What a freaking joy it was to consume this story again  but in a different format  This was one of my all time favorite stories as a kid growing up  and nothing has changed to stop my from enjoying this again  maybe more this time around   It s amazing how many small  and in some cases major  plot points I had forgotten  It was  in some ways  like I was reading it again for the first time  I was on the edge of my seat  well  not literally  since I was driving  for the entire story  needing to know what happened  Of course  I knew most of the details  but this was still so enjoyable  Read it again everyone    Nunca es tarde para entrar a Hogwarts    Harry Potter     Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone is a fantastic book that everyone should read  young or old  This novel introduces Harry Potter  a boy that has lived a miserable existence for the last 13 years  His parents were killed in what he thinks is a car crash  and he has been left to live with his mother s sister  Petunia  her husband Vernon  and their spoiled  obese son  Dudley  His aunt  uncle  and cousin despise Harry  and are not afraid to show it  They keep him locked away in the broom closet under the stairs  and require him to do manual labor often  However  on Harry s 13th birthday  he learns the truth  he is a wizard  and a famous one  He discovers his parents were wizards  too  but they were killed by the infamous dark wizard  Voldemort  and he escaped the attack on his parents with just the lightning bolt scar on his forehead  Voldemort disappeared after this leaving everyone to believe Harry is the famous defeater of evil  After discovering this  Harry is whisked off to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry  meets his best friends  Ron Weasley and Hermonie Granger  learns to play Quidditch  a wizarding sport  and begins his lessons to become the powerful wizard he is destined to be  At the end of his first year  Harry comes face to face again with Voldemort  but escapes  thwarting Voldemort s plan to rise to power  This novel is full of fantastic characters that are realistic and have an interesting depth to each one  I found myself not only caring about Harry Potter  but also everyone he meets  whether they are good or evil  The descriptive language creates a new world that I can picture in my mind  and as I read  I wish I could live in the world J K  Rowling detailed so lively that it seems as though it is a plane ride away  The conflict in the story  although a fantasy  is a easy relatable tale  good versus evil  a conflict that anyone can relate to at any point in life  This book is a new twist on a coming of age tale that everyone would enjoy   Gotta buy the series  gotta buy the series  Reread July 2015 Oh man  it s good to be back   Still a favorite after all these years  3  Okay so hopefully the others wont be as long as this  This is the first time I have read the Harry Potter books  I have seen all of the films and I am a fan  But these books are something else  I am amazed at how different the books are  They are the same stories  essentially of course  but the details and the extra interactions  information and moments missed out by the films are just exquisitely magical  It is lovely to experience a world you know and love  only to have it improved and revamped  and also  this may be cheeky  but to be able to see all the details of the film in your head   the candle lit hallways of Hogwarts  the snowy scenes and christmas and all the characters faces and voices  without the terrible acting from the principal actors  at least for the first couple  Anyway  The Philosophers Stone is an introduction to this amazing wizarding world and it gave me goosebumps on many occasions  such as when Hagrid turns up to give Harry his cake and take him to get his things  when the passage describes how Harry heard a woman s voice and turned to see a small red haired woman with a small red headed girl and three other red headed boys  when Hermione tells Ron that his spell  isn t very good   and many more  Rowling s writing for me  is 95  fantastic and very descriptive   I think the films help a little here but   and conjure a superb atmosphere  but 5  silly  With the reference to muggle things  it can be a bit irritating  Especially with Ron  which is unnecessary  and odd considering what his father s occupation is  I mean how can they know THAT little about muggle stuff  A bit silly  But with all that said  the story and characters and interactions and the world as a whole it s unmissable  The bits that aren t in the movies are some of the best bits  and discovering these extras was a real pleasure  More to come in the next ones Wonderful  Just wonderful   MEGALOS LATRES TOU KhARI POTER GIA PANTA         Still as engaging as the first time I read it  Sis gramatas burvibai ir nemirstibas eliksirs  This book is worth a 1000    s Love it   4 5Ben bu Draco yu cok seviyoomm yiaaaa    Defalarca okusam izlesem bikmayacagim tek dunya Just as amazing as the first time I ever read it  Just as good as I remember  Love you Harry   K tomu se da rict jen jedine   I  Harry Potter  THIS BOOK IS LIKE THE MOST AMAZING BOOK EVER    Simple y sencillo  AMO Harry Potter  5 stars  Of course  Review to come  Harry potter is a famous book  It is about a little kid named harry  wich lived in a family where everypne hated him  He didn t understand why they hated him  Of course  no mother could hate her son  he lived with his cousins and uncles  Mrs  and Mr  Dursley  They had a nasty fat son called Dudley  They told him his parents died in a car crash  but the truth is he is a wizard  When he goes to a wizarding school  a whole new adventure begins Personally  best book I have read  this book hooked me and I highly recommend it to anywone that loves adventure  It s so good to be back again  The series is the bestestestest ever  WOW WHY HAVE I NEVER READ THIS BEFORE THE FEELSRIGHT IN THE CHILDHOOD Last time read on June 17th 2012 Re read  even better this time around  A refreshing and insightful re read   Just as fantastic as the first time     Just as perfect as I remembered  Read again Feb  22nd 24th 2015 Review coming soon  So excited  I love reading this every now and then  I loved this book with all my heart The book that started it all   So magical   Love it  Un mundo fantastico  Jim Kays work was excellent   Simply incredible   Buku ini KEREN               the grand re read 2015 On the recommendation of my eight year old grandson  I decided to read the first book in the Harry Potter series  I am sorry it took me so long to read this wonderful book  From the very first page  J K  Rowling had me captivated and spellbound  no pun intended     I devoured the book in basically one day  If  like me  you did not read the series when it was first published  I highly recommend it  Rowling is an artful writer    I enjoyed the first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and look forward to reading about the further adventures of Harry and his fellow classmates  I m 20 and I still love it  I love rereading this  My childhood right here  I ABSOULTLY LOVED THIS SERIES Harry Potter 4ever Of course I m giving this 5 Stars  It s Harry Potter what do you expect   I finished this on an airplane and I love that I can really get lost in these Books  The 1 1 2 hour flight just flew by  It was an extra pleasure to thoroughly examine the beautifully painted pictures  I had forgotten that J K  Rowling could suck me in like that  Her writing is just spectacular and I am happy she dedicated it to this breathtaking story  I enjoyed this so very much and I am absolutely looking forward to the next illustrated edition   Review for audiobook   5 magical stars for the story  5 enchanting stars for the narration  I read this series starting around 2000  They were such magical books and I ve always felt so fondly about them  When I realized that they were in audiobook format  I just knew I needed to listen to them  The story was just as magical as I remembered  It was great to catch a few things that I didn t realize before  I love it  The narrator was fantastic  He doesn t such a spell bounding job of bringing the book and characters to life  I really  really loved   Review to come    Such a great novel   even better than I remembered it being  Stephen Fry is an amazing narrator As I listened  I thought about  problems  with the story or areas that could have been improved  I thought it might be fun to think of the story with a critical eye as an adult  But instead I was once again swept away into Rowling s charming world  I outright cried at the most ridiculous events from a combination of nostalgia and some other emotion  I have to listen to them all now  I can t wait to get to my favourite in the series   The Order of the Phoenix   Uh    Duh  relecture 2014 Do you remember your first reading of Harry Potter  I do  I was a teacher librarian and I knew  just knew  that something quite amazing and magical had landed on my desk  Here was a book that was going to get non readers reading  a book that would fully engage those who already read  a book that would delight children and adults alike  Reading Harry Potter takes me back to my childhood of being completely immersed in a world outside of my own  Rowling and her characters take you inside a world that as a child you hope actually exists somewhere  She makes you believe it does and if you are really  really lucky you will get to go there  In the meantime someone has written about it and you can escape there any time you want simply by opening a book Subsequent readings of the book do not dull it s shine  I still feel that shiver of delight as Harry escapes the Dursely s and discovers the other world  I look for clues to things I know will happen in future books and I ponder and despair over things like Snape s dislike of Harry and his desperate need to protect the child of the woman he still loves Yes  Harry Potter is magical and wonderful  It is a story that will never age and will be loved by many for years and years to come  Bueno  pues aqui vengo al fin con la resena del primer libro de  Harry Potter   Tenia muchisimas ganas y muchisima curiosidad a la hora de estrenarme con estos libros  pues son universalmente conocidos  Lo que ocurre es que cuando comenzaron a publicarse yo ya era un poco mayorcita y me pillo con otras lecturas  pero como nunca es tarde si la dicha es buena  y encima ahora leo de todo  pues aqui estoy con el Primero os dire que no voy a dejar sinopsis porque creo que no habra practicamente nadie que no conozca  aunque sea a groso modo  de que trata esta saga y por consiguiente este  su primer libro  Me voy a centrar mas en mis impresiones durante su lectura Lo primero que ha llamado mi atencion a sido su sencillez  pensaba que seria una obra mucho mas elaborada en lo que a la narracion se refiere  pero me he encontrado con una forma de contar las cosas extremadamente sencilla  pero deliciosa  pues te imaginas todo el  universo Potter  sin dificultad ninguna pese a la sencillez que os comento  lo cual para mi siempre es de agradecer pues se convierte en una lectura amena y sin complicaciones  Esta claro que es un libro juvenil y por lo tanto no suelen ser complicados de leer pero al tratarse de un universo diferente pense que quiza se enrollaria mas con descripciones y tal  pero no ha sido asi Por otro lado  si no lo mejor  casi  son los escenarios  Ese majestuoso castillo  con sus innumerables salas  estancias y escaleras  es maravilloso  Ademas de ese lago y bosques que lo rodean que aunque no sean protagonistas  al menos de momento  los intuyes y te arropan Muchos de sus personajes tambien son destacables  pues han quedado fijados  a lo largo de los anos  en la imaginacion colectiva  tanto de los lectores de la saga como de los seguidores de sus adaptaciones cinematograficas  convirtiendose para siempre en iconos de lo magico Por lo tanto  un libro muy ameno  que creo que merece la pena conocer aunque sea por mera curiosidad  Os resultara una lectura muy facil y agradable  Preparados para desenfundar baritas    WINGARDIUM LEVIOSA    I did a reread of Harry Potter books 4 7 last fall in preparation for some bar trivia contests  we got 2nd    twice   but I can t remember the last time I picked up the earlier books in Harry s saga  Once upon a time I devoured them over and over and over again  impatiently waiting for Goblet or Order of the Phoenix to be released  Now it seems I will be impatiently waiting again  and not just for the soon to be released script of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child  which is being published this summer to coincide with the stage show s opening in London No  now I also get to wait for more of these illustrated editions  Word is that the entire series will get the illustrated treatment  and I could not be more delighted  Jim Kay  the mastermind being the paintings within this first installment  does gorgeous work in both recreating popular scenes and in providing filler images to accentuate the story  the chessmen are a personal favorite   Last I read Kay is planning on doing all of the upcoming novels as well  and I am eager to see his interpretations of additional characters  creatures  and concepts within Rowling s magical world If you are a newcomer to Harry Potter and have somehow avoided all books and movies up until this point  know that this book stands on its own without the illustrations  though it is quite clearly intended for younger readers  I have heard criticisms from adults who read this book for the first time assuming that the writing and themes would be for a grown up audience  They were disappointed because frankly  you cannot have that expectation  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone is the opening adventure in the life of an eleven year old boy and his likewise aged friends  and the story is meant to be accessible for children of that same age One of the things that drew me to the series in my younger days was that I was that target audience age at the time of release  As the characters grew  so did I  This particular book is most appropriate for young readers   and I d imagine the pictures would make for awesome story time   but they are just has fun for adults  I had as wonderful a time reading this book now as I did fifteen or so years ago  Additionally  to you adults reading these for the first time  the books grow in maturity as the characters age  The early stories can be read by pre teen readers  but by the conclusion the themes are far darker and more grown up  Having recently read Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows  the difference in tone between Harry at eleven and Harry at seventeen is remarkable It s hard to say much more about this series  since it has now been a massive presence in our pop culture for nearly twenty years  If you ve read these books already and would like to visit Harry s world again  give this a read  It s beautiful on top of being fun and absolutely brimming with nostalgia  If you are one of those seemingly rare non reader flowers  get on this  Even if you re an adult  It s such a delightful  creative world wrapped into a quick  engrossing  and gorgeously illustrated volume  It should not be missed by any  Bu seriyi okumakta cok geciktim Filmleri izledigim icin kitaplari okumak istemiyordum ama okuduktan sonra iyiki okumusum dedim Mukemmel bir kitapti Kitabi okudugum zamanki hissi nasil ifade edebilirim bilmiyorum Kitaptan aldigim doyum o mutluluk hissi cok guzeldi Serinin devamini okumak istiyorum ama bir yandan da bitmesini istemiyorum Filmleri bosverin Tamam gercekten cok guzel olabilirler ama kitap cok cok daha iyi Elinizde varsa daha fazla geciktirmeden Harry Potter in buyulu dunyasina dalin    O  Reread It is always funny going back to books you have read before and discovering new things there  Sorcerer s Stone actually was not the first Harry Potter book I read  Rather I skipped right to Chamber of Secrets  which I read after listening to my mom read some of it to my little brother aloud  they filled me in on the details from  1   In fact I dont  think I got around to reading Sorcerer s Stone itself until after I had already read Prisoner of Azkaban  By that time I was 17  I found it to be rather dull compared to the exciting second and third books and as a result  though I have read 3 7 at least twice  I have never really gone back and read 1 since that first time which was about 16 years ago  I never had that feeling of coming to Hogwarts for the first time  I loved the Harry Potter books  I loved the later movies  but I was too old  I never really experienced the magic in the way my brother did  my brother who was 6 when the book came out and he was introduced to this magical world  who believed his letter to Hogwarts could come  I was determined that my daughter get the full experience  I took her to the Wizarding World of Harry Potter in the fall of 2014 and she became enraptured with the idea of Harry Potter though she had never heard the stories or seen the movies before  When I saw the newly illustrated edition of the book released last year  I knew this would be my opportunity  First of all  I must say that the illustrations are gorgeous  Beautiful as artwork and beautifully complementary of the text  Secondly I have to say reading the book to somebody who has no idea what is going to happen  who doesn t know any of the characters  who is bright enough to understand what is going on but still naive enough to believe in magic was an absolute delight  I think reading this book aloud to my daughter was one of the highlights of my life as a parent  There really is no experience like a 5 year old voice asking can we read another chapter please please  There are many ways I can be critical of the work as a lover of literature  as a librarian  but certain works are beyond criticism  certain arguments simply cannot be made when it comes to things that are beloved  that have become so entwined with childhood  Does my daughter  for whom the work is intended  care that aspects of the book are derivative  that the narrative wraps up too conveniently  It is fun to believe in magic again   Supremely late to the party but hey  at least I am here now  And I m so HAPPY   Everyone knows how perfect this series is and I can definitely see why  There s just nothing wrong with this book  How could that be  But it can  Losing it   losing it      Yeah  whatever Snape  I should stop using all these HP gifs  I m starting to sound nuts  But this is fun  SO MUCH FUN P s Dumbledore  Hagrid  Professor McGonagall  ME LOVES YOUUUUU P P s Is there anyway not to love all Weasleys  Especially Fred and George As I thought  As I thought  What can a person really say about Harry Potter this long after it s come out  This is one of those books that I initially avoided because of the hype around it but eventually I gave him and read them before the final book was released  I was immediately hooked  A long time  and at least a couple of rereads  has passed since I first read this book but it s still a fantastic book  The early books  and this one in particular  are geared toward a younger audience  of course  but it can still be appreciated by a person of any age  Who doesn t need to be reminded of how important friends are  and standing up for what s right even when others don t  or the true value of courage  There is so much packed in these few pages that make this book a must read for everyone  Even this early in the series  the characters are learning so much that is still applicable to the real world  I won t belabor the point by going into the story and what happens in it because that s not what this review is about  The story is so familiar in mainstream culture now that trying to explain it just comes across as pretentious and needlessly wordy  What I will say is that this is an excellent book for young readers  teens  and adults alike  You can delve as deep into the book and world inside it as you like or just read through it quickly and move on to the next one  This is an excellent starting point of a story that will grow with the reader  Don t be afraid to pick it up just because it s a kid s book or geared for young adults  There is plenty of content here and in the following books for adults as well   ILLUSTRATED EDITION REVIEW INCLUDEDGeneral statement  not regarding illustrations  Ok  obviously I ADORE this book because it is one of my favorite books of all time  If you haven t read this  you need to get on that  My rating is clearly five stars The review below is for the ILLUSTRATED EDITION and mostly critiques the art style  This is based on my opinions on art and how I would have liked it  it s 100  opinions  Read the illustrated edition before reading my review  please     view spoiler   ok  I am THE ONLY ONE  but I really disliked the illustrations  This edition gets 3 stars from me  the story was flawless  but this edition was definitely a disappointment for me  I ve never been a fan of creepy art  And especially for the first book  I felt that the art style should have been more whimsical  It should become more dark throughout the series  at this rate  I d expect the pages of Deathly Hallows to not even have a dot of white space The character illustrations almost reminded me of Tim Burton  whose work I dislike because his films gave me nightmares as a child  I ll respect that he is talented and that s his style  but I don t necessarily have to be fond of his style  There were so many opportunities for Jim Kay to add illustrations  for example  visuals of the candy purchased on the train  the Great Haul and the Griffindor dorms would have been excellent  Instead  he illustrated the ghosts  which I found boring  and dark silhouettes of the hogwarts castle several times I also disliked his take on Hermione  particularly the one on page 150  She doesn t look anything like how I pictured Hermione  or at least anything like movie Hermione  In fact  I preferred the actors in the films to the drawings in this book in general And of course  I m not saying the illustrations are WRONG  I m saying they aren t what I wanted so I was disappointed  Jim Kay is very talented  I just don t believe this art style was best for this book  Perhaps for the last few  when the mood gets darker  it would have been more appropriate  but for a nostalgic reader who wanted to return to the whimsical land of hogwarts  though I never really left lol  it really confused the mood of the book for me  I recognize and respect the work it takes to do something like this  and while his art style isn t something I love  I ll respect it  I ll still keep the book because of the gorgeous cover  but I ll choose to read the original editions next time  favorite illustrations  in order of appearance the hogwarts train  pg 80 coverowl  pg 4Harry in cupboard  pg 16Harry with mirror of erised  pg 170Harry with Dumbledore  pg 173Voldemort under turban  pg 234End of Year Feast  pg 244 you ll notice that my favorites are the more whimsical illustrations because that I think that is the mood of the book also sorry if this was rambly lol  hide spoiler   It s Harry Potter   nough said  Not even my favorite book out of the bunch  but just what J K  Rowling s done in terms of building an entire world  starting with this book right here  is sufficient for this to be worthy of a five stars rating HOWEVER    It d been years since I last read any Harry Potter books  Almost a decade  tbh  I decided I wanted to do it again but this time in English  see if my experience with the story would be different somehow  What I found is that the language really had nothing to do with how I perceived the book  but my current age did  Reading Harry Potter as an adult is completely different than reading it as a child or teenager   view spoiler  For instance  Snape  I remember loving Snape  he was one of my favorite characters by the time the series was over  And yes  it s been a while  I might have a change of hearts again over Snape as I continue with the story  yadda yadda  BUT  Dude  The way he treated Harry was just  Argh I mean  I don t even like Harry  He s a good character  but not one I like as a person  if that even makes any sense  I tend to dislike Gryffindors in general  they re annoying as fuck  But Harry was an 11 years old orphan boy who spent his entire life in an abusive home  knew absolutely nothing about his family or his powers or the world where he belonged  totally lost on his first few Hogwarts  weeks  and here comes this professor treating him like crap from day one  Wtf  seriously  What kind of bitter adult does that to a child  Yes  I know  there was the whole thing with James and Lilly and the fact Snape was sort of playing his part in a much bigger picture  if you will  STILL  It s kind of revolting to see the way he humiliates Harry every chance he gets  That s a bloody child who s gone through a lot of shit  Chill out  bro  Also  Dumbledore  he s a bit of an a hole  isn t he  I mean    Come on  You just brought Harry in  Give the boy some advice  at least  Say hello  Don t freaking send him into a potentially deathly battle with bloody Voldemort  dude  Kid s 11  A bit of a self important brat  Yes  But come on  He s got no guidance  never had  He s basically just dancing to the song you play him  and he doesn t even know what the fuck he s doing  A bit of support would ve been nice Neville  I bought the whole  oh  look at this loser  crap when I first read this book  It s entirely possible I m being influenced here by the fact I know Neville becomes a fucking badass by the end of the story  but I totally changed my mind  Neville is awesome  I love Neville  He s my favorite Gryffindor  alongside Hermione   hide spoiler   Minha terceira releitura  acredito eu  que nao foi literalmente uma leitura porque eu escutei em audiobook  Confesso que gostei muito  mas acho que isso se deve mais ao narrador  o incrivel Stephen Fry  Que ator maravilhoso  Ele conseguiu dar vida a cada personagem apenas com a voz  O mais perfeito de todos foi o Hagrid Nao tenho muito o que acrescentar enquanto apreciacao de Harry Potter  Mais uma vez foi otimo e eu gosto muito do primeiro porque e o mais nostalgico pra mim  Contudo  eu demorei muito tempo pra escutar o livro todo  Muito mesmo  Aproximadamente tres meses    Eu gostei bastante da experiencia em si de escutar  mas tive dois grandes problemas  1  nao da pra se distrair porque se nao perde se um monte de coisas  Quando voce le geralmente se dedica aquilo  escutando  as chances de prestar atencao em outra coisas  ate dentro da propria cabeca  sao grandes o que e ruim  e 2  dediquei pouco tempo por semana ao livro entao demorei muito pra escutar  Talvez eu devesse ter aumentado a velocidade da narracao  mas  de qualquer forma  nao colocaria como prioridade escutar em momentos que poderia estar lendo um livro fisico Ou seja  ler audiobooks pra mim serve mais quando volto pra casa a pe    5 Amazing  Brilliant  StarsBrings back memories of my childhood  I can remember being 12 years old and visiting my grandma s house  In her living room she had the first three hardcover books sitting on the piano bench  At the time I had no clue about the series  or what was to come  At that time it was strictly the Scholastic Black History novels  The Babysitter s Club and Goosebumps  Those were my reading books  I remember grabbing the first book and sitting on the couch  the next thing I know it s dinner time and I m halfway done  I was shocked that I had read that much  I absolutely love this series  If I had to describe it in one words it ll be Friendships This series told me how to have friends  and keep them  It taught me what undying love looks like  It taught me loyalty  happiness  and courage  It brings tears to my eyes writing this review because I hadn t read the series since 2005 when I was 17 and the last book was released  Sure I ve seen the movies a billion times  I know almost all the dialogue  and history  It s nothing like reading the magic from the beginning  Harry Potter is one of my favorite characters every  I love the cast of this series  even that dreadful toad Malfoy  I love Harry s courage to be himself in a world where he knew nothing about  I love Ron s undying loyalty  I love Hermione s quick wit  and her smarts  I ll continue reading the series as if I never have  So  turns out my parents let me live under a rock for 17 and a half years  I ve never read any of the Harry Potter books growing up nor did I see the movies around the time they came out  basically because my parents hate movies books containing fantasy science fiction genres like that  and hey  if your parents hate it  that must mean you ll hate it too  5 year old me logic  And then  people around me  all big fans of the Harry Potter stuff  found out I did not grow up following the story of The Boy Who Lived   HOW DARE YOU    YOU MISSED YOUR ENTIRE CHILDHOOD    DID YOU EVEN READ ANYTHING AT THAT AGE    so a few months ago  I decided to give the movies a try I absolutely loved every bit of it I watched the movies until the Half Blood Prince  and then I stopped  because now I really  really wanted to read the books And so I did  starting at the very beginning  of course Reading this book is an adventure  From the first line you re immediately pulled into the story full of magic and it s very hard to take a break from reading  I basically took this book with me wherever I went to continue reading  and now that I ve finished it  I need more Really excited to continue reading this series to catch up on my  missed childhood   One of the most beautiful books i ve ever owned   This edition is absolutely stunning and i can t take my eyes from it Jim Kay was an excellent choice his drawings are amazing  He captures the story in just a few pictures but brings it to life like nothing else  They are funny like Dudley s baby pictures but also very touching like Harry leaning against the mirror Erised or scary like Snape  or for me some hairy big spiders  and the Owls are judt beautiful  It s a great addition to my bookshelf and i m going to treasure this version for ever        Si je prends toujours autant de plaisir a relire cette serie et ce premier tome  celui ou tout a commence  je crois pouvoir dire que je l ai presque redecouvert cette semaine  Les illustrations m ont vraiment obligee a prendre le temps de le lire  de savourer la plume magique de J K  Rowling a nouveau  C est a chaque fois le meme emerveillement de voir la maniere dont elle nous emporte  Les illustrations de Jim Kay accompagnent a la perfection cette magie enchanteresse  Je le reconnais  au tout debut  quand j ai entendu parler d une version illustree  je ne m attendais pas du tout a ce style de traits  je ne sais pas ce que j imaginais mais une chose est sure  ce n etait pas ca  Une part de moi etait plutot septique puis au fil des petites images qui etaient devoilees    oui  pourquoi pas       Puis j ai arrete de vraiment les regarder pour me laisser l entiere surprise  c est pour ca que je vous mets peu de photos dans l article et en petit format   Et finalement  c est vraiment splendide et colle parfaitement a l histoire  Il y a une version de Harry en fin de livre  je me suis arretee 5 minutes dessus en me disant    mais c est vraiment lui  c est mon Harry     On reconnait tous les personnages  tous les lieux et Jim Kay a su nous les rendre vivants  reels  peut etre pas comme on les imaginait apres lecture mais qui finalement correspondent parfaitement       L integralite de mon avis ici  http   lune et plume fr harry potter     I LOVED this story  It was beautifully written  it had fun characters and exciting situations  it had humor  it made me both laugh and cry  it    It was just wonderful     There are so many scenes that I love in this book  From  The Boy Who Lived  to  The Letters from No One  to  The Mirror of Erised  to  The Man with Two Faces  and pretty much all the other chapters  as well  there was always something to love One of my most favorite scenes is the one in Chapter Eight   The Potions Master   where Professor Snape says   view spoiler   I can teach you how to bottle fame  brew glory  even stopper death      hide spoiler    I heard this speech in Alan Rickman s voice and it gave me the chills     Other fun scenes included Harry s time in the reptile house during the trip to the zoo for Dudley s birthday  Harry s first trip to Diagon Alley  the Sorting Hat s song and sorting of Harry  learning that Hagrid  view spoiler  named his giant three headed dog Fluffy   hide spoiler   and the whole of the  Through the Trapdoor  chapter   and more  Of course  more  Like I said in the beginning of this review  this story was beautifully written  So every scene was wonderful   Through the Trapdoor  especially has much in it to love  First  we have the hilarious scene where Harry and Ron are  view spoiler  trapped in the Devil s Snare  Hermione knows what the plant likes    the dark and the damp    and when Harry tells her to  light a fire   she cries   but there s no wood   And Ron  I really love Ron  lol  bellows   HAVE YOU GONE MAD  ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT   Then once the boys are free and the three of them are past the Devil s Snare  Ron says       there s no wood   honestly    hide spoiler   lol   There s also the  view spoiler  chess match  in which Ron realizes that they can win if he sacrifices himself   I m sooo glad he wasn t too terribly hurt when the white queen took him out    hide spoiler   Then Hermione uses logic  and if we readers had been told which bottles were the largest and the smallest  I d have been able to figure out which was which  too     And  of course  there s Harry  Courageous and able to think in the midst of a crisis  what s not to like  I really love Harry      In fact  I really like all of the characters  even Malfoy and the rest  I mean  we re meant to dislike them  right  And I do dislike them  So that makes them fun to read about  I enjoyed every one of the moments in which Malfoy was surprised  scared  and or in trouble     In sum  I just really love this book  I could gush more  but I think I ve said enough  You get that I love this book  I m sure      Be still my muggle heart  I m still wrapped up in the magic of this book  I ve lost count of how many times I ve read Sorcerer s Stone but this new illustrated version is on a whole other level  Every detail of this book is absolutely beautiful and serves to elevate the story  The thick glossy pages remind me of a children s picture book  The illustrations are richly colored and most importantly  true to the story  As much as I adore the movies  you won t see Daniel  Emma or Rupert depicted in these pages  The characters and scenes are modeled after JKR s descriptions  If you are wondering if the illustrations are few and far between  nothing could be further from the truth  There is artwork nearly every couple of pages  many of which are full page or two page spreads  I was very impressed  The icing on the cake is the red ribbon book mark attached to the binding  I am ecstatic to collect the other 6 volumes as they come out  Though I wish I didn t have to wait a whole year for the next one  the publishing company has probably done me a favor  If I had them all at my disposal now  I would likely want to read nothing else  If you are a Harry Potter fan  this edition belongs in a prominent spot on your bookshelf  Harry Potter has lived 10 long uneventful years with his abusive uncle  aunt  and cousin  the Dursleys  He thinks he ll live his whole life as an outcast  until one day  a giant breaks down the door  and tells Harry he s a wizard  From that moment  his life changed  The giant man  Hagrid  told him that there was a wizarding world  and he was part of it  Harry learns that he is actually famous in the wizarding world  because he defeated the villain  the same villain who killed his parents  when he was still a young baby  Hagrid brings him to Hogwarts  the wizard school  and Harry makes friends  Hermione and Ron  learns magic  plays quidditch  and does loads of things he shouldn t have done I love the Harry Potter series so much  It s amazing  I love the characters  the magic  the adventures  just the concept of Hogwarts itself  Honestly  if JK Rowling just wrote a book about Hogwarts  before Harry came and had all his  adventures   I would ve read it  and probably would have enjoyed it  Hermione Granger  is my favourite character  I m not going to go into that much detail but  she s a genius  The brightest witch of her age   They haven t found a spell our Hermione can t do   She knows everything  Literally everything  Starting from the Hogwarts Express  she was my favourite character  She s smart  She s amazing at spells  charms  transfiguration  and even potions  Harry and Ron would have died like a thousand times if Hermione wasn t there to save them  The Devil s Snare  the potions  everything  She has logic  which most wizards and witches don t have  I think she s a little bit of a perfectionist  which is why and it incantations and potions are up to par  She needs to do amazing in exams  so she studies hard  Hermione Granger is an amazing role model  Emma Watson  the girl who played Hermione in the Harry Potter movies  once said   Girls are told you have to be the delicate princess  Hermione taught them that you can be the warrior   And it s true  That  is why Hermione is my favourite character Also  I don t know what JK Rowling was thinking  but where in Canada  where I live  the bishop is not next to the rook  There s a knight in between the two  But  in the book  when they were on their way to the stone  and playing chess  Ron said   Well  Harry you take the place of that bishop and Hermione you go next to him instead of the castle  I m not saying I m an amazing chess player  but I know how to play  and I know how to set up a board  When I set up the board  the Rook is at the edge  the knight is next to it  then the bishop is next to the knight  She could ve not meant right next to it  but it doesn t make sense  Also  it s not called a castle  It s a rook  Although this was written in Britain I think  so they could play different than I do  but I doubt it Anyways  Harry Potter is still one of my most favourite series   and I think Louella should finish reading the series  and anyone else who hasn t read it yet should really read it because it s amazing  I was flabbergasted when I received the book  which I ve purchased without much investigation  I appreciated the first illustrations revealed when the project was young  and was determined to have it But when I thought it d be a normal book  with quite a few illustrations  I discovered a full color album  large and thick  where the integral text is mixed with quantity of quality illustrations  big and small  paint  watercolors  black and white  sepia   Jim Kay is very talented  and I truly appreciated how his art and personality helps us escaping the movies  images  even if I like them  to be immersed in the story  a wonderful and fascinating story The book in itself is magnificent  especially at such a reasonable price  256 pages in deep and bright colors  the text is printed upon sepia pages with tiny illustrations all over the free spaces   in a thick and glossy paper Under the movable color cover  the book is covered in bright red canvas  with a red ribbon as a bookmark Having one s favorite book completely illustrated is a dream coming true  and we are very lucky to have access to such a beautiful version  which isn t a marketable object  even if it ll be in a way  of course  but a true work of art  4 8Nothing wrong with the writing  still so many years later I love this book  Though I noted the text had all the English spellings of words not a big deal or really that noteworthy The art was so pretty done in mostly inks and what looks like watercolor  There are a few images that stuck out more than others the ghosts portrait at the welcome feast and Diagon Alley being a few  The selection of what the artist Jim Kay chose to illustrate is what I was a little disappointed with  It seemed that he just pick and chose a few things to illustrate and popped them in wherever they made sense  The pictures didn t always match the text or really display what was going on that part of the book  The pictures and the text were sometimes disjointed from each other  though the pictures were never ugly or disappointing  Towards the end of the book I felt there were less pictures than there were in the beginning  like the artist lost steam or something  In the next book I would like to see more illustrations and a better selection of the subject of said illustrations  I did appreciate Jim K s interpretation of the characters though  it took me an embarrassingly long amount of time to read this  to be fair tho while I did start in August technically I read the bulk of it in September and just finished tonight  I think I found it hard to read consistently bc I knew the story so well  I ve read the first book the most out of all of them and seen the movie also soooo many times  I didn t feel compelled to constantly be reading and to know what happens next  although that doesn t change how much more I loved this book reading it years after I first read it     I appreciated so many things about the book I didn t appreciate before like the mirror of erised  and noticing what it and the inscription on it spells backwards if that wasn t already supposed to be obvious     or how touching it is when Harry learns about why his scar is powerful or so many little things  I paid more attention to things I didn t before and I also noticed things about the characters I didn t before  Ron reminds me of Seth Cohen from the oc where I loved him when I was younger and I still love him now but am able to recognize some of his flaws   Neville used to be an annoying pansy to me when I was younger but now I m able to relate to him and understand how hard it really is to stand up to your friends   anyways maybe I ll write a full post on this on my blog one day but I m glad I reread this    there s a few other books I want to read finish reading before I start the chamber of secrets but hopefully I ll start it soon      reread September 2015  I CAN T BELIEVE I WAITED SO LONG TO READ THIS SERIES  It s probably definitely one of the best series I ve ever read  it s so perfect  But I feel like a full blown review on how great this book is would be redundant  over said  and unnecessary  So I ll just do the highlights THE CHARACTERS IN THIS BOOK WERE CRAFTED SO WELL  I can t believe that I liked all of the characters  There s usually one or two characters hat I can t stand  but I loved all the characters   even Snape and Draco a bit  WAIT  OVERRIDE  I   and hopefully everyone else with a working mid   HATE THE DURSLEYS SO MUCH  GOD  I JUST WANNA MURDER THEM ALL  Like what are you doing trying to abuse the greatest hero your world has ever known  GET OUT   I guess the fact that they incited such a reaction in me must be an example of how well crafted they were   I ve been told that none of them perish in the books to come  so that s unfortunate  But otherwise  yeah  characters are 12 10 stars My favorite scene is   and will always be   the end scene where Dumbledore gives Gryffindor a bunch of points and they beat Slytherin  CLASSIC  I smile out loud every time  There were also a lot of laugh out loud scenes in this book   Stop moving   Hermione ordered them   I know what this is   it s Devil s Snare   Oh  I m so glad we know what it s called  that s a great help   snarled Ron  leaning back  trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck  Shut up  I m trying to remember how to kill it   said Hermione  Well  hurry up  I can t breathe   Harry gasped  wrestling with it as it curled around his chest  Devil s Snare  Devil s Snare       what did Professor Sprout say    it likes the dark and the damp     So light a fire   Harry choked  Yes   of course   but there s no wood   Hermione cried  wringing her hands  HAVE YOU GONE MAD   Ron bellowed   ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT    Oh  right   said Hermione  and she whipped out her wand  muttered something  and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames she had used on Snape at the plant  In a matter of seconds  the two boys felt it loosening its grip as it cringed away from the light and warmth  Wriggling and flailing  it unraveled itself from their bodies  and they were able to pull free  Lucky you pay attention in Herbology  Hermione   said Harry as he joined her by the wall  wiping sweat off his face  Yeah   said Ron   and lucky Harry doesn t lose his head in a crisis    there s no wood   honestly   Just in case you live under a rock  this book is unofficial required reading for everyone on Earth  Get your hands on one now  I ABSOULTLY LOVED THIS SERIES Harry Potter 4ever Of course I m giving this 5 Stars  It s Harry Potter what do you expect   I finished this on an airplane and I love that I can really get lost in these Books  The 1 1 2 hour flight just flew by  It was an extra pleasure to thoroughly examine the beautifully painted pictures  I had forgotten that J K  Rowling could suck me in like that  Her writing is just spectacular and I am happy she dedicated it to this breathtaking story  I enjoyed this so very much and I am absolutely looking forward to the next illustrated edition   Review for audiobook   5 magical stars for the story  5 enchanting stars for the narration  I read this series starting around 2000  They were such magical books and I ve always felt so fondly about them  When I realized that they were in audiobook format  I just knew I needed to listen to them  The story was just as magical as I remembered  It was great to catch a few things that I didn t realize before  I love it  The narrator was fantastic  He doesn t such a spell bounding job of bringing the book and characters to life  I really  really loved   Review to come    Such a great novel   even better than I remembered it being  Stephen Fry is an amazing narrator As I listened  I thought about  problems  with the story or areas that could have been improved  I thought it might be fun to think of the story with a critical eye as an adult  But instead I was once again swept away into Rowling s charming world  I outright cried at the most ridiculous events from a combination of nostalgia and some other emotion  I have to listen to them all now  I can t wait to get to my favourite in the series   The Order of the Phoenix   Uh    Duh  relecture 2014 Do you remember your first reading of Harry Potter  I do  I was a teacher librarian and I knew  just knew  that something quite amazing and magical had landed on my desk  Here was a book that was going to get non readers reading  a book that would fully engage those who already read  a book that would delight children and adults alike  Reading Harry Potter takes me back to my childhood of being completely immersed in a world outside of my own  Rowling and her characters take you inside a world that as a child you hope actually exists somewhere  She makes you believe it does and if you are really  really lucky you will get to go there  In the meantime someone has written about it and you can escape there any time you want simply by opening a book Subsequent readings of the book do not dull it s shine  I still feel that shiver of delight as Harry escapes the Dursely s and discovers the other world  I look for clues to things I know will happen in future books and I ponder and despair over things like Snape s dislike of Harry and his desperate need to protect the child of the woman he still loves Yes  Harry Potter is magical and wonderful  It is a story that will never age and will be loved by many for years and years to come  Bueno  pues aqui vengo al fin con la resena del primer libro de  Harry Potter   Tenia muchisimas ganas y muchisima curiosidad a la hora de estrenarme con estos libros  pues son universalmente conocidos  Lo que ocurre es que cuando comenzaron a publicarse yo ya era un poco mayorcita y me pillo con otras lecturas  pero como nunca es tarde si la dicha es buena  y encima ahora leo de todo  pues aqui estoy con el Primero os dire que no voy a dejar sinopsis porque creo que no habra practicamente nadie que no conozca  aunque sea a groso modo  de que trata esta saga y por consiguiente este  su primer libro  Me voy a centrar mas en mis impresiones durante su lectura Lo primero que ha llamado mi atencion a sido su sencillez  pensaba que seria una obra mucho mas elaborada en lo que a la narracion se refiere  pero me he encontrado con una forma de contar las cosas extremadamente sencilla  pero deliciosa  pues te imaginas todo el  universo Potter  sin dificultad ninguna pese a la sencillez que os comento  lo cual para mi siempre es de agradecer pues se convierte en una lectura amena y sin complicaciones  Esta claro que es un libro juvenil y por lo tanto no suelen ser complicados de leer pero al tratarse de un universo diferente pense que quiza se enrollaria mas con descripciones y tal  pero no ha sido asi Por otro lado  si no lo mejor  casi  son los escenarios  Ese majestuoso castillo  con sus innumerables salas  estancias y escaleras  es maravilloso  Ademas de ese lago y bosques que lo rodean que aunque no sean protagonistas  al menos de momento  los intuyes y te arropan Muchos de sus personajes tambien son destacables  pues han quedado fijados  a lo largo de los anos  en la imaginacion colectiva  tanto de los lectores de la saga como de los seguidores de sus adaptaciones cinematograficas  convirtiendose para siempre en iconos de lo magico Por lo tanto  un libro muy ameno  que creo que merece la pena conocer aunque sea por mera curiosidad  Os resultara una lectura muy facil y agradable  Preparados para desenfundar baritas    WINGARDIUM LEVIOSA    I did a reread of Harry Potter books 4 7 last fall in preparation for some bar trivia contests  we got 2nd    twice   but I can t remember the last time I picked up the earlier books in Harry s saga  Once upon a time I devoured them over and over and over again  impatiently waiting for Goblet or Order of the Phoenix to be released  Now it seems I will be impatiently waiting again  and not just for the soon to be released script of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child  which is being published this summer to coincide with the stage show s opening in London No  now I also get to wait for more of these illustrated editions  Word is that the entire series will get the illustrated treatment  and I could not be more delighted  Jim Kay  the mastermind being the paintings within this first installment  does gorgeous work in both recreating popular scenes and in providing filler images to accentuate the story  the chessmen are a personal favorite   Last I read Kay is planning on doing all of the upcoming novels as well  and I am eager to see his interpretations of additional characters  creatures  and concepts within Rowling s magical world If you are a newcomer to Harry Potter and have somehow avoided all books and movies up until this point  know that this book stands on its own without the illustrations  though it is quite clearly intended for younger readers  I have heard criticisms from adults who read this book for the first time assuming that the writing and themes would be for a grown up audience  They were disappointed because frankly  you cannot have that expectation  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone is the opening adventure in the life of an eleven year old boy and his likewise aged friends  and the story is meant to be accessible for children of that same age One of the things that drew me to the series in my younger days was that I was that target audience age at the time of release  As the characters grew  so did I  This particular book is most appropriate for young readers   and I d imagine the pictures would make for awesome story time   but they are just has fun for adults  I had as wonderful a time reading this book now as I did fifteen or so years ago  Additionally  to you adults reading these for the first time  the books grow in maturity as the characters age  The early stories can be read by pre teen readers  but by the conclusion the themes are far darker and more grown up  Having recently read Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows  the difference in tone between Harry at eleven and Harry at seventeen is remarkable It s hard to say much more about this series  since it has now been a massive presence in our pop culture for nearly twenty years  If you ve read these books already and would like to visit Harry s world again  give this a read  It s beautiful on top of being fun and absolutely brimming with nostalgia  If you are one of those seemingly rare non reader flowers  get on this  Even if you re an adult  It s such a delightful  creative world wrapped into a quick  engrossing  and gorgeously illustrated volume  It should not be missed by any  Bu seriyi okumakta cok geciktim Filmleri izledigim icin kitaplari okumak istemiyordum ama okuduktan sonra iyiki okumusum dedim Mukemmel bir kitapti Kitabi okudugum zamanki hissi nasil ifade edebilirim bilmiyorum Kitaptan aldigim doyum o mutluluk hissi cok guzeldi Serinin devamini okumak istiyorum ama bir yandan da bitmesini istemiyorum Filmleri bosverin Tamam gercekten cok guzel olabilirler ama kitap cok cok daha iyi Elinizde varsa daha fazla geciktirmeden Harry Potter in buyulu dunyasina dalin    O  Reread It is always funny going back to books you have read before and discovering new things there  Sorcerer s Stone actually was not the first Harry Potter book I read  Rather I skipped right to Chamber of Secrets  which I read after listening to my mom read some of it to my little brother aloud  they filled me in on the details from  1   In fact I dont  think I got around to reading Sorcerer s Stone itself until after I had already read Prisoner of Azkaban  By that time I was 17  I found it to be rather dull compared to the exciting second and third books and as a result  though I have read 3 7 at least twice  I have never really gone back and read 1 since that first time which was about 16 years ago  I never had that feeling of coming to Hogwarts for the first time  I loved the Harry Potter books  I loved the later movies  but I was too old  I never really experienced the magic in the way my brother did  my brother who was 6 when the book came out and he was introduced to this magical world  who believed his letter to Hogwarts could come  I was determined that my daughter get the full experience  I took her to the Wizarding World of Harry Potter in the fall of 2014 and she became enraptured with the idea of Harry Potter though she had never heard the stories or seen the movies before  When I saw the newly illustrated edition of the book released last year  I knew this would be my opportunity  First of all  I must say that the illustrations are gorgeous  Beautiful as artwork and beautifully complementary of the text  Secondly I have to say reading the book to somebody who has no idea what is going to happen  who doesn t know any of the characters  who is bright enough to understand what is going on but still naive enough to believe in magic was an absolute delight  I think reading this book aloud to my daughter was one of the highlights of my life as a parent  There really is no experience like a 5 year old voice asking can we read another chapter please please  There are many ways I can be critical of the work as a lover of literature  as a librarian  but certain works are beyond criticism  certain arguments simply cannot be made when it comes to things that are beloved  that have become so entwined with childhood  Does my daughter  for whom the work is intended  care that aspects of the book are derivative  that the narrative wraps up too conveniently  It is fun to believe in magic again   Supremely late to the party but hey  at least I am here now  And I m so HAPPY   Everyone knows how perfect this series is and I can definitely see why  There s just nothing wrong with this book  How could that be  But it can  Losing it   losing it      Yeah  whatever Snape  I should stop using all these HP gifs  I m starting to sound nuts  But this is fun  SO MUCH FUN P s Dumbledore  Hagrid  Professor McGonagall  ME LOVES YOUUUUU P P s Is there anyway not to love all Weasleys  Especially Fred and George As I thought  As I thought  What can a person really say about Harry Potter this long after it s come out  This is one of those books that I initially avoided because of the hype around it but eventually I gave him and read them before the final book was released  I was immediately hooked  A long time  and at least a couple of rereads  has passed since I first read this book but it s still a fantastic book  The early books  and this one in particular  are geared toward a younger audience  of course  but it can still be appreciated by a person of any age  Who doesn t need to be reminded of how important friends are  and standing up for what s right even when others don t  or the true value of courage  There is so much packed in these few pages that make this book a must read for everyone  Even this early in the series  the characters are learning so much that is still applicable to the real world  I won t belabor the point by going into the story and what happens in it because that s not what this review is about  The story is so familiar in mainstream culture now that trying to explain it just comes across as pretentious and needlessly wordy  What I will say is that this is an excellent book for young readers  teens  and adults alike  You can delve as deep into the book and world inside it as you like or just read through it quickly and move on to the next one  This is an excellent starting point of a story that will grow with the reader  Don t be afraid to pick it up just because it s a kid s book or geared for young adults  There is plenty of content here and in the following books for adults as well   ILLUSTRATED EDITION REVIEW INCLUDEDGeneral statement  not regarding illustrations  Ok  obviously I ADORE this book because it is one of my favorite books of all time  If you haven t read this  you need to get on that  My rating is clearly five stars The review below is for the ILLUSTRATED EDITION and mostly critiques the art style  This is based on my opinions on art and how I would have liked it  it s 100  opinions  Read the illustrated edition before reading my review  please     view spoiler   ok  I am THE ONLY ONE  but I really disliked the illustrations  This edition gets 3 stars from me  the story was flawless  but this edition was definitely a disappointment for me  I ve never been a fan of creepy art  And especially for the first book  I felt that the art style should have been more whimsical  It should become more dark throughout the series  at this rate  I d expect the pages of Deathly Hallows to not even have a dot of white space The character illustrations almost reminded me of Tim Burton  whose work I dislike because his films gave me nightmares as a child  I ll respect that he is talented and that s his style  but I don t necessarily have to be fond of his style  There were so many opportunities for Jim Kay to add illustrations  for example  visuals of the candy purchased on the train  the Great Haul and the Griffindor dorms would have been excellent  Instead  he illustrated the ghosts  which I found boring  and dark silhouettes of the hogwarts castle several times I also disliked his take on Hermione  particularly the one on page 150  She doesn t look anything like how I pictured Hermione  or at least anything like movie Hermione  In fact  I preferred the actors in the films to the drawings in this book in general And of course  I m not saying the illustrations are WRONG  I m saying they aren t what I wanted so I was disappointed  Jim Kay is very talented  I just don t believe this art style was best for this book  Perhaps for the last few  when the mood gets darker  it would have been more appropriate  but for a nostalgic reader who wanted to return to the whimsical land of hogwarts  though I never really left lol  it really confused the mood of the book for me  I recognize and respect the work it takes to do something like this  and while his art style isn t something I love  I ll respect it  I ll still keep the book because of the gorgeous cover  but I ll choose to read the original editions next time  favorite illustrations  in order of appearance the hogwarts train  pg 80 coverowl  pg 4Harry in cupboard  pg 16Harry with mirror of erised  pg 170Harry with Dumbledore  pg 173Voldemort under turban  pg 234End of Year Feast  pg 244 you ll notice that my favorites are the more whimsical illustrations because that I think that is the mood of the book also sorry if this was rambly lol  hide spoiler   It s Harry Potter   nough said  Not even my favorite book out of the bunch  but just what J K  Rowling s done in terms of building an entire world  starting with this book right here  is sufficient for this to be worthy of a five stars rating HOWEVER    It d been years since I last read any Harry Potter books  Almost a decade  tbh  I decided I wanted to do it again but this time in English  see if my experience with the story would be different somehow  What I found is that the language really had nothing to do with how I perceived the book  but my current age did  Reading Harry Potter as an adult is completely different than reading it as a child or teenager   view spoiler  For instance  Snape  I remember loving Snape  he was one of my favorite characters by the time the series was over  And yes  it s been a while  I might have a change of hearts again over Snape as I continue with the story  yadda yadda  BUT  Dude  The way he treated Harry was just  Argh I mean  I don t even like Harry  He s a good character  but not one I like as a person  if that even makes any sense  I tend to dislike Gryffindors in general  they re annoying as fuck  But Harry was an 11 years old orphan boy who spent his entire life in an abusive home  knew absolutely nothing about his family or his powers or the world where he belonged  totally lost on his first few Hogwarts  weeks  and here comes this professor treating him like crap from day one  Wtf  seriously  What kind of bitter adult does that to a child  Yes  I know  there was the whole thing with James and Lilly and the fact Snape was sort of playing his part in a much bigger picture  if you will  STILL  It s kind of revolting to see the way he humiliates Harry every chance he gets  That s a bloody child who s gone through a lot of shit  Chill out  bro  Also  Dumbledore  he s a bit of an a hole  isn t he  I mean    Come on  You just brought Harry in  Give the boy some advice  at least  Say hello  Don t freaking send him into a potentially deathly battle with bloody Voldemort  dude  Kid s 11  A bit of a self important brat  Yes  But come on  He s got no guidance  never had  He s basically just dancing to the song you play him  and he doesn t even know what the fuck he s doing  A bit of support would ve been nice Neville  I bought the whole  oh  look at this loser  crap when I first read this book  It s entirely possible I m being influenced here by the fact I know Neville becomes a fucking badass by the end of the story  but I totally changed my mind  Neville is awesome  I love Neville  He s my favorite Gryffindor  alongside Hermione   hide spoiler   Minha terceira releitura  acredito eu  que nao foi literalmente uma leitura porque eu escutei em audiobook  Confesso que gostei muito  mas acho que isso se deve mais ao narrador  o incrivel Stephen Fry  Que ator maravilhoso  Ele conseguiu dar vida a cada personagem apenas com a voz  O mais perfeito de todos foi o Hagrid Nao tenho muito o que acrescentar enquanto apreciacao de Harry Potter  Mais uma vez foi otimo e eu gosto muito do primeiro porque e o mais nostalgico pra mim  Contudo  eu demorei muito tempo pra escutar o livro todo  Muito mesmo  Aproximadamente tres meses    Eu gostei bastante da experiencia em si de escutar  mas tive dois grandes problemas  1  nao da pra se distrair porque se nao perde se um monte de coisas  Quando voce le geralmente se dedica aquilo  escutando  as chances de prestar atencao em outra coisas  ate dentro da propria cabeca  sao grandes o que e ruim  e 2  dediquei pouco tempo por semana ao livro entao demorei muito pra escutar  Talvez eu devesse ter aumentado a velocidade da narracao  mas  de qualquer forma  nao colocaria como prioridade escutar em momentos que poderia estar lendo um livro fisico Ou seja  ler audiobooks pra mim serve mais quando volto pra casa a pe    5 Amazing  Brilliant  StarsBrings back memories of my childhood  I can remember being 12 years old and visiting my grandma s house  In her living room she had the first three hardcover books sitting on the piano bench  At the time I had no clue about the series  or what was to come  At that time it was strictly the Scholastic Black History novels  The Babysitter s Club and Goosebumps  Those were my reading books  I remember grabbing the first book and sitting on the couch  the next thing I know it s dinner time and I m halfway done  I was shocked that I had read that much  I absolutely love this series  If I had to describe it in one words it ll be Friendships This series told me how to have friends  and keep them  It taught me what undying love looks like  It taught me loyalty  happiness  and courage  It brings tears to my eyes writing this review because I hadn t read the series since 2005 when I was 17 and the last book was released  Sure I ve seen the movies a billion times  I know almost all the dialogue  and history  It s nothing like reading the magic from the beginning  Harry Potter is one of my favorite characters every  I love the cast of this series  even that dreadful toad Malfoy  I love Harry s courage to be himself in a world where he knew nothing about  I love Ron s undying loyalty  I love Hermione s quick wit  and her smarts  I ll continue reading the series as if I never have  So  turns out my parents let me live under a rock for 17 and a half years  I ve never read any of the Harry Potter books growing up nor did I see the movies around the time they came out  basically because my parents hate movies books containing fantasy science fiction genres like that  and hey  if your parents hate it  that must mean you ll hate it too  5 year old me logic  And then  people around me  all big fans of the Harry Potter stuff  found out I did not grow up following the story of The Boy Who Lived   HOW DARE YOU    YOU MISSED YOUR ENTIRE CHILDHOOD    DID YOU EVEN READ ANYTHING AT THAT AGE    so a few months ago  I decided to give the movies a try I absolutely loved every bit of it I watched the movies until the Half Blood Prince  and then I stopped  because now I really  really wanted to read the books And so I did  starting at the very beginning  of course Reading this book is an adventure  From the first line you re immediately pulled into the story full of magic and it s very hard to take a break from reading  I basically took this book with me wherever I went to continue reading  and now that I ve finished it  I need more Really excited to continue reading this series to catch up on my  missed childhood   One of the most beautiful books i ve ever owned   This edition is absolutely stunning and i can t take my eyes from it Jim Kay was an excellent choice his drawings are amazing  He captures the story in just a few pictures but brings it to life like nothing else  They are funny like Dudley s baby pictures but also very touching like Harry leaning against the mirror Erised or scary like Snape  or for me some hairy big spiders  and the Owls are judt beautiful  It s a great addition to my bookshelf and i m going to treasure this version for ever        Si je prends toujours autant de plaisir a relire cette serie et ce premier tome  celui ou tout a commence  je crois pouvoir dire que je l ai presque redecouvert cette semaine  Les illustrations m ont vraiment obligee a prendre le temps de le lire  de savourer la plume magique de J K  Rowling a nouveau  C est a chaque fois le meme emerveillement de voir la maniere dont elle nous emporte  Les illustrations de Jim Kay accompagnent a la perfection cette magie enchanteresse  Je le reconnais  au tout debut  quand j ai entendu parler d une version illustree  je ne m attendais pas du tout a ce style de traits  je ne sais pas ce que j imaginais mais une chose est sure  ce n etait pas ca  Une part de moi etait plutot septique puis au fil des petites images qui etaient devoilees    oui  pourquoi pas       Puis j ai arrete de vraiment les regarder pour me laisser l entiere surprise  c est pour ca que je vous mets peu de photos dans l article et en petit format   Et finalement  c est vraiment splendide et colle parfaitement a l histoire  Il y a une version de Harry en fin de livre  je me suis arretee 5 minutes dessus en me disant    mais c est vraiment lui  c est mon Harry     On reconnait tous les personnages  tous les lieux et Jim Kay a su nous les rendre vivants  reels  peut etre pas comme on les imaginait apres lecture mais qui finalement correspondent parfaitement       L integralite de mon avis ici  http   lune et plume fr harry potter     I LOVED this story  It was beautifully written  it had fun characters and exciting situations  it had humor  it made me both laugh and cry  it    It was just wonderful     There are so many scenes that I love in this book  From  The Boy Who Lived  to  The Letters from No One  to  The Mirror of Erised  to  The Man with Two Faces  and pretty much all the other chapters  as well  there was always something to love One of my most favorite scenes is the one in Chapter Eight   The Potions Master   where Professor Snape says   view spoiler   I can teach you how to bottle fame  brew glory  even stopper death      hide spoiler    I heard this speech in Alan Rickman s voice and it gave me the chills     Other fun scenes included Harry s time in the reptile house during the trip to the zoo for Dudley s birthday  Harry s first trip to Diagon Alley  the Sorting Hat s song and sorting of Harry  learning that Hagrid  view spoiler  named his giant three headed dog Fluffy   hide spoiler   and the whole of the  Through the Trapdoor  chapter   and more  Of course  more  Like I said in the beginning of this review  this story was beautifully written  So every scene was wonderful   Through the Trapdoor  especially has much in it to love  First  we have the hilarious scene where Harry and Ron are  view spoiler  trapped in the Devil s Snare  Hermione knows what the plant likes    the dark and the damp    and when Harry tells her to  light a fire   she cries   but there s no wood   And Ron  I really love Ron  lol  bellows   HAVE YOU GONE MAD  ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT   Then once the boys are free and the three of them are past the Devil s Snare  Ron says       there s no wood   honestly    hide spoiler   lol   There s also the  view spoiler  chess match  in which Ron realizes that they can win if he sacrifices himself   I m sooo glad he wasn t too terribly hurt when the white queen took him out    hide spoiler   Then Hermione uses logic  and if we readers had been told which bottles were the largest and the smallest  I d have been able to figure out which was which  too     And  of course  there s Harry  Courageous and able to think in the midst of a crisis  what s not to like  I really love Harry      In fact  I really like all of the characters  even Malfoy and the rest  I mean  we re meant to dislike them  right  And I do dislike them  So that makes them fun to read about  I enjoyed every one of the moments in which Malfoy was surprised  scared  and or in trouble     In sum  I just really love this book  I could gush more  but I think I ve said enough  You get that I love this book  I m sure      Be still my muggle heart  I m still wrapped up in the magic of this book  I ve lost count of how many times I ve read Sorcerer s Stone but this new illustrated version is on a whole other level  Every detail of this book is absolutely beautiful and serves to elevate the story  The thick glossy pages remind me of a children s picture book  The illustrations are richly colored and most importantly  true to the story  As much as I adore the movies  you won t see Daniel  Emma or Rupert depicted in these pages  The characters and scenes are modeled after JKR s descriptions  If you are wondering if the illustrations are few and far between  nothing could be further from the truth  There is artwork nearly every couple of pages  many of which are full page or two page spreads  I was very impressed  The icing on the cake is the red ribbon book mark attached to the binding  I am ecstatic to collect the other 6 volumes as they come out  Though I wish I didn t have to wait a whole year for the next one  the publishing company has probably done me a favor  If I had them all at my disposal now  I would likely want to read nothing else  If you are a Harry Potter fan  this edition belongs in a prominent spot on your bookshelf  Harry Potter has lived 10 long uneventful years with his abusive uncle  aunt  and cousin  the Dursleys  He thinks he ll live his whole life as an outcast  until one day  a giant breaks down the door  and tells Harry he s a wizard  From that moment  his life changed  The giant man  Hagrid  told him that there was a wizarding world  and he was part of it  Harry learns that he is actually famous in the wizarding world  because he defeated the villain  the same villain who killed his parents  when he was still a young baby  Hagrid brings him to Hogwarts  the wizard school  and Harry makes friends  Hermione and Ron  learns magic  plays quidditch  and does loads of things he shouldn t have done I love the Harry Potter series so much  It s amazing  I love the characters  the magic  the adventures  just the concept of Hogwarts itself  Honestly  if JK Rowling just wrote a book about Hogwarts  before Harry came and had all his  adventures   I would ve read it  and probably would have enjoyed it  Hermione Granger  is my favourite character  I m not going to go into that much detail but  she s a genius  The brightest witch of her age   They haven t found a spell our Hermione can t do   She knows everything  Literally everything  Starting from the Hogwarts Express  she was my favourite character  She s smart  She s amazing at spells  charms  transfiguration  and even potions  Harry and Ron would have died like a thousand times if Hermione wasn t there to save them  The Devil s Snare  the potions  everything  She has logic  which most wizards and witches don t have  I think she s a little bit of a perfectionist  which is why and it incantations and potions are up to par  She needs to do amazing in exams  so she studies hard  Hermione Granger is an amazing role model  Emma Watson  the girl who played Hermione in the Harry Potter movies  once said   Girls are told you have to be the delicate princess  Hermione taught them that you can be the warrior   And it s true  That  is why Hermione is my favourite character Also  I don t know what JK Rowling was thinking  but where in Canada  where I live  the bishop is not next to the rook  There s a knight in between the two  But  in the book  when they were on their way to the stone  and playing chess  Ron said   Well  Harry you take the place of that bishop and Hermione you go next to him instead of the castle  I m not saying I m an amazing chess player  but I know how to play  and I know how to set up a board  When I set up the board  the Rook is at the edge  the knight is next to it  then the bishop is next to the knight  She could ve not meant right next to it  but it doesn t make sense  Also  it s not called a castle  It s a rook  Although this was written in Britain I think  so they could play different than I do  but I doubt it Anyways  Harry Potter is still one of my most favourite series   and I think Louella should finish reading the series  and anyone else who hasn t read it yet should really read it because it s amazing  I was flabbergasted when I received the book  which I ve purchased without much investigation  I appreciated the first illustrations revealed when the project was young  and was determined to have it But when I thought it d be a normal book  with quite a few illustrations  I discovered a full color album  large and thick  where the integral text is mixed with quantity of quality illustrations  big and small  paint  watercolors  black and white  sepia   Jim Kay is very talented  and I truly appreciated how his art and personality helps us escaping the movies  images  even if I like them  to be immersed in the story  a wonderful and fascinating story The book in itself is magnificent  especially at such a reasonable price  256 pages in deep and bright colors  the text is printed upon sepia pages with tiny illustrations all over the free spaces   in a thick and glossy paper Under the movable color cover  the book is covered in bright red canvas  with a red ribbon as a bookmark Having one s favorite book completely illustrated is a dream coming true  and we are very lucky to have access to such a beautiful version  which isn t a marketable object  even if it ll be in a way  of course  but a true work of art  4 8Nothing wrong with the writing  still so many years later I love this book  Though I noted the text had all the English spellings of words not a big deal or really that noteworthy The art was so pretty done in mostly inks and what looks like watercolor  There are a few images that stuck out more than others the ghosts portrait at the welcome feast and Diagon Alley being a few  The selection of what the artist Jim Kay chose to illustrate is what I was a little disappointed with  It seemed that he just pick and chose a few things to illustrate and popped them in wherever they made sense  The pictures didn t always match the text or really display what was going on that part of the book  The pictures and the text were sometimes disjointed from each other  though the pictures were never ugly or disappointing  Towards the end of the book I felt there were less pictures than there were in the beginning  like the artist lost steam or something  In the next book I would like to see more illustrations and a better selection of the subject of said illustrations  I did appreciate Jim K s interpretation of the characters though  it took me an embarrassingly long amount of time to read this  to be fair tho while I did start in August technically I read the bulk of it in September and just finished tonight  I think I found it hard to read consistently bc I knew the story so well  I ve read the first book the most out of all of them and seen the movie also soooo many times  I didn t feel compelled to constantly be reading and to know what happens next  although that doesn t change how much more I loved this book reading it years after I first read it     I appreciated so many things about the book I didn t appreciate before like the mirror of erised  and noticing what it and the inscription on it spells backwards if that wasn t already supposed to be obvious     or how touching it is when Harry learns about why his scar is powerful or so many little things  I paid more attention to things I didn t before and I also noticed things about the characters I didn t before  Ron reminds me of Seth Cohen from the oc where I loved him when I was younger and I still love him now but am able to recognize some of his flaws   Neville used to be an annoying pansy to me when I was younger but now I m able to relate to him and understand how hard it really is to stand up to your friends   anyways maybe I ll write a full post on this on my blog one day but I m glad I reread this    there s a few other books I want to read finish reading before I start the chamber of secrets but hopefully I ll start it soon      reread September 2015  I CAN T BELIEVE I WAITED SO LONG TO READ THIS SERIES  It s probably definitely one of the best series I ve ever read  it s so perfect  But I feel like a full blown review on how great this book is would be redundant  over said  and unnecessary  So I ll just do the highlights THE CHARACTERS IN THIS BOOK WERE CRAFTED SO WELL  I can t believe that I liked all of the characters  There s usually one or two characters hat I can t stand  but I loved all the characters   even Snape and Draco a bit  WAIT  OVERRIDE  I   and hopefully everyone else with a working mid   HATE THE DURSLEYS SO MUCH  GOD  I JUST WANNA MURDER THEM ALL  Like what are you doing trying to abuse the greatest hero your world has ever known  GET OUT   I guess the fact that they incited such a reaction in me must be an example of how well crafted they were   I ve been told that none of them perish in the books to come  so that s unfortunate  But otherwise  yeah  characters are 12 10 stars My favorite scene is   and will always be   the end scene where Dumbledore gives Gryffindor a bunch of points and they beat Slytherin  CLASSIC  I smile out loud every time  There were also a lot of laugh out loud scenes in this book   Stop moving   Hermione ordered them   I know what this is   it s Devil s Snare   Oh  I m so glad we know what it s called  that s a great help   snarled Ron  leaning back  trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck  Shut up  I m trying to remember how to kill it   said Hermione  Well  hurry up  I can t breathe   Harry gasped  wrestling with it as it curled around his chest  Devil s Snare  Devil s Snare       what did Professor Sprout say    it likes the dark and the damp     So light a fire   Harry choked  Yes   of course   but there s no wood   Hermione cried  wringing her hands  HAVE YOU GONE MAD   Ron bellowed   ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT    Oh  right   said Hermione  and she whipped out her wand  muttered something  and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames she had used on Snape at the plant  In a matter of seconds  the two boys felt it loosening its grip as it cringed away from the light and warmth  Wriggling and flailing  it unraveled itself from their bodies  and they were able to pull free  Lucky you pay attention in Herbology  Hermione   said Harry as he joined her by the wall  wiping sweat off his face  Yeah   said Ron   and lucky Harry doesn t lose his head in a crisis    there s no wood   honestly   Just in case you live under a rock  this book is unofficial required reading for everyone on Earth  Get your hands on one now  Do I need to write a review  I don t think so Everyone has read Harry Potter and if you re the one that hasn t yet  just do it  Right now  You won t regret it After reading the books when I was younger  it was time to reread and it also was the first time  I have read a Harry Potter book in English It s even better in the original language than in the German translation Hagrids accent  the spells  names  herbs  potions and even the sweets sound so much nicer and more wonderful  Rowling has put many details in her story and in her names  that you sometimes need to read a book a couple of times to notice things like this  HOGwarts  HOGsmeade and the HOG s head The only thing I wish was different  is  that the book shoud have been longer  It s just a short read and the story is so much bigger  but somehow Rowling managed to put it in  320 pages and leave us readers speechless  I m sad that I ll never be able to read Harry Potter like the first time  I ll never be able to wonder what Snape s up to  why he wants the Stone and what Fluffy s really guarding Nevertheless  it still fees like coming home after a long day  Hogwarts  I ve missed you and need not wait so long till I visit you again  Originally posted at  http   thebookplank blogspot com 2015   For many readers  Harry Potter doesn t need an introduction  But for those who don t know him  The Harry Potter series was first published back in 1997 through 2007  spanning seven volumes  I recently started to listen to the audiobooks and I was once again reminded just how awesome these book are  Even if you are an adult  Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone is the first installment in the series  In the beginning of the book you see how baby Harry is placed on the doormat of his aunt and uncles house  Aunt Petunia and uncle Vernon and his cousin Dudley  Of course there is something big to it as Hagrid comes with a flying motorcycle to Privett Drive  where the aunt and uncle of Harry live  Hagrid is a giant of a man and was set to retrieve Harry on order of Albus Dumbledore  Harry being a small baby that he is here  has already gone through a lot  His parent have been murdered by Lord Voldemort  when he turned on Harry he couldn t kill Harry and the result is that Harry bears a lightning patterned scar on his forehead  After the drop off of Harry  life skips a few years right until Harry is a wizarding age  In growing up  his cousin Dudley hasn t made it any easier on Harry  he is constantly bullied  But one day relief comes for Harry as posts comes for him from none other than Hogwarts  Now first Harry doesn t have a clue as to what Hogwarts is    He never knew that he was a wizard  The Dudley s have always kept him in the dark about what Harry s parents really were  they have gone through many a lengths but luckily for Harry  Hagrid once again saves him  And off is Harry to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry  With Harry having brought up in the normal world  the muddle world   he doesn t have any equipment what so ever and thus Hagrid takes him along to Diagon alley a place in London that has everything a wizards needs  Here Harry literally watches he eyes out as a completely new world opens up for him  But also the rumors start to make their way   is that really Harry Potter   Equipped with all the books he needs  a special wand and the owl he has called Hedwig  Harry sets off to Hogwarts  The only instruction he got was to depart from platform 9 and 3 4 well  there isn t a platform with that name to be found anywhere in the train station  Here he meets up with the Weasley family who help him to get on board  During the train ride to Hogwarts Harry makes his first real friends  Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger  And thus a truly new chapter for Harry begins  After getting only settled for a few minutes its time to get sorted  There are four major houses present at Hogwarts each named after one of it s founders  Rowena Ravenclaw  Helga Hufflepuff  Godric Gryffindor ans Salazar Slytherin  After hearing a lot of worse about Slytherin  Harry prays to himself to not get placed into Slytherin and again luck is on his side and his placed in Gryffindor together with his new found friends Ron and Hermione  Now it s time to start learning magic  Subjects that Harry and the other first years learn are Transfiguration by Professor McGonagall  Potions by Professor Snape  Charms by Professor Flitwick  Herbology by Professor Sprout and Defense Against the Dark Arts by Professor Quirrel  Harry couldn t have wished a better life  He has a great time at Hogwarts and gets along with most teacher accept Professor Snape who seems to dispise Harry with whatever he does  And Draco Malefoy a Slytherin boy who bullies Harry and his friends  Just as when Harry has finally settled down his past starts to catch up with him    Over the course of the year strange things have happened at Hogwarts  the Three Headed Dog Fluffly they ran into  as well as Professor Snape had a nasty encounter with it   the Dragon that was send to Hagrid and lets not forget the artifact that Hagrid retrieved on Dumbledore s orders from the Wizarding Bank Gringotts  Years ago Lily Potter managed to safe Harry from death by sacrificing her when Lord Voldemort cast the death curse on Harry and was heavily weakened  But it seems that he is on the move again    There will be many a fruitful year for Harry to come  Where this book excels in for me is the way that J K  Rowling shows the various characters  Take Harry Potter himself for example  never having known that there was a magical world is thrown in  head first  in it all  Everything is new for him and he has a lot to learn  At home he was always bullied and this has given him the feeling that he is actually worthless  which comes to show more than once  He didn t have any friends  but now with Ron and Hermione on his side the does gain that all important confidence once more  He accepts who he is and how other are  take the relation with one of his housemates Neville Longbottom who well isn t smart  but Harry supports him no matter and this is I think something that more people should see  Treat everyone how you want to be treated The same goes for the Weasley s the family that showed Harry how to get onto the Hogwarts express  They don t have a lot to spare and Ron has everything second or even third hand  Again here Harry doesn t look down upon them but actually look up to them because what they have is an amazing family and friendship and that is worth more than money can buy  Well of course this doesn t count for Draco Malefoy of course he is just a jerk  The characterization of Draco is also spot on  I don t think you could paint a more annoying  slimy creature then that  More than once I was cheering for him to just get a punch in the face  When it comes down to world building I have to give J K  Rowling a lot of praise for what she has achieved in the small volume that is Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone  From the halls of Hogwarts with the food appearing on the tables  the sorting hat scene  the quidditch patch  the ghosts  the painting that move and a lot more  It is all so dynamic and as a tonne of atmosphere to the book  I can safely say that this is one of my top worlds that I wish were real  After reading this Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone I don t know who doesn t want to be a wizard  Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone introduces the reading a very richly imagined world with magical flying around your ears  The muggles  the non magic users  will look their eyes out when they find about what else is possible  In the short but very strong prologue J K  Rowling gave a ton of information about Harry s past with Lord Voldemort but along this adventures in this book a lot already became clear on why he is so important  The ending of the book does indicate already that Lord Voldemort hasn t died and that certain precautions might be required to be taken    With having read the first book once again  I have found my love for this series back again  There are some many feel good moments in this book and I don t really care if they are a bit of cliches  it does my heart well to see Harry and his friends Ron and Hermione grow up once again   That moment when you regret not reading a book despite everyone s advices to do so THIS BOOK WAS AMAZING  I think that is that kind of book that never dies and it s not only for kids  but for everybody  I felt like discovering myself  like entering a new amazing world and all thanks to Harry Potter  Harry is such an amazing character that evolves so beautifully and it s that child inside everyone  I think that is what makes him so special  I loved Hermione  Ron  the teachers  Hogwarts  This book just gave me life and took me out of a great reading slump I recommend it to absolutely everyone  it is an amazing book that deserves to be read The ending got me like this  literally By the way  isn t Professor Dumbledore the most amazing person in the world  I just love him   I had forgotten how good these books are  so I am enjoying re reading them for the third time immensely  The writing at the beginning of this book is a bit sporadic in quality  but once you get a few chapters in  it settles down to what I have come to expect from Rowling  I am re reading them because I just got back from my first trip to Scotland where the guide pointed out a building in Edinburgh on which Hogwarts was based and I stayed at the Balmoral in the room next door to the JK Rowling suite  where she evidently wrote the last of the Harry Potter books over the course of a year  So on to the next in the series  and when I m finished I ll see all the movies again  Harry Potter is a curious mixture of  Wow  and frustration  something I had forgotten  I think I had originally hoped he would be a superhero kind of kid  but the more often I read the books  the happier I am that Harry doesn t always know what to do and frequently gloms onto the right thing almost by accident  It makes him a more sympathetic character   Amazing  Daisey LessenberryHarry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone by J K  RowlingGenre  FantasySummaryHarry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone is the first book in the Harry Potter series written by J K  Rowling  The series is about a boy  Harry Potter  who lives with his Aunt Petunia  Uncle Vernon  and cousin Dudley  He didn t remember his parents whom had  according to his aunt and uncle  died in a car crash where Harry got an odd lightning shaped scar on his forehead  Harry was aware that he was odd  his aunt and uncle emphasized on daily  He would have never thought he was a wizard but sure enough  he was  It all started the day the letter came  Harry came down in the morning for breakfast and went out to check the mail  He had gotten a letter  which Vernon had snatched out of his hand as soon as he had mentioned it  It was a letter from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry  This was to be Harry s new school  Since the letter was never read by Harry more letters came  and more  and more  and more  Until  the whole family had to flee  and even then the letters still came  Until  so many letters arrived that they went to an abandoned house on an island  That s when Hagrid came  In the middle of the night a big and burly man in a large moleskin coat came to the small shack like house on the top of the hill in the middle of the sea  He knew Harry very well and for a long time  and knew Harry s parents very well  they were a couple of the most powerful wizards in the world  When Hagrid arrived all of the family was very shocked Uncle Vernon  Aunt Petunia  and Dudley were very angry  but Hagrid calmed them down very quickly by giving Dudley a pig tail  which fit him very well  Harry had no idea who or why Hagrid was here  due to him not reading the letter  which made Hagrid very angry  When all was told Harry knew that he was a wizard and that his parents were wizards  When Hagrid mentioned his scar that s when Harry got mad  His parents hadn t died in a car crash nor did he get his scar the same place  Harry had gotten his scar from surviving the most powerful dark wizard in the world  Voldemort s  attack which left his parents dead  They went to the bank and got part of a small fortune that his parents left him for when he got older and they died  So  once the family stories got done being told Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Way which is where you shop for Wizarding school supplies  Harry got his wand  robes  parchment  quills  and books  Harry had to spend one more month with the Dursley s  Then he went to the train station to get on station 9 3 4 but there wasn t one  There was 9 and then 10 and a barrier in between  Then he happened to run into the Weasley s  They pointed him the right way  through the barrier  Mrs  Weasley explained that wizards could go through the barrier to station 9 3 4  So  Harry did  he walked through the barrier to station 9 3 4  When he got on the train he sat with Ron and they begin to talk about Quidditch and the wizarding world  Then they meet Hermione who is overachieving and talks a lot and Draco Malfoy  whom Harry met at the robe store  Then when the get to Hogsmeade they get transported onto a boat with Hagrid where they sail across the lake that has a huge squid and many killer fish in it  Once they get into the castle they get sorted where Harry  Ron  and Hermione get put into Gryffindor  Then they eat and go back to their rooms  During this time Harry gets stared at or his scar gets stared at  During his first days at Hogwarts he goes to tea with Hagrid where he learns Hagrid is not a very good cook  Also  that Professor Snape does not like him  Then they get flying lessons and Harry is a natural  So  Professor McGonagall bends the rules that first years cannot be on any Quidditch team and puts Harry on the team as Seeker  Then when Harry  Hermione  and Ron are heading to class they accidentally stumble upon a door where when they open it there is a large dog guarding a trapdoor  Once they go to Christmas dinner there is a troll loose in the castle and Harry and Ron find a way to knock it out  Then the next day when Harry was playing Quidditch his broom started moving out of control and he almost fell off  Hermione saw Snape muttering words while staring at Harry  So  she went to Snape and set his robe on fire  Then  Harry plummets to ground and by chance catches the snitch  Harry tells Hagrid that Snape got injured by the three headed dog  Fluffy  and Hagrid accidentally reveals that Fluffy is guarding the secret only known to by Albus Dumbledore and Nicholas Flamel   On Christmas Eve Harry gets in trouble for looking in the restricted section of the library  When Harry and Ron wake up they find presents  Harry got a box of candy and an invisibility cloak accompanied by an anonymous note saying that it one was his father s  That night Harry went to the library s restricted section but one of the books starts screaming when he opened it so he left  On his way he passes Filch and hides in an abandoned classroom and sees a mirror  When he looks into a mirror he sees his whole family including his mom and dad  Then the next night he brings Ron to that same room but Ron does not see his family he sees himself winning the Quidditch world cup  On the third night Harry goes back and finds Dumbledore and Dumbledore explains that it portrays your deepest wants  One day at Quidditch practice after Christmas break Neville hops by  Malfoy had cast a spell to lock his legs together  Harry explains that Neville needs to stand up to Malfoy  So  Neville leaves but not before giving him a card for his collection  Then  Harry realizes where he has heard the name Nicholas Flamel  on the back of Dumbledore s famous wizard card  Nicholas Flamel was the only person to ever make a sorcerer s stone  The sorcerer s stone can transform any metal into gold and produces an elixir of everlasting life  In Harry s next Quidditch match he catches the snitch within the first five minutes  After game he sees Snape running into the forest and follows him  When he is in ear reach of Snape he hears Snape talking to Professor Quirrell and they are talking about the Sorcerer s Stone  When Hagrid comes up to the castle one day close to finals they bombard him with questions about the Sorcerer s Stone and he tells them to visit him later  Later they visit him and he shows them a dragon egg he won in a poker game  Later they word that the egg is hatching so they rush over  Once the egg has hatched they tell Hagrid he must get rid of it  So  they write to Charlie  Ron s older brother  and he agrees to help them  So  later that night they meet with his friends so they can take the dragon  but Malfoy gets out there and sees them  So  they get punished by 150 points being taken from Gryffindor  Then  later in the week he hears a suspicious conversation between Snape and Quirrell  That night for detention they would be going into the forbidden forest to see what has killing unicorns  Malfoy had been playing tricks on Neville so Hagrid takes Neville and Harry goes with Malfoy  They stumble upon a cloaked figure drinking a recently killed unicorn  Then a centaur rescues Harry and takes him back to Hagrid  Harry learns the cloaked figure was Voldemort and that he was drinking unicorn blood to sustain his health  Then  they have finals  One night Harry finds that while playing poker one night he accidentally reveals to Voldemort that anyone can get past Fluffy by playing music to him  So  Harry  Ron  and Hermione run to find Dumbledore and they find that he has been rushed to London  Harry convinces them that they need to get the stone  So  they rush to Fluffy but when they get there they notice a harp by his feet  so Harry plays a flute and gets past Fluffy  Then when they go down through the trapdoor they land on a plant that wraps around Harry and Ron  So  Hermione uses her wand and shoots fire out of it and gets them loose  Then they end up in a room with a locked door and a lot of birds which are really keys  Harry uses his Quidditch skills to catch the right one  Once they unlock the door they end up in a giant chess game where they have to play as pieces  Ron successfully leads them through  but Ron must be caught and severely beaten  Then Hermione and Harry come upon some potions and a puzzle  Hermione figures out the puzzle  goes back and Harry moves forward  Once Harry gets to the next room  he finds Quirrell  with Voldemort s voice and mind  Voldemort has the mirror and makes Harry look in it and tell him what he sees  Harry lies and says he sees himself winning the Quidditch world cup  Voldemort can tell and commands Quirrell to unwrap his turban  When he does Harry realizes that Voldemort is what Quirrell has been hiding  So  Voldemort tries to get Harry to give him the stone which he knows is in his pocket  and join him on the dark side  Harry refuses so Voldemort tells Quirrell to seize Harry  So  Quirrell tries but every time he touches Harry he burns  Harry feels himself falling with Quirrell  If you want to know the ending you should read the book  Its called Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone by J  K  Rowling  I personally love this book  It is the first in the interesting fantasy book series  I think you should read  you ll definitely get hooked  When I was in Florida with my Aunt is when I started reading and I just couldn t stop  So  my aunt sent me home with 4  5  and 6  I was in Florida for a little over 2 weeks  and it only took me 3 days to get hooked  This is now my favorite series  I absolutely love this book  I would recommend it to everyone  Read this review along with others on my blog by following this link  https   bibliomad wordpress com Set in a wizarding world of magic  Harry Potter lives in the world the majority of children born in the late 1900s and onwards have always dreamt of  It is this world   in which Hogwarts exists   that crafted the imagination of children all over the world  Well  aside from mine   That s right  people   I finally read Harry Potter  And I now finally understand what all the fuss is about  I saw that I could access this book for free through Amazon s Kindle Lending Library  and so seized the opportunity and got reading  And  frankly  I can only call myself a fool for waiting this long Part of the fantasy genre  Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone focusses on the world of witchcraft and wizardry  in which Harry Potter resides  Although mainly focussing on the witches and wizards  this book does also contain some other fantasy elements  like dragons  unicorns  and centaurs  I really enjoyed the inclusion of these things  and also found it funny how they were only briefly mentioned  as if seeing these creatures were the norm  However  whilst it  granted  adds to the building and development of the world  it does make you question how these creatures have never been seen by the  muggles   or ordinary people   yet this problem is quickly answered with magic magic magic  It s truly wonderful the world that Rowling has managed to create in only 300 pages  and very much enjoyable Primarily  I assumed this novel was going to be written in a lesser fashion  due to it being aimed at younger readers  However  I was proved wrong  The quality of this novel is on par with some adult novels I ve read  along with many young adult books I ve read  also  The language isn t dumbed down for children  nor is any of the action compromised for children  either  Thus  I enjoyed this book much more than I expected to  for it contained a lot more action and suspense than I d anticipated  I would say this book is suitable for a vast selection of ages because of this  Of course  as it s aimed at children  it s suitable for them  however I   a teenage girl   along with many of my age category are still enjoying this series  Furthermore  I have been told that many adults enjoy this book  also  exemplifying how universal it is The majority of this book is told from Harry s perspective  but in a third person narrative  which allows a lot of the story to be told through Harry s eyes  without having any bias taint it  I d say this particular grammatical  person  is my favourite  and so I personally was very happily surprised by this  but I can t speak for other people  Generally  I find it quite tedious when books insist on focussing on the protagonist s thoughts as opposed to the action  which is something one comes across quite frequently in first person narrative  Thus  as aforementioned  I very much enjoyed and appreciated the narrative for this book Now  whilst I was originally worried of the effect the target audience would have on this story  I instead discovered that there come some bonuses with said target audience being younger than yourself  For example  I found this novel very easy to follow  despite it being quite a fast pace  Having said this  it s not as if the plot is compromised for this purpose  quite frankly  I d argue the opposite  It s quite difficult to successfully deliver a gripping storyline without it becoming unnecessarily confusing  yet Rowling succeeds Furthermore  all of the characters in this book have a true purpose  and are equally individual  Thankfully  there are no characters that are unnecessarily similar  besides  perhaps  Malfoy s minions  but that is with reason  Harry  Ron and Hermione  each to their own  bring different qualities to the friendship group  as does Neville when he is sporadically involved  Thus  there is a character for everyone to relate to  just as there is development of each of said characters  Hermione  for example  begins the book with quite a haughty and patronizing demeanour  yet concludes the book having learnt from Harry and Ron that it s OK to not be right all the time  and to relax Surprisingly  this book also made me laugh quite a lot  Some of Harry s wit is very amusing  as are some other sections of humour included by Rowling  I didn t expect there to be such a sarcastic side to Harry  for I feel this is eradicated in Harry s screen character  and very much enjoyed it  for I am a rather sarcastic person as well  Likewise  I didn t expect this series to be so addictive  however what should I have expected when considering the PotterHead fandom  On multiple occasions  I discovered I had been so immersed in the book that I d been reading for hours  when in reality it only felt like minutes Overall  I awarded this book 5 5 stars  for it amused  entertained and pleasantly surprised me with many of the attributes mentioned above   Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts  Before we begin our banquet  I would like to say a few words  And here they are  Nitwit  Blubber  Oddment  Tweak  Harry Potter means so much to so many people  It is beyond huge  a property that exceeded the bounds of what anyone could have imagined  Due to its size and position in the zeitgiest  one has to wonder if the origin is a victim of nostalgia  Is it really as special as it is made out to be  Does it still hold up  The answer is an easy yes  As an adult reader  I believe I was able to better appreciate what Rowling does with this first book  The last time I read this book  I was in middle school  I remember loving it  but I believe that subsequent exposure to the films and Harry Potter pop culture explosion diluted the actual experience of reading the first novel  I forgot so much of what Rowling managed to include in this book  and how so much better it is than the film versions almost everyone knows  Rowling manages to combine the wizard lore of Europe with her own twist and build an incredibly detailed world where magic and the mundane are able to coexist  But all that exposition doesn t feel forced  and she manages to also include a pretty suspenseful mystery tale woven in as well  Simultaneously  she sets the pieces in motion for one of the great villains of all time  Voldemort  Can we also talk about how awesome Rowling s names are    Perhaps the most impressive aspect of the book is how she manages to do all of this within a relatively slim volume  She does so much with so little  It s remarkable when we get the grand reveal of Hogwarts castle  it is described as a  vast castle with many turrets and towers   Given that everyone knows their own version of Hogwarts castle in their head  it s surprising to see such a simple description  Instead  Rowling integrates the details with the story  constructing the castle over time  a place where people in portraits visit each other and ghosts roam the halls as if it s the most normal thing in the world  A sense of magic and whimsy  with a hint of darkness  fills every page in a way I ve only ever seen from Roald Dahl And let s talk about Dumbledore  one of the greatest literary characters that continues to go unrecognized and unknown  I say this because the film versions  Richard Harris and Michael Gambon  are written and directed as austere  stiff  and occasionally brash  I ve been away from the books so long  and I suspect this of many others  that my view of Dumbledore has been tarnished by these impostors  The Dumbledore in this book is weird  charming  unpredictable  relatable  hilarious and mysterious  He s the Dumbledore who will offer his colleagues lemon drops  shout random words before dinner  sit on the floor next to Harry at the Mirror of Erised and talk of wishing for woolen socks  He s so real and wonderful that I can t for the life of me figure out how the filmmakers got him so wrong  It s rediscovering this forgotten character  the anchor of the entire series  that has made my rereading such a special experience Does Harry Potter still hold up  It s better than that  Rereading makes me realize that Rowling discovered a magic that is one of a kind  There simply won t ever be anything like Harry Potter ever again   Duh   Okay  I started writing an in depth review about this but realized how much people already know how good this is  so    I refrained from doing so  Of course  you can spare yourself all the lectures  I know it s a shame I haven t started this sooner  I never grew up with the novels like I did the film s    YES I WATCHED THE FILMS FIRST BUT MY MEMORY IS SOOO BAD WHICH IS BITTERSWEET BUT SWEET IN THIS CASE SO I CAN KINDA START OFF WITH A CLEAN SLATE   unfortunate  but honestly I wish I read this before I read the Percy Jackson series which I did grow up with  This is so much better  But I can t deny that the two series are definitely my favourites  And of course  I usually rate the first of a series 5 stars because of its initial intriguing factor  and rate the rest 4 but we ll just see how the rest of the series will go  If I happened to favour a later book in the series  I might swap the ratings because I usually like keeping 1 favourite out of the series  That s just the rule for me   The story of an orphaned boy raised by relatives who hate every thing about him  and who turns out to be one of the world s most powerful wizards   is one of the greatest publishing success stories the world has ever seen  Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone is book one of seven  and not only has the series gone on to sell hundreds of millions of copies around the world   but more significantly  countless of millions of lives have been changed  and  dare i say it  saved  and redirected to the powers of reading and thereby strengthening of our individual imaginations  These facts alone are enough to justify giving the entire seven book series full marks  But I won t get ahead of myself  This story can be reviewed on several levels  I wont claim to be something I am not  so my review will focus primarily on the story telling side of this phenomenon  At book s commencement  the reader is introduced to those revolting people referred to by Ms Rowling as  The Dursleys   Poor Harry is kept  under the stairs  for years in a vain  and stupid  bid by Dursley Snr to control the  natural  growth of magic in the potential Boy Wonder  Of course  the efforts of domination and control by this stupid man amount to pushing water uphill and it is not long before  strange  things start to happen to people around Harry   The alert reader will see that these are all performed by Harry without him being aware of doing it   which thereby suggests his subconscious is performing the magic  Which leads to countless further questions     As Harry s Eleventh Birthday approaches  letters from Hogwarts School of Witch Craft and Wizardry begin to arrive addressed to Harry s attention  but of course these are intercepted by the Dursleys in yet more vain attempts to control events and powers that are way beyond them  And this is where we meet the story s first truly adorable character  Hagrid the groundskeeper of Hogwarts appears in the scene  right as the clock strikes midnight  and just as Harry turns eleven  In one clean sweep  we meet this wonderful man  the Durselys are  finally  put back in their place  and Harry s metaphorical train ride to destiny finally begins it s unforgettable journey from the land of Muggles to a rather fantastic and make believe University for talented youngsters  Chapter five is where the fun and excitement starts to build  We are given a glimpse of an alternative London which possesses a giant underground bank  Gringott s  which is staffed and guarded by goblins  a shop which sells nothing but wands  they choose their owner  you know   text books and of course  the mandatory uniform for witches and wizards in waiting  There is hardly a chapter that goes by that fails to scream   GENIUS LIVES HERE    Of course Hogwarts itself is brilliant  the place is just about infinite in an infinite number of ways  but even getting there is only possible for those with the ability to perform the unmentionable  It comes down to faith  you see  and if you don t have that at the start  you might as well give up and go home right away  I wont reveal the magic here as the fun is in the reading  Chapter five gave the reader the book s first true glimpse of childhood evil   school yard bullying   but this is a fleeting glimpse only  and may well be soon forgotten  We meet the legendary Hermoine Grainger and Ronald Weasley in chapter six  and our worlds  and lives  will never be the same again  And so the story goes on  Fun and laughter  tears and terror are yours for the taking  We make friends  we make enemies  we learn to fly and we learn what the heck a NIMBUS 3000 is  I want one     And most importantly  we learn all about the wonder that is Quidditch  The Harry Potter books rule  HPATPS really is incredible  The writing may not win any awards in its own right  it would have by now  if it was going to  but the important thing to take away from these books is the fun and excitement you come across  and the magic  there s that word again  of each person s individual interpretation of the words on the page  Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry really does exist  you know  You just gotta know where to find it  and how to get there  It all comes down to having faith  And I have plenty   Bueno  este libro para mi tiene 5 estrellas por el recuerdo y lo que representa dentro de mi infancia Decidi releer toda la saga este verano porque la ultima vez que lo hice tenia diecisiete anos  y ahora  varios anos despues  me apetecia volver a este mundo y recordar como era  porque ya me empiezo a olvidar de los detalles  Harry Potter fue la saga que me inicio en el mundo de la lectura  que me ayudo a evadirme en mi adolescencia y en definitiva  con la que creci  Tenia muy buen recuerdo de estos libros y ahora que he terminado mi carrera queria volver a ella con lo que la formacion me ha aportado  con todo lo nuevo que se sobre literatura y con la nueva mirada que tengo despues de todas las lecturas que he obtenido a lo largo de estos anos Desde luego  Harry Potter y la piedra filosofal me parece el libro mas dirigido a los ninos de los siete que componen la saga  Es muy directo  Harry no reflexiona mucho sobre las cosas  se deja llevar  consigue creer en la magia con facilidad    no es a lo que ahora estoy acostumbrada  Normalmente me gustan los libros que tambien dedican tiempo a la reflexion entre escena de accion y escena de accion  Aqui todo pasa muy seguido  muy rapido  todo se centra en esas aventuras que vive y no hay tanta atencion a detalles que me gustaria conocer  como son las clases  por ejemplo  como es el dia a dia en Hogwarts    no se  alguna escena mas pausada y cotidiana para conseguir un efecto mas redondo y dar la sensacion de paso del tiempo  En este primer libro cuesta creer que un curso escolar termine tan pronto  No recuerdo ahora mismo si obtendre esto de lo que hablo en los siguientes libros  por el momento  La piedra filosofal me gusta por lo que me recuerda  pero sino  lo veria infantil y dentro de ese genero  creo que es una muy buena historia Lo que mas me entristece es que ya nunca podre leer este libro como esa primera vez  que lo lei todo en un dia  aun sin ser yo una nina lectora llena de emocion y expectativas  Es un recuerdo de que la infancia no vuelve  pero creo que Harry Potter siempre seran unos libros que despierten mi nostalgia  5 STARS  This book  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone was recommended to me by my cousin  Hemangi and I thank her  for if she hadn t forced me  I might ve not been able to know such a good book and read it  I mean I can t believe it myself that their was a time when I used to think that this was a book for babies and a very bad one that too  I mean  see me now  I totally love it  Harry Potter is living with his aunt  uncle and cousin  They all treat him very badly and he has to live in a cupboard under the stairs  One day  a mysterious letter arrives and he is whisked into the world of magic  coming to know that he himself is a wizard and so where his parents  He meets a half giant man  Hagrid and goes to Diagon Alley to buy his book supplies  robes etc  He soon finds himself at Hogwarts  school of witchcraft and wizardry learning all about this secret  magical world  He finds himself between yet another mystery and has to face many difficulties as he finds  along his friends  Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger  about the very unique and special Sorcerer s Stone By writing Harry Potter and creating this world  J K  Rowling has become immortal through these pages of work that will never stop being passed on  and in the hearts of the people  who see these movies  or more specially in the heart of those people who read these  She has created a world from just one word  Magic and given it a new meaning  a very special one that too  she has created a world so detailed  genuine and most importantly one that feels real  one that you want to be a part of Thanks for reading my review  and thanks J K R  for creating this world by your words  Second read 5 29 15 I m going to try to do reviews that pertain only to the current book   PThis is only my second time reading Harry Potter and The Sorcerer s Stone  I read it for the first time back in 2006  Throughout school I read a ton  Afterwards it became just a book here and there  When I read this one  I had to binge read the series  It was the first time in a long time that I had felt that need and desire to fully immerse myself in a story  in another world  Reading it again  even though I know the outcome  I m still excited and anxious to continue to the next book Harry Potter is one of my favorite characters  His life up to this point has been terrible  Think about it  the kid has never experienced love before  There are so many different ways his life could have gone  He could have been bitter and turned out so differently  But given the circumstances he s a really good kid  He s generous and kind  and I think that s really the first thing that drew me to his character   One of the first scenes with Ron when he buys all the treats and willingly shares  Absolutely love that scene  Ron annoyed me in the beginning  I ll be honest  He was like that classic little brother  As time went on though  he really grew on me  You could tell that he felt overshadowed by his older brothers and I sympathized with him on that  His friendship with Harry I feel was something they both needed  They stuck up for each other almost immediately Hermione took time to love  Let s face it  she was a bit of a goody goody  She proved herself throughout the book though  When her friends needed her  she stepped up and was there regardless of the consequences The dynamic between the core three characters are what ultimately make the book in my opinion  That friendship and dedication to one another is one of the main aspects I enjoyed  I ll use the invisibility cloak   said Harry   It s just lucky I got it back   But will it cover all three of us   said Ron  All  all three of us   Oh  come off it  you don t think we d let you go alone  The first time I read this  view spoiler  I never suspected Quirrell was helping Voldemort  not even once  I was convinced it was Snape  There were so many things pointing to Snape  I was totally caught off guard    hide spoiler  Speaking of Snape  I love the buildup for his character  I love getting the little tidbit at the end that he and  view spoiler  Harry s father were at odds and Harry s father saved him   hide spoiler   It gives me something to look forward to reading about later in the series  What happened to make him so rigid and mean  You can tell just from this first book that there s so much about him left to discover  view spoiler  Of course with that ending we know to expect more from Voldemort  Where did he go  Who all is helping him  After learning of Quirrell s betrayal  anyone could be viewed as a possible accomplice   hide spoiler  The only complaint I have about this book is the lack of Dumbledore  He s not that present in the book  and by the end we re getting all these little nuggets of wisdom from him   I love those   He seems like he has so much insight to offer and I look forward to more of that in future books  After all  to the well organized mind  death is but the next great adventure   Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself   The truth   Dumbledore sighed   It is a beautiful and terrible thing  and should therefore be treated with great caution  Memorable scene  When Harry sees his parents in the Mirror of Erised      I remember during the first read that I cried at this part  It was the full realization that Harry was completely alone  He could want anything in the world  and he wanted his family  I m excited to continue the series   3    to have been loved so deeply  even though the person who loved us is gone  will give us some protection forever  First read 2006 Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone by J  K  Rowling is a fun read  This is the first book of a long series that I finally decided to read because so many people liked it  This is about a boy named Harry Potter who is a wizard  but didn t realize it  When both his parents died  he went to live with his aunt and uncle who were strictly ordinary humans  Harry gets accepted into Hogwarts when he is 10 years old  a private school for wizardry and witchcraft  This is why I put off reading this series for so long  but decided to read it for myself before condemning it  This is an enjoyable read dealing with bullying  adventure  friendship and courage with a surprise ending  I still don t think I would want my child reading it because it does glamorize the world of witchcraft  As a Christian  to be honest  I struggle with whether I should be reading this series  There is no doubt that it is entertaining and amusing  I actually laughed out loud at parts and like the funny names of the characters  When the professor became a cat at the beginning of the story  I was hooked  The school supply list cracked me up and I especially enjoyed the part when Harry was learning to fly on the broomstick  I thought the invisible cloak would be a cool thing to have and liked the idea of the owls as mail carriers  The sorting ceremony with the talking hat reminded me of the old cartoon  Tom Terrific  and the part in Divergent where the teens choose what faction they want  For me  the characters and all the amusing things is what kept me reading more so than the plot   Karen s review This is a beautiful book  This novel is about a young boy named Harry Potter  One day  much to his surprise  he finds out that he is a wizard and goes to a special school called Hogwarts for wizards  I really loved the interaction between Harry and his classmates and teachers at Hogwarts  There is always something interesting going on in this book that makes you want to keep reading  I know I am late to these books  but better late than never  Loved the ending   Gerard s review  I don t feel like I have to explain what the plot of this book is  If you haven t read Harry Potter  you ve probably watched the movies or at least know what it s about  If you haven t  you must live under a rock I read this whole series when I was in like 3rd grade  And I absolutely loved them  I forget just about everything except for the first book because I ve seen the movie about 100 times So I decided to reread the Harry Potter series just because they re amazing  I mean  they ve stayed popular through the years and have one of the biggest fandoms I ve seen I think the thing that makes Harry Potter such a loved story is that it was kind of ground breaking  It s like The Beatles  They were as popular as they were and continue to be because they were ground breakers  Although there were probably stories that involved magic and that kind of stuff before Harry Potter  J K  Rowling created a world that continues on through 7 books  which really appeals to a reader if they re in love with the world and characters  Which  who wouldn t be  All of the characters are so complex and amazing and even if I hadn t seen the movies  I know that is exactly how I would have pictured the characters  Especially Dumbledore and Hagrid It s a lovely thing to pick up a book and be transported to a world where you can vividly picture everything that is going on around the character  It s a lovely thing to read a book series that sticks with you forever and makes you just want to read the whole thing over again  even if it is around a total of 4000 pages  Harry Potter woont al sinds kleinsaf bij zijn oom en tante  de Duffelingen  Een doodnormale familie  nietsvermoedend dat hij zelf een tovenaar is en de bekendste jongen over de hele tovenaarswereld  Wanneer hij op een dag een brief krijgt  Op de een of andere manier wordt de brief steeds opnieuw bezorgt en steeds door zijn oom Herman verscheurd  Net op zijn elfde verjaardag wordt hij door Hagrid  sleutelbewaarder en terreinknecht van Zweinstein  gered en verteld hij dat Harry een tovenaar is  hoe hij aan het litteken op zijn voorhoofd komt en waarom hij zo bekend is  Hij neemt Harry mee naar het station om daar de trein te nemen naar Zweinsteins hoge school voor hekserij en hocus pocus Eenmaal op Zweinstein lijkt niet iedereen goed te zijn en samen met zijn vrienden  Ron en Hermelien  gaat hij een avontuur tegemoet dat niemand ooit had kunnen verwachten Het boek verteld zoveel meer dan de films  Het is fijn om de boeken te lezen van Harry Potter  je kan je helemaal inleven in het verhaal  zelfs voor mensen die de films nog niet gezien hebben  Het verhaal is spannend en het wekt nieuwsgierigheid op  Je wil meer te weten komen  Op zich lijkt het veel om te lezen  maar eenmaal je begonnen bent gaat het zeer vlot  Het zijn fantastische boeken  het wekt je fantasie helemaal op en laat een heel andere wereld zien  Het is ongelooflijk en interessant hoe J K  Rowling haar fantasie de vrije loop heeft laten gaan  Werkelijk vind ik fantasieboeken ook de mooiste ik kan me helemaal in het verhaal inwerken   I decided to read this book because I really enjoyed all the movies and I decided to go by the saying that the books are better than the movies  My favorite character in this book was Hermione Granger because she was smart but a little bit stuck up which stopped her from making friends  She was also different because both her parents were humans  muggles  which made her different from the other wizards  I think she was a good role model because even though she got teased she pushed all of that out of the way and topped her year and all her classes  My favorite quote from this book is  Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself   This is said by Hermione when she is talking to Draco Malfoy and his farther  She say this because Draco s farther is trying to intimidate Hermione  I like this quote because I like the meaning behind it because giving something a label can change the way people feel about one thing  In this case  giving something a frightening name will only increase the fear of what it is  Something I thought more deeply about when I read this book was the meaning of friendship and how important it is to have loyal friends  Harry  Ron and Hermione become good friend halfway through the book and after that they always sacrificing and doing things for each other  Hermione helps the boys to study and teaches them spells  Ron sacrifices himself while trying to get to harry to the philosophers stone and Harry gives his friends a real adventure  This showed me how important it is to have good friends and the impact they have on your life Overall I really enjoyed this book and recommend to everyone looking for an adventure and if you really enjoyed the movies    I read this book after a good friend of mine went to see the movie  I remember he kept talking on and on about the story  about how good the movie was and how good the first four books were and how he was anxiously waiting for the fifth  After about two weeks of non stop talking about Harry Potter  I finally caved in  and asked him to lend me the movie  The next day he came to school and gave me the video cassette and saying  You ll love it   And I did  How could I not  It had the power to keep you in that fantastic world where you can be a child forever  where everything has a solution and where good always wins  I went to school on Monday and begged him to lend me the first book and with every page I read  I loved the story more and more Ten years later  the book still has that power over me  to make me feel like a kid again and wish I too received a special letter from a secret school  What I love most about these books is that with every read  you discover new things  things you missed the previous time you read them This book isn t my favorite in the series  but it s an awesome start  I can t name everything I loved about the book  because I d just have to copy the entire book  I can say I liked the idea of a secret room and a mirror that showed you what you most wanted  I also loved the friendship that Harry  Ron and Hermione have  a friendship that eventually lasts forever Like every other Potter fan  I hope that in the future J K Rowling will give us a sort of an update  little tidbits of what  the boy who lived  and his two best friends are doing after Voldemort died  If it doesn t come to that  though  I ll be a happy reader as well  because re reading the books doesn t change their charm and their magic   When Mr and Mrs Dursley woke up on the dull  grey Tuesday our story starts  there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country    I ve lost count of how many times I ve read the Harry Potter series over the last 15 years  but this line still gives me shivers when I read it  There s something about starting Harry s journey all over again that reawakens the magic  even though the story itself is familiar and well loved Although  reading this as an adult  I do cringe slightly at Hagrid giving Dudley a pig s tail  Dudley doesn t do anything in that scene except quake with fear and  attempt to  hide behind his parents    yes  we know he s a bully  but Hagrid s only reason for giving him a pig s tail seems to be  lol he s fat  which  wow  pot calling the kettle black  much  Obviously Hagrid isn t the best role model  but as a pre teen I thought this was funny  whereas my first reaction nowadays is  hang on  that s uncalled for   IS THIS WHAT GROWING UP FEELS LIKE I also have to wonder at Dumbledore letting Harry find the Mirror of Erised so he was  familiar  with it    presumably he took the Stone out first     I had visions of Dumbledore hiding it in his sock drawer  Which  actually  might have been a safer place for it  and a supremely awesome bluff   Congrats  you got through all the enchantments and protections  But    the Stone s not here  lol sorry   Re read Feb 2015  in anticipation of the first official  HarryPotterBookNight   Captivating Humorous Fantasy  Finally a book for the entire family      _  First of all  I may not be exactly the demographic that you would think would read this book  or even give it a glance  So why should I care about a book that features a little boy who runs around with his friends casting charms and flying around on his broomstick  Hardly seems worth wasting my precious time    But then  very quickly actually  JK Rowling  undoubtedly a graduate of Hogwarts herself  began to weave a most hypnotic magical spell and I was hooked  Transported to that child like garden of delights at Hogwarts   a land of fantasy  witches  warlocks  trolls  spells  potions  charms and  for the readers  total enjoyment and smiles   I fell in love with Harry  RON  Hermione  all of their Gryffindor classmates  and with Dumbledore s paternal wisdom and I cheered wildly as Harry  the team seeker  dove and swooped in quest of the Snitch during their quidditch matches  As I flew on my broomstick through the magical mind of Harry Potter I noticed that not only had it taken mind off of where I was and was happening around me  but that I was taking a journey that no other book has taken me on before  Harry Potter is a book not only about magic and spells  but it also shows the true beauty that authors can show through their unbelievable talents  If I had the power to speak to whoever reads this and personally convince them that this book is full of wonders and morals that they must uncover  I most definitely would without a moment s hesitation  While I read about magic  spells  and charms  I felt J K  Rowling put a spell on this book to make her writing so unique yet breath taking  Some of the books I have read  most of them seem like the author was losing his or her talents towards the end of the book  J K  Rowling never left me bored or wanting to put the book down  In most books I count the pages I have left until the book is finished In Harry Potter I counted the pages I read  never wanting it to end  Rowling s writing style never failed to amaze me throughout the whole book  No matter what chapter I was on  I kept telling myself  I wish all the children in the world could read this book just to show that books can tell you the true beauty of friendship  courage  and kindness  This story  I guarantee  will sweep you off your feet and into a world of enchantment  this book is an excellent book for all ages a wonderful example of the power of friendship and loyalty I would definitely urge everyone to read it  The author has put together a sensational plot with extraordinarily fascinating characters that hook a reader on the story  this is one of the best I have ever read  To those who so quickly condemn these books at the first mention of the word  Witchcraft     take a step back  look at the bigger picture  and allow yourself to be stimulated by a rare gem of a book  in which good prevails  This famous and beloved book goes beyond just a story about witchcraft and magic  This is NOT the whole point of the book  believe it or not  J K  Rowling uses morals such as friendship and trust to create a wonderful story that has made her famous  and for a good reason  If you haven t read these books you don t know what you re missing         Highly recommended to everyone  I really liked the book  It had everything that I like  action  mystery  and magic  This Book was actually one of my favorites  I loved it so much  I have already bought all seven books  and right now i m currently only on book two  I personally think J K  Rowling is a genius  I don t really get sucked into books right off the bat  but this one did  I hope you all enjoy what I have to say about the book I love the plot of the story  this book definitely had the best plot of any of the books that I have read  A infant  Harry who is a wizard  whose parents get killed when he is young  and forced to live with his horrible uncle  horse faced aunt  and fat little greedy Dudley  Harry s cousin  for ten years until Harry s eleventh birthday where a giant saves him from his wretched family and takes him to Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry  Harry is forced to make sacrifices to save his friends and the school The plot is the main part that got me hooked from an instant  I guess I just like the fantasy stuff like the book  If you like fantasy books  this is the book for you  The book is full of cauldrons  spells  wands  and even magic sporting events J K  Rowling s writing techniques made you feel like you were in the the book  I urge you to read the series  because book one out of seven was really good  and it made me like reading  The Harry Potter series  I ve heard  are great  The whole book was great  but my most favorite part of the book was  the wizard sport  quidditch  that part made you feel like the crowd was cheering for you  If you read the book I hope you like it  because it was one of my favorites  The world of Harry Potter probably doesn t need any more reviews  but who cares  I just want to explain why I think this book is so awesome  1  It appeals to people of pretty much any age  Like Disney movies that have little jokes hidden away for the grown ups  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone is full of little moments of sarcasm and humour that most kids miss  2  The kids are kids One of my favorite parts in this book is right after the troll attack  The transformation of the relationships between Harry  Ron and Hermione is brilliant and so incredibly accurate  I ve worked with kids of all ages  and it really is crazy how enemies can so quickly turn into friends  3  Magic  Duh Who doesn t like the idea of a school for magic  4  Neville  I just   I love him  His character  even while not a main point of view  is so well created that I feel for him just as much as the main three kids  In fact  this kind of thing can be said for many of the other characters  It s not that I don t love Harry  He s great  But it s truly the ensemble cast that makes this book so fantastic  Every sentence leads to the final climax  and I never read something and thought it was superfluous or awkward  If you haven t read the Harry Potter series by now  you really need to  and I don t care how old you are    I couldn t resist It was during my second winter break when I decided to rewatch the Harry Potter movies  Even further  I couldn t wait to go to the library and get it  so I read the first book completely online  Some words were probably missing  but I ve already read it  so the experience is still there  Not as scintillating  but still there I have to say  Rowling is a mastermind  If you ve read her entire series  you d have to agree that certain character arcs and plot threads were woven beneath the entire framework    it was all orchestrated majestically by Rowling    and that her tapestry of the wizarding world is utterly  nobly  magical  Not just literally  But there is definitely an aura of wonder permeating the pages of Harry Potter  as there is in Percy Jackson and Malazan  Her world is so real  her characters so unforgettable  her magic system so    scholastic But in our quotidian stress  in our shared struggles in pursuing the elite schools  reading about another school is all the more understandable  Twelve inch essays about the history of magic remind us of those English AP essays that many think useless  A student body wearing robes and sorted into distinct Houses reminds us of the old image of college  uniformed students walking around an architecturally Gothic or Romanesque campus  learning in musty classrooms  In fact  Hogwarts is similar to college in that the students receive loads of homework  live in dorms in the school  and pursue work right after graduation A story is little without characters  I can talk ad infinitum about the characters  histories  developments  and traits after reading the series  Could I be as studious as Hermione  as noble as Harry  Most likely not  Harry Potter is just so awesome  Really  nothing comes close to the beauty of Rowling s work  To think of all of the places  names  people  histories  spells  galore is bloody brilliant If you haven t seen the movies yet  don t watch them until after you finish reading the books  They might give you altered perceptions of the characters  who are actors  and how magic really is used  Speaking of the movies  I d like to point out the huge flaw of  view spoiler  Death Eaters flying in the form of black smoke that can physically wreak destruction  Nobody can fly unaided in the books except for Voldemort and Snape   hide spoiler  There is a pearl on every page  In fact  a boxed set of all seven books would be a magnificent Christmas gift  I do have the seventh book from a white elephant long ago  but to own a book rather than read a copy from the library is so much better  A borrowed book is a window into another world  yes  but merely a window  An owned book is a door  which you can enter any time  I am very tempted to read book seven right now  and occasionally I find myself flipping to a random page and reading a couple of paragraphs before I catch myself  This is a series that everyone must read  not only bibliophiles  but everyone with the capacity for imagination and wonder that must necessarily remain in us even in our old age So if you haven t already  please read this book  and the six following  Don t use Kindle or Ebook or some other screen  Use the original version  a tangible page to be grasped eagerly by the hand  And if you re to read it  better to purchase a copy rather than borrow  This is a book that you can read over and over again throughout the years  How does one write a review the Harry Potter series  It s impossible  but I ll still give it a shot because something would be missing without a HP review  Also  this is one of the books in the Reading Challenge so I need to do my due diligence I read  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone  on my ninth birthday when it was first released in the US and no one had heard about this fantastic book  I remember reading the book in one or two compulsive sittings  but was then disappointed there were not any additional books in the series  Two years later the Harry Potter craze was starting up and I dug the story off of the book shelf  reread it and then read the next two books that were out  Now that there were more books in the series  I got into it Part of what makes the Harry Potter series magical to me is it seems almost everyone gets into them and enjoys reading them  For the first time  my friends had read the same books as me and wanted to talk about them  Previously being a bookworm  no one had read most of the books I had and therefore had different tastes  Harry Potter was the original  nerdy geeky can be cool   Read it so that you can be part of the conversation The Harry Potter books should be read as a series  but if you only read one this is it  The Sorcerer s Stone establishes the magic and is the  origin story  for all the rest to follow  Don t just read the movies  read the books  Or listen to the audiobook  they re fantastic and have won two Grammy awards   Great for road trips  Who should read it  Everyone  This is such a solid series and relevant to popular culture  I think everyone needs to give them a shot See all my reviews and more at www ReadingToDistraction com or  Read2Distract 5 stars out of 5 And I finally managed to get around this book after 2 millions at years of keeping it at bay   DI already watched all the 8 movies  and enjoyed all of it  but I know that I still have to read the books  I keep telling myself before that since I already watched the movies I should just put Harry Potter on the bottom of the books that I have to haul and read  But then again  I realized if I ll keep doing that when will be that time that I ll get around all the Potter books  And so I decided to give them already a go and yes yes yes it lived up to my expectations  I ll skip the detailed plot summary since everyone  I guess  already know what the books are all about  Everything that is to say has been said about this book already  But basically  the first book follows Harry Potter s first year at Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry  And from there we follow Harry and his friends  Hermione and Ron  with their adventures  How he adjusted from just surviving his sinister relatives to dealing with goblin bankers  dragons  centaurs  unicorns  a three headed dog and killing trolls  The book then follows their adventure in keeping the Sorcerer s stone  a stone that could be used to create the Elixir of Life  which extended the drinker s lifespan  as well as transform any metal into pure gold    Harry Potter Wiki  Now I understand the many people that adore Harry Potter  the author was able to breathe life to a fictional character  She created a genuine and unique magical world for the readers to enjoy  I love how the author played with words and managed to make the readers easily live the worlds that she made  I also love how the author was able to create each character distinct from each other  And how they are all engaging and rolled into one book  The interactions between the characters are so real  I easily connected to them and felt like one with them  Rowling s witty writing drew me in the moment I started reading the book  I love everything from it  Well it s hard not to like the book really  The writing makes it very easy to follow  Chapters are like short stories and book is just a compilation of it  The book is very simply but one can feel that that the author gave her heart writing it  The book is intended to be read by grade school to middle schoolers but what can be learned from the book transcends boundaries of age  The book talks about finding hope and courage from your friends when all seems to failing  It talks about how courage should not solely depend on how you re strong physically but also how strong you are inside  And lastly  it talks about the optimism and believing that anything is possible pays well  It also talks about love and how it can defy anything  Overall  this is a great start for the rest of the books  Clearly  Rowling knows how to entertain  This book deserves to be celebrated  After finishing this  I am ashamed that I only starting reading the Potter books at this late age   _  After reading this book  I felt like  I am already one with the humankind   D After reading the book  there s no way I won t continue with the series and after reading them all  I ll definitely reread them again  This is just the beginning of my journey  and I know  I know it will only get better   D 5 stars out of 5  Where it all began  for so many people like me  The start of fifteen years of wishing you too could attend Hogwarts  that you d be sorted into the house of your choice  that you would learn  how to bottle fame  brew glory  even put a stopper on death   When I first read this book at the tender age of 7  or perhaps 8  I can t remember exactly  I put it down within the first chapter  I read a lot as a kid   anything I could get my hands on  so it was odd that I would abandon a book so quickly  In my place  my mother read it  She didn t often read English books  but because it was only a slim novel  and she d heard about it before  she decided to give it a go Thank you  mammy  You brought many years of delight to my life by that decision  taken on a whim  She finished the book rapidly  and thrust it upon me within days  begging me to give it another shot  Skeptically  I did  And devoured it within two hours   I was a fast reader   it was why I was always searching for something new to read  be it the back of a shampoo bottle or a completely inappropriate chicklit novel   I had been transported to a whole new world  A world where magic unlike what I d ever heard of existed  I had decided to read the back of the novel before I started this time  So I knew the basic idea   magic  boarding school  blah blah blah  And once I made it past that damned first chapter  I knew I was never going to let this story go  I followed with burning hate as the Dursley s mistreated Harry  as the snake broke loose with a terrified delighted  and with bated breath as Hagrid made an appearance  And once that fateful chapter was over  I knew it was just beginning I don t remember much from the first time reading  except being curled up on the crappy old sofa where I always read  and telling my younger sister to go away because I was busy reading  And I remember finishing  realising there were more books  and calling my mother desperately over  demanding to go to a bookshop  She smirked  of course  Never let me forget that day  the day when I admitted that she was indeed correct  that yes I would love the book  and that she had already purchased the second in the series on the recommendation of my speech and drama teacher  the woman who had recommended it to me in the first place  I feel like I don t need to go into much detail about the writing itself  It s a debut novel  there is occasionally shaky characterisation  But it s already a classic  it s flaws make it all the more charming  And I m sure it s be discussed by the thousands of reviewers below  In fact  this review is wholly unnecessary   what can I say that hasn t already been said  But I wanted to share my introduction to the wonderful wizarding world of Harry Potter  and I d love to hear yours  This is  only   the third time I have read this book  and I love it even more now that I ve reacquainted myself with it  The re read was inspired by visiting the Warner Brothers Harry Potter Studio Tour in London  which also inspired watching all of the Harry Potter movies within a week  Knowing what happens in the story adds an extra excitement  for me  I can see the development of Professor Snape s feelings about Harry Potter  and how Albus Dumbledore is testing Harry to see what he is capable of  I love these little hints at the future  I am also enjoying getting to know the characters all over again  Neville Longbottom is going to become a new favourite  I just know it  I always used to ignore him as I thought he was insignificant  I m paying special attention to Peeves as he was never in the movies  and making sure I have my eyes open properly when they re talking about the learning of spells  observation of astrology  and preparing of potions  All the little things If the Harry Potter series is one that you have never read  all I can ask you is  why not  It s not just for children  it s intelligently written  it examines the human condition  and it stretches the imagination  I sincerely wish that I could go to Hogwarts  receive the acceptance letter  go to Diagon Alley for all my supplies  and take the lessons with all the other students  I remember reading this book for the very first time and just being amazed  Just amazed by how great this book was  how fantastic JK Rowling s writing was in the novel  And I remember having to wait forever and ever to read the next book because all the books were checked out from the media center and I had to wait until the other kids returned it and it was just forever and ever waiting between all the books  I can t imagine how it was for the kids who actually had to anticipate the release of the next book  That would have been AWFUL  Harry Potter is just so awesome  how can you stop reading it  I NEED MORE HARRY POTTER FOREVERMORE  I NEED MORE HARRY POTTER NOVELS FOR AN ETERNITY BECAUSE IT IS JUST THAT EPIC  AND I PITY THOSE OF YOU WHO DO NOT SEE THE EPICNESS OF THESE NOVELS  SUCH SAD LIVES YOU MUST HAVE  Do not pity the dead  Harry  Pity the living  and  above all  those who live without love    Rowling  Deathly Hallows Great quote by Dumbledore  but I think it needs to be changed to  Pity the living  and  above all  those who live without loving the Harry Potter series    Rowling  Deathly Hallows  adapted by me  Reread this book for the second time It proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that Rowling is a master author The characterization is brilliant  as is the plotting Harry  in the beginning of the book  has nothing  In fact  he has less than nothing No money  no parents  no friends  and a family that basically despises him Then  as the book progresses through the first through chapters  he suddenly gets money  a new start at life  and eventually even friends Then he starts at his new life  discovers a mystery that needs to be solved  and ends up solving it with the help of his new found friends Ron is pretty much the perfect best friend in this book   he supports Harry in everything he does  and helps Harry adjust to his new life Hermione is the slightly annoying  somewhat unlikely friend that proves to be extremely helpful in a pinch  Like Ron  she turns out to be incredibly loyal to Harry Dumbledore is the wise old man that anyone would love to have as their grandfather  while at the same time being a magical super hero Hagrid is a loyal and good friend  while at the same time being a perfect comic relief  with his unusual size and looks and his undying love of everything big and scary Malfoy is a great opposition to Harry  Where Harry is brave  Malfoy is a wimp  Where Harry is including and generally tries to get along with everyone  Malfoy is selective and apparently loves nothing more than to pick a fight  He also likes to look down on anyone not in his circle of friends This isn t just a good fantasy story   this is a good book  End of story  I have read this book AT LEAST 30 times  although it has been 6  years since the last time I read it  and it was far too long  I was so nostalgic the whole time reading it    although I own several copies of the book  I decided to read my original one from 10 1999  The pages were smooth  and the corners worn  and you could still kind of smell that crisp smell that only Harry Potter books have  although it is starting to smell like old book now too  There is something about these books that have always been so special   even reading this book for the 30  time and as an adult  it was still magical  I still giggled at the jokes  and got choked up when Neville received 10 points for Gryffindor at the end  and I remember how excited and enthralled I was the first time I read it nearly 16 years ago  WHAT       which mirrored to how I felt reading it this time  I read great books all the time  but there is something magical about these books that gets me every time like nothing else ever has  I m so glad I decided to start my year by reading these again  I feel inspired  1 26 2016   I enjoyed the Stephan Frye narration  and I look forward to listening to the next one  However  although it was nice to have someone else read to you and not have to do all of the work myself       haha  I didn t feel as emotionally invested as I do when I read books to myself   I first read this book when I was seven and have read it many times since  Harry potter is a classic and the majority of people know the plot of the story  however if you haven t read the book then I d strongly urge you to Ten year old Harry lives with his thin  nosey aunt  his beefy uncle and his spoilt  rapidly expanding cousin  all of whom reluctantly tolerate his presence  The Durselys took Harry in when he was just a year of age and was left on their front doorstep  after the death of his parents  Nearing his eleventh birthday  mysterious letters start to arrive for Harry  however his guardians destroy them all before Harry can open them  The letters  it transpires  are from Hogwarts   a school for witches and wizards   who invite Harry to attend their school  as his parents did before him The story revolves around Harry s journey from a life of neglect to a whole new world he knows nothing about  For the first time  he makes friends as well as enemies and fits in well with his new classmates and excels at a wizarding sport  Quidditch  Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone is written with children in mind and has that overall tone of a child s book  so it s easy to read but it sets it up for the following books which continue with increasingly sophisticated language and plots  The book has a decent plot and a good twist at the end   which if you didn t already know the outcome would come as a welcome surprise  So    I was wondering how to write a review on a book that needs none  Its fame is already spread worldwide and is adored by thousands if not more  It is hard but it has been annoying me to no end that I read such a remarcable piece of literature  several times of course  and never wrote a review   gasps  The horror The very first time this book  series  came to my country  some years ago  I m ashamed to admit that I vowed then never to read it  The continuous mentions of the name Harry Potter on TV was bugging me to no end  Seriously   a book that needed to be commercialised  Bunch of kids screaming over TV about  how amazing this series is and we all should read it right away    Nope    I wasn t going to do it  I never do what other people tell me to do  I am that rebellious  Right A year later I decided to do it  There was still some annoyance  but as a bookworm    I just had to read it  And I never felt more sorry in my life   that I didn t read it sooner I mean   Seriously    Hook  line  sinker  That easy  It sucked me into that magical world like some sort of    uh    magic    A story of a young boy  destined to do great things in his life  And it all starts in the very first book  We are introduced to the magical world of witches and wizards at the same time as Harry is  We learn it all through his eyes and adventures  some hard and some funny as all hell  A boy  who never had real family or friends finds his home at Hogwarts   school for witchcraft and wizardry  and true  loyal friends who help him understand it all and make him feel accepted   finally  The world J K Rowling created is vast and spectacular  And it feels real even when it obviously isn t It is a first book in a series that speak about loyalty and true friendship  About finding yourself and helping others  About battling evil and reaching goals that seem impossible and    MAGIC  The beautiful magic every person dreamed about at least once in a lifetime I would recommend this book to everyone  Do not mix religion or science into this series while you read it  Really  don t  It s magic Re read  Sept 16 2013Re read  July 30 2015 What is there to even say about Harry Potter  I am so glad I decided to start rereading this series  I was amazed at how often my mind flashed between the book and movie due to the dialogue  much of which is straight from the text  The story was amazing as always and it was fun going back and finding the differences between the book   movie  Harry Potter was a huge part of defining my generation  I was 10 years old when HP was released in the US and I was lucky enough to start reading it right away   I grew up with Harry and I am forever grateful to JK Rowling for this series  It s singlehandedly the reason I am in love with literature and reading today Book 1 is so much fun and really a quick read   it s only 310 pages and compared to the monster books that come later in the series  it flies by  In this book  Harry discovers who he really is and is quickly immersed into the magical world  We meet his best friends Ron and Hermione  see how they meet one another  and begin to understand how the wizarding world works I recommend this book to anyone  period  If you for some strange reason haven t read Harry Potter yet  stop what you are doing and start right now  5 5 stars  After a very short 3 days  i ve finished the first Harry Potter book i must say   i really enjoyed it  one of my fears going into this would be that i wouldn t enjoy it as much as i could because i m 20 years old  but that didn t really matter  the story is SOLID     and its kind of making me resent twilight a little bit which is weird   but i digressi really enjoyed reading this  i actually had to stop myself from reading because i would ve been done in 2 days rather than 3 if i hadn t i was pleasantly surprised that not alot of detail was missing from the movies   that s usually a big thing with film adaptations  alot of things are left out because of time  but i guess since the movies were so long they had the time to put everything in the only thing i will say that i found out from this book that i didn t get from the first movie was that Harry s dad saved Professor Snape when they were younger    now i don t know if i just don t remember Dumbledore telling him that or what but   that was  curious  loli was hoping that by reading the book i would get a little more insight into Snapes whole role in this series and in Harry s life  but thus far i m still confused as hell  i swear    everything Snape does its just like  jeez you really hate this kid     yet he does everything in his power to try and protect him    ugh maybe in the next few books i ll get my  Snape Questions  answered     The Harry Potter series is probably my favourite book series of all time   sorry  Baby sitters Club  The books are so full of excitement and magic  and Ms Rowling has created such a fantastic world that it s hard to believe that a place like Hogwarts doesn t exist  I still remember the first time I read Philosopher s Stone  it was December 2001  and the first movie was out and all anyone talked about was Harry Potter  I was flying to BC to meet a friend  and I bought the first book to read on the plane  just to see what all the fuss was about  Little did I know that I would end up getting sucked right into the fuss I love this first book because  in addition to our introduction to the world of wizards  it s got that great mix of innocence and action  It s perfect for getting your feet wet  a nice light appetizer before reaching the heaviness that the later books deliver    For my first Goodreads review of Harry potter and the Philosopher s Stone  I listened to the UK audiobooks  narrated by Stephen Fry  It was my first time listening to an audiobook right through  my first time was  A Short History of Myth   and that was just to study on my drive to school  and I thought it would be interesting to experience a different medium of Harry Potter   Also  I wanted to give audiobooks a try   I really enjoyed it  but I don t know if it was because the story was familiar  or because it had been awhile since I had read the books  so I missed them  I did find  however  that sometimes I d tune out from listening   browsing the internet and focusing on what I was reading  driving and focusing on the road  for shame  I know   Even making food and I d just tune out from the story  So I don t know if I d want to listen to a story that was completely new to me on audiobook  for fear of missing something important  Maybe after I finish listening to all seven Harry Potter books  I ll be better at paying attention to the story AND whatever I m doing    Need  I  Say  More I have a confession  When I picked this up  I had a niggling doubt at the back of my head that I wouldn t enjoy this as much as most people  Simply because a lot of people read this series when they were much younger and therefore their ratings would have been according to their feelings at the time  I thought that the story would be predictable and perhaps a little childish Wrong Man  did I get warped into this book  The plot twist of the last chapter made my jaw drop  I found myself smiling and laughing at the banter between the characters  The complexity of the story in simple yet not so overly simple writing was so genius  I mean   who comes up with something like Quidditch and still explains it so well  so confidently  so easily  Rowling created a monster when she published the first book in 1997  If I ve learnt anything from reading Philosopher s Stone  it s that Rowling s writing isn t restrictive   it isn t just aimed for children or just young adults  It is an ageless masterpiece      the trouble is  humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things which are worst for them     I have lost track of the number of times that I have read this series of books and I love them just as much now as I did then  I hate to be cliche about this but there is a magical  almost innocence quality to these stories  Ms  Rowling did such a good job of capturing wonder of a child going to some place like Hogwarts  She also does a very good job of making the Dursleys and Lord Volemort so unlikable that you don t feel bad when they get what they deserve  This is the first book in the series and there is a lot of character building and background throughout the story  In this the book is so much better than the movie  We get to see what Harry s life was like before he knew he was a wizard  before he had any real friends  It would have been so easy for Harry to have become bitter and unruly with the abuse that he receives at the hands of the Dursleys  You have to wonder why Dumbledore left Harry with these people  That is answered in later books but at this point we just have to wonder  I have no patience with bullies and this story is filled with them  That is one reason I have always had such an intense dislike for the Dursleys  they are a whole family of bullies  Harry is what we all want our children to grow up to be  He is courageous  loyal  smart and kind  He is respectful of others and befriends so many that are left out for no other reason than they are different Ron and Hermione are wonderfully written as well  We all know someone like Hermione  She is brilliant and just a little awkward  She knows so much but there are times her wisdom is a little off  She hasn t ever broken the rules and she has always study very hard to be the best  She is driven and needs someone to show her that there is more to life than books and knowledge  This is where Harry and Ron come in  They drag her from one adventure to the next showing that there are other ways that things can be done  They are show the meaning of friendship and kindness  They show her how to temper her comments and not be the overbearing know it all  Hermione keeps the boys from failing their classes  I am not sure that Harry and Ron would have done so well without Hermione s help  Ron just wants to prove himself  He wants some accomplishment of his very own  Being the youngest of four brothers from a struggling family he has never had much that was just his  Ron wants to shine and show his parents that he is more than just another Weasley boy The rest of the characters are all just as interesting  I could probably write several pages on the teachers and the other students but I think I should leave something for the new readers to discover on their own  This first book is a very quick read  first because it is the shorter of the seven and second because you keep reading to find out what happens next  This is also the least dark of the series  Lord Volemort is still weak and things and ordinary in the wizarding world for the time being  This a great book for young and old alike  There are funny parts  sad parts  exciting parts and wondrous parts  All just waiting to be discovered by the next reader  It s strange for me to look back and remember that I first read this book over seven years ago  and at the time I was sure I wouldn t like it  At 15  I was convinced I was too old for this kind of thing  Seven years  seven books  five films  multiple websites  and one convention later  I am happy to say that I don t think I ll ever be too old for Harry Potter A couple of years ago  I decided I would re read the series once every year  but that has become a hard thing to stick to  I usually read the series at least twice a year   once in summer and once in winter   and will find myself returning to any one of the books at certain times just to get my fix  There s something so comfortable and familiar now about Harry  Hermione  Ron  Hedwig  Professors Dumbledore  McGonagall  and Snape  the Marauders  the Order of the Phoenix  the Death Eaters   even Voldemort himself  Reacquainting myself with them every few months is like sinking in a warm bath  I know how it will go  how it will end  who lives  and who dies  but I can t help loving the journey every time  I don t usually make New Year s resolutions  but I m pretty sure I m going to try to read the entire Harry Potter series this year  About 10 years ago  I got up to book 4  It was sort of a  thing  my mother   I did together  the movies anyway  and when she died I totally lost interest  Maybe not interest   maybe just the heart for it  But rereading year one was such a treat  I can definitely remember why I loved the story so much  Maybe it s not the greatest literature in the English language  and maybe it s not even the best of the fantasy genre  but it s a wonderful story  engaging and funny and fun Ten years after my first reading  I certainly had some updated responses  I found a comma splice  which I m not sure I could have identified back then  I m pretty sure the Mirror of Erised didn t make me cry quite so much before I had two long lost parents of my own  And interestingly  when I read this the first time  I remember being annoyed at how much of the beginning takes place at the Dursley s  This time  I thought it was rather well crafted  but back then I just wanted to get to the magic part  Good to see I grew some patience What an experience  Here s to a Harry Potter filled 2011  I originally wasn t thinking I d write a review about J  K  Rowling s amazing first book to her equally amazing Harry Potter series  Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone  but the second I started listening to it  I knew I had to write something Yes  I listened to this one on audio  I had read this series in university  starting when the fourth book came out  I remember making fun of a friend of mine who was reading the books because they were MG books   kids books  I could never enjoy these But  like most people who started reading these books  I was immediately entranced from the first few sentences  Even now  listening to it  only my second time reading the book   I fell in love instantly  The only reason I decided to listen to this one was because I was waiting in the car and the wait time turned out to be LONGER than I had anticipated  I was bored with my music  so I flipped through my audio books and picked this one So much love   SO much love   for this one  I was leery about the audio   this one narrated by Stephen Fry   but it was wonderful to listen to  I found myself finding more things to do during the day just so I could continue listening to it  Stephen Fry was a wonderful narrator  I ve heard that his narration is nothing compared to Jim Dale s  but I really love the sound of his voice  One of the arguments I had read was that Stephen Fry s narrations are much LONGER than Jim Dale s  but this was something I liked  Stephen Fry takes     his     time     while     reading     and it s great  I loved his enunciations and the emphasis he put on certain words  I LOVED his Hagrid voice because it was so much like Robbie Coltrane in the movie And the story  Can I really say anything else about the story that hasn t been said  Probably not  But I ll continue to gush  This story is MAGICAL  I just can t get over the way the story is written   it s something that is juvenile  but still a book that can appease adults  I can t explain it  but it just doesn t come across as juvenile as some books do   it s not too silly  but just silly enough  It s silly in a unique  magical way  It s unbelievably funny   I found myself smiling for the majority of the book  Sure  it might not be the BEST written book  but it s fun and one that I could listen to over and over again While this is just my second time reading the story  if you re like me and consider listening reading   I ve actually seen the movie quite a few times  I ADORE the first movie   seeing the actors so young and cute   so I found myself immediately wondering about the differences between the books and the movies  The first chapter of this book outlines Harry being brought to the doorstop of the Dursley s and there is so much DETAIL that I couldn t get over it  The movie is also quite detailed  but I found myself getting lost in descriptions  the people  and the interactions  It was wonderful The only thing that bothered me   and it s probably just because I ve seen the movie so much   is Harry and Ron s relationship with Hermione  She just seems so snooty and bossy in the book  whereas they re best friends pretty much right off the bat in the movie  BUT  it was entertaining  to say the least  It only bothered me here and there This was a great reread   I loved the humour  the magic  the mystery  and the characters  I can t wait to continue on with the rest of the series Read more reviews on my blog  Reading In Winter    I love the Harry Potter series and the Sorcerer s Stone is the book that started it all I ll be honest  I tried to read this book when it first came out many years ago  and I was unable to finish it  For the life of me  I just couldn t get into it  However  several years later  during the summer I turned 18  I gave this book a second try and I m so glad that I did  I m 24 now and I m re reading the series for the millionth time and I can safely say that I still love this series just as much now as I did then  Probably even more Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone isn t without it s slow bits and clunky parts  as are most other first novels in a series  However  the world that J K  Rowling creates is enough to leave any reader coming back for more  No matter how old you get  you ll still be wishing you could receive your Hogwarts acceptance letter  Rowling introduces us to some amazing and memorable characters such as Ron and Hermione  Dumbledore  Hagrid  McGonagall  and even Snape and Draco Malfoy  I love the whimsical feel of this book  I do wish that Rowling hadn t taken as much time as she did to establish the story  You don t even get to Hogwarts until about halfway through  I m always a little disappointed that we don t get into the meat of the story earlier  However  considering the breadth and depth of the series  that is a small nitpick to have  The end leaves you wanting more and hungrily anticipating the next year at Hogwarts I d definitely recommend this book to just about anyone regardless of their normal preferences  This book is great for kids and adults alike  and will especially appeal to the fantasy crowd  This is a must read book  Hello everybody  I am really happy to write down my second book review  I ve missed some of them already and I dont want to miss another one anymore  About Harry Potter and The Sorcerer s stone  it is really good  you see details you wont be able to catch in the movie even if you see it twice  I thought about seeing the movie again but I was told I d better read it and so I did  I am encouraged to continue to read next Potter book so I shall do it  Some readers might like him some other readers might not  some people might prefer the movie some others not but to me it was great  I have to confess  I like the way the chapters progress and are explained  All characters are totally different and all proffesors have strong personalities to me and even Harry seems to be stronger than he looks in the movie  I quite like him  There is plenty to say about it but it could be better to read it  so you can have your own opinion  thanks to this book plenty of children in my country started to read and they keep doing so    Now I wish more adults get to have this hobby  so in this Dia de Muertos  in Mexico  or Halloween  it s an exellent choice  so take it and get to be a wizard in your life but be carefull with what it can be seen on the mirrors of life  focus on truth not in what you want to see   Nearly every Harry Potter fan I meet has read the series at least twice  As for me  I never pictured myself actually finishing the books for the FIRST time  and just as I ve never considered converting to Islam  I ve never given a first thought to re reading the four Potter books I HAVE already read  and my desire to read the last three books was only half hearted at the most  Then I watched HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS  PART II at the movie theater this summer  I was converted from a tepid fan   I like the POTTER series  It s pretty good  I think it s a bit over hyped though    to a speechless fan                I reread the first book with my children and wife and loved it more the second time around There s no feeling like introducing your children to your own hobbies and interests and seeing their faces light up with enthusiasm  When little eight year olds in Baton Rouge utter their very first  That s bullshit   to a referee s call against the Tigers  the glow from their beaming dads  hearts pulsate with the potential to make the moon not so secure in his position with the company I ve been brainwashing Caedmon for years now with STAR WARS  and I m afraid I may have corrupted him  His enthusiasm for and knowledge of the STAR WARS universe has surpassed my own  He knows the names of every single machine to step foot on Hoth    He s played PS2 s STAR WARS LEGOS video game every week for nearly four year  We re currently on our third copy of the same game  which Caedmon paid for with his own money    I m ready for a change  so I guess now it s time to pack the U haul  leave Mos Eisley for a while  and enroll at Hogwarts We have been reading HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER S STONE aloud for the past few weeks  Each night Jess  Caedmon  Arwen  and I read about a chapter or so  Now  I ve been reading books aloud to the kids for years now  but NO BOOK has captivated us as intensely as HARRY POTTER  I think the excitement I feel when looking forward to each night s reading outreaches Caedmon s on some nights  Reading this book out loud is SO much better than reading it by myself in my head  It s fun coming up with voices for each character  even though my English accents are quite rough and inconsistent  my Hagrid sounds more like my pirate impression  and my family thinks Professor McGonagall is Ron s mom  Mrs  Weasley is the head of Gryffindor  and Harry and Ron are the same person  It s even worse when I do Hagrid s voice not realizing that Hermione is the one speaking We re about ninety pages into THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS and hope to finish the entire series within two years  The kids haven t seen the movies yet  so it ll be an extra treat to watch each movie together after we finish each book  I also bought HARRY POTTER LEGOS YEARS 1 4 for Caedmon  for straight A s on his interim report   but I m making him wait until we finish reading each year before he plays the video game version  Pretty soon  he ll be able to put me to shame  for I m sure  before long  his ability to recite the names of each spell and its effects will rival Hermione Granger s   Audio review Genre  Fantasy fiction     Reading level  Age 8 This popular series launched a new wave of readers a decade ago  The tsunami effect continues with audio formats  movies  and games based on Rowling s beloved boy and his friends  Harry Potter is an

my daughter s urging  I read the books before drawing conclusions  and I quickly realized that the opponents were missing the point  What passes for witchcraft in the books is not related to the practices proscribed by the Bible  for more details see my review of Prisoner of Azkaban  while the themes of the books are well within the Christian ethical system  The most powerful magic on earth is the love of a mother for her child  Friendship often consists in opposing our friends for their own good  Interpersonal relationships are more important than the means to worldly success  It is more important to understand rules than to follow them  because true submission requires understanding the reasons behind the rules and improvising our responses to circumstances  rather than mere rote repetition of the rules  in word and action  This is a children s book  but it is also the first step in a fascinating experiment  Each of the seven books is written for the reading level  maturity  and human understanding matching the age of the characters  At fourteen  the characters will respond to the challenge of the Goblet of Fire not as eleven year old children  but as adolescents finding their way  At seventeen  their search for the Deathly Hallows will reveal growing maturity comparable to the adults surrounding them  As far as I know  no one has written a similar series before  and Rowling succeeded admirably  Let me try to explain the reason why I have read Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone by J K  Rowling more times than I can possibly count  When an author is able to link several details together like J K  Rowling masters  it is hard not to enjoy a novel  For example  Harry reads about Nicolas Flamel on his very first Chocolate Frog Card on his way to Hogwarts  this little detail might seems completely unimportant  but later on Harry receive a Chocolate Frog Card from Neville Longbottom  and remembers why Nicolas Flamel seemed so familiar to him when he tries to remember where he read about him  The example above is art  I am honestly astound by the author s ability to link these small details together  Many novels contain a lot of unnecessarities  details that has no relevant to the story in any way  Not only did the author of this stunning read create a complete new world with round characters  but she also manage to write it stunning  Not many authors of today can do that   Finished 5 19 09 Read aloud to my 6 1 2 year old son and he LOVED it  Ms  Rowling has a delightful way of describing an amazing world  including some pretty dark elements  without overdoing it  Harry is the quintessential underdog cum hero  All of the characters are creative and interesting  The action moves along quickly and the story is riveting  The serious topics  death of parents  intense scary scenes  bullying  pain  evil  are dealt with age appropriately without minimizing them or making them too heavy Wonderful first glimpse into a fascinating world                                     Finished reading it to my now 12 year old  9 year old  and 6 year old again tonight  4 8 15   They were all entranced from start to finish  frequently begging for  just one more chapter   Can t wait to start the next one                                       For more book reviews  visit my blog  Build Enough Bookshelves  I just finished listening to Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone on CD  and I can t wait to go pick up the second book  The audio version was fabulous  Award winning actor Jim Dale read the story and wonderfully articulated the story with accents and expression  This story begins as Harry Potter is dropped off at his aunt and uncles house shortly after his parents die from a horrible wizard named Voldemort  The Dursley s  Harry s family  go on to raise him  They treat him poorly and he feels like he never fits in  Then one day  he receives letters from a giant named Hagrid asking him to go to a boarding school called Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry  Harry goes on to learn all about his parents and his  special  abilities  After Harry goes to boarding school  he realizes that he is a legend in the wizard community for surviving an attack from Voldemort which left him with a large scar on his forehead  Harry and his two new friends  Ron and Hermione  go on to protect the third floor at Hogwarts to battle evil figure out the the mystery behind Harry s lightening shaped scar  This is a wonderful story appeals to many readers as it is filled with suspense  fun  friendship  and fantasy  The audio version is perfect for readers of all ages  At least 3 reviews later  I still haven t quite captured my exact sentiments for this book  Again  still trying     Reading this book always brings me back to the summer of 2005  when my Potterhead aunt was in town with a hardback edition of the Sorcerer s Stone  I was in third grade  finally hitting the reading and maturity level to enjoy these books  and all of the upperclassmen of my elementary school were reading them  so of course I wanted to Even then  I still had a slight disdain for the mainstream  always looking for faults and flaws in things that everyone loved  When my aunt wanted to read me Harry Potter  I very much wanted to dislike it  but not quite as much as I wanted to love it and join the fandom  And I fell in immediately  hooked by the first chapter  asking my aunt a billion questions  horrified to hear she couldn t answer all of them because they weren t to be revealed until the  not yet published  seventh book  What about the people in cloaks  I wanted to know  Do we find out why they wear the cloaks   That head scratcher is answered shortly in  not to spoil anything  but the cloak wearers are wizards  You re welcome  Thankfully  there was more mystery than that to keep me going  and that s half the fun  Not just the unanswered questions  but the wonders of the wizarding world  The magical  ever changing castle that is Hogwarts  the laws and logic of spells  Quidditch  Diagon Ally    there s just so much to take in  As a child  the magic was the best thing  it was so strange and beautiful  and Rowling totally sold nine year old me on all of it  She s not a literary sort of writer  her prose isn t highly stylized or poetic  but if being a good writer means getting a picture into the readers  heads  she s among the best  No one closes Sorcerer s Stone not knowing what Hogwarts looks like  Seven years later  and I m still in love  even if Sorcerer s Stone feels just a little bit silly  It s not as though it s a flawless story  again  she s not out to create literature  just a story  But for what it is  just a story  it s marvelous  I was so stunned by every twist and turn when I first read it  and now I can only retrace my steps and grin at the memories  What prevails above all of it are the characters  They rise above the story that really is just the opening paragraph of the series and become the focal point  After having read the entire series multiple times through  I know how they all end up  and to some degree  that ruins things  but in a different way  it makes it better  I have such appreciation for the way things all tied together  and more and more I m starting to see the beauty of the characters fates by Deathly Hallows in a way I didn t see when I first read it in sixth grade  Those connections throughout the books are what make Harry Potter more than just a story  Overall  I have only fondness for these books  a combination of nostalgia and appreciation of craftsmanship and fangirlish adoration  I ll be among the many of my generation who will read these books to their children  and I can only hope my kids can appreciate it the same way I can   Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone  Harry Potter   1 by J K  Rowling384 pagesArthur A  Levine Books0439554934This book sets up the story line Of J K  Rowlings trilogy  It starts off with a boy  young Harry Potter  living in a horrible home with his aunt and uncle  However  an extreme change in his life was about to happen when he went to wizard school  The story is set wit 3 protagonist  Harry  Ron  and Hermoine and as well as the main antagonist Draco  who always tried to get in Harry s way  Learning for harry came easy to him  since he was the child of 2 great wizards  This is where he first meets the murderer of his parents  Voldemort  With everyone troubling him at wizard school  he still managed to prosper with this help of his friends  He even helped to get enough points for his house to win in the wizard competitions  I would recommend this book to people who haven t seen the movie yet only because if you see the movie you wont want to read the book  It is an easy read  but not for people who are too young  All in all  i thought the book was pretty good  however i still liked the movie more  I grew up with Harry  meaning I was always the same age as the character  and I maintain that that is the best way to read the series  In fact  my future kids will be forbidden to read them  or watch the movies  before they turn 11 12 13   When I think about it now  everything these kids are put through seems like a lot to ask of an 11 year old  but I never had that feeling reading the books when I was that age  Of course I always thought they were brave to be walking around an enchanted castle at night  hunting some unknown in the forbidden forest and battling a crazy teacher with Voldemort s face on the back of his head  but I still thought  and hoped  I could be that brave if I was ever faced with similarly scary situations   No forbidden forest near my house  so that particular one might be tough     It really is a series to grow up with and I think most die hard fans  like me  did  If you didn t  try to read it through the eyes of an 11 year old  because I think that s the way it s meant to be read  I just finished this for the third or fourth time  I tried audio and was not disappointed  Reading it at this point in my writing journey  I noticed many things that bothered me  plot holes  coincidence  faulty motivation  and that ending   he s saved by his acid skin    but all of that can be swept under the rug because of the incredible world and characters Jo has made  Couple that with her complicated plots and witty prose  and it s no wonder she s the 2nd richest lady in England I CAN T WAIT FOR THE NEWT SCAMANDER MOVIES  Later reviews  After consuming many books on writing and beginning to question my own writing style  I figured it was time to get back to the basics  I m going to see how JK does it   Cause whatever s she s doing must be right  Earlier  and unforgivably negative  review Not the best in the series  but certainly incredible  Things that bug me  The Quidditch rules seem utterly pointless  Why even have any other balls and players if the seeker can just win the game with a single snitch grabbing  But of course the game was developed as a vehicle to make Harry shine  and to that end Quidditch is perfect  Here I am reading Harry Potter again  gosh  I came into the series reluctantly at 12  around the time Prisoner of Azkaban came out  thinking I was too old to read a silly book about a dorky kid on a broomstick Little did I know  This is my first full reread of the series since Deathly Hallows came out  and I am just as pleased with it now as I was then Rowling wrote the ultimate escapist fantasy  where kids who feel like they don t belong can be suddenly whisked off to a nonsensical wizarding world with wands and owl post and bastardized latin spells  I loved it  I love it still  Rowling began to expand her universe and make it more complex and  grown up  with each book  something  as I ve written before and go more deeply into  that I ve only really seen Susan Cooper do unitentionally with her Dark is Rising sequence and definitely with Terry Pratchett s Tiffany Aching books    I don t think anymore that he was following Rowlings  lead  Pratchett has always aged his characters in  real time  from book to book  he likely saw no reason to not do so in his children s books It s a risky gambit of Rowlings but one that helped cement Harry Potter into the imaginations  and hearts  of us lucky readers who grew up with the books  It was amazing  I can only compare it with something like Lost  I was sucked into the show  it s mythology  everything  as it spooled out over six seasons  Then it ended and I saw how limited it all was  Once it stopped  growing  the magic went away I guess   the existence of Pottermore makes me suspect that Rowling feels the same way As of writing this I ve already finished rereading up to halfway through Goblet of Fire and yeah  definite cracks that appeared in Rowlings  wizarding world s logic just keep getting bigger  but it s a FANTASY series for KIDS  I know we all have a lot of investment in these books but  come on people  reading these books is a case of willing suspension of disbelief  I m not going to bother pointing out how ridiculous most of the rules of magical people are in future reviews  Even if I am seriously disturbed that there are apparently no English or math lessons  etc  past the age of 11  Arithmancy does not count Next  Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets J K  Rowling does a marvelous job of creating a world so unlike ours but so similar in many ways  The witches and wizards in Harry s world are not that unlike us when you think about it  They have the same feelings  fears  hopes  dreams and disappointments  There s a social hierarchy in their world  much like ours  There s a political structure in their world too  complete with a governing agency  ruling officials and laws and regulations  They go to school  hold jobs  get married  raise families  get old and die  They love sports and entertainment as well  There s good and evil in Harry s world too Harry is your typical boy for the most part  but having never known his parents has left him missing out on that most important relationship  He s being raised by his mother s sister and her husband  living with them and their bully of a son  Dudley  but not really wanted  I got angry all over again at the way they treated him and at his living conditions  One thing that amazed me then and still does is why the Dursley s put up such a fight to keep Harry from going to Hogwarts  They made it abundantly clear every day that they didn t want Harry  barely tolerating his presence in their home  Going to Hogwarts would get him out of their home and ultimately their lives  They should have been kicking up their heels in joy when the first letter arrived  Perhaps  I will never understand why  Fortunately  the lack of bonding and family love does not turn Harry into a sociopath  bent on destroying lives Harry adjusts remarkably well to his new life and the excitement of it all  Once again  I found myself wishing I could go to Hogwarts  Going away to school in a castle with moving staircases  ghosts  magical creatures  and interesting characters may seem like a lot for an eleven year old boy to deal with  but Harry does  Finding out his parents were actually murdered by a very evil wizard who also tried to kill him is a lot to take in  as well  but Harry soon learns that those events are a part of who he is and the world he is now a part of I wanted to savor each page of the book  but I couldn t put it down  Even knowing what was coming next  I discovered things I had missed before or perhaps forgot  I had forgotten what a strange and unusual girl Hermione was in the beginning  I had forgotten that Ron is very brave  I had forgotten how troublesome Peeves was and how stern Professor McGonagall could be So whether you are a fan who loves to re read this series or someone who is reading it for the first time  embrace the story fully and enjoy the ride  It is an adventure not to be missed  I decided it was time for a re read of the Harry Potter series as I first started the series in 2004 well after the initial publication date but before all of the series was completed  I was amazed  inspired  captivated  awed by the writing and forevermore I became a Potter groupie  Now after the second reading of the first book in the series  I am reminded just what a phenomenon this series became for children  for youth and for those of us adults who appreciate the creative genius of JK Rawlings  I truly do believe this series became an instant classic upon initial publication and that it will continue to be one of those books that readers of all ages should include on their reading lists  Harry Potter is one of the most recognizable characters in literature and his personality  character  courage and determination are so much more clearly defined from the books than from the movie adaptations  Re reading the first was clearly a treat  I look forward to the re read of the others   Harry Potter is the best book series ever    Yeah  I am one of those  This is not just for Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone but the series in general I read Harry Potter long after it had become a phenomenon in itself  I was always interested in the genre but never actually noticed it somehow My introduction to Harry Potter was done by my elder sister  She loved it so much that even I grew curious  then I was t even into reading  and started reading it  Love it It is written with such passion that you can t do anything but love it  J K  Rowling is the best author ever  When the book is supposed to be funny  it is rib tickling  when it is suppossed to be spooky  you get goosebumps  when it is supposed to be emotional  you cannot help but feel sorry  when it is suppossed to be showcase the school life  you can do nothing but think of your school and how it isn t cool enough   It has all those elements and is still very sorted  That s the magic writing of J K  Rowling It has every making of a classic as it has now become  God   I miss it   5 stars This is were it all started I have a confession to make  I watched the movie first before finally reading it   a year after its last book installment came out  Yep  2008  I actually watched the movie a month after the third movie came out  Yep  2004  Why  I have this clearly misguided thought that it was a horror movie and I am not fond of that kind of genre  Blame my overactive imagination  I ve been wanting to read it after watching the flick but failed to do so  well  right away because 1  I don t have money to buy the books 2  I can t convince my father to buy the books because he s not so fond with fiction  Trust me  I have tried so hard  still  bleh 3  Our school library has a meh selections of books  and most are academics  so  bleh  No copies of Harry Potter 4  I tried borrowing from a friend   but they told me they just borrowed it from a friend  too   and they live kinda far so they can t ask once again to borrow it  view spoiler  5  I haven t discovered the power of the internet  yet  HAH   hide spoiler  So  Yeah  Why I have just read it 11 years after the first publication of the book  I finally knew someone who OWNS the book   and I freakin  borrowed it  YEP  ALL OF IT  Pathetic me and I don t have means to have the copy not until I was in College   but  I guess I don t have to  erm  justify   but I ve watched all the movies and have been fond of it ever since I ve first watched it  HAHA  I may have not read the books first  still  I think my  err  faithfulness in the series still counts  There were a lot of trials and mishaps why I haven t read the series right away even I badly want it to  It took me a week to finish the books  since I was on a semestral break then   view spoiler  I read it again when I discovered the power of the internet  hide spoiler   I read it again when I finally have my own copy of the book  It s so fun to read it again and it s like visiting my old friends  I love them all  And I want to cry  HAH I ll probably read the whole series again this week   even if I should be doing and reading different stuff  UGH   New York Times Bestselling Series New York Times Extraordinary BestsellerHarry Potter and the Sorcerer s StoneThe GistHarry Potter has been an orphan ever since he was a baby and was left on his aunt and uncles porch  He has just turned 11 which means 11 awful years living with his  family   Aunt Petunia  Uncle Vernon and his cousin Dudley have set out to do nothing but find ways to make Harry uncomfortable and unwelcome ever since he moved in  But this all changes when one day Harry receives a mysterious letter by owl to attend Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry  Uncle Vernon quickly dismisses this thought of Harry leaving to have fun and throws away the letter  Soon enough they start getting attacked by letters and after some crazy circumstances Harry gets to go to Hogwarts  When he gets there things aren t exactly as they seem  Harry soon learns he is the only person in the world that has survived from an evil dark wizard called Lord Voldemort who caused him to have the lightning bolt scar that he has on his forehead  Because Voldemort was so powerful everyone in the magical world calls him  he who must not be named  because he was so evil  Apparently  he who must not be named  perished when he tried to kill Harry and was never seen again  When Harry finally gets to Hogwarts he meets friends  learns spells  how to fly brooms and starts to learn the great destiny that has been waiting for him since the day he was born What We ThinkReviewed by The North StarI love these books  I only started reading these books last year because all of my friends were yelling at me to read them because apparently they were the best books in the world and of course I had already seen the movies so when reading the books I wasn t surprised at what happened because I knew what happened in the end  When reading the books I was instantly sucked in a flew through the first 4 books and had to wait to get the next ones because I didn t have them with me  I m going to say now that the books are a lot different from the movies  The movies are sort of true to the books but the books are better  The movies are also very entertaining so if you haven t seen them then I highly recommend doing so  J K Rowling does an amazing job of creating this whole other world where there are witches and wizards and ogres and giants and all these crazy magical creatures and you totally get hooked on the characters good and bad  Of course everyone loves Harry and that is sort of given  I actually like the character Malfoy  for those of you who have not read the book he is Harry s arch rival   I don t like him as a person because I think he is mean and cruel but as a character he s great  Every time he speaks you want to listen to what he s going to say and what actions he is going to do  Just to warn you these books are highly addicting and so if you start reading one you get so addicted you have to finish the series  Although they get more and more complicated as they go on the Harry Potter series will someday be considered a classic and I think it should be on everyone s reading list if you haven t already read it  One final note is that not only is J K  Rowlings writing addicting character wise  it is also fantastic writing  She uses great detail in describing places and you can feel if your there at the school playing Quidditch  very popular sport in the wizarding world  or just hanging in the dorms with everyone  Fantastic job J K Rowling Real Teen Rating A   Why are you still reading this go buy the book NOW   Reviewed by Dream CatcherI am a Harry Potter fanatic  This series is honestly one of the best I ve ever read  if not the best  J K  Rowling is an incredibly talented writer  The style of writing is   for lack of better words   delightfully British  and there s never too much detail or not enough  The perfect balance of dialogue and detail  which is important to have in a story  Also  the plot is the most well thought out story I ve ever read  It s ridiculous how complicated   but not in a bad way   these books get  J K Rowling puts so much into her ideas it really makes you think about how smart she must be  There are crazy references to Greek mythology and fairy tales that you could only figure out if you were seriously looking for them  It s truly mind blowing  This book in particular was not my favorite in the series  but it was indeed very good  This book is a classic  and must be read by all  If you ve watched the movie  know now that it pales in comparison to the book  with J K  Rowling s strong writing and character development  The whole world has read these books  and if you haven t  you should start with this one  It s a truly amazing read and you will not be disappointed Real Teen Rating  A    Why are you still reading this  go buy this book now  I ve heard all the talk for many  many years  but you really can t understand the awesomeness that is Harry Potter until you finally buckle down and say to yourself  I m going to read this with a clear  unbias mind   Just the first step in what many consider the greatest series of all time  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone lives up to that hype  and in its second half surpasses my wildest expectations  This is a funny  touching story that aims to please all ages and does so through characters I already love way too much  Besides the lovable Harry  you have his crew of followers  Ron  Hermione and Neville  all with their own unique voices that Rowling plays so well off of one another you d swear these are real children attempting to learn magic in a school that actually exists  You have the loyal oaf Hagrid  his bumbling persona already a staple of every scene he s in  the strong willed Professor McGonagall  I ll never look at a cat the same way again   and hovering above it all the cagey  wise Dumbeldore  who is no doubt inspired by Gandalf from The Lord of the Rings trilogy   And those are just the good associated with this story  The loathsome Malfoy and slimy Professor Snape keep your stomach in knots  all while a hooded figure looms in the forest outlining Hogwarts  I loved this book and I haven t even made mention of its wonderful plot  which puts Harry and his friends through a number of challenges  both calling upon magic and wits as a measure for passage or failure  This is the kind of setup that catapults a book into a worldwide phenomenon  It s not hard to see why Harry Potter is more popular than the Prime Minister in his native land   I could never list the books in order of how much I love them  but I can definitely tell you this is would be in the top half  if not the top book  Not only did Rowling create this incredibly magical world  she created it on such a level that anyone  adults or children  can love  From despising the Dursley s  the Malfoy s and Snape to vollowing in love with Harry  Ron and Hermione  Rowling captured the imaginations of generations and revitalized an industry which some say is  or said was  slowly loosing pertinence to the  modern world  But what is most impressive about this book and this series  to me at least  is the meticulous planning and intricate detail coordination Rowling used throughout the series  As I reread this book it really hit me once again how many hints and references there are in this first novel of the series which are  vitally  important to things which don t happen until later in the series  like Book 6 or 7 for a few things    All these little facts and passing comments have really geared me up for re reading the rest of the series  As a first novel in a series  I think it does a great job setting up the world and providing enough details to really hook the reader into the world Click here to continue reading on my blog The Oddness of Moving Things  I finally read my first Harry Potter book  I know  That took me a while  to say the least  Join the rest of the literate world  Cathy  right  Well  now I have  I bought this book on a whim at Wal Mart one day  long ago  but never got around to reading it  I really am not all that into Middle Grade fiction  so this never had much appeal to me  But  now that I ve read it  I do see what all the fuss is about  This really is an amazing story like nothing else out there This is my opinion on why this book is a classic  and will stay that way for a long time to come  this exact narrative voice  this exact way of telling this story  and this exact mixture of these particular characters can never be duplicated  It is like eating The Colonel s country fried chicken  and loving it  but coming up empty on trying to duplicate his recipe for his succulent chicken  Only this author  J K  Rowling  can do what she has done in this modern era  The only other author like her that even comes close is Charles Dickens  who surpasses her  in my opinion   and he s long dead   By the way  I detected the Dickens influence in this book  When you re not only the first to do something  but you re the only one who can do it  then nobody ever forgets you and what you did  This is what makes this novel so lasting and probably the best selling book in human history  excepting  perhaps  the Bible  which has a 2 000 year head start   Rowling is a fascinating iconic celebrity to me  she s much more interesting than any British Royal  She has an incredible gift that no one else has even had for more than 100 years  It s like she s a sort of reincarnated writing spirit in the form of a human avatar Anyway  I won t say this is my favorite book now because that wouldn t be true  I happen to have a lot of favorites  anyway  but I will be filing this one under the stack of my many favorites now  I figure this book is so great that  if I were a small child right now  I am positive it would be my most favorite book in the whole world  Certainly  if I had children  I d make them be all up in this business  and I m sure they d want to be  What a wonderful way to bond with your children For all its amazingness  I award it extra points  referencing the awarding of points to the Hogwarts Houses  if you didn t quite get that   It is a magical fantasy world for children and adults of all ages to escape into  I want to move into the Griffyndor dormitories  and I hate dormitories  That has to account for something  But  I find that I can t connect with the book the way I need to in order for it to be an ultimate favorite  It might be my age  or my problem with not completely loving Middle Grade fiction  I don t know  But  it is the best Middle Grade fiction that exists in the entire world  so you ll probably never read better than the early Harry Potter books And  I do intend to read the rest of the books in the series  for sure  Hopefully  I ll connect better with the later YA sequels    My score  4 5 out of 5 stars   I really liked it  Pure magic   This is the second time I ve read this book  The first time was 1997 when I was about nine or ten years old  I can t believe how many things I had forgotten  I have seen the movie so many times that I had begun to believe that how it happened in the movie is how it happened in the book as well  The basics of course were the same but a lot of the details were different  It was also humorous at how many of the lines in the movie came word for word out of the book  All the characters in the book felt much differently to me than what I m used to seeing in the movies  I m not really sure how to explain it but the characters in the books just seem like  more  The book characters definitely have more dementions than the movie characters do  I know most people say this but the book really is better than the movie  I also liked comparing and contrasting this read through of the book from what I can remember of the first one  I remember that I thought I was so cool because the book was so long and hard to read but I had finished anyways  This time I couldn t believe how quickly I got through the book and how easy it was to read  I couldn t understand for the longest time why they had the Harry Potter books in the young adult section of most libraries but now it is very easy to see how popular these books would be because they really make you want to keep reading and for a lot of kids they don t like the thought of reading but give them a copy of Harry Potter and they will be reading in no time  I ve read Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone more times than I can count however it s been a few years since I last read it so I ve decided to pick the whole series up again  It was slightly strange reading this one knowing what is going to come but also reassuringly familiar  The adventures  especially the ending  seem quite tame compared to later books and it now seems very unbelievable that it would have been that easy for the eleven twelve year old trio  My mum has told me that she changed the ending slightly as she read it to me as a child as she thought it d be too scary for me to hear just before bed One thing that this reading did highlight is how horrible the Dursleys are  I think that with everything else that happens their meanness becomes slightly eclipsed in later books If this had been my first reading would I have read on  I don t know  It s enjoyable but I think that it might not have been  clever  enough for me  Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone sets the background of the characters well  yet might not quite be as enjoyable for adults reading it for the first time as the later books in the series  I m glad that I grow up with it as a child  WOWWWW A person named Lora made a review on this book  and I think it is perfect to quote her  I think the reason I waited so long to read this series is because I just couldn t imagine myself enjoying reading about an eleven year old boy and his adventures at a school of wizardry  I thought it would be too juvenile for my taste  I was wrong  of course  I can honestly say that I loved every minute of this  It s a spectacular little romp with funny  courageous  and endearing characters that you can t help but love     Lora  a Goodreads member THIS Before this week  I ve always heard everyone talking about Harry Potter and how great it is and how obsessed they are and etcetc  I thought in my head   Come on  it can t be THAT good  I was wrong I can t believe I waited so long to read Harry Potter  Cannot believe it  This has to be the best book I have ever read  It is very humorous  and also very creative and     MAGICAL  I loved the little bits of humor in it and I have to say  this is definitely better than Twilight  I am so eager to read the 2nd book  I m off to finish the first movie And oh  have I mentioned that Hedwig s Theme has been on replay on both my iTunes and my head for the past week p s  Ron is my favorite character with Hermione close behind   And of course HP himself   I got this book for Christmas in 2003 and immediately thought  it s a children s book how good can it really be  I loved it  I read the book in less than a week  I ve not read such a well written  all consuming book in years  And then I found Harry Potter   breathtaking stories which combine charm  wit and imagination  It s one of those amazing stories which has you waiting on the edge of your seat for the next installment  Harry Potter spent the first ten years of his life living with his Muggle  non wizard  Aunt and Uncle and revolting  spoilt pig like cousin Dudley  They reluctantly let him live with them when his parents are murdered by the evil Lord Voldemort but they loath the fact that he is not  normal   Consequently he lives in the cupboard under the stairs and is not even recognized when he walks into a room or talks  Then  a letter arrives from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry by the giant Hagrid and plunges Harry into the world of wizards where he is famous as the only survivor of Voldemort s curse  the proof evident as a lightning bolt shaped scar on his forehead  Each book chronicles a new year at Hogwarts where Harry lives in a world of potion classes  care of magical creatures and learning to fly broomsticks in the wizard game of Quidditch  He is also involved in the death challenges Lord Voldevort constantly throws at him  aided by his best friends Ron and Hermione   all the while trying to dodge the school bully Draco Malfoy  The characters captivate you as well as the plot twists  many people can relate to one of the characters or knew an equivalent at school  The bossy but well meaning Hermione  dim witted Neville and funny Ron  The story recognizes the anxieties and situations all children go through  dealing with the bully  the mean teacher  the torment of keeping secrets and having the courage to act against injustice  Many people believe children are only interested in video games and T V  It s probably true but only because there hasn t been anything else to grasp their attention  Now there is  the magical and awe inspiring Harry Potter  With the plot twists and incredible wit it will captivate child and adult alike  The vocabulary is such that adults will not feel a loss of intelligence reading it   indeed it will not even occur to them  To date  it has won the National Book Award  the Smarties Prize  the Children s Book Award and is short listed for the Carnegie Medal   it deserves all and more   I m reading this book for the first time  which is shortly after the final film   Revisiting the series has been memorable  It has been years since I ve seen the first movie and was consistently surprised how much story was in this book  Not only was Harry new to Hogwarts  but he made the Quidditch team  battled his fame  tracked down the mysterious sorcerer s stone  and even worked to expose school faculty for their foul play  That was some busy 10 year old I think this book will always have the essence of the pure child like nature the series is remembered for  Sure  we all recall the later deeds of  you know who   but this first foray into the wizarding world introduced readers to so much of what is now considered pop culture history As a story  it is a little bit long and and detailed  but I think the fact that Rowling wrote it that way is what made the series endearing  It wasn t about shallow puppy love and magic didn t cure everything  It was a suitable start to an on going story  Wow  what to say about the book that started it all First off  THANK YOU to J K  Rowling for her amazing story and her ability to bring it all to life  It s hard to imagine the world without Harry Potter and his story  I started rereading this story  and who knows how many times I ve read it since it was published   in anticipation of the first chapter of the final movie  I never imagined it would come to this  though can remember fearing something horrible would happen to me  or Ms  Rowling  before the story was completed  I don t have a whole lot to say about the first book  It s perfection  It s simplistic  It s magical  Oh  and totally a topic for a different time  but why on Earth  did the US distributors insist on changing it to Sorceror s Stone rather than Philosopher s Stone  That just doesn t make any sense  I read this book in it s original UK paperback edition  and there s no feasible reason why it was changed    but whatever  Love  love  LOVE    Now I just have to see if there s enough time for me to get all the way through the next 6 books before November 19th   I may just skip ahead to the final book   I decided to do a Harry Potter reread session because I ve got to the point of feeling completely read out and not being excited about anything that was on my TBR shelves  For me reading Harry Potter again was a bit like going back to the reading equivalent of a comfort blanket  For me the first Harry Potter book is the book that got me back into reading fiction after spending a good chunk of my teen years not knowing what to read  It was like revisiting old friends and the experience of reading a book I know so well was really interesting  For me this book while not the darkest or most exciting of the series really sets up the world and the characters and gives you a real grounding in a world you become completely immersed in  I found myself comparing the book to the film by picking out bits that hadn t been transferred over to the film and reminding myself of small details that I d forgotten  For me the character of the piece has to be Hermione  I had forgotten how much of an outcast she was at the start  hiding behind her cleverness to try and mask the fact that she is actually quite a lonely soul  I loved the Weasley s from the first moment they stepped onto the page and I m now sadly at the age where I wanted to mother Harry from the moment you heard how horribly the Dursley s had treated him  I m hoping to reread the entire series over the next few months  I cannot wait as retreading this first instalment was a pleasure    Freshman University Student Decided to Reread Harry Potter First Time Read In Arabic from October 2004 June 2005  back when I was in grade 4  Man I was such a slow reader Harry Potter is surprisingly one of my first ever reads  My copy looked something like thisSecond Read on December 2013 Finished in five days due to my ultra busy university work as an architecture student And my copy looks like this  DThe decision on re reading the series came after the epic fail or resisting the wonderful new US 15th anniversary box set  And I just couldn t own the box and leave it unread  It feels wrong   I ve Overheard Your Theory Nostalgia s For Geeks  I Guess Sir if You Say So  Some of Us Just Like To Read  I guess we are all well aware that Harry Potter is a Children s series at least the first couple of books  So at some parts I ll say my reactions I got when I was a kid and the reaction I had now as a university student  The Boy Who Lived  When I was a kid my mum was not fond with the idea of me reading books about witches  wizards and magic crafts  she told me if you got disturbed leave it at once  I m going to shamefully admit that Miss McGonagall as a cat scared the hell out of me when I was a kid  and Uncle Vernon s reaction  I got scared but proceeded because I got excited too  Present reaction to this  NONE Beside getting scared in the past let s talk about what I used to feel about the characters Uncle Vernon When I was a kid  I wished if Voldemort could just kill them but my PRESENT reaction  MAN  Uncle Vernon has such a sense of humor   I can t believe I could not see it   Dudley  he s not as EVIL as I used to see  he s just a total brat  Something I may have in common with  PAfter Harry s Birthday  Hagrid s journey to the banks and Diagon Alley  I was so into it and wished if I got a list of such demands in my first year of university  wand  pet  cool book names  Not the uniform part though   Instead of T Squares  Architecture Scale  Triangles  Canson Papers etc    I can waste all writing characters on the stuff that I had to get  During the Diagon Alley Harry gets to meet the dude who shook his hand out of nowhere  Man when he did it my reaction as a kid  TELL HIM HE IS A WIZARD TELL HIM MAN  WHY JUST LEAVE   But My present reaction was likePEDO ALERT   Moving Forward  FUCK  I got back that feeling of  TAKE ME TO HOGARTS  PLEAAAAAAAASE  I would trade my university s cats for these  But you know  This ain t even High SchoolAlso the fact that Hogwarts first year classes are way more interesting than my architecture classes I won t cry about the food that Hogwarts provide  because I love the stupid tiny cafeteria in my campus but I would like to say that I pay for it unlike Ron  Which brings us to mean MalfoyHis joked were too mean but sometimes I had to giggle on some  But he was too rude but yet NOWHERE close to that fucking incest Joffrey Baratheon  Weird thing I would like to share  on a tired day I ve mistakenly read Hermione  HEROIN  Which made me feel a little bit like trashor awesomely COOL But my thoughts haven t changed towards Quidditch  it still bores me  but I wish if I could get that broom stick and fly Last part  Headmaster Dumbledore  image error  That bitch is crazier than me  he opens the year by speech which is nothing but a tiddly widdly brambles   I was like I guess I ll conclude the review at this point  Bottom line re reading Harry Potter gave all those childish dreams and memories crap which I really enjoyed  also I ll not forget that it took my mind off from the pressure I m having in university which was WORTH IT  Yeah  Can t wait to re read the whole series and rediscover the amazing world created by the one and only JK Rowling    I first read this book from August 19  2011 to September 2nd  2011  The current dates are from rereads  This review is from 2011   Lets start with saying Harry Potter is my all time favorite series and I cannot even begin to explain what the series has done for me  FYI I rated all 7 books with 5 stars  and I rarely give 5 stars  Saying that I read the series once they were all published and once all of the movies were already released  it s a given that I probably had already seen some of the movies  1st  2nd  and 4th  so they weren t as enjoyable as I already knew what was going to happen  though there were things in the books that weren t in the movies Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone is the first novel in the Harry Potter series written by J  K  Rowling and featuring Harry Potter  a young wizard  It describes how Harry discovers he is a wizard  makes close friends and a few enemies at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry  JK Rowling describes how  with the help of his friends  Harry stops an attempted comeback by the dark wizard Lord Voldemort  who killed Harry s parents  but failed to kill Harry  when Harry was just one year old  I don t re read books  i ve never tried it because i didn t see the point of it  But today i was thinking about my all time favorite books  or books that had and impact on me and thought of this one  It s one of a few i m thinking about reading again along with The House of the Spirits and probably The Hunger Games  I have many many books to read in the future and think that the list might grow a little longer after i find new favorites  This book  particularly changed me  in some way  This is the kind of story that you finish feeling good about everything and grabbing spoons from your grandmother s kitchen and start annoying her with your  magic tricks   I was 15 at the time i read this whole series and felt like i was 8  And that was awesome  Today  when i m in college and going through the disappointments  joys  and crazy days of my life    I miss this books  i miss Hermione  Hagrid  Hedwig  EVERY CHARACTER  It s weird being 18 and missing being a kid when your basically still one I m waiting for the new book my dear J K  Rowling s publishing this year with high hopes  I m late into the game  ten years late into the game  When I was seven  everyone was reading Harry Potter  I m sure that children who could barely talk were reading Harry Potter  I  however  was bored to death by the second page  I blamed the book  when really  at that age for me  it was all books  So  I never made another attempt at reading a Harry Potter book until  well  earlier this week I m a huge fan of the movies  at least  as huge as a non book fan can be  I felt the need to suppress this enjoyment because I felt guilty  I couldn t shake off the feeling that I was constantly being judged for watching the movies but having no interest in the books And then Deathly Hallows came out in theaters  just a few weeks ago I was interested  to say in the least  of how it all ended  Sure  I ve skimmed Wikipedia and Harry Potter Wiki articles  but it didn t fit with the whole picture  Plus  as doing the aforementioned activity taught me  there was a whole lot to the books that the movies couldn t convey or just wouldn t mention So I borrowed the Sorcerer s Stone I am ten years late into the game  but no book has ever given me such a warm feeling as I read it  No book has ever brought me such joy  and rarely does a book cause me to giggle or even full out laugh  This book did I am not giving it five stars because of its  literary achievement  or usage of strong language to convey deep messages  although I m sure a better fan than I could   I won t say that  I completely understand why many adults I have encountered find the books to be a waste of time  perhaps that s why I m enjoying them so much  because they re literally a fantastic experience  they re interesting and the world that J K  Rowling illustrates with her words becomes more complex through each chapter and book I suppose I am giving Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone five stars simply for the reasoning that I genuinely enjoyed it  Nothing more and nothing less  a billion  most likely literally  people have said it before me  these books are great and gosh darn it  leave me alone  I want to get back to reading  Like the Harry Potter nerd that I am  I re read all 7 Harry Potter books in preparation for the final movie  The series is not perfect  It is flawed by uneven writing  slow pacing at various points  lack of character development in some characters  most notably Ron and Ginny Weasley   and one dimensional romantic attachments  Literary snobs who look down their noses aren t altogether wrong  That said  I love Harry Potter  These books stand in a class by themselves  They are compulsively readable  evoking a magical world that is believable and compelling  They maintain internal integrity  express emotional depth  explore universal themes  and come as close to Truth and Meaning as most adult fiction I have delighted in the years of Harry Potter  Along with millions of other readers  I have speculated about Snape s loyalty  Dumbledore s past  Neville s future  and Luna s love life  I have dressed up as Mad eye Moody  Ron Weasley  Mrs  Weasley  and Hermione as a cat  I have stood in line for books and gone to movies with friends dressed variously as the squid  the portrait of Serious Black s mother  the entire Weasley family  Rita Skeeter  a dementer  Fred and George  Peeves the poltergeist  Mrs  Trelawney  and the snitch  I have made bets about Harry s O W L  grades  Lupin s sexual orientation  and Snape s allegiance  I have taken quizzes to find out which house I m in and which character I m most like  I have laughed and cried and marveled Here s to you  J K  Rowling  Mischief managed   The Sorcerer s Stone has some amazing world building  I m the type of person who wants to know everything about a world in books  I want to know the hows and the whys of that world  Obviously I want to know everything I can about this world  Rowling does a really good job with her world building  There is quite a bit of information in this book but it s just enough  It gives you just enough understand the basics of this world  While I would have been perfectly happy with pages of info dumping  it s probably for the best that it s not there  It gives a good sample of what is to come I ve read this book  and series  quite a few times  I guess I ve never paid attention to the foreshadowing but it s a nice touch  There are references to the dragon at Gringotts  Snape telling Harry about the bezoar  as well as other things  It s the type of thing that makes rereading the books a huge delight  You can pick up on stuff you ve never paid attention to before The characters are undoubtedly the best part of the series  Harry is a fantastic protagonist  He s got a decent mix of good qualities and flaws  It makes him a more rounded and realistic character  Harry wants justice but he s completely reckless to gain that justice  the Rememberall incident   Ron is just completely loveable  His humor and awkwardness make him so real  I was surprised that Hermione annoyed me at the beginning of the book  I don t remember her being that bad  She probably annoyed me because she reminded me of me  I would most definitely be a Hermione type character taking everything far too seriously  Even though they aren t in this book too much  the Weasley twins will forever be my favorite characters  Their humor comes so easily and I think it adds heart and warmth to the story  Obviously the Phelps twins play a huge part in my love for the Weasley twins You can t go wrong with the underlying themes of the story  truth  friendship  loyalty  courage  They re so simple but the simple stuff is what we sometimes need to be reminded of  It definitely has the qualities of a lasting story The bottom line  This is children s literature at its best  You ve probably heard of this book already  and if you haven t read it yet I think you ll enjoy it This is a story about Harry and his two new friends settling down for their first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry only to discover that they have a part to play in the downfall of the evil Sssh  You Know Who  You will like Harry Potter  He s shy and self doubting and puts up with a lot from his awful aunt Petunia and uncle Vernon and fat cousin Dudley  Poor Harry lost his parents  supposedly in a car crash  when he was a baby and that was when he received the strange lightning shaped scar across his forehead  Ever since then he has slept in the cupboard under the stairs at the Dursleys  perfectly normal house in Privet Drive and the best thing he has to look forward to is starting at the local secondary school next term   well away from Dudley who will be going to his father s old  expensive school  Smeltings  But  other people know a lot more about Harry than Harry does himself  That lightning shaped scar is a matter of enormous interest and Harry is about to discover that he has a lot of friends  and enemies  in a rather different kind of world from the one he was brought up in  This is a book about magic  but there s plenty of reality  Settling into a new school  making friends  learning who to trust and who not to trust and when to obey school rules and when to overlook them  There s a great deal of humour in the book  You might find the magic funny   visit Diagon Alley to purchase all your Hogwart s kit   but there is strong evil magic too and you won t doubt the courage that Harry has to show in the final chapter  Written in a strong narrative style with straightforward but not over simplified language there is enough in this plot to think about whether you are Harry s age or Sssh  You Know Who   Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone by J  K  RowlingAward Winning Literature5 Stars  It Was AmazingHarry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone  is  obviously  one of the very popular Harry Potter books  and when the last movie of the series came out in the summer of 2011 many said a huge phase in their lives had now come to a close  It is clear  by the impressive reviews and bundles of awards that this book is extremely gripping and has many fans  The first book of the series  in particular  reeled in about ten different awards according to the website the Leaky Cauldron  including the British Book Awards 1997 Book of the Year and Whitaker s Platinum Book Award 2001  This book by J  K  Rowling is about a boy called Harry Potter  who had lived with his horrid aunt  uncle and cousin in England ever since his parents had died years before in what he had been told was a car accident  but was actually an attack from a world famous Dark wizard  Lord Voldemort  Harry had been left only with a lightning shaped scar on his forehead as proof of the attack  along with a memory of a flashing green light  However  what this story is really about is how your home isn t always where you live  it s where you fit in the most and are happy  Harry finds a place  where  at last  he feels safe and like he belongs there  Though he grew up with the Dursleys  the Dursleys were abusive  mean  and neglectful of Harry  and never let him be a part of their  perfectly normal   Rowling  1  family  Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry was home to Harry Potter  though he was already a celebrity and knew no one there  everyone acknowledged his presence and tried to be friends with him  which to Harry was foreign because Dudley  his cousin  had always made that impossible  Harry showed courage  an expected trait of him by almost everyone at the school because of his one time  defeat  of Lord Voldemort  Over the course of his first year  he developed a trio of friends  him  Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger  with whom he investigated and talked to and took advice from  His courage inspires others to be even closer to him  as he protected Hermione from a monster and immediately gained her nose in the air  know it all attitude in his favor  When he is caught breaking the rules  he was rewarded  unusually  by a professor for exceptional abilities and conduct  I rated this book a 5 out of 5  because I really enjoyed reading it  possibly because I read it following a very bland piece of literature but nevertheless great writing  It was a fast read  completely appropriate for people younger than me  The vocabulary  though on the simpler side  was descriptive and made a clear picture in the mind  Now  after reading the book  I love how I can t remember which parts I watched in the actual movie and which parts I imagined  For example  in the very beginning of the story when the headmaster of Hogwarts is delivering Harry to the Dursleys  Hagrid arrives and brings us Harry whom the story revolves around   A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them  It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight  it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky   and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them    Rowling  14  I enjoyed reading what everyone else had set a high bar for  as it reached my expectations I would recommend Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone to any boy or girl or woman or man  because even though it s an easy read  it s a good one  It contains levels of understanding for many groups of people and is appropriate for everyone  The adventures Harry Potter faces are appealing to me  and so I recommend this read to anyone interested in journeys and finding out where home really is and expectations  In addition  I have also watched the movies and have yet to experience the feeling of  THE BOOKS ARE WAY BETTER THAN THE MOVIES   that my friends have expressed to me recently  and I m glad to be finally reading these books  I look forward to reading the rest of the Harry Potter series in the near future   Harry Potter Book Awards   The Leaky Cauldron   Harry Potter News  Books and Films   The Leaky Cauldron  N p   n d  Web  30 Dec  2011    The phenomenon of Harry Potter began with The Sorcerer s Stone  Instead of reviewing the overall book  as we have all read the books  I am going to go over some of my favorite events in the book  in order  and a few reasons why I love this book The Vanishing GlassIt is hard to not love this part of the novel  Dudley finally gets what he deserves  This is also really the first time we  the readers  get see Harry s  magic  in the making  even though you are given history of  unexplained events  Harry has been through  you now get to actually see it  You cannot help but laugh at the image in your head of Dudley and Piers falling  through  the glass and into the boa constrictor s cage  It is also hard not to imagine the pandemonium that ensued   people throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits    I think of stampedes  Harry Gets His First WandHarry s first wand I believe is one of the most important events in the entire Harry Potter Series  for many reasons  Most obviously  he is now officially a wizard student   he has the means to do some magic  Second  this intertwines the threads and mystery between him and Voldemort more   It so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand  gave another feather   just one other  It is very curious indeed that you should be destined for this wand when its brother   why  its brother gave you that scar  Harry  Ron and Hermione Meet The door of the compartment slid open and the youngest redheaded boy came in    Without this trio the entire series would not be the same  if even exist  thus making it  to me  THE MOST important event in the entire series  From this meeting true friendship is formed  tested  and molded into something that reverberates throughout the novels  While each character is strong in their own way  together they are able to accomplish many things that they wouldn t have otherwise  Even though Ron and Harry get on right from the beginning  and Hermione not so much  their ease with each other is foretelling for the entire series  Their first conversations are also really important to pay attention to  You get a sense of Ron and where he comes from  his family  coming from a wizard family and the expectations pressure he thus feels     I m the sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts  You could say I ve got a lot to live up to      Everyone expects me to do as well as the others  but if I do  it s no big deal  because they did it first  I think it is also very important to point out that while Harry never had any money and even though he just found out he could buy anything his heart desires  he does not put himself above Ron  who s family is not a well off  in fact poor      Harry  who had never had anything to share before or  indeed  anyone to share it with  It was a nice feeling  sitting there with Ron  eating their way through all Harry s pasties  cakes and candies    We cannot of course forget Hermione  She enters the cart with an air of knowledge  You can tell right away that she uses her knowledge to make up for the fact that she comes from a Muggle born family  which we discover later on  Hermione s  loving  side comes out  in a way  when she informs Ron that he has dirt on his nose   while her statement doesn t come across as  motherly  her it is great foreshadowing  not only to her relationship with Ron  but also to her role in the friendship   she takes care of the boys in a way  Harry Stands Up To MalfoyWhile Harry has already confronted Malfoy and his one sided mind earlier before they were sorted  Harry puts his words into actions when Malfoy flies away with Neville s Remembrall  This scene in particular shows us that Harry will always stand up for what is right  even if he could  and sometimes does  get into trouble  A real statement about his character It goes without saying that there are many other important scenes in the first Harry Potter book  If you really think about it  pretty much everything about this book is important as it sets the stage  J K  Rowling did an amazing job in every aspect  plot creation  character development  details  hints  foreshadowing  etc  I dare you not to fall in love with Harry Potter and his world after reading this book   La mia prima lettura in tedesco e stata una faticata  nonostante conoscessi oramai il libro a memoria  E  nonostante conoscessi oramai il libro a memoria  ancora mi e sembrato bellissimo e ancora ho divorato gli ultimi capitoli come se non sapessi benissimo come va a finire La parte iniziale si conferma la meno bella  o comunque quella meno capace di attrarre un pubblico adulto  Il clima e ancora troppo da  storiella per bambini  e la vicenda abbastanza standard  piccoletto occhialuto senza amici negletto dalla famiglia che non lo capisce   sebbene gia l ironia della Rowling si faccia sentire  Poi iniziano ad arrivare le lettere misteriose  frotte di missive che scendono dal camino  si infilano sotto la porta  sfuggono a qualunque controllo e qualcosa inizia a solleticare la curiosita   Tempo poche pagine e ci stamo gia intrufolando in Diagon Alley accompagnati da un mezzo gigante barbuto  dove compreremo libri di magia al Ghirigoro e una bacchetta magica su misura dal sinistro Olivander  ci perderemo tra i cunicoli sotterranei della banca dei maghi  accompagnati da scorbutici e infidi folletti  E poi c e il binario 9 e 3 4  l espresso per Hogwarts  Hogwarts    impossibile descrivere l atmosfera  la magia comunicata da questo libro  Harry Potter e Harry Potter  Punto  E pazienza se e diventato un fenomeno di massa  pazienza se ne hanno tratto deri film orrendi  Resta una bella storia di fantasia  sicuramente in debito verso illustri predecessori  ma comunque scritta in modo appassionante e ironico  con personaggi realistici  ben tratteggiati e mai banali  un mistero congeniato molto meglio che in tanti libri per adulti  scritto per i ragazzini ma in grado di conquistare anche i grandi perche la sua autrice sa prendere i ragazzini sul serio  Inhalt Harry Potter halt sich fur einen normalen Jungen  Als Vollwaiser lebt er bei seinem Onkel Vernon  Seiner Tante Petunia und seinem Cousin Dudley  Doch die Dursleys mogen den Jungen nicht und haben keinerlei Verwendung fur ihn und deshalb lebt er auch im alten Schrank unter der Treppe  Harry selbst hat sich damit abgefunden  weder geliebt noch gemocht zu werden  Seine Eltern starben  als er noch ein Baby war und seitdem lebt er auch bei seinen grasslichen Verwandten  Doch eines Tages scheint sich fur Harry plotzlich alles zu andern  Zu seinem elften Geburtstag erhalt er einen Brief  Absender ist Hogwarts  eine Schule fur Hexerei und Zauberei  So erfahrt Harry  dass er gar nicht so normal ist  wie er dachte  Ihm eroffnet sich mit einem Schlag eine komplett neue Welt  Eine Welt  in der jeder Harry kennt  denn dort ist er beruhmt  Wieso er das ist  mochte er im ersten Schuljahr herausfinden   Gemeinsam mit seinen neuen Freunden Ron und Hermione macht er sich auf die Suche nach diesem Geheimnis  Und dabei entdecken sie gleich noch ein Zweites  rund um den Stein des Weisen Meinung Ich habe mich Jahre lang gegen Harry Potter gewehrt  Dem anfanglichen Hype habe ich nachgegeben  indem ich diesen Teil im Deutschen begonnen habe   Ich las ihn nie fertig  im Gegenteil  ich brach das Buch nach ein paar Seiten ab  Seit diesem Moment war mir klar  dass J K  Rowlings Bucher und ich nie Freunde werden wurden  Dachte ich Es wurde mit den Jahren jedoch immer schwerer  die Bucher weiterhin abzulehnen  da der halbe Bekanntenkreis die Bucher nicht nur gelesen  sondern geliebt hatte  Irgendwann fand ich dann diese hubsche Signature Edition und dachte mir  ich gebe dem ganzen im Englischen noch einmal eine Chance  Es hat keine drei Tage gedauert  da hatte ich das Buch durch  Hatte mir mal jemand gesagt  ich wurde ein Harry Potter Buch verschlingen  ich hatte es ihm nie geglaubt und ich kann es bis jetzt auch nicht wirklich glauben  Ich weiss bis jetzt auch nicht genau  was es war  Rowlings flussiger Schreibstil  der mich das Debakel der deutschen Fassung vergessen liess  oder diese zuckersusse Welt  in die sie einen entfuhrt  voller Fantasie  Emotionen  Humor und Spannung  Vor allem ihre Zeichnung der Charaktere hat mich begeistert  Angefangen von der Familie Weasley  die man einfach ins Herz schliessen muss  uber die Familie Dursley  denen man gegenuber einfach nur Abneigung empfinden kann  bis hin zu Professor Snape  den sie zu einer interessanten und zwiespaltigen Personlichkeit formt  Zu meinen personlichen Favoriten zahlen die Weasley Zwillinge George und Fred  die mich durch mehr als eine Aussage amusiert haben und Hagrid  der Unwesen liebende Riese  Eins habe ich jedenfalls gelernt  Ich werde nie wieder vorschnell uber ein Buch urteilen Fazit Die Folgebande stehen im Regal  bereit gelesen zu werden  During the holidays it is important to take time out from your busy reading schedule to read the important things   Harry Potter  This past weekend I felt the urge to pull Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone off the shelf and fall in love with the books all over again  And since everyone has either read them  seen the movies  or heard of them I won t give a synopsis but rather  I ll share my first experience of reading this glorious book  I first heard about this book while doing research for a paper on censorship  This Harry Potter kid kept on popping up on the banned book lists  I mentioned this to my sister in law and she told me it was all the rage and she mentioned that I might like them  Well that Christmas I received the first book in the series  That night I was suppose to be packing for a trip  so instead of packing  I started reading  and I didn t stop reading until I realized it was really late and really needed to pack  Within 24 hours of receiving the book  I was hooked  and needed to get my hands on the second book   and so the journey continued  Kicking off my Harry Potter reread  I started the first book  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone t  It almost makes me giggle how tiny this book is  My version is around 380 pages      a mere baby compared to The Order of the Phoenix at 900 pages  I m on page 147  Harry is just about to get sorted into his house  There hasn t been much action yet  just a sniffy Hermione and the start of many descriptions of how green Harry s eyes are In my opinion  the Dursleys don t get enough screen time in the film  Mr  Dursley s antics to keep Harry out of Hogwarts are hilarious in the book  Also  I m going to try and restrain myself from comparing the books and the movies  but I do like how The Sorcerer s Stone movie takes lines word for word out of the book  It s much more accurate than the latter movies More thoughts later        I finished The Sorcerer s Stone in less than 36 hours  I was reading this in the atrium outside of one of my classes and I got some weird looks from two boys  I proceeded to mentally give them the finger   wait until I break out my Sex with the Queen book  Can I just say that I am so jealous of those people who were infinitely smarter than me and started reading this series as soon as it came out  I actually read them for the first time last summer  If I enjoyed them as much as I did at 18  I can t imagine how much more amazing they could have been at 7  This is still one of the books that I wish I could read for the very first time again  It s easy to tell that this was a children s young adult book  J K  very effectively has the writing style  grow up  with Harry and the readers as well  I loved re meeting the characters that we see evolve through the following years  I also noticed a lot of points and details that maybe went unanswered in the first book  yet resurface and are answered in later books  such as why Hagrid was expelled from Hogwarts   It s nice to see clues tie up neatly  I don t know how many of you have ever read any of The Baby Sitter Club books  but those 13 and 11 year old girls never had adult supervision and did crazy things like solve mysteries and medically diagnose children all while never telling any adults what was going on  Harry  Ron and Hermione remind me of The Baby Sitters Club in that sense   they are some of the sneakiest kids ever  It ends up making Dumbledore and the other professors look irresponsible  While reading through the book and thinking about the series as a whole  something occurred to me that I find interesting  When people are asked who their favorite characters from the entire series are  you get answers like Ron  Snape  Luna  the Weasely twins  my personal favorites   or Lupin  Very rarely is somebody s favorite character Harry   you know  the namesake of the series  Why is that  Sometimes I think that Harry is actually the most overlooked and forgettable character  Is that bad writing character development on J K  s part  Is Harry just a so so hero  I m not sure what to make of this  Thoughts  I enjoyed re reading this one book more than anything else I ve done this month  On to The Chamber of Secrets   This is the Book that renewed my interest in reading  As a young Child I remember loving books and stories  What I remember enjoying most though  is being read to  not reading for myself  Sometime in middle school I more or less gave up reading all together  why waste hours reading  when I could get the story in 90 minutes on the TV  I was a latecomer to the Wonderful Wizarding World of Harry Potter  When I began reading them  it was the summer before my freshmen year of college  The Half Blood Prince had just been published and my friends were losing their freaking minds  I vividly remember one of the actually breaking down and crying at work during a particularly emotional part near the end of that book  No Spoiler  But you all know the part I am referring to   It was then that I decided I would give these silly children s books a shot  By the end of that summer  after devouring all of the available 6 books  I was desperate for more  A couple of years later I found myself at a Barnes and Noble at 12 00 am waiting in line with the most interesting group of people imaginable  In addition to the expected generic people dressed as Gryffindor or Slytheryn students  there was a 300 pound Snape and a 90 lb Hagrid    In any case  I know that none of this actually has to do with the book itself  I say all of that to say  this is the book that opened the flood gates of reading for me  Before I read it  I would have told you that I hated to read  Reading is now one of the things I most enjoy    and I blame this book P S  If you  like me  enjoy being read to as much as you enjoy reading to yourself  Stephen Fry and Jim Dale both voice excellent renditions of each of the 7 books  I have heard both versions and think they are both amazing  I highly recommend them   TGFJKR  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone is the beginning of something magical and full of wonder for a reader of any age  J K  Rowling started an amazing journey with this first book following the survival of one boy who grew up with humble beginnings to be brought into a magical world filled with wizards  witches  trolls  dragons  and much more  Harry James Potter s life has always been an interesting one growing up at 4 Privet Drive  Living under the stairs with his Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia with their precious son Dudley  While his life may not seem interesting  Harry is able to do unimaginable things and it s like magic  from growing out his hair to talking to snakes and it isn t until his eleventh birthday that he discovers the truth  Harry Potter is a wizard and not just any ordinary wizard but he is the Boy Who Lived  I was very impressed by the simplicity and complex story line that Rowling weaved together in the first installment of the Harry Potter books  I truly thought that this book would be boring and too easy to read and yet I was proven wrong because I couldn t put the thing down and had to read it until I finished  I am so glad to have listened to my friends who love Harry Potter and began reading because after this first book I ve become so hooked   And so  the obsession with Harry Potter begins  Re reading this book and writing a review is nothing less than a transport through time for me  As a teenager  I had read nothing like Rowling s books before  and I had never been sucked into a story the way this tornado of a series pulled me in The book had everything   drama  humor  morals  adventure  Who wouldn t fall in love with an ugly duckling story of a magical boy who feels like a freak in the non wizarding world  And learning about the whole magical community with Harry as he starts magic school is like finally taking a class that I could enjoy  Who knew I could gain magical knowledge and have fun at the same time My laughter erupted like a volcano within the first chapter of meeting Fred and George Weasley  Lucky for me  there were plenty more instances of those twins  pranks and jokes  keeping my ribs cracking every time they were in a scene  Admittedly  most all of the characters were loveable and memorable  It s unbelievable how easily I memorized all of the minor characters  names when I barely remembered the names of my own classmates in school  That shows how much I cared about Harry s friends  and how little for my own Some of my favorite words of wisdom came directly from this book  particularly from Dumbledore   the never ending fountain of knowledge   It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies  but just as much to stand up to our friends    Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself   and my personal favorite   It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live   There are plenty more where that came from in the following books  but these words are part of what hooked me like a flapping fish It s the first of the long series that captivated my heart  as well as hundreds and thousands of others  Who knew one little wizard could enchant the world with his quest for learning the truth about his parents  and defeating the evil Lord Voldemort  he who must not be named   EZRead Staffer  Amelia Updated   1 Jan 2014I made myself a Harry Potter  Down the Memory Lane reading challenge as I m suddenly overwhelmed with nostalgia and I believe nothing makes a better cure than reading the entire series again  So  here I am The last time I read Philosopher s Stone was ages ago    back when I was in secondary school  I think  Not because it s the least favourite of mine    it is not    but mainly because I hadn t owned the book until now   gasps  Yes  it is true  The first two books of the series were borrowed from my friend and I m not sure why it hadn t occurred to me to buy the books as soon as possible but I hadn t  Until now  that is  Anyway  this book is still as good as I remember it was  For a moment    before I dived into the story    I was afraid I would discover that I had outgrown the series and it was with the greatest fear that I approached the book  Turned out I worried myself unnecessarily  JK Rowling is still an enchanting storyteller as I vividly remember  By the end of this book  I couldn t get enough of her words and the world building still left me in awe and wonder    just like reading it for the first time  And I believe it would always remain to be so even with the years to come  I m glad I decided to read the book again  I forgot how funny Ron could be  Get this    Ron is hilarious  It s not like I haven t known it already  but to be reminded how awesome Ron actually was is like receiving the best wake up call ever  I like Harry but that s a given  Who doesn t  right  But Ron    he s something else altogether  My favourite scene of his is when the trio had to play a part in the life size chess game   Yes     said Ron softly   it s the only way   I ve got to be taken   NO   Harry and Hermione shouted  That s chess   snapped Ron   You ve got to make some sacrifices  I ll make my move and she ll take me   that leaves you free to checkmate the king  Harry   But    Do you want to stop Snape or not   Ron    Look  if you don t hurry up  he ll already have the Stone  There was nothing else for it  Ready   Ron called  his face pale but determined   Here I go   now  don t hang around once you ve won   There you have it    Ron went badass and all  If anybody ever doubted him as a Gryffindor  well  take that you non believers  The lines from the Sorting Hat s song   Their daring  nerve and chivalry  Set Gryffindors apart  couldn t have rung any truer    for Ron  for Hermione and for Harry ultimately  God  I love the trio senseless  Dumbledore  on the other hand  had in me in tears from the very beginning  Every time he appeared  my eyes would immediately start to swell up with tears  Maybe because due to the fact that his life is timed starting from this book onward  it made me appreciate him more  I honestly couldn t wait    and somewhat disappointed    that Dumbledore only appeared a little in this book  I know it s ridiculous to feel so  but I couldn t help it  I miss reading about Dumbledore s calm demeanor especially in time of conflicts and uncertainty  I miss his penetrating gaze  I miss his blue  blue eyes and yes    I miss his half moon glasses   chuckles  My favourite scene of his is when Dumbledore paid Harry a visit at the hospital wing  Absolute favourite  Again  I m glad I read the book  I think I ll watch the movie before I move on to the second book  a part The thing about Harry Potter is that kids understand him  There is no kid on the planet who  at one time or another  didn t feel like he shouldn t belong to his family  or wish that there was something special about him and that someone someday would take him away and show him a whole new world  And that s exactly what happens to Harry Potter In addition to kids being able to identify with Harry Potter  the book s full of great  believable characters and wonderful adventures  Some of them reminded me a lot of some older Roald Dahl books I ve read  Both Rowling and Dahl are masters of explaining strange new worlds  and making us believe that they really could exist  For those of us who love weirdness  this is great I have to say  my favorite part of this book was the end  Without giving anything away  I will say that Rowling manages to slip in some great lessons and some touching  tear jerking moments  Not sure I would have cried over the same parts when I was young  but now that I m old  I understand why some of those touching moments are so poignant Not just for kids  and a great read all around  I can t even begin to describe how much I love harry Potter  It s not just a book it s a legacy  I started harry potter when I was five and I m 12 now  And I am convinced that when I m 80 years old I ll be sitting in my chair reading Harry Potter and the spine will be falling apart and when my family asks  after all this time   I will sau  Always   if you re a harry potter nut you ll get that reference   I owe Jo my childhood and probably the rest of my entire life  She created a world of magic and made millions of people believe in a world and gave them a second home or maybe even a first in a single book  If I could do that for one person I would feel so so blessed  But she did it for millions  Harry Potter is one of those stories where you can run along side of the characters every step of the way  From pulling pranks with the twins  to finding horcruxes and killing voldemort with Harry  Ron and Hermione  it never ends  J K Rowling said  wether you return by big screen or the pages  hogwarts wil always be there to welcome you home   And it s true  when I finished the last book it felt like I was leaving my home  except I knew I d be coming back  Maybe not next year  but I d just grab a time turner  turn back the clock and go back to the beginning and start over again   When so much has been said about the fantasy novels starring the one and only  Harry Potter   cue screaming fans   what is left  Here s a quick over view of the book  Wizard boy s parents are murdered when he s young  He s dropped off at his horrible aunt and uncle s house  He turns 11  discovers he s a wizard and is whisked off to school for the beginning of his wizarding life  While he s there he discovers he s famous  But why  It all has to do with his lightening shaped scar on his forehead and his vanquishing the dark lord Voldemort all when he was a little boy  He has many close calls with his two BFFs Ron and Hermione and in the end has to once again overcome Voldemort in a struggle for the Sorcer s Stone  Now I want to talk about the voice of the book  Jim Dale  The man is an audio MACHINE  I am astounded at his vocal abilities  He is one of the best book readers I ve listened to and really emotes the feeling behind the words  His is the voice I hear when I read the books to myself I suggest this book to young adults regardless of their age  The beauty of Rowling s writing style is her language speaks to all ages as well as the story line  Her characters  even in this first installment of a 7 book series  are well developed and the thinking as well as language ascribed to them reflects their young age  This book has already proven its universal appeal and I feel it will continue to impress all ages of audiences for years to come  If you haven t  READ IT  or listen to it   It s worth your time      Aber was geschah mit Vol    tschuldigung   ich meine Du weisst schon wer    Gute Frage  Harry  Ist verschwunden  Wie vom Erdboden verschluckt        Die meisten von uns denken  dass er immer noch irgendwo da draussen ist  aber seine Macht verloren hat  Zu schwach  um weiterzumachen  Denn etwas an dir  Harry  hat ihm den Garaus gemacht  In jener Nacht geschah etwas  mit dem er nicht gerechnet hatte   weiss nicht  was es war    aber etwas an dir hat er nicht gepackt  und das war s     S  65 f    Erster Satz   Mr  und Mrs  Dursley im Ligusterweg Nummer 4 waren stolz darauf  ganz und gar normal zu sein  sehr stolz sogar   Inhalt  Harry Potter  Jeder Zauberer und jede Hexe  kennt seinen Namen  Jedes magische Wesen weiss  was dieser kleine Junge  gerade noch ein Baby  fur die ganze Zauberwelt geleistet hat  Er hat alle gerettet und den bosesten und dunkelsten Zauberer  genannt Lord Voldemort  gestoppt  seiner Macht Einhalt geboten und damit etlichen Zauberern und Hexen das Leben gerettet  Harry Potter  Jeder kennt diesen Namen  jeder weiss um die wichtige Rolle dieses einen Jungen  im Kampf gegen das Bose  nur Harry selbst  weiss nichts von alledem  Nach dem Tod seiner Eltern  welche im Kampf gegen den dunklen Lord fielen  wuchs Harry in einer ganz normalen Welt auf  ohne jegliche Magie  11 Jahre nach dem grossen Ereignis  Harry hat keine Ahnung  dass eine Welt voller Zauberei existiert  andert sich plotzlich alles und die Welt des kleinen Jungen steht Kopf  Auf einmal erreichen ihn merkwurdige Briefe  die sein fieser und kuhler Onkel unbedingt vor ihm verbergen will  Aber was hat es mit den Briefen auf sich  Und wird Harry jemals die Wahrheit erfahren  Diese Abenteuer bietet alle magischen Antworten   Idee  Umsetzung  Warum  Warum habe ich nicht viel fruher die Werke um Harry und seine Freunde verschlungen  Warum habe ich mich nicht eher getraut  in diese magische und faszinierende Welt einzutauchen  Warum habe ich 12 Jahre gewartet  Ich besitze den ersten Harry Potter   Band nun schon seit 12 Jahren  Meine Nachbarn schenkten ihn mir zur Kommunion  zusammen mit dem zweiten Teil und seit diesem Tag stehen die Werke in meinem Regal  ungelesen  Vor einigen Tagen habe ich es dann endlich geschafft  Ich habe den ersten Band beendet  Was ich zu sagen habe  So unendlich viel  Ich bin so sprachlos  begeistert und verzaubert  Das Buch ist so wunderschon  Voller Fantasie und Uberraschungen  Joanne K  Rowling hat hier ein wunderbares Werk geschaffen  welches in jeder Hinsicht mitreissen kann  So steht nicht nur die Jagd nach dem grossten und bosesten Zauberer der Welt im Mittelpunkt der Geschichte    nein  es werden noch ganz andere  schone  wie auch wichtige Themen behandelt  wie etwa Freundschaft  Familie und Mut  Eine wahrlich magische Mischung  welche nicht nur Kinder oder Jugendliche hinter die Seiten locken sollte  sondern ebenso Erwachsene  Was dieses Buch sonst noch besonders macht  Die Autorin hat in der Meisterdisziplin uberzeugt  So hat Frau Rowling nicht nur eine umwerfende und spannende Idee erschaffen  sondern diese auch mit den richtigen Mitteln und Worten realisiert  Dies alles macht diesen ersten Band so schon  so rund  so einzigartig und so zauberhaft  Schreibstil   Naturlich kenne ich einige Leseratten  welche die Abenteuer um Harry  Ron und Hermine kennen und lieben  Zudem habe ich alle Kinofilme gesehen  Es ist also so  dass in meinem Kopf eine gewisse Vorstellung herrschte  Eine Vorstellung davon  was mich  wie verpackt  hinter den Seiten der Autorin erwarten wurde  Ich hatte diese Vorstellung  hielt sie ganz fest und stapfte durch die ersten Worte und Buchstaben  immer tiefer in die Handlung und wurde uberrascht  Warum uberrascht  Joanne K  Rowling hat eine unglaubliche und wunderbare Schreibe  welche man  als Leser  einfach lieben MUSS  Jedes ihrer Worte passt perfekt in das Gesamtbild und Konzept und formt dieses Werk zu jenem Schatz  welches es nun einmal ist  Mit viel Witz  einem bestechenden Ideenreichtum und liebevollen Charakteren  schafft die Autorin eine ganz neue Welt  Eine Welt  welche neben unserer existiert  Eine Welt  welche man ausschliesslich durch ihre Seiten betreten kann  Eine Welt  in welcher man jegliches Zeitgefuhl verliert  Ich habe wirklich jede Seite von   Harry Potter und der Stein der Weisen  genossen und freue mich schon unglaublich auf eine neue Ture  einen neuen Band  um in diese magische Welt zuruckzukehren  Charaktere  Die Figuren sind alle so wundervoll  Jede hat ihren ganz eigenen Charakter und gibt der Geschichte eine eigene Note  Selbst die Bosewichte fugen sich in das stimmige Gesamtbild  dieses ersten Bandes  Dabei hat es mir besonders Hermine angetan  Schon in den Filmen  war sie mein absoluter Liebling  Aber auch alle anderen Figuren  haben das Potential zu verzaubern  So haben mir auch sehr gut gefallen  Fred und George  die Weasley Zwillinge  Ihre Passagen waren immer witzig  leicht und locker  Einfach genial  Ich bin schon gespannt  wie sich die Figuren im folgenden Band entwickeln  Mich kribbelt es formlich in den Fingern  Cover  Innengestaltung  Das  Cover  des ersten Bandes gefallt mir sehr gut  auch wenn es Covergestaltungen aus anderen Landern gibt  welche mir vielleicht doch noch etwas besser gefallen  als jenes der deutschen Ausgabe Die  Innengestaltung  des Werkes ist schlicht  Uberschriften leiten die jeweiligen Kapitel ein  Fazit  Manche Bucher scheinen magisch  durch ein magisches Cover  Andere Schmoker locken vielleicht durch eine magische Inhaltsbeschreibung  aber nicht jeder Buchschatz  ist durch und durch mit Magie getrankt    Harry Potter und der Stein der Weisen   von Joanne K  Rowling  ist durchaus zauberhaft  Mit einem spannenden  witzigen und unterhaltsamen Schreibstil  baut die Autorin ihren Lesern ein Tor in eine andere Welt  Eine Welt beherrscht von Zauberern  Hexen und magischen Wesen  Eine Welt  in welchen die Leser die Zeit der realen Welt vergessen und ganz mit der Geschichte verschmelzen  Dort  zwischen den Seiten  treffen sie auf eine ausgereifte Buchidee  liebevolle und gelungene Charaktere und einem ganzen Haufen an Abenteuern  An jene Unwissende dort draussen  an jene Muggel  welche noch keinen Fuss in die Winkelgasse  den tropfenden Kessel oder Hogwarts gesetzt haben  Bitte  wartet nicht so lange wie ich  ehe ihr einen Fuss in dieses lesenswerte und mitreissende Abenteuer setzt  Seid mutig und lasst euch verzaubern  This was a great book to read with my son  It introduced him to fun fantasy  wizards and witches  good and evil  It s a very fast read for adults  and I would recommend it to them as well  Just for fun  The plot may be simple  but so what  I liked Star Wars  too  Another orphaned boy with special powers  Another tale of Good vs  Evil  I love the spells  which are so related to the action desired that they are easy to remember  This gives my son and his friends the ability to act out spells and to come up with ideas for other spells that they can use  Expelliarmus  sp    for example  is a spell the wizards use to cause opponents to drop their wands  or whatever they are holding  Stupefy  may be my favorite  When I first read Harry Potter for myself  it was a page turner  Not great literature  but interesting enough that I did not want to stop  For my son  the series appears to be helping him overcome his fear of slightly scary tales and movies  To us  it sounds great when read out loud  My husband likes to listen to the tale  too  and he takes turns with me and sometimes reads out loud  Our whole family has started to enjoy reading to each other  My son reads  Wimpy Kids  to us  I have never understood why some folks see HP books as sinister  The Bible is a story of Good and Evil  Honestly  Read it  Expelliarmus    Angkat tangan kalian dan taruh dibelakang kepala  Eh  salah ya    DBuku ini  Harry Potter and The Sorcerer s Stone adalah buku pertama dari serial terkenal Harry Potter  Perkenalan awalku dengan buku ini kira kira 10 atau 11 tahun yang lalu  Lupa  tapi rasanya seperti baru kemarin saja aku menarik narik tangan mama untuk membelikan buku ini Aku memulai membacanya justru dari buku yang kedua  baru kemudian lanjut ke buku pertama  Kebalik   heheheh soalnya dulu itu aku iseng iseng aja nyoba baca buku ini  biasanya kan belinya cuma komik  Eh setelah dibaca kok malah nagih  jadilah setelah pertemuan yang tak sengaja itu selanjutnya aku malah menunggu buku buku selanjutnya dari serial ini Buku ini  bercerita tentang seorang anak yang bernama Harry Potter  Harry yang dibesarkan oleh paman dan bibinya di dunia manusia  tidak tahu kalau dia penyihir sampai ulang tahun nya yang ke 11  Sepucuk surat dari sekolah sihir Hogwarts dan kedatangan Hagrids akhirnya membuka jati diri Harry yang sebenernya Hagrid pun membeberkan bahwa Harry adalah seorang penyihir  dan bahwa orangtuanya meninggal akibat perbuatan penyihir jahat bernama Lord Voldemort  Hidupnya berubah  Hidup Harry berubah  Ia yang awalnya adalah anak yang bukan siapa siapa dan hidup dalam bayang bayang Dudley sepupunya  kini menjadi penyihir yang paling terkenal di seluruh dunia sihir  Dialah Harry Potter yang berhasil menghancurkan penyihir paling jahat Lord Voldemort Di Hoghwarts  Harry berteman akrab dengan Ron Weasley dan Hermione  Ron adalah seorang penyihir berdarah murni atau asli dari keluarga penyihir  sedangkan Hermione sebaliknya  Hermione lahir dari orang tua yang non penyihir atau muggle  sama dengan ibu nya harry Potter  Sedangkan Harry Potter sendiri   dia berdarah campuran Selain persahabatan antara ketiganya  Rowling juga menyajikan permusuhan yang biasa terjadi di kalangan anak anak sekolahan  Semacam guru yang pilih kasih  atau berantem antara murid murid  Antogonisnya Draco Malfoy  Dia adalah anak dari Lucius malfoy  Draco terlahir dari keluarga berdarah murni  yang saat Lord Voldemort masih berjaya  kedua orang tuanya adalah pengikut setia dan memiliki kedudukan yang cukup penting di sisinya  Namun kini  setelah 11 tahun Voldemort menghilang  mereka hanyalah keluarga berdarah murni  biasa    yang sedang mencari cara untuk menemukan tuan mereka yang hilang dan merebut kekuasaan mereka kembali Lalu bagaimana sekarang rasanya ketika membacanya kembali   Jujur saja  rasanya seperti bertemu dengan sahabat lama kemudian saling bercengkrama sembari menyruput secangkir kopi di sore yang cerah  Hangat sekali Tentu saja ada kesan yang berbeda ketika aku pertama kali membaca dan membaca untuk kesekian kalinya sekarang ini  Kesan yang didapat dari tokoh tokohnya sangat berbeda sekali  Dulu aku benci banget sama Professor Snape  salah satu guru Hogwarts yang dikesankan amat pilih kasih di buku ini  Tapi sekarang tidak   malah senyum senyum sendiri membaca tingkah laku snape dan berusaha memahami maksud tindakan tindakannya  Kemudian kesan terhadap Dumbledore juga  bahkan kepada Neville  Amat sangat berubah Dan rasanya semakin kagum dengan Mrs  Rowling  membayangkan dia bisa membuat buku yang sungguh sungguh unputdownable  Dengan twist yang luar biasa di buku ketujuh  dan semua dilmulai dari buku yang pertama    sambil membayangkan Harry menangkap golden snitch dengan mulutnya  Sekarang  rasanya sudah tak sabar untuk melanjutkan ke buku kedua dan kembali terhanyut dalam petualangan Harry  Ron dan Hermione Btw   Suamiku itu pengagum Hermione loh  dan kalau anak yang kedua ini perempuan katanya mau dinamakan Hermione   D i m really surprised i enjoyed this story as much as i did  i was expecting a silly little kids story with no serious plot  man was i wrong  of course kids were everywhere but the subject matter i totally identified with  Harry living with his horrible relatives and being treated so wrong  him being plopped into Hogwarts and trying to fit in  finding friends and trying to analyze what u see with ur eyes and how evil people are  it was really interesting and yet funny at times  some parts i almost cried on too  i m a softy when it comes to someones feelings being hurt  Harry always seemed to deal with that  and even Ron had his share of sadness  being like the 5th boy in his family and second to youngest  never having his own things and not feeling as special  i really felt for him Hermony i wasn t too fond of at first  but i ended liking her as well  once she calmed down that is  hehe  she was smart and people hated her for it  she loved knowledge and wanted to follow the rules  they all learned something about themselves and others in this book  Harry that he actually has some people that care about him  that he s special and lovable  Ron that he has some unique qualities that set him apart as his own person  Hermony that she can be smart without making others feel stupid  these are all things every person at some point in life learns and become better for it  some don t like Blondie  can t remember his name  definitely want to continue the series and i m totally glad i ve started the series   Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone is an incredibly magical story of a young boy and his journey to become Hogwart s next best wizard  He was raised by his wretched aunt and uncle and bully of a cousin  Ever since her sister Harry s mom  was a wizard when they were kids  Harry s aunt has hated wizards and she refused to let Harry continue on the horrid family trait  Little did she know once Hogwart s tried to get in touch with Harry  they would stop at little or nothing to succeed  Despite the great efforts of his aunt and uncle  the letter finally made its way to Harry  Harry had no idea what was in store for him  there was so much he didn t know  so much that his aunt and uncle had been hiding from him  J K  Rowling captures the essence of each character incredibly along their magical journey  She is such a great writer to be able to capture so much detail for so many different characters in such a captivating story  I greatly enjoyed reading the first book in such a great series  and greatly look forward to reading the rest  I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves a great adventure   I have lots of catching up and things to do  but hey what are summers for if not staying up a bit late to finish a book  Some people don t reread books  I m sure I could read a lot more variety in my lifetime if I didn t but I m not sure if I could resist the comfort of sinking back into the familiar  Maybe it is also because I do enjoy the writing craft  looking back to see the well tucked hints  This is why this isn t a review blog  who on earth needs a review of anything Harry Potter at this point  I have always loved Harry  actually I m so much of a Hermione that I wanted them to end up together for the longest time  but it s like many books I ve read where with time and age I realize why the ones that end up together do  If I still had my first copy of the book  bah irresponsible borrowers  I might could tell you to the day when I finished this book this first time  even what I rated it  but there are things I know now I could not have told you then  Harry brought so much attention to fantasy and children s books  I was already a nerd  note when it came out in 1998 I had just turned 11 in May  but I was still mostly a high fantasy girl  There was good modern fantasy for adults but some of the things they tried to sell us kids back before Harry were just ridiculous  People still worry about kids picking up Harry because of the sheer size  but here is the thing it s not hard  but it s not dumbed down  There can be a happy medium in children s books  What    There are so many series now that are loved by childrens  teens and adults  There have been several books in the past year  where I FORGOT where it was being classified  I used to worry what people thought of me for reading so many  young  books still  but what I ve learned is who cares as long as we re having fun  My mother could probably tell you how many of the books in the series I read in one sitting  well  not so much a sitting I did move but even moving to the dinner table my eyes never left the page   I started this reread and on page 15 I laughed aloud and looked at Ben and praised the joy of details like the scar on Dumbledore s left knee  a perfect map of the London Underground  And just like that you are caught in this world  I see all these articles about saying goodbye to Harry  but come on people  The joy of books is that there he sits in arms reach  You can come back and visit but Harry would want you moving on to the next adventure  This is the first book of the Harry Potter series   Reviewed for THC ReviewsThis was my second read of  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone   and I have to say that even after having read it before and seeing the movie four times  it is still just as good as it was the first time I read it  I m simply a little more familiar with the story now  I started this series a few years ago by reading it to my kids  but when our busy schedules just seemed to keep getting in the way of finishing it  I decided to go back on my own to re read the earlier books and hopefully finally wrap up the series this time around  Even as an adult reading it alone  this is still a delightful book with a magical  no pun intended  plot and a host of colorful and diverse characters  I absolutely love the interactions between Harry  Ron and Hermione  They make an ideal trio of friends whose strengths and weaknesses compliment each other perfectly  I really admire the Weasley family  They may not have much in the way of material possessions  but they have lots of warmth and love and are a family I wouldn t mind being a part of  Professor Dumbledore is the perfect  gentle father figure who is also a genius with just a touch of humorous eccentricity  Professor McGonagall is wonderful as a very stern  but kind  motherly figure  Professor Snape is a total enigma who constantly keeps me guessing about his motivations  Hagrid is one of the most marvelous characters in the book and also one that keeps me guessing but in much different ways  His affection for and attachment to magical creatures is both funny and endearing all rolled into one  and he definitely has a gift for their care  Of course  these are just a few of my favorites  but the story is teeming with more characters from teachers to students  and from the ghosts and spirits who haunt the castle to Harry s Muggle family  the Dursleys  all of whom are brought vividly to life  It would be nearly impossible not to love  or at least love to hate  each and every one  Sometimes  it s hard to believe that this was J  K  Rowling s debut novel  but with her enchanting story telling skills  it is very easy to see why the Harry Potter series enticed so many kids and teens back to reading and is still a world wide favorite  quite possibly even destined for classic status  I know that when I read a children s young adult book as an adult and enjoy it this much  it is one I too would have enjoyed in my youth  I very much look forward to continuing this captivating series soon  This book clearly needs no review  because it s a fantastic book  But I will rant on one topic I knew several people who refused to let their children read this book series because it was ungodly due to its reference to magic  Ungodly  Really  The antagonist of the story cannot touch the protagonist because his mother died   so that her son could live    laying your life on the line to protect your son is unholy Not to also add other themes in the book such as SOCIAL JUSTICE   I suppose I ve got Cristianity all wrong To also add  another reason was because it involved magic  You who make this claim are pathetic It s high school  set in a world where magic does exist   ITS A FANTASY   It s not like they re taking from the wiccian religion   I ve never heard of a real Hogwarts  or people who could fly around on brooms  and I don t feel like less of a

sVoldemont  a wise wizard gone bad who killed Harry s parentsPlot summary Harry s parents were killed by a man named Voldemont when he was a baby  Voldemort tried to kill Harry but he was unsuccessful

students like Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger  At school  the first years take turns putting on the  Sorting Hat  to find out in which residential house they will live  Harry  Ron  and Hermione end up in the Gryffindor house  As school gets underway Harry accidentally discovers a fierce three headed dog guarding a trapdoor in the forbidden third floor corridor  For Christmas  Harry receives his father s invisibility cloak  and he explores the school  unseen  late at night  He discovers the mirror of Erised  which displays the deepest desire of whoever looks in it  Harry looks in it and sees his parents alive  After Christmas  Harry  Ron  and Hermione begin to unravel the mysterious connection between a break in at Gringotts and the three headed guard dog  They learn that the dog is

decided to destroy the stone  Strengths  including reviews and awards  The imagination you gain from reading this book is wonderfulThe book flows very well leaving you to want to keep reading ok so the biggest reason i wanted to read this books was because i saw all the movies and my brothers suggested that i read the books because they are way different than the movies  hes right so far plus the loads of information that they give which i didnt understand in the movies like i didnt know aunt marge stayed a week that must ve have been tourture  The sites were cool in the movies i think that rowling did a good job putting a mental picture in your head  they go everywhere london  the castle  derslys poor boy  rons place  and more  man harry ive grown up with the actor feels like a brother even though i dont know him black hair or really dark brown  glasses  a scar on his forhead  average height not sure if slaying monsters and fighting evil would classify as athletic or not but its something to wonder about i wonder how rowling came up with all these ideas the flying keys the three headed dogs the plant that engulfs you the drinking test and anything else oh yeah the whole thing   haha  harry has got real guts to go and see who was trying to take the stone heck hes got guts trying to get past the dog from the moment he learned he was a wizard from hagrid to the deathly hollows hes one bad ass dude ill tell anyone who actually reads this one thing its that hagrid should have gotten the stone without harry because harry was nearly killed just solving who was taking the stone or at least trying anyway i still don t get how harry just touching quirel made him burn and such im sure that rowling said something that made me go  oh thats odd   all in all this book was great because it was informative mostly and come on HARRY POTTER   Mr  and Mrs  Dursley  of number four  Privet Drive  were proud to say that they were perfectly normal  thank you very much  They were the last people you d expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious    I m going to try to keep this review concise and to the point  with little fangirl spurs that are sure to sprout from me  At least  I hope I can do that  Oh  who am I kidding  I love this book There isn t really much I can say about this book that hasn t been said  The writing is simple  but wonderful  the characters are three demensional  the plot line is amazing  and there is both humor and action galore  So  basically this book has everything I look for in a book  And more  Nothing is quite like Harry Potter  I m sure authors have attempted to re create the magical feel of this world  but they just can t  I don t have anything to compare J K  Rowling s writing to  It s simply amazing and fun  Can I just say I love J K as a person as well  She seems so down to earth  Not to mention  she s a classic success story  Poor  single mom in a tiny apartment struggling to make ends meet and battling depression decides to loose herself in a fictional world and ends up writing a best selling book  It s the kind of thing that makes you believe in miracles  Which is very ironic  considering the books kind of make you believe in miracles too I really  really want to go to Hogwarts  I mean  let s be honest  Who hasn t at least entertained the idea of being a witch or wizard  even as a child  And Hogwarts sounds so awesome  Just imagine being in a midevil castle like setting  learning spells  playing Quidditch  carrying around an owl  getting sorted into a house  If that isn t my dream life  I don t know what is The characters  I loved them  I won t say I loved each and every one of them  of course  But most  I loved Harry  and Ron and Hermione are both resorceful  humurous  smart characters  They really add a flavor to the story that diffenetly wouldn t be there without them  Not to mention  Romione is one of the best ships in the history of shipping  Harry can be a bit too perfect  but I can easily forgive this because he can also be very human and acts like any real teenage preteen boy does at times in this book  I also love Hagrid a groundskeeping giant with a soft spot for dragons  how can you not love him    Dumbldore  he always had something insightful  wise  and sometimes downright hilarious to say   and Professor Mcgonagall  she was  in my opinion  on the top list of badass female witches involved in this book  after Hermione  of course  So  that s pretty much the gist of what I have to say about this book  And no fangirl out burts  Yay  Okay  so there were a few minor ones  but I did a lot better than I thought I would  Anyway  I started this series a few years ago but only got to like book two or something like that  So  I ve decided to re read this series  It was at the top of my Need to freaking finish list so why not  If you re looking for a light  funny  adventurous  book with characters that will stay with you forever  I would strongly recommend the Harry Potter series Favorite Quotes   But from that moment on  Hermione Granger became their friend  There are some things you can t share without ending up liking each other  and knocking out a twelve foot mountain troll is one of them     After all  to the well organized mind  death is but the next great adventure     The truth   Dumbledore sighed   Is a beautiful and terrible thing  and should therefore be treated with great caution   P S  I had a british accent in my head the whole time I was reading this Now  I m off to re read Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets This is where the magic began  That wonderful  captivating magic of Harry Potter  The Boy Who Lived Baby Potter with his famous lighting scar     Harry Potter might be your ordinary 10 year old boy in an ordinary street with the ordinary  but mean  Dursleys  By the time he turned 11  he receives the shock of his life  He is a wizard  And the rest is history       Harry gets submerged into the magical world of Hogwarts  and meets new friends  Hermione and Ron  and gets in a lot of trouble  When a a new teacher attends to teach  Harry can t help but wonder why is he meeting with Snape  the Potions teacher  The result of it  makes him enter into a new discovery he never knew  The Philosopher Stone  Now  Harry and his friends  have to find that Stone before it gets on the wrong hands  But that might not be the only thing Harry will find out       everything will connect to the man who killed his parents and the night he survived I just loved it  It had mystery  great characters  and it wasn t easy to put down  It was amazing     It made me so happy  The last chapter was kind of rushed  but that s okay  because the awesomeness of this book overshadowed that   I was ten when the first Harry Potter was published  and here we are  14 years later  and the series is still incredibly relevant to the literary and pop culture world  I would say that this fact is unbelievable  but really  it should have been expected given the quality and creativity of J K  Rowling s skills as a storyteller I remember my mom reading me the first one  but I dropped off around book three  and so I am one of the few who has no idea what became of Harry and his Hogwarts experience  I haven t even seen the films  I am aware  however  that the world is anticipating the final movie and the passion and attention it s been getting has made me decide to pick the series back up and finish it properly  starting at the beginning  since I was a child the last time I read them and recall very little about the first few books  After all these years there is not much that hasn t already been said about Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone  Harry Potter  1   so my review will be short The experience wasn t as magical as I remember it being as a kid  but the world Rowling creates is still wonderful and fully developed  The writing is obviously geared toward children  though Rowling does a good job of not shutting adults out despite her younger audience  And of course  the story telling and dynamic characters are the reason the books have been as successful as they are Harry Potter is a classic that has stood the test of time and I m sure they will be read to children until the world ends  I wish I had kept reading them as a youngster  because that sort of wonderment is priceless  but I do look forward to reading the next six books eventually   Harry Potter isn t a normal boy  He survived the curse that killed his parents  and was meant to kill him  He discovers on his 11th birthday that he is a wizard  From then  Harry goes on to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry  learning new things he never would have dreamed he would learn  such as Transfiguration  Defense Against the Dark Arts  and Charms  He meets his new best friend  Ron Weasley  who comes from a wizarding family  unlike him  and after a series of events  another best friend  Hermione  who is Muggle born  but she is very knowledgeable and has read all the textbooks cover to cover  But very weird things are happening at Hogwarts  Does Harry have what it takes to solve the mystery  J  K  Rowling starts this series with a perfect pace  placing certain details here and there evenly  The writing is perfectly plotted  and you could tell she spent a lot of time thinking about how this book should be planned out  It really bugs me how people complain that this book promotes  Witchcraft   In my opinion  it doesn t  It just promotes a perfect side of imagination  I would recommend this book to anybody  who was even an ounce of imagination  Five plus stars  Ahh  my 14th time reading this book  and it never gets old I know everyone has read this book  but to those who have not  shame on you   or to those who may have forgotten  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone is the first book in a seven book series  Eleven year old Harry Potter has been forced to a miserable life with his Aunt Petunia Dursley  Uncle Vernon Dursley  and cousin Dudley Dursley  One day  he is hand delivered a personal invitation to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardy and learns that he is indeed a wizard  Harry Potter attends Hogwarts  and his life changes  It is there that he makes friends  masters the game of Quidditch  hunts trolls  befriends a giant  and learns about the sorcerer s stone  The sorcerer s stone  which is said to give immortality to its beholder  is supposedly hidden somewhere in Hogwarts  However  suspicious events lead Harry Potter to believe that other individuals are attempting to steal the stone for themselves and abuse the stone s power  Can Harry Potter  the boy who lived  survive his encounters with such evils in the wizard world As for my review on this book  I  of course  find it to be an absolutely amazing read  If you have never read Harry Potter and are on the fence about doing so  I highly reccomend you give AT LEAST the first three books a chance  as these books are the lightest and easiest to read   To me  it is amazing to compare the first three books to the six and seventh books  which are dramatically darker  It really demonstrates how J K  Rowling has developed as an author   This is my FIRST book toward my 2012 50 Book Challenge  This is a great book for teens and young adults  it has action  adventure  suspense  and even a little horror some times  You ll travel through a magical and scary adventure with Harry Potter and his friends while trying to save the world from a terrible and dark fate  You see everything from Trolls to Goblins in this book and many more magical things to come withing the upcoming books  You can have so much fun with this series by really bringing it alive by  watching the movies or getting on websites or even looking up some of the spells  I thoroughly enjoyed this book  I was able to really connect with this series and I would highly recommend this to all Middle   High School students  You will have a magical time traveling through the book and reading about so many things you have never encountered before like Quidditch  Wizardry and much more to come  You should really take the time to unravel the mysteries that lie within all the books  you might be surprised at the end of the series how things turn out  so take the time to fall in love with this series and have a marvelous adventure   Pertama kali membaca ini pas masih SD dulu  Ulang tahun  dan ayah saya membelikan buku ini sebagai hadiah  Awalnya saya bingung  tidak mengerti   Apaan nih    Novel    Kenapa nggak beliin sepeda   dan sebagainya  Namun malam harinya  saya mulai membaca buku ini  dan saya mendapati bahwa saya sangat tertarik akan ceritanya  Mantap  Keren Cerita ini merupakan pembuka dari serial Harry Potter yang termasyhur  Sebuah pembuka yang solid dan kuat  Tidak ragu ragu dalam ceritanya  Sangat menyenangkan membaca bagaimana seorang Hero saat memulai   A Hero s Beginning   sebagaimana yang dilukiskan di buku ini Minusnya adalah  karena buku ini jelas jelas ditujukan untuk anak anak  tidak banyak hal hal yang kuinginkan   seperti epic scene  dan sebagainya yang kuingin baca sekarang sekarang ini  Jadilah aku sudah nyaris tak pernah membaca buku ke 1 ini   Tapi tak apa  Buku ini akan selalu kukenang sebagai novel pertama yang kubaca  Fantasy pertama yang kubaca  buku pertama yang merangsangku untuk mendalami novel per Fantasy an  dan seterusnya XD Mantap   READ MORE FOR THE MOVIE REVIEW 5 stars  eh  Pretty predictable    Brilliantly imaginative  Harry Potter and The Sorcerer s Stone is a legendary children s tale that will be unforgettable for ages   I m so glad to have this book now  I regret nothing  really  I am not mad at myself for not having to read this book earlier  I am happy that this world is all new to myself  I m feeling so great that I have never  EVER sit down properly to watch Potter movies  Because I know one day I m going to read the books first and have it to myself alone  This is the time for me to finally find out about The Boy Who Lived I m not really keen to children s books  I m the one who prefers to read writing styles like Delirium or to have actions like the ones in Divergent  so that s why it took time for me to pick this book up  Although I know it s very legendary  I m very picky and choosing books  But finally  FINALLY  I have the whole set now The best thing that kept me reading is Hogwarts  It s like a fantastic boarding school that I m dying to be in now  Well  for your information I m in a process of getting myself out of boarding school whilst reading this  so I get all the feels  In my boarding school there s houses  and there s Houses in the school  and everything s the same except we learn only magic in Hogwarts  It s amazing Harry Potter  the character itself  is okay  I mean  we get a story about the most anticipated boy to be at Hogwarts  but I don t think it would hurt to know a story from another kid s point of view who s really nothing and rebellious and such  But I adore his bravery and he s     he s just amazing  I love Hermione the most  she s the most realistic characters in the book  And of course  Ron     RON  Love him The bad thing is that Daniel Radcliffe and the rest are the ones in my head while I was reading this  I hope I don t know any of them so I can imagine all of them to myself  That s impossible  really  However  I find my Harry and movie Harry s slightly different  My Harry is a bit more fun and not that nerdy  really straight from the book Now I m watching the movie  Probably I m probably writing the review ___________________________________MOVIE REVIEWWell  I wouldn t call this a review  really  Just some brief thoughts Hm     So  it s hard for Hollywood to really  really  REALLY satisfies me when it comes to book to movie adaptations  I m satisfied with neither The Hunger Games nor The Perks of Being A Wallflower or anything  So  unfortunately  I have to say Hollywood does not satisfy me with this one either  Sighs  So  clearly  this means that it s quite difficult for me to be happy when I m watching a movie from a book  Harry Potter movie franchise  it s one of the most legendary movie franchise ever made this century  But whywhyWHY can t I feel as happy as I am when I was reading the book  So   The book is more fun  Harry Potter in the book is way entertaining to compare with the movie Potter  Malfoy seems less evil to compare with the one we had in the book  All the fun parts  Harry Potter s taking over Hogwarts during Christmas  he only SEARCHED FOR FLAMEL    giving over Norbert to Charlie  etc   is not in the movie  Ergh  I m expecting too much  But HARRY POTTER 1 is full of joy  And I don t feel as much as joyous watching the movie  Well  they made it in 2001  I can t complain now Anyway  the movie s portrayal of Hogwarts is spectacular  And Hermione  Anyway  I m a bad movie reviewer  ___________________________________SO    I HAVEN T READ HARRY POTTER YET Hate me  I ve been stalling to read this becausea  The format of the book available in the local bookstore is A MESS   ISBN  1408810549   An amount of packed mothereffing small fonts all fit in a damn thin book  No WAY I m going to buy it  Plus it s SO FUCKING EXPENSIVE I won t waste my money on that b  The movie  I HATE it when I saw the actors portraying the characters  Let me imagine them myself  LET ME THINK ABOUT IT MYSELF  If it s back before the movie s out  I m so effing young it s so impossible  I would probably pick this book up  c  Wizards and 3rd person  Two of the things I AM NOT interested in at all So those are the reasons  And do I feel like I m embarrassed admitting this fact Because  at least  I m NOT one of those people who said  HEEEEY I READ HARRY POTTER  while they only watched them movies  I have to say these   a  I don t read the books yet   b  I will NEVER watch the movies until I read the books Okay  good news  I VE JUST ORDERED THE BOXSET OF THE WHOLE SERIES  Eleven years ago an Australian friend of mine gave me a novel as a gift   about a young boy who goes to wizardry school   If I had any idea back then  I would pause and take a photo of this defining moment in my life First  story aside  J  K  Rowling is a superb writer  What kept me through the first half of this first book was simply how hilarious it was  I don t mean chuckle  I mean laugh out loud  The reason why Harry Potter is a  world of its own  is because it is  when Rowling describes places and characters  you see them and you know them  As soon as you start reading you find yourself there in the scene  The characters are so comical and yet so real  you can instantly relate  Potterheads love this book because they become Harry  Ron and Hermoine Rowling is a writer who does her homework  You may start out thinking it s just a story for children  but before you are done with this first book  you will realize this is a surprisingly detailed  intricate  well told and above all meaningful story  This is a story that talks about racism  about prejudice  fear of the other  over estimation of power  about having the courage to stand on the right side This is more than a book  this is an experience  Amazingly intoxicating and thrilling  Although this is written as a book for children  unless you ve been living under a rock you know its for all ages   actually  depending on your child s personality  it may not be a book for your child at all  My son is not generally easily  spooked  by stories  but I didn t give him the green light to start the Harry Potter series until he was eight   I have friends  though  whose children started reading Harry when they were as young as six and none of them have yet had to seek professional counseling    I am a big fan of fantasy stories and have been since I was young  so as soon as I heard about the Harry Potter series I started reading it   in my late 20 s  I m a sucker for coming of age wizards so it was a perfect fit for me   and I have loved every moment I ve spent immersed in Harry s world   and am very much enjoying sharing that now with my son   hopefully my 2 year old will end up being an avid reader as well so I can re visit Harry again in about five or six years  Review An ordinary boy  Harry Potter  discovers that he isn t so ordinary  Harry is a famous wizard and journeys off to join Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to learn his craft  make friends and enemies  and to have a few adventures  He discovers that someone is trying to steal the philosopher s stone  so with his friends Ron and Hermione in tow  they endeavour to save the stone   This is a growing up story  the first book of seven  detailing the changes of the children enclosed in the school and later of the outer world changing around them  It details good  evil and the blur in between  It is a very good commentary on how people are different  but also how similar  It shows that a person s choices are what matters and shapes a person and their life   The story exemplifies certain key qualities in the characters such as knowledge and bravery amongst others  whilst demonstrating the importance of friends Children s Literacy If you read this book looking for educational value  you may feel guilty finding that you enjoy it too much  so surely it can t have any educational value  Well you d be wrong  For one  the fact that you enjoyed it means that small children may enjoy it  inspiring them to read  It will provoke their imagination  perhaps encouraging children to want to write some of their own fantasy stories  This book  as well as the other six in the series  would also be useful to discuss citizenship topics such as making friends as the protagonist has a very different experience to his friend Hermione  This book is a part of a large common pool of well known literacy  This gives the children a good conversation point with adults as well as with other children  improving their speaking  listening and discussion skills  This would be good for year 4  at story time and 5 6  for guided or independent reading  The children can be asked to name and describe some of the many characters in the book to develop their knowledge retrieval skills  There are also a lot of questions to be asked about these characters  such as their connection to the other characters and their personalities  Rowling  J K    2003   Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone  New York  NY  Scholastic Press Target Audience  Grades 4 9 Harry Potter  although a wizard  is a relatable character as he is picked on  unpopular  and mistreated by even his family members  However  he soon learns of the magical powers he has and is able to escape his less than optimal life in England  When he goes off to live at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft  he still faces adolescent troubles  such as making new friends and trying to become the best Quidditch player in school  The difference here is that he is able to take his magical gift and develop it  He doesn t let the idea that others don t accept him take away from what makes him unique  which is the message I would like to use for my own students when reading this book   The language in this book is very interesting to use with students  It is filled with figurative language as characters shoot not just magic  but also  shoot looks  at one another and other examples such as  sitting frozen   Students will already be more engaged because of the hysteria surrounding Harry Potter so it can be used to the teacher s benefit to teach various writing techniques ranging from descriptive language to onomatopoeia as students are instructed to  describe spells     There were a hundred and forty two staircases at Hogwarts  wide  sweeping ones  narrow  rickety ones  some that led somewhere different on a Friday  some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to jump  Then there were doors that wouldn t open unless you asked politely  or tickled them in exactly the right places  and doors that weren t really doors at all  but solid walls just pretending  It was also very hard to remember where anything was  because it all seemed to move around a lot  The people in the portraits kept going to visit each other  and Harry was sure the coats of armor could walk  Honestly  I don t know anybody who d refuse to even entertain the thought of attending a school for wizards  Yes  the experience itself may be daunting and scary but really  most of us would welcome an opportunity to escape the mundane world and enter one of the fantastical  And such is what  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone  is  an introduction to world that you could never have imagine may possibly exist I ve already lost count as to how many times I ve re read the Harry Potter series  The plot and characters are well known and described in many reviews  so I will not address them  I don t even think I need to convince anybody to read these books and or watch the movies  Harry Potter and the magical world that J K  Rowling has creating  Leaky Cauldron  Diagon Alley  Hogwarts  in the first book alone have already become household names the world over that you have to be living under a rock if you haven t been aware of this phenomenon   Welcome   said Hagrid   to Diagon Alley  Harry wished he had eight more eyes  He turned his head in every direction as they walked up the street   trying to look at everything at once  the shops  the things outside them  the people doing their shopping There were shops selling robes  shops selling telescopes and strange silver instruments Harry had never seen before  tottering piles of spell books  quills  and rolls of parchment  potion bottles  globes of the moon   I believe that I maybe counted as one of the millions of readers worldwide who wished something better for Harry Potter  especially being made aware of the miserable treatment done to him by his Muggle relatives  I too wish to know the contents of the mysterious letters which were detailedly addressed to the exact location of Harry  I cheered when Hagrid finally got a hold of Harry and conveyed to him the message that he ll be attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry that coming term   Harry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place  It was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four long tables  where the rest of the students were sitting  I was looking forward as well to the process of selecting a wizard s wand and what exactly it is that aids magic  Every Ollivander wand has a core of a powerful magical substance  Mr  Potter  We use unicorn hairs  phoenix tail feathers  and the heartstrings of dragons  No two Ollivander wans are the same  just as no two unicorns  dragons  or phoenixes are quite the same  And of course  you will never get such good results with another wizard s wand  Instead of retelling the plot of which most people are already familiar with  I d like to post here my favorite scenes and quotes from the book itself  One treat was finding out the type of delicious treats available to those who travel aboard the Hogwarts Express  What she did have were Bertie Bott s Every Flavor Beans  Droobles Best Blowing Gum  Chocolate Frogs  Pumpkin Pasties  Cauldron Cakes  Licorice Wands  and a number of other strange things Harry had never seen in his life  I didn t expect the fast and true friendship that would form between Harry  Hermione and Ron  Early on we ve managed to catch glimpses of the personalities of the two boys but of Hermione  I snickered  I hope you re pleased with yourselves  We could all have been killed    or worse  expelled  One item  aside from a witch s wand  that I d like to have is most probably Harry s Invisibility Cloak  Just think of the possibilities  And yes  I wouldn t pass up the chance to stand in front of the Mirror of Erised   I show not your face but your heart s desire   No matter what Dumbledore may say that  It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest  most desperate desire of our hearts  The best laugh out loud moment of the entire book would be  Devil s Snare  Devil s Snare   what did Professor Sprout say     it likes the dark and the damp     So light sa fire   Harry choked  Yes    of course    but there s no wood   Hermione cried  wringing her hands  Have you done mad   Ron bellowed   Are you a witch or not  But what would make one continue reading and ultimately finishing the Harry Potter series  It s because  like Harry and the rest of the magical world  we all want to know what exactly happened that night when Voldemort tried to kill the Potter family  How was it possible that Harry  as a mere baby at the time  survived  Would the friendship between Harry  Ron   Hermione survive the test of being constantly thrust into the limelight fraught with dangers  Why does Prof  Snape hate Harry so much  that you couldn t help tagging him as the one trying to steal the Sorcerer s Stone all this time   The truth   Dumbledore sighed   It is a beautiful and terrible thing  and should be treated with great caution   Book Details  Title Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s StoneAuthor J K  RowlingReviewed By Purplycookie harry

one who would kill any one to get it back 5 stars I would recomend this book to anyone who loves fiction I look forward to rereading Harry Potter  when it s turn comes   and the first book never disappoints  It s just a funny and well written as I remember every time  I think I enjoy the early books more in light of what I know from reading the later books  If this is your first time through  enjoy  If you are an  old pro   watch for shadows of later plot developments Original Review  The first book of the Harry Potter series serves as a good introduction to Rowling s magical world  Rowling took the interesting tactic of raising the reading level of her books as she wrote the series  knowing  of course  that her original intended audience was growing up with her characters  That being said  this book is  of course  directed at a much younger audience than the later volumes  so a reader should be prepared for that  The story is plenty exciting to keep you involved and the character development is great  There is very little profanity in the first books of the series  but someone setting out to read the whole series should be aware that there IS increasing profanity in the later books  It might also be noted that the book does not promote  witchcraft  in the religious sense of the word  characters in this series are born with a natural ability to do magic  wizards or witches   or not born with the ability  muggles   A muggle cannot learn to be magical  and  in fact  is completely oblivious to the fact that this magical world exists   I didn t start reading these books until AFTER I had seen all the movies  My friends acctually got me into it when they had an HP Marathon and I told them the movies creeped me out  So  natually  they invited me  I didn t want to go because I had seen bits and parts and found it scary  Well all that was gonna change  By the time I get to watch all of the movies and cry with my friends near the end of the 7th movie  I decided to read the books  My mom was about ready to kill me because I would lock myself in my room or try to read in the bathtub   Yes  I am 15  so I still live with my parents   This book is definatly a good read and if you want I ll tell all ya all  bout it    1  Harry Potters parents  James and Lily Potter  are murdered by Lord Voldemort when Harry is 1 year old   or what my mom would say 12 months  and Harry is taken to live with his horrible Aunt Petunia  Lily s sister  Uncle Vernon  and cousin Dudley Dursley  Before Harry s 11th birthday  letters come from all over the place by owls to deliver them  however  Vernon refuses to let Harry get a hold of one  So  they move out go on vacation till the end of summer to a cabin in the middle of the ocean 2  Harry is up in the middle of the night at 11 59 to wish himself a happy birthday     As soon as Dudley s watch beeps 12 00a m  Harry blows out his dust candles on his dust cake and the door breaks off his hinges  Vernon and Petunia come rushing down the stairs and Harry hides behind Dudley as a large  hairy man walks in by the name of Hagrid  He tells Harry he is a wizard and they are off 3  Harry buys all of his school supplies with a small fortune his parents left for him  galleons are what the call the coins  there are other smaller ones but galleons are worth the most   Hagrid also gets him a pet white owl which Harry names her Hedwig 4  Harry meets his best friends Ron Weasley  redheaded freckleface  like me  and Hermione Granger  bushy  brown  curly hair everywhere and large front teeth which become smaller as she grows  Harry also meets his least favorite people  Severus Snape  the potions master  Draco Malfoy  a blonde haired boy who is snoby and rich  and Crabe and Goyle  Draco s  followers   This book is a really good read and I don t recomend the movies for younger girls particularly as my brother got me to try to watch the first movie when I was 6 and I was flat out terrified  My little sisters don t like it much either  But  my little brother who is 7 is on the 7th book  Haha  he seems to love it  Hope you all read it  Its amazing how creative J K  Rowling is  she is amazing  Great read  Lucas Pires MoraisMs WhiteIndependent Reading29th November  12Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s StoneBy J K Rowling  Classic Fiction  223 PagesHarry Potter and the sorcerer s stone is the first book of the 7 from the Harry Potter series  I was very interested in the story and since I have seen the movie before  I managed to compare how close to the book the movie actually is  All in all the movie stays faithful to the book but there are always thoughts and small stories from the characters that can only be seen in the book  In this story  Harry Potter lives life as a normal  muggle  non magical person  in a small village with his abusive and cruel uncle and aunt  He was never a normal boy though and at exactly the moment he turns 11 he finds out why  Harry is a wizard  just like his parents were  After Harry finds out from Hagrid  a gigantic hairy gatekeeper  that there is a school called Hogwarts for wizard kids  he goes there straightaway  There he meets Ron and Hermione  who he shares many adventures with in the magical castle of Hogwarts  The 3 kids face a problem though  as the man who killed Harry s parents seems to have returned to Hogwarts to try and kill Harry too and take the all powerful sorcerer s stone  which would bring him back to full power  Harry  along with his friends then embarks on a journey within the castle to defeat the feared Voldemort and keep not only Harry but also the whole wizarding world safe from the dangerous villain   Why I decided to read this book  I love Harry Potter and decided to read this book again because I love it so much  Bingo board  this covers the male main character box  This was interesting because it gives a different perspective on the situation to what a girl might do My favourite quote   I hope you re pleased with yourselves  We could all have been killed   or worse  expelled  Now if you don t mind  I m going to bed   because I believe Hermione says this because she did come from a muggle family and didn t want to go back to that  its also really funny Something I learned  I learned that you don t have to be the strongest or the smartest or the bravest to be recognised  Neville Longbottom is the silly clumsy one but it is him who makes Gryffindor win the house championship favourite character  My favourite character would have to be Hermione because of the way she handles each situation that she s in  Like when she nearly get killed by Fluffy she is worried about getting expelled but is ok with knowing about a illegal dragon   J K  Rowling s well known story about Harry Potter begins with this book  In the beginning of the story  Harry is miserable living with his aunt  uncle  and cousin  where he is forced to live in the cupboard under the stairs and eat only what Dudley  his cousin  doesn t want  However on his eleventh birthday  he is told that he is a wizard  and so begins his journey through his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry  Through the year  he discovers that he s famous and an excellent quidditch player  makes new friends  and saves the day by keeping Voldemort from getting the Sorcerer s Stone Even though I d heard many things about this book and had seen the movie  I still couldn t put it down  Everything was described so richly and colorfully that I felt as though I was actually at Hogwarts with Harry  and I began to imagine things very differently from the way they had been portrayed in the movies  Any book that can make a reader with preconceived notions change their mental images as the story continues is clearly a good book Overall  I loved  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone  and will probably continue with the series when I find time  Obviously children love this book too and that s why the HP series has sold so well  I think this would be a good book to use with fourth and fifth grade students either as independent reading or in small reading groups with discussions  After living with his dreadful aunt uncle and cousin on his 11th birthday Harry Potter is told that he is a wizard and will be starting at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry Now finally Harry has some friends and discovers that he is very handy on a broomstick Even having enemies like Draco Malfoy and sinister Professor Snape don t bother him until he suspects that Snape is trying to kill him and steal something secret that is being hidden in the castle It will lead to a confrontation with Voldemort the evil wizard who murdered Harry s parents I love going back to read the series over and over again as I love all the humour and can imagine how excited I would ve been to get a Hogwart s letter   Sigh  maybe next year   The Owl Post idea I loved as my mail would be delivered a lot quicker than Royal Mail and you don t need to worry about strikes   Doesn t it all sound a damn sight more interesting than bloody trigonometry  I like Uncle Vernon s psycho behaviour  the description of the wizarding world with all its amazing detail  the midnight adventures  the humour and the characters  I think my favourite bit was Hagrid and his insane idea to keep Norbert as a pet  That was very funny  I didn t really have any complaints on this book which was a fun read   My beautiful sister found a copy of Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone at Title Wave  our local used bookstore  I was jealous  mentioning that I d looked for it in every bookstore I went into in Scotland to no avail  So  as a surprise   she bought it for me  Thank you  Sara It s hard to believe that it s been fourteen years since the book came out  I don t know when the last time I sat down and read the first book  but while convalescing this month  I decided to read it First off   I don t think the American editions were really needed  All of the words that might need an explanation could have been taken care of with a British to American glossary There isn t a lot to say about this book that hasn t been said  I would love to read an adult book by J K  Rowling just to see how it would go because these are really superb mysteries  Clues and red herrings are sprinkled throughout so cunningly that were I not a good Christian girl I d be tempted to worship Rowling as a demigoddess  There are  of course  flaws in logic throughout  For example  we know underage wizards aren t permitted to perform magic outside of Hogwarts  but on the train Hermione mentions doing a few simple spells before coming  It s also said that the teacher for Defense Against the Dark Arts never lasts for more than a year  but people talk about Quirrell as though he s been at Hogwarts a while  If the Weasley clan is known for being poor and fertile  shouldn t Gryffindor be teaming with gingers  Cousins  second cousins  aunts  and uncles  Sure these things can be  fan wanked  away  but still  they are there Bottom line  Rarely has the term  instant classic  been so well deserved  An exciting book written in a way that makes you fall in love with the characters  You root for Harry all the way through finding out about his magic  getting to leave his mean family  to discovering new adventures at Hogwarts  Rowling does a great job of getting you to feel sympathy for Harry whose parents are dead and is stuck living with his aunt and uncle who treat him poorly  He realizes his magical powers and is invited to go to Hogwarts  He is very excited but then realizes there may be more dangers there than with his family  His major dilemma is Voldemort and he has nightmares about him and worries extensively  The plot line in the story is clear for readers to follow through his new wizarding world  You can see the change happening to Harry s world and follow him through meeting new friends  exploring the school  and encountering the dangers of the wizard world  The author also does a nice job of beginning the story in the  real  world and slowly exposes how Harry is set apart from other muggles  The audience even experiences a sense of delight as Harry gets the opportunity to leave his current living situation  The audience is delighted as you go through his adventures and in the end you are proud of his accomplishments of fighting off Voldemort the first time  But you still feel nervous knowing Voldemort still may be lurking  Great book   This is a review for the entire series   Harry Potter follows the formula for the standard fantasy novel  Rowling s style is very simple  Not the elegant simplicity that comes from experience but just very simple and basic  It works well for children  however  though it is not ideal  The characters are generic and the entire world is not a new innovation but a collection of old myths  legends  and a rehash of epic stories and children s fiction  But Rowling has done this meticulously The detailed planning that has gone into turning this whole world real is what gives this series it s charm  There is a working formula for every bit of magic in Rowling s world  The creatures  stories  characters   everything references stories we all heard growing up  Except once we began figuring out that they weren t real Rowling came along and said they are real and explained HOW  Every good fantasy writer knows how to do this and Rowling did it too  The generic good vs evil archetypal characters in the series has also received a lot of criticism  There is no denying that there are such archetypal characters   in fact she glories in them  I believe these archetypal characters are what I liked  They remind me of epic tales and old myths and have a vintage feel to them that I can dig  They are not so black and white that they could be dangerous for an impressionable child to read   Rowling highlights plenty of greys  eg the characters of snape  malfoy  pettigrew  etc  but she does it very slowly  More of as a coming of age thing  The characters are not unique or strange enough to be realistic  But they are real enough in the fact that every single personal can relate to them for being so generic  I d say it s easier reading for children as imagination always supplies what is lacking or at least it did for me  I loved these books growing up and I have fond memories of them  There are better  more realistic fantasies out there  But I knew them not when I was a kid and I am not so much a hardened mature reader that I can reject a book I once loved just because I can now see it s shortcomings  Harry Potter will always charm me  In my book harry potter and the sorcerer s stone  I recommend the book to my friends  because it is an excellent book that you could read  The reason I said it is an excellent book to read is  because the author did a great job writing and using her imagination to create the book  The Author did not just do a good job with writing the chamber of secrets  but with all the Harry Potter books  Here is one example of her imagination  One by one the ghost flouted away through the opposite wall  that is a classic example of someone using their imagination in a story  The Harry Potter saga is well known around the world  Therefore  even if you never saw the Harry Potter books than you should have at least heard of them  Or at least talked about it with your friends or anyone else that likes to talk about Harry Potter chamber of secrets  That is why I personally want to recommend this book to  because it is such an amazing book you could read  The first reason why I would recommend the book to a friend is  because if you are one of those types of readers that reads five or more books in a month than this book is perfect for you  If you like magic  and everything else in a fiction book than you would like the book  The reason why you would like the book is  because it is a great compelling adventure that is masterfully imagined for all ages to read  And it is also an award winning books so  you know that the book is going to be epic when you read Harry Potter the sorcerer s stone  If you are in the process of reading the series than  it would be recommended that you read the book  because the book carries on where the last book left off  The reason why you would want to continue reading the series is  because the book has key information about Harry Potters story therefore it would be unwise to skip the book  because you would lose out on the whole story  The second reason why I would recommend is  because the book has a lot of action  drama  magic mischief  Here is an example  dobby froze  horrorstruck  then grabbed harry water jug from his bed side and smashed it on his head  that is one example of drama found in the book  Which are the characteristics that you might really like in the Harry Potter book  it might make you want to keep reading the book just to find out what happens on the next page  I would recommend it also  because Harry Potter is fun to read  I am pretty sure that everybody has heard about Harry Potter Therefore I would recommend Harry Potter sorcerer s stone to my friends  Another  reason why I would recommend it is because it is a famous book which might encourage you to actually read the book  because it is well known and loved by fans all over the world  I personally think this book is epic book to read The third reason why I would recommend Harry Potter and the sorcerer s stone  because if your just one of those types that like reading than this book will be great  Also if you just like the thrill of fast passed and interesting book  than this book would be great for you to read  The reason why it would be excellent for you to read the book is  because it has a lot of witchcraft  For an example people using magic to hurt each other  people making potions etc  if you are a first time reader of the harry Potter  than you should read the book  because once you start reading you will never want to ever stop  therefore this book is highly recommend to a book enthusiast  Also here is an example of someone using magic against another  There were thousands and thousands of candles fluting in midair  In my conclusion Harry Potter and the sorcerer s stone is a magic packed book with a mix of adventure and drama  and of magic  I would recommend it because it s about how Harry potter first fought Voldermolt  Also my friends like Harry Potter too therefore I would  also personally recommend it to my friends because it was written by my most favorite author  The author is well known around the world for Harry Potter saga  I wouldn t recommend this book to anyone else than my friends  And on a last note I would recommend this book to anyone who is willing to read this amazing book   This book  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone  by J K  Rowling was a good book  Harry Potter lived with his aunt and uncle  because his parents passed away when he was a baby  What Harry didn t know was that he was wizard  which he found out on his eleventh birthday  He goes to Hogwarts for school and Harry finds out about Voldemort  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone  was written in third person  The main character was Harry Potter  Harry Potter s two best friends are Ron and Hermione  Hermione was more the serious and smart one  Ron was more a person who wanted to have fun  Voldemort was the one that gave Harry his scar on his forehead and Voldemort killed both of Harry s parents  Vernon Dursley and Petunia Dursley was Harry s uncle and aunt  The story took place at the Dursley s house and Hogwarts  Harry was living with the Dursley s house  When Harry was living at Dursley s house  he was treated more like a slave than family  When Harry turns eleven he gets to come to Hogwarts school  Harry found out why he felt different than everyone else  but when he goes to Hogwarts he felt like he was at home  Two of the themes are desire and the values of humility  The theme of desire which took place when Harry looked in The Mirror of Erised which lets you see what you wanted to see  When Harry looked in the mirror  he saw a lifelike image of him with his parents  The second theme deals with the values of humility  This took place when Harry gains fame at Hogwarts he didn t change who he was even though he was famous  I would recommend this book to middle school students  because this book was an easy read and I wanted to keep reading it  I would say this book is good for both genders  because it doesn t just focus on one gender  I really enjoyed this book and plan on reading the rest of the series   Okay  Harry Potter  The cultural trend of all things awesome since 1997   cuz let s face it  EVERYTHING happened in 1997  If you haven t read the series yet  I highly recommend that you do so  The series itself will take you on a thrilling adventure filled with magic  broomsticks  Quidditch  fear  and just about anything else you can imagine     And the ocassional Butterbeer  The series starts off at a point where we learn about a  perfectly normal  family  the Dursley s  We meet three  and a half   people by the end of the first chapter aside from the Dursleys  Albus Dumbledore  Minerva McGonagall  Rubeus Hagrid  and of course  a young Harry Potter  He is left on the Dursley s doorsteps after the murder of his parents  having no idea about what is to come in the next ten years  At one year old  Harry doesn t yet know of his destiny   one that can be learned by reading the book So  the first book of any series is always awesome  But I must say  it s not really my favorite  While I know it was necessary  I felt that a lot of the first book was just getting to know the characters  While the plot of the book was pretty awesome  it seemed to lack the    I want to say familiarity  but I know that s not right  If you ve ever looked at a plot map  you d see that the plot should begin with a straight line  Getting to know the characters    proceeds with a steady incline in pace  THE CLIMAX HAPPENS   Usually the most suspenseful moment in a story    a steady incline  and the story draws to a finish  With a series  there is a big plot scheme  The entire series plot   the grand scheme of things   with several smaller ones that make up the large one   The individual books   Book one was the flat line to me  While it was awesome  the other books seemed to have heavier doses of the qualities that made Book 1 awesome  They are all   AWESOME   but some of the later books were just more awesome  But  of course  you must read the first book to get to the others  If you skip any books in the series  I will be mad at you  Even if I don t know you   Thunder clap I am unsure about how to end this review    so I shall end it rather strangely with this  PLATYPUS  Claire AllsbrookHarry Potter and the Sorcerer s stone review The book Harry Potter is a fictional novel written by J K  Rowling  a single parent who lives in Edinburg with her daughter  The book itself is about a boy named Harry Potter that lives with his terrible aunt  uncle and his cousin Duddley  They are terrible to Harry and make his life miserable  but then he is invited to Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry and his life seems to be turning out well  Harry soon learns about his parents and that he is more popular in the wizarding world for something he didn t even remember doing  The story follows Harry through his 7 years at Hogwarts and the adventures he and his friends experience  The theme of the book seems to be that there is power in friendship  that love will always stay with you and good will always triumph over evil  which is excellent considering this is a youth targeted book  I personally enjoyed the book  it had good morals  the characters were believable  and there was no awkward diologue  Also the thing I liked was since the wizarding world is so vast and different from our daily non magical world or  muggle  world that some things would be difficult to understand but Harry all his life has been in the muggle world so whatever Harry learns we learn right along with him and what we are clueless about the magical world so is Harry  I like in the story that they don t as magicians do any of the  Dark Arts  and the only thing the students take that relates to it is  Defenses against the Dark Arts  and how the spells they learn are never to harm anything but to merely temporarily disable them  I like how the book sort of shows how even if you aren t all that brave or strong you can still do amazing things like how Nevile Longbottom  page 240  stands up to his friends even though throughout the book he is the quirky  shy and weak sort of character that needs help often  and in the end because he stood up to his own friends he is awarded 10 points towards Gryfindor house and wins them the house cup  as Dumbledoor said  it is hard to stand up to your enemies but it is even harder to stand up to your friends       Harry potter and the sorcerer s stone is a well written book with good morals and greatly relates to everyday life for children especially and is worth the money and time to read  Explaining what the first Harry Potter book is about would probably be redundant and completely unnecessary  If you haven t read the book yourself  you have probably watched the movie  or you care so little about the books that you won t bother reading this blog post anyway  So  I won t bother with that part of my review this time My husband was one of those few people who just didn t give a hoot about Harry Potter  He wasn t interested in seeing the movies and he wasn t interested in the craze surrounding the little wizard   Notice I used the word was    I thought that needed to change The Harry Potter books are such a huge part of our popular culture  and the imaginative storytelling of J K  Rowling is so awe inspiring that I very much wanted to share them with Nathan  Plus  I just knew he would love it So  reluctantly  Nathan allowed Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone to become the next on our list of books to read  And  as predicted  he loved the book   See  I knew it  Nathan and I have very different taste in books so it was fun to share a book with him that I have greatly enjoyed and have him appreciate it as well  And so  for now  the book is tucked away until Jack is ready for it  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone is one of my favorite books  It is a wonderfully imaginative book by the great author  J K  Rowling  The magical fantasy novel is about a young boy named Harry Potter who was given the chance to leave the slightly ordinary  Dursley family filled life and trade it for a magical and adventurous filled wizarding life  Harry had been brought up and treated horribly by his boring  plain  Aunt and Uncle and their horrible son Dudley  Life wasn t looking so good for 11  year old Harry until he received a letter that would change his life forever  Harry was able to escape his plain life and enter into a unknown magical world  As Harry meets his two best friends  Ron And Hermione  the possibilities were endless at his new wizarding school  Hogwarts which was luckily very far away from the Dursley s  As the school year proceeds  Harry becomes a very brave and great wizard  a talented Quiditch player  and in secret  is trying to find facts about a very mysterious stone that might just be the answer to all their problems  However his unfortunate past brings out a true test in Harry as he has to use his little adventures throughout the year to face the wizarding worlds enemy  the Dark Lord  I love this book because it really makes you use your imagination  There are so many colorful ideas about Harry s journey that Rowling amazingly written in the story  The detail that the author has added to the makes me feel like i am actually inside the whole adventure with the three best friends  The book is one of her shorter novels however  that means you can read about the rest of Harry s adventures faster   Want to see if Harry prevails in defeating The Dark Lord  Well you will have to read the book      This review marks my first full reread of this book since I read it back in 2000  so I shall wish to call this a retrospective review  I went through this book knowing what ultimately happens in the series as well as learning bonus information through JK Rowling s Pottermore I have to say it was difficult to decide on the star rating for this book  Though I have a bit of an issue with pacing  I have to give it a 5 star since it holds the things I look for in a 5 star rating book  Chief among them  it makes me think about it even after I have put it down I won t get into any specifics   though I cannot see how anything in this could be classified as a spoiler at this point  but whether it was her original plan or not  the author succeeded in weaving nuances and hints to an overarching mystery that would later show fully fledged plans of characters nesting within each other  A lot of authors seem to try this out  but it ultimately ends up shallow  overly convoluted  or basically just a bad case of deus ex machina  I would largely attribute this to the fact that I know that JK Rowling spent many years developing her world  She came up with backgrounds for characters that are never written in the books  she came up with laws and governments  and many more things  And this shows  You can tell when going through the book that things relate to each other and make sense in the setting  This isn t always shown when the author only comes up with little details here and there to hint at a world that isn t actually developed yet I ve heard that Rowling is criticized for having a simple language and writing style  First  I d like to know why that is bad  Let s look at the opposite extreme  William Shakespeare  Normal people don t like reading that  or trying to read it at least  I ve seen too many times where it seems like the author is using big words for no other reason than to appear smart  Or they use constant flowery language to the point that it begins to distract from the story  That aside  yes she uses a pretty simple vocabulary  but she uses it in a way that flows wonderfully  At times it sounds like a classic fairy tale  other times it is like a song  Honestly  I prefer this style much more than those books that I have to look up words constantly My main complaint about this novel that almost made me give it a 4 star is the pacing  Before Harry arrives at Hogwarts  the pace seems to go pretty slowly  then later it just starts rushing by  The climactic confrontation and its lead up ends up taking only about a chapter and a half which made it feel too easy  And this will be a recurring theme in the rest of my retrospective reviews  but why does the denouement only last about the length it takes to walk to the bookcase and pick up the next book   4 9 I loooved this book  It may have to do with the fact that when i read it i was the same age as the main character  harry potter   The plot this is the introduction book to the series and it tells the background of the harry potter and his parents and how he became the one who lived  So Harry gets the letter of invitation to go to Hogwarts but at first his aunt and uncle refuse to let him go  His family is really not likable but i guess every book needs some character to dislike  After Harry goes to Hogwarts with the help of Hagrid he starts finding out about his past  i found the plot to be engaging as the reader is taken through all the steps as harry is and the reader as well as Harry are new to it all  I loved all the plot twists for sure specially the ending The characters The characters are very well developed and introduced nicely by Rowling  I must admit from the beginning you fall in love and sympathize with Harry  Ron and Hermione and you kind of dislike Malfloy but secretly hope he becomes good at some point  I loved the development and growth of the characters specially the friendship between Harry  Ron and Hermione  You really understand where the characters are coming from and what are their motives to do what they do  Environment description This was one of my favorite parts as Rowling described the whole Harry Potter world perfectly  You can really imagen everything being magical  I loved how she goes into details to make sure to create the perfect image in the readers head I give this book 5 stars because i loved it when i was 12 and i loved it 8 years later when i read it again  I really recommend it for everyone who enjoy light reading and specially for children to get them into reading   Rating  10 10 Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone  is a fantastic start to this series  I love the way all the characters are introduced and you know whether to love or hate them  And it is not a mild feeling  you truly learn to feel the extreme  Harry is the perfect protagonist  He is brave and inquisitive  while very loyal to those he loves  You can t help but cheer for him  even when he is breaking the rules  I love Hagrid as well  His devotion to Harry is so touching  He is the connection to the parents he never knew  The way that Hagrid responses to Harry is so very lovely I love how we get to learn and experience this new world of Hogwarts at the same time Harry does  Hogwarts is described so well that I feel like it is a real place  The imagination gone into creating it is truly amazing  I love Hogwarts so much  I wish I could enroll there J K  Rowling writing is so witty and clever  Every sentence is well thought out and essential to the book  She created an amazing world with this first book  encouraging the reader to crave for more  Every chapter grabbed me and was so good to read  I never felt like there was a dull moment where the book started to drag  I don t think there has been a book yet that has affected me emotionally like Harry Potter does I would recommend this book to those who are looking for something different to the average book  If you like a little mystery and danger while loving character development and a bit of fantasy  this book is for you The Questions Entertaining   YesAddictive   YesImpacting   YesThought provoking   YesClean   YesRead it again   YesWould I Recommend it  Yes Fav Quotes   That is because it is a monstrous thing  to slay a unicorn   said Firenze   Only one who has nothing to lose  and everything to gain  would commit such a crime  The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive  even if you are an inch from death  but a terrible price  You have slain something pure and defenseless to save yourself     Well  a second s there to take over is you die   said Ron casually  getting started at last on his cold pie  Catching the look on Harry s face  he added quickly   But people only die in proper duels  you know  with real wizards  The most you and Malfoy ll be able to do is send sparks at each other  Neither of you knows enough magic to do any real damage  I bet he expected you to refuse  anyway   And what if I wave my wand and nothing happens    Throw it away and punch him on the nose   Ron suggested    Your mother died to save you  If there is one thing Voldemort cannot understand  it is love  He didn t realize that love as powerful as your mother s for you leaves its own mark  Not a scar  no visible sign    to have been loved so deeply  even though the person who loved you is gone  will give us some protection forever  It is in your very skin  It was agony to touch a person marked by something so good  The magic was in the air  impressivly designed with great creativety  enjoyed the loyalty of Ron  always having Harry s back  and the friendship w  Harry from the very start  took me emotionally into a whole new world and enjoyed it very much  Thx J C    In the first of Harry Potter s adventures  the reader is introduced to a boy who encounters strange occurrences throughout his childhood  When he discovers through some persistent letters that he is a wizard  everything makes sense  He is sent to Hogwarts  a school of wizardry  in another world that is different from any he s ever known  This book appeals to all age groups and is a great read for children who need motivation to read  because of its captivating nature  I read this book for the first time as a 20 year old and loved it  J K  Rowling tells this incredibly creative story with descriptive language and perfect imagery  I think that s what gives this book so much appeal  the story is so easy to imagine  With her big imagination  Rowling fully describes the wizard world  including culture  social hierarchy  education  social life  and even good and evil forces  I was very impressed with how fast the story flew by  when you let your imagination follow Rowling  everything flies   As an adult I was very hesitant to get involved in this series  I have 2 younger siblings who showed interest in the movies and after the first movie I was hooked I have never taken much interest in books that become movies because the movies never seem to do them justice  So I decided this would be a movie series  I was still resolved not to touch the books  For the following 7 movies we bought tickets weeks in advance and waited in crowds for midnight showings  By the end of Deathly Hallows Part 2 we had planned a venture to Universal Studios Wizarding World of Harry Potter and many of my adult friends where telling me the books were a must read So I caved  And I LOVED THEM  I started the series in August  I made a valient effort to finish all 7 books in 4 months  our trip was in November  but that was a pie in the sky goal  I made it through book 5 by our trip  By the end of December I had completed the entire series  My advice for those of you holding out like I was   Read the books  If you like fantasy you won t regret it  I love Harry Potter  I just finished reading the entire series again for the third or fourth time  The thing I find most interesting about the story is it the organic growth  Not only of Harry and his friends as they progress through each year  but the themes get progressively more intense  a little darker  and the action sort of grows with Harry  The first book is pretty straightforward in that everything is very simple on the surface  Harry has a rotten childhood  Snape hates him  Dumbledore is sort of a nice old man  and Voldemort is just a fragment  a scary parasite that doesn t really have a true form yet  But it is only the beginning for Harry and Ron and Hermione  I started reading them in the fifth or sixth grade  and by the time Harry was leaving Hogwarts  I had just left high school and was in college so I sort of grew up with Harry  In each book  Rowling delves into issues that are age specific  Eleven year old Harry has some of the same problems as many other eleven year olds  making him a sort of  everyman  but for kids  All in all Harry Potter is an excellent series written by a gifter author  I consider book one to be my least favorite and I still absolutely love it and have no problem reading it over and over again   I don t read too many books twice  none actually  I m usually ready to put them to bed so I can move on to the next one  However  given that Harry Potter and his series of witchcraft and wizardry was such a powerful inspiration for me when I first read each book  I ve decided to give them another go  Also  it has been a decade since I last read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone  so I thought I should see how it I have changed based on the story at hand  Would I still love it as much as I did  How well would I like it knowing everything I know now concerning the success of the series  the resolution of the characters  and the film versions  Finally  as a thriving novelist  you are supposed to read and write what you love  That lead me directly to the HP books  starting with Numero Uno with rereads of the rest to follow And I m super glad I did  I tell you  as I approached the end  even knowing Harry Potter and Hogwarts  fate  I still got chills  I even teared up a little bit  Now  that is a powerful story  You know  it s not  great literature   but it sure is a fun read  When I would think of the series as a whole  book 4 is the one that always stood out as a favorite  but this first one is pretty solid Just watched the movie after I finished the book today  and while the movie did a pretty good job of covering most of what was in the book  the book easily wins out between the two  Watching Rupert Grint s portrayal of Ron was pretty great  though By the way  I agree with the reviewer who remarked that most of the action in Quidditch is pretty useless  You ve got to get a lead of more than 15 goals in order for the other team s snitch catch to not seal a win for them  Now if the normal goals were worth 30 or 50 points each  things would be a bit more interesting  But then Harry s role wouldn t be quite so exciting  would it  Rating  PG for some suspenseful moments and a couple of scenes that could be scary for little ones Stuff I liked  from the book  Hagrid got Fluffy from a Greek guy  Awesome  Cerberus  the 3 headed dog  guards the way to Hades  the underworld  in Greek mythology   To the well organized mind  death is but the next great adventure     Dumbledore  view spoiler  You know  the Stone was really not such a wonderful thing  As much money and life as you could want  The two things most human beings would choose above all  the trouble is  humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them   hide spoiler      Dumbledore I read the first chapter of this book years ago but never finished  even though I bought the book for my younger sister and had ample opportunity  What likely held me back is the outrageous number of times I have spent sitting with my mom to watch the movie  invariably only seeing the infamous bathroom scene and not much else  This quickly poisoned me against the series to the point of publicly proclaiming near and far how lame the series apparently was and how I would never be caught dead reading the books   but the first chapter was pretty good from what I could recall This year for Christmas  we got the entire series on DVD  The third installment  printed correctly on the disc and enclosures  is actually Polar Express  despite being straight from the store  Anyway  I found out I really enjoyed watching the movies with my husband and quickly became a fan  much like many of my friends  Recently I came into possession of my own copy  since a co worker had a spare  I immediately tore into it  reading it during downtime at work  I found myself not wanting to put it down to see what happens  sometimes almost to my detriment  When I wasn t reading it  I was watching the films  scouring Pinterest  and reading interviews rife with spoilers whether I had seen that one or not  basically absorbing the series as best as I could So what did I find so enjoyable  First and foremost  it is a story with heart and a lot of interesting things going on  Although I am not really a sports fan  I even enjoyed the parts dealing with the Quidditch matches and would not have minded one more inclusion  There is enough action to interest me as an adult reader in enough detail to be realistic or even anxiety inducing to some readers  but it does not go too far by the same measure  I suppose the sense of realism is right on the nose in this way  There is a definitive voice  charmingly funny and full of gentle humor  that is distinct enough that I cannot help but dub Rowling s voice over it as I read  Every character  good or bad  is loved and given a purpose  To humanize instead of glamorize  characters are described as being ordinary or by more humble aspects  This may be one of my favorite things about the series  especially as it deals with reader self esteem  Characters do not come out on top every single time  and they are given meaningful chances to grow and make choices throughout the text  I wish more books would do this  What I did find annoying  however  was the over abundance of commas where other punctuation may have been more appropriate  I also wonder about how much the American izing of this text changed it  It was surprising to hear that in its original version  they were seeking a Philosopher s Stone  but American readers were predicted to be less interest in that  I really hope we deserve more credit than that  because I would love the story either way  I have read this book many times  This is the first review I have ever written about this book Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone is the beginning of the life of an ordinary boy until he receives some mysterious letters  His aunt and uncle are determined not to let Harry receive these letters The story is slow at first just so that you can be introduced to the many characters  You meet Dumbledore  Harry  Aunt Petunia  Uncle Vernon  Dudley  Hermione  Ron  Hagrid and many more  I love all the interesting descriptions of these characters this helps with being able to connect with them on a very personal level Harry is surprised to learn that he is a wizard and that his parents were great ones  I loved the part when Harry learns that he is a wizard  Hagrid is a huge lovable character  He is like a big teddy bear Harry learns a lot about his new world before he even starts at Hogwarts  Harry doesn t know anything about the Wizarding World and he is afraid of making a total fool of himself  While Harry is shopping for his supplies he meets his young nemesis Draco Malfoy  Harry is very alert as to not trusting him from the start I could go on and on about this book even though it isn t my favorite  It is great for being the first book in the series but not the best  I love fairy tales  and stories where the hero has to conquer seemingly insurmountable difficulties  My college age daughters think I am nuts for reading Harry Potter  but I think that they may have secretly started down the road to Hogwarts  By starting with Harry at age ten and working backwards and forwards  Rowling has given us a protagonist with whom nearly everyone can identify I think that these books have affected so many people because they do not talk down to children  but rather raise the level of discourse between author and child  Also  they boldly address the gamut of issues that everyone  but most especially children  secretly fear  from having one s motives misunderstood or  jealousy  to physical harm treachery  and even death They also send a message of comfort  assuring the reader that parents really do love their children  that there are teachers and other adults in life who can be trusted  and most especially that we all get by with a little help from our friends  There are some who say the Harry Potter series are entertaining but not much in the area of literary quality  If that s true  I don t know  But one thing I do know is that it is possible for books like the Harry Potter series to be both entertaining and of good literary quality  When you consider that this series was originally considered children s literature  it s amazing how it has transcended boundaries and has appealed to adults and children alike  I originally read this book when I was about 10 or 11 and remember being amazed at all the whimsy and magic  but at the same time I felt that each character was so life like  Re reading this book today  more than ten years later from the first time I read it  I am still so hooked on the story and am fascinated by how many life lessons the Harry Potter series possesses and teaches its readers  I m definitely not a hardcore Harry Potter fan  but this book series is special and one that I ll always remember  Literary quality be damned  I love this book  sometimes that is all that matters  Harry Potter came to live with the Dursleys as an infant after his parents died  He s spent the last ten years being treated poorly by both Mr    Mrs  Dursley and their spoiled rotten son Dudley  Harry s life starts to change when he receives mail but it s snapped up by Mr  Dursley  When they see who the letters are from they attempt to keep them from Harry even dragging him away from their home  On his eleventh birthday while away from home Harry is startled awake by a strange visitor named Hagrid who tells him all about who he really is  As Harry embarks on the adventure of a lifetime  everything will be different from the last ten years and it won t be easy   Harry makes new friends in Gryffindor s house where the magic hat as assigned him  Together with his two new close friends the trio are not only tasked with school but with trying to figure out what is hiding behind Hagrid s dog fluffy  Not only does Harry learn about magic but he also learns about his past and who his parents are even uncovering a magic mirror  Everything isn t all good something dark is lurking still intent on getting at Harry Potter  Will they solve the mystery and save Harry  I liked Harry granted he s only 11 but his character doesn t come off as a child he s easy to connect with filled with courage and I couldn t help wanting to cheer him on  I liked his friends however Hermione got on my nerves with her know it all  I just wanted to strangle her a few times  However when I mentioned this to my hubby he promised that she will get better as the books progress  I loved to hate Draco as well he s such a pain  I decided to read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s stone for two reasons  My hubby has been harping on me to read it for ages even though I ve seen the movie and it was perfect for my monopoly game  The characters are engaging and easy to connect with you can t help cheering them on  The author has created a unique concept by putting her own twist on the boarding school loaded with magic  I ve not read many witch wizard books but this one was really good  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone was a fast read I just had to find the time to sit down and read  I like the book it s well written and flows along smoothly so kids as well as adults will enjoy the story  I watched the movie right after the only difference I noticed was how the ending was different but I think they did a really great job of making the movie match the book  Plus it had dragons     I m looking forward to reading the next one  I know my hubby is as well    Harry Potter has lived a dismal life with his aunt and uncle  the Dursleys  He sleeps in a closet and has never had a birthday party or Christmas presents  Even worse  he has to endure life with his horrible spoiled cousin  Dudley  Then on Harry s eleventh birthday  things change when a letter arrives   by owl   inviting him to attend the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry  Suddenly Harry finds himself among friends  learning about potion making and magic wand waving and broomstick riding  There re chocolate frogs and Every Flavor Beans and a three headed dog and Quidditch a game better than soccer  Also  Hagrid  a lovable gamekeeper who befriends Harry  Hermione Granger  a witch who s read all the school books and knows all the rules  and there s Ron Weasly  Harry s best friend who has quite a legacy of his own to fill  Hogwarts treats him well  even with the abomidable Malfoy s mean tricks or Professor Snape s obvious hatred of Harry  The soon Harry finds himself in the middle of a mystery at Hogwarts  and together with his two new friends  embarks on adventures he never dreamed possible  The book is engaging with its imagery  humor  plot twists and real life child problems  The book doesn t only appeal to children but adults as well  She s a master on fantasy  She really can  with no difficulty at all  think herself back to 11 years old  You will love the whimsical descriptions  humorous quotes and the fun characters  Synopsis  Harry  an extra ordinary boy in a an ordinary place has been living with his aunt and uncle for about 11 years  after being dropped off at their door in the middle of the night  He comes to find that he  being almost 11  has been accepted into a school  for extra ordinary boys and girls like him  Harry is then thrust into the world of wizardry  He then learns of the events that led up to him being dropped off at the Dursley s  and the man who destroyed his life and killed his parents  Harry  befriended by Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger  start their journey along a path that gets darker and darker through his time at school and  confronts his greatest enemy  the man   he who should not be named   Voldemort  the dark wizard who killed his parents  and would change his life forever Review  I  like most all people who have read these adventurous books  are absolutely enchanted by the stories told behind J K  Rowling s Harry Potter books  This book  like all the rest  are very descriptive and create a new magical world  one right under the noses of the regular people or  muggles   I love this book  Harry Potter is not a challenging read  but each time I read it I seem to pick something new up from the story  and every time I am changed by how I perceive the story of the boy who survived  This book is good for all ages  and I recommend that everyone read it  along with the others  even though I ve read the books multiple times  I never get tired of the adventure  mystery  terror  and love that this book shares with you   Everyone probably remembers the first time they read this one J K  Rowling first put a spell on me on Thanksgiving Day  1998 When I was younger  I had a speech cognition disability that made it difficult to enjoy reading  My school system told my mother that I would probably never read or write beyond the level of a sixth grader  She fought them and gave me plenty of books to read  but it was never something I was extremely passionate about  I ve always had an over active imagination  But for some reason  nothing I read ever seemed to fully grasp my attention  On Thanksgiving  while my aunts were busy putting turkey into the oven and making ten billion other dishes  I was laying around the not so kid friendly house  bored as hell   Since I broke my leg several months earlier  I couldn t run around and play games like hide and seek with my brother and sister  My told me to come into the kitchen  she had a present for me In her hands she held Harry Potter   the Sorceror s Stone I didn t know what to think of it  what kid expects a book when their mom says present I went to the living room and started to read When it was time for turkey  my mom had to scream at me several times   PUT THE BOOK DOWN AND COME TO THE TABLE  The characters are wonderful  The story is wonderful  The imaginative world  one that I still wish I was a part of  is wonderful I admit   I cried when I didn t receive my acceptance letter to Hogwarts Harry Potter changed my life forever  I never would have loved reading or writing without J K  Rowling  I never would have become so invested in learning  I never would have proved my school system wrong  I never would have made the honor roll  Life would be so weird without Harry Potter   I wouldn t be a captain of a Quidditch team  I wouldn t be called  Ginny Weasley  by my friends and other students  I wouldn t read fantasy novels or watch sci fi television  I wouldn t dream the dreams I dream If not for Harry Potter  I wouldn t be a Writing major in college If not for Harry Potter  I wouldn t have such an incredible drive to do what JKR did for me  inspire children to be all that they can be If not for Harry Potter  I wouldn t be the person I am today  2010 Review After neglecting to read the series  and also after trying to avoid fantasy novels for good   here I am  finally seeing what the hype is all about  While Harry Potter is a light  well written  and highly entertaining read  I didn t find it enough for me to jump on the diehard fan bandwagon  True  I will in the near future splurge on better copies of HP just for the sake of loving and adoring the story so far  It really isn t my type to go with mainstream of any kind  but I won t lie about wanting to finish the series  It is gripping and unexpectedly funny My review regarding this first book is based on starting and reading HP in general  Ideally  the first installation should be great so the readers would ask for more  I guess this my saying that I want to read  or currently reading  the next one would suggest how well loved the series is  This is a highly understated review  but given the fact that I am not yet under its full spell  this would have to do  I am starting to adore Harry Potter  but I don t see myself lining up for the premier night of HPDH Part II  I m happy loving it in a low profile kind of way So this is it  My adventure with Harry just started  See you at the end 2012 Review Fuck you  2010 Self  Fuck you  You were witless and skeptical and I am ashamed of ever being connected with you  Harry Potter is the best thing that will ever happen in your miserable life and you better be thankful for it Also  you DID line up for the midnight premiere of HPDH Part II  Douche  A minha mae comprou me este livro ha muitos anos  Nao o comprou para mim  mas sim para ela  Por volta dos 9 10 anos foi a primeira vez que o li  Nao havera no mundo alguma coisa que me tenha influenciado tanto  ou ira  como a leitura deste livro  A sua leitura  que se foi repetindo ao longo dos anos  trouxe me o gosto pelo meu maior interesse que jamais terei em toda a minha vida  a saga Harry Potter  Ja tentei  noutros momentos  explicar a estima que tenho por esta colecao e pela autora  J K  Rowling escreveu uma historia tao complexa e maravilhosa que  quando releio  volto a descobrir novas particularidades da sua escrita e novos detalhes da historia que fazem com que tudo faca realmente sentido  A forma profunda de como ela descreve os acontecimentos e nos transporta para outra realidade e genial Um dos aspectos particulares que admiro nesta saga e o contraste com a  literatura barata   Completamente o oposto  Harry Potter e uma historia completamente rica em pormenores  acontecimentos  enigmas  personagens que se tornam reais e mais do que isso  nossas amigas  Ao longo do tempo  sentimos que os personagens da historia fazem parte de nos  e no momento mais avancado  vivemos os seus problemas  tristezas e alegrias  Ao longo do tempo  tornamo nos nos mesmos uma certa personagem  Acho brilhante a maneira de como neste livro e descrita a sociedade inglesa e a sociedade de bruxos ingleses  A verdade e que  a historia central  da Pedra Filosofal  e real  e a meu ver  foi nessa historia que Rowling se inspirou para escrever este livro  A magia e bruxaria  gracas a estas leituras  fizeram com que desde sempre eu gostasse e ficasse do lado dos bruxos perante as pessoas que os consideravam  aberracoes   e e por isso que nao apoio quando fazem criticas desse genero a esta saga  This book tells the story of a young boy named Harry Potter  In the beginning of the book  strange things start happening to Harry  Both of Harry s parents passed away when he was a baby  so Harry lives with his aunt and uncle who treat him terribly  He receives hundreds of letters from a place named Hogwarts  but his aunt and uncle do not let him read them  Eventually Harry finds out that he is a wizard and travels to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry  Harry becomes a member of the house of Gryffindor  and becomes best friends with Ron and Hermione  He learns how to spells and how to fly on a broomstick  and learns that he is very good at quidditch  At Hogwarts  Harry learns the truth about how his parents die  With the help of Ron and Hermione  Harry uses his wit and courage to face Voldemort and rescue the sorcerer s stone  I chose a Harry Potter book for my book commercial because it has been my favorite series since I was in elementary school  and it is easy for me to try to persuade other people to read them  I love the details and the depth of the plots in these stories  They definitely appeal to people of all ages   I was always known as the kid who adores reading  still am  and I can honestly say it s all thanks to Jo Rowling  It was particularly this book that got me into reading in the first place  I ve never wanted to read a book if it wasn t absolutely mandatory before this one  and I ve always done it in a bad temper  skipping pages and stuff  But  one day  my dad and I went to his friend s house and when I entered his daughter s room  I saw her lying on the bed  reading a book and all I could think about was how cool she looked doing it  I asked her what book she was reading and the next thing I knew   I was asking my dad to buy me a copy of Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone  That s how my interest for books blossomed and it only grew from there on  So  thank you very very very much  J K  Rowling  you re not even aware of the favour you ve done to me  You ve completely reshapen mine and my brother s childhoods  Although I was young  I still remember that we were quite poor back then  We didn t own a copy for a long time  but there was always someone in our building who could afford it  so basically  our whole building depended on that one copy that was being passed up to everyone who wanted to read it  We lived on the top floor and were one of the last ones to get our hands on it  so it was pretty shabby by the time it got to us  but we didn t mind  It is one of the most vivid memories I carry from my childhood  So  all in all  thank you very much     I started reading these books when I was in elementary school when my father who was trying to get me interested in reading read them aloud with me every night  With my severe ADHD and mild dyslexia reading was my least favorite activity  besides math  but soon after my father and I blew through the first book we became obsessed with Harry Potter and the fantastic world that JK Rowling has created  Not only did this book teach me how to read but it kick started my passion for wonderful universe of fiction  I am now 21 and i still re read the first harry potter  I see so many more layers to this novel now that i am older that i couldn t have understood as a child  it is filled with messages about right and wrong  and teaches you to question authority and find out the facts for yourself  It shows you that not everything is as it seems and that anything is possible if you believe in yourself  Some may say that it is cheesy but those are the people who watched the movie before they read the book  there is so much to the plot line in the book that the audience doesn t see in the movie    This is not just a children s book  Everything  even the most small  and minute details have a purpose to the series  it is an amazing first stop on a journey into the magical world of Hogwarts   J K  Rowling is one of the first writers I read when I was finally able to read alone  Of course I read books at school but I had a friend in Primary school  I will never forget her  She had this same kind of hair as Hermione  she was clever and adorable  She was my best friend  She read a lot and told me to go read Harry Potter  I think I was eight maybe nine  So I started this book  in Dutch of course and my mom had to drag me to the dinner table and all the other things  She bought me all the other books because she loved to see me read  I talked almost every day about Harry Potter thanks to my  Hermione Best Friend   How I fell in love with Harry in this book  Harry was in the beginning without a doubt my favourite character  He is funny and really brave  I liked him a lot  I of course also liked Hermione  She was like me  When I was younger  I didn t have many friends because I was to shy to talk to anybody  I rather read than talk to other people  in the end I was brave enough to make friends  Without knocking out a twelve foot tall mountain troll but that s beside the point  I read a lot and thought I knew a lot and my mom often called me a bossy know it all  So that s how I also fell in love with Hermione  The writing style from Rowling is of course very easy because it s a child book  However it s very funny  The things with Fred and George  Or the part with the mountain troll and becoming friends after that  The way she describes things speaks to me and makes me laugh all the time When I re read this now I have to be honest that it hurts very much to read about Sirius or James and Lily  Because the last two years I ve been a big Marauder fan  I ve got a phone case from it and I ve got James Potter his wand so I blinked away a few tears maybe a bit much but I felt the pain especially now Halloween is coming near  However the bright side of Halloween is Harry  Ron and Hermione became friends  Re reading is a great joy and I can t wait to continue  However this already took me a week because of school  I have midterm exams now  The only thing by the way that I don t understand is why Hermione lies to McGonagall about why she was in the toilets  If she just said  I was here not knowing about the troll and Harry and Ron came to get me  Nothing bad would happen but her saying she wanted to take on the troll on her own  Everybody knew she was lying come on at that moment Hermione wasn t a person who skipp the rules   I don t get this part  By protecting Harry and Ron she could have said that there wasn t a fight so McGonagall didn t have to know that  Although I was a keen reader at a young age  it was the magical Harry Potter series that really got me hooked  We all know what it is about so I ll keep the outline brief  The story begins with an abandoned and vulnerable baby Harry who has been left at his not so friendly Uncle and Aunty s after losing his parents in a mysterious explosion  After going through a neglected childhood  at the age of 11 he receives a letter from Hogwarts to find out he is actually a Wizard  During his time at school he meets his best friends  Ron and Hermione  They lead themselves into a series of magical adventures  their friendships are tested and Harry learns that an evil  powerful wizard named Voldemort is seeking the Philosopher s stone in order to be immortal and end Harry s life the same way his parent s did  The appropriate age range for this book is 7 11  Although it is set in a magical fantasy land  the deeply descriptive and personal writing of this book really allows the reader to feel connected to each individual character and experience their magical adventures with them  Consequently it could be used to inspire a creative writing piece in the classroom  The whole story  and series  teaches children about the importance of friendship  growing up and how doing the right thing is not always the easiest   Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone is the first book in a series of 7 written by J K Rowling  In this debut novel by Rowling we meet Harry Potter  a young boy who has spent the first 10 years of his life living a miserable existence with his Aunt Petunia  Uncle Vernon and cousin Dudley after his parents were killed when he was just a baby  He soon realises that he is no ordinary boy  he is in fact a young wizard  famous throughout the wizarding community as being the only survivor of the attack which killed his parents when he was 1 years old by the evil Lord Voldemort  He is whisked away to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry where he meets a close group of friends  discovers more about his past and learns how to become a fully fledged wizard  Discovering the significance of his survival all those years ago  he learns about the battle which raged between good and evil amongst the wizarding world at the time of his birth  When the evil Lord Voldmort threatens to rise to power once again  it is down to Harry  with the help of his new friends Ron and Hermoine to stop him I have given this book 5 stars  having read this book originally in 1998 when I was 13  I feel I read it at a time before the Harry Potter mania we know now had begun  At this time it was largely unknown by my peers and I felt as though I had stumbled upon something special  until that point there hadn t been a book that I was so engrossed with and I felt like it really did transport me into a different world  Despite being a children s book  this really is a must read for anyone aged 8 to 80  in fact as the series progresses the subject matter does become quite dark and in some ways I feel written to be read by an older audience As a tool for the classroom this book could be used in a number of ways  read by the teacher to the entire class it would be sure to inspire young minds and to encourage them to be more creative in their writing  Moreover  as the Harry Potter brand had become so famous nowadays  with blockbuster films and theme parks being based around it  it may encourage children to want to read the book  which may in turn spark a lifelong interest in reading and therefore improve literacy  Harry Potter  The first time i heard that name i was in primary school  probably in the first or second year  My older sister came home so excited  begging my mum to buy this book called  Harry Potter   promising that we were going to love it  Since both my sister and i had trouble reading my mum was eager to encourage us  as well as having a passion for books herself  These were the days when she would read to us  both curled on either side so we could follow the words with our eyes  I first met Harry Potter like that  curled up on the couch  I think my dad was listening in too as he quickly developed a fondness of  Potty  just as strong as ours  The books quickly became something special  a constant presence in my childhood as we waited for each book and then movie to come out  AND everybody was reading Harry Potter  Harry Potter was so much part of my childhood that rereading them is like going back to visit old friends  The books  to me  are never anything less than amazing I am completely and utterly bias   On my 3rd go around and this book still gets 5 stars  I remember about 10 or so years ago when I first heard of this  thinking that it would be a stupid teeny bopper fantasy series    and who knows maybe it is     But I love it either way  My 15 y o son has been a Potter fan for years  hey anything I can do to encourage my kids to read   and asked if we could reread these and then watch the movie and compare the differences  For the record he prefers the movies   Uuuuggghhhhh     I prefer the books  I don t think a review is necesary as most have seen the movie and or read the book   if not I am sure you have heard of it and the cult following it has generated  I also won t do a full comparrison of the book movie   just a couple of thoughts Uncle Dursley was cast perfectly   looks just like I imagined him I won t flatter many of the actors but Alan Rickman is a genius both in the past and in this role   brilliant actor plays this part to near perfection IMHO Petunia and Dudley have blond hair   why is that so difficult to cast   the first 2 books and movies have always been my favorites because they are so much more child friendly    from 3 on there seems a darker element which is still cool but loses some of it s youthful charm for me   my favortie from 3 7 has always been the half blood prince   but the movie was borderling atrocious for me   2011 review  This series never gets old  I truly feel that every single time I read these books  I m revisiting old friends  It s so comforting  I would even say that I enjoy re reading this series even more than I did reading it the first time  Why  Well  the first time around  I was so eager to know what happened that I just blew right through the story  wanting to read it for myself before anyone else could spoil it for me  But each time I re read  I m struck by the little things  I find that I go back and re read passages two and three times  and in this book especially  I love meeting the characters for the first time  I enjoy lingering over the funny moments  and I always tear up during the emotional ones  So excited to be re reading  2009 review  Rereading this felt like cracking open an old photo album and thinking   My God  I can t believe how much we ve all grown   I found it even more engaging knowing what I know now  having read all seven books   Such a different  but equally fantastic experience  I m looking forward to the progression of the plotline  Rowling s writing  and the development intricacies of the characters all over again This is a book that I look forward to revisiting many times in my life As I struggle with my rating  I realize that I m actually finding it hard to separate my feelings for this book from my overall feelings about the series  To me  they are all so wrapped up in each other that I just can t rate this book independently of the others  Hands down  this is a five star series  so I guess that s what I m going with  I rated this a 5 star because of the impact it had on my life rather than the actual content of the book itself  So this isn t really a review but more of an account of the impact Harry Potter had on my life  I was about 12 years old when this book came out and prior to this  I had a very vague interest in reading which to my family is a bit worrisome since they are all such voracious readers  I used to read a lot of comics  manga  and also what my sisters would call  childish  books like Sweet Valley Twins with large print that wouldn t hurt my eyes  My sisters tried to upgrade me to Enid Blyton  like Famous 5 and even Malory Towers  but I was turned off by the small words and didn t even bother with them  So my sister in a last ditch attempt to get me to read  proper  books  and knowing how much I loved reading manga  decided to get me Harry Potter and the Philosopher s stone  She literally told me that Harry Potter is a lot like Manga stories but in book form  So Harry Potter became the first  proper  book I read as a 12 year old kid and thankfully not the last  After that I was hooked to reading  I started reading all the Enid Blyton books that my sister had bought for me  Famous 5  Malory towers  Secret 7  St Clare s  and was wondering what an idiot I was to have ignored all these books  By the time I was 13  I had definitely upgraded in reading and started reading all the classics  Pride and Prejudice  Jane Austen  Women in White  Little Women  Anne of Green Gables  Robinson Crusoe  Count of Monte Cristo  Dracula  in my family s library Since then  it s always been tradition for my sister to give me a Harry potter book on the day of its release  all the way to Deathly Hollows even though by then I was full grown adult  As an adult  when I read the first harry potter book I can t help but smile  even though my adult brain keeps screaming about all the inconsistencies  the plotholes and stock standard side characters  because of what the first Harry potter book did for me as a 12 year old kid  Loved  loved delving into the world of Harry Potter  With four children aged 11 through 4 the audio edition on CD was a great Summer reading alternative for us  As a Christian I remember all the  Harry Potter debates  a decade or so ago when the books became such a huge success  I have no problem with the Harry Potter books  even while being a spiritual parent who strives to protect and instruct her children  I found it to be a wonderful  very fanciful piece of writing  The witchcraft  while the Bible does warn against it  I feel  is purely fanciful  Not much different from the magic found in most of children s fairy tales and fables written originally to instruct children in morality  J K  Rowling brings to the focus through literature the struggle of good and evil  I have a very nerdy confession  Having a hard time sitting still during our listening to The Sorcerer s Stone   I am not good at sitting  I worked on a Harry Potter wordle  and took some notes  Knowing that this series in fact a very intelligent read  I am trying to get the most of J K Rowling s work Renting the DVD the day after we finished the book was a fun family night too Highly recommend to the next up coming generation of young readers and their parents    Books  And cleverness  There are more important things   friendship and bravery  Re visiting Harry Potter is like going to see an old friend  you know what they look like and you know what they re personality is  you even know what kind of trouble they manage to get themselves into but it still feels new and exciting all the same It had been just over a year since I sat down and re read the Harry Potter series for the umpteenth time so I thought now would be a good time to start re reading it for my challenge and I was right  The second I opened those pages and read the first few lines I felt happy and secure  I was back with Harry  Ron and Hermione  I was home At 2 20 am April 25th 2011 I closed the Philosopher s Stone once again and sighed  so many more great adventures awaited and I wanted to immediately start Chamber of Secrets and continue my re reading adventure but  sadly  sleep beckoned me and I had to leave it Reading Harry Potter this time feels extra special because  all too soon  it s coming to an end with the second part of the Deathly Hallows movie coming all too fast  It feels like the last time I ll ever read it  even though I know it s not  and it also feels like the first time I ever read  again even though I know it s not  It feels old and new  and end and a beginning Philosopher s Stone will always be held closely to my heart because it s where I began making my friends  like so many others  these friends that will stay with me long after it ends  When I first read Philosopher s Stone I was 8 years old  now I m 22 and I still feel like that little girl that was eagerly awaiting her 11th birthday so she could get her Hogwarts Letter and run off to this magical place I ll always wait for that letter  no matter how old I get Just expect reviews like this for the entire HP re read because it always makes me a sappy  sorry mess when I read it  Well      this was a re read and it was like catching up with old friends It s where it all began  Harry s discovery that he was a wizard and his introduction to the wizarding world and all its danger and splendour  It has reinforced my love of these books  the settings and the characters  I remember why Hagrid is such a warm and gentle soul  why McGonagall is strict but motherly  why Dumbledore is     well  Dumbledore  why Malfoy is smug and horrible  and how Snape is mean and multi layered  Each time I re read this series I pick up new things that I hadn t noticed before  Small snippets that help the penny drop about things that happened later in the series  I can see the early signs of later plots that J K  discretely embedded into the story  I can see how the characters started  and compare them to how I know they grew later in their lives J K  did so much to get kids  and adults  into reading  Her impact is unmeasurable  When I wrote my first book  The Golden Scarab  I made sure that I wrote some of it in the same place that J K  wrote Harry Potter  sitting in The Elephant Cafe in Edinburgh  looking out the window towards the castle   I wanted to be where the journey began  and to hopefully channel her energy and skill This book was a great start to the series  It set up the characters  the world  the settings  the conflict  It hooked the readers     it hooked me  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone is a mysterious thriller with lots of action  The book starts off with Harry waking up in his aunt and uncles house as an orphan  Both of his parents were killed by  the one who must not be told   Soon Harry gets all these letters to go to the magical school of Hogwarts  Later he meets this giant named Hagrid who takes him to get his wand and owl and takes him to the train to go to Hogwarts  On the train Harry meets his soon to be best friends Ron and Hermine  When they are on the train Harry buys a whole bunch of candy  Latter when they get off the train they take little boats across the big lake to the magical school of Hogwarts  As they get out of the boats there sorted into teams  There is four teams  Grifindor  Huffelpuff  Ravenclaw  and Slytherin Another exciting part in the book is when Harry tries to find the Sorcerer s Stone  Harry  Ron  and Hermine all go through these challenges to try to get the stone  In one of the last stages Ron defeats the other pieces in wizard chess  Harry then meets  the one who shall not be named    The one who shall not be named  ended up being one of Harry s teachers  Harry then defeats him with his wand and gets the stone This book was an amazing action packed story  The ending was fantastic with great twists  I mean you would never expect that kind of ending  The best part is the author   J K  Rowling  wrote more books to the series  I d give this book a 5 5 stars    3 Okay  I ll have the same review for all the Harry Potter books  We started reading the series in 2004 and caught up quickly  My son and I read them and then we listen again as a family with my husband and daughter  For audio  the reader is the best reader ever ever ever ever ever  But back to the books  The books get darker as the series moves on  The series is about good versus evil  magic  and secret worlds that we muggles  non magic folk  can only dream of     I particularly like that there are so many rules with the use of magic in these books   that is  that there are guidelines that a good little witch or wizard must adhere to as a respected member of their society  JK Rowling is very clever when it comes to foreshadowing future events     her facts  check out   That is  I ve not found any major contradictions in the series  pretty difficult when working with the world of magic and wizardry    As for the controversy on whether or not to allow my children to read the series  It s a personal decision and I respect the take of those parents that won t allow it  Personally  I am not opposed to my children reading them as they are secure in their beliefs and they are clearly able to identify this as a fictional piece of fun fantasy  We all love this series  Anche questa volta ho letto il libro divorandolo  bevendolo e respirandolo  lasciando che penetrasse in me da tutta la pelle e in ogni piu piccolo poro L ho amato 12 anni fa quando la Rowlig era poco famosa ma stava gia cominciando ad essere letta in altre nazioni oltre la sua  Ho amato la saga al punto da fare la questua nelle librerie ogni volta che si preannunciava l uscita dell ultimo libro scritto  Ho avuto grande rammarico di non conoscere l inglese perche non potevo leggere i libri in lingua originale  Harry Potter e la pietra filosofale  in questa edizione mi ha provocato emozioni molto diverse  Intanto la sorpresa nel constatare che  nonostante abbia letto il libro piu volte  ancora sono tante le parti che non ricordo  i particolari che mi sfuggono  In questo credo che molta colpa la debba attribuire ai film  e molto piu facile ricordare le parti del libro che coincidono col film  diventa piu difficile rammentare quelle che non sono potute entrare nella trasposizione cinematografica In secondo luogo  sembra davvero un libro magico  E  vivo  VIVO  vivo per davvero  Lo guardi quand e chiuso e sembra che si muova  che ti sorrida o che urli  Terzo  la nuova traduzione  Per quanto mi sia piaciuto molto nella prima edizione  questa e decisamente piu curata  piu lineare nel linguaggio e molto piu fluida  Nella sua prefazione Stefano Bartezzaghi ci tiene a sottolineare di come sia stato difficile per i primi traduttori poter rendere in modo adeguato una storia che era solo all inizio e della quale erano completamente sconosciuti la maggior parte dei particolari  Non so se lo dicesse per giustificare il precedente lavoro  ma veramente questo e piu riuscito del primo  Anche la scelta dei nomi e stata molto studiata  Nella maggior parte dei casi  i personaggi si sono ritrovati i propri nomi originari   e questo a volte crea un po  di casino perche non e semplice far mente locale e ricordare chi e chi  Ma alcuni personaggi hanno mantenuto  nella versione italiana  il nome scelto dai primi traduttori  Il caso piu eclatante e stato quello di Albus Dumbledoore  ribattezzato Silente e mantenuto definitivamente Silente  Bartezzaghi spiega questa scelta proprio sulla base del  senno di poi   Il preside di Hogwarts nell arco della storia ha commesso vari errori  tutti legati al fatto che non ha voluto parlare a Harry Potter di cose importanti che lo riguardavano  Curiosamente alla fine il nome  Silente  risulto veramente adatto a lui Alla fine della storia  al di la dell enorme successo  che spesso e un cattivo consigliere per acquistare un libro   si tratta di uno scritto autenticamente notevole  di grande valore e di una profondita che va esplorata anche attraverso riletture in tempi diversi della vita  Sono molto poche le opere che meritano questo  Una e la saga di Harry Potter     Escribiran libros sobre Harry    todos los ninos del mundo conoceran su nombre    Los personajes me encantan  creo que haber visto primero las 8 peliculas y despues leer los libros le da un sentimiento distinto  Amo a Dumbledore  su sabiduria y experiencia me encantan aunque no haga mucho en este primer libro  Hay que tener un gran coraje para enfrentar a nuestros enemigos  pero hace falta el mismo valor para respaldar a nuestros amigos Harry como personaje me gusta bastante  al igual que Ron y Hermione aunque me parece que este primer libro es muy corto y no se llega a apreciar realmente lo que son entre ellos El libro esta narrado en 3era persona y este narrador es omnisciente  Algo bueno de este es que no deja que te pierdas mucho sobre lo importante y tampoco se excede en descripciones lo que favorece al lector Harry Potter sin duda es un gran exito  es un libro que puede ser leido tanto por chicos como por adultos y siempre van a pasar un buen momento  Creo que nadie deberia perderse la oportunidad de leerlo  Do you remember Scholastic book orders  I used to beg my parents to buy me books every time they came out  Up until third grade  I always ordered Goosebumps  Bailey School Kids  Ramona or anything that came with some girly toy I just had to have  When the book order came with Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone  I picked it out amongst a few Goosebumps I didn t yet have in my collection  When the order arrived  I read Harry Potter first Instantly  I was obsessed  My sisters were obsessed  Even my mother was obsessed  I lent the book to my best friend  who phoned me that night to gush over how obsessed she was  From that day on  we played Harry Potter every recess  We spent our lunch period copying out and personalizing Harry s acceptance letter to Hogwarts  and then pretended to be surprised when we  found  them  We were both Hermione Granger for Halloween  Our nerdom never ceased We were mocked heavily by the snotty girls in our third grade class  who insisted that sitting on the grass talking about the periods and bras they were all years away from was far more respectable than reading about wizards  of all things    But we didn t care  and we continued our devouring obsession through the Chamber of Secrets and the Prisoner of Azkaban Harry Potter had become something that we d never experienced before  Although we read constantly in attempt to escape the heinous plagues of school children during recess  we d never before been so immersed in a world so unlike our own  We wanted so badly to go to Hogwarts  to be sorted into a House  I in Ravenclaw  she in Gryffindor   to practice spells and eat Cauldron Cakes in the Great Hall  And though Harry s world was quite different from ours  it seemed so easy to relate to him  He was bullied  hurt  misunderstood  And with him  we kept going Shortly after the Chamber of Secrets became available through Scholastic  the other kids in our grade started to really get into them as well  Suddenly the snotty girls on the grass were loudly squealing about what houses they thought each other would be in  and how they just loathed Draco Malfoy  I remember one of them adamantly insisting that Hermione s name was pronounced  Her mee on Graunge urr  and got the entire class to agree with her instead of me  ah  third grade drama   But who laughed when the movie came out in fifth grade  Oh  that s right  I did It seems that there are a lot of catty reviews on here hating against Harry Potter  I guess I could understand why  considering how much I loathe Twilight  but the third grader in me still doesn t understand why anyone wouldn t want to disappear to Hogwarts every so often  Even in the later books of the series  when the action is obviously much heavier than that of the Philosopher s Stone  the Chamber of Secrets or the Prisoner of Azkaban  the books still have such a homely feel to them  I feel as if I ve grown up with these characters  I know them so well  Hell  they were a lot better than the kids I actually grew up with  so I d pick them no matter what  True story  this is how I first got into Harry Potter In 1999 I was in middle school  7th grade  and I had a friend who was super into reading  Regardless of how much I read now  for me  it was all about computers back then  And you have to understand  in 1999 computers were a big deal  My school got its first computer lab  where we d get to go once or twice a week and play on these huge MACs than ran DOS and we generally ended up playing Oregon Trail or education games  but still  it was a big deal But I digress  she was constantly telling me about this kid named Harry Potter  And she tried for ages to get me to read the series  Currently there were three books out  To get her to shut up  I agreed to put my name on the mile long wait list for the first book at the library  And because said wait list was a mile long  by the time I was notified that I could pick up the book  I d already forgotten about it  I almost didn t go get the book  I almost passed on Harry Potter  But that s the moment  in literary terms  that my life changed  Because I devoured the first book  forced my mom to buy me the next two books which I read each in about a week  respectively  and then had my first experience of waiting desperately for a next release My high school life  in terms of books  can be described as endlessly waiting for the next Harry Potter book to come out  and nerding out over it with my best friends  I still remember buying each book  who I was with  when it happened and how I did nothing but read forever afterwards  refusing to be interrupted So I don t know why I took me 14 years to reread the first book  But in a way  rereading thing was like reading it for the first time  because I remembered everything that happened in it  and I ve seen the movie a million times  but the words themselves were forgotten over time  So I really and truly got to have a second first time with this book  and it s still as magical now as it was when I was a kid Reading this book  now as an adult  I m still so completely charmed by it  This book made me laugh so unexpectedly  and I got teary at certain points  I felt like a kid again rereading this book  going on an adventure with Harry one more time  I knew how the story ended  but it still managed to surprise me  and delight me  and just wow me I really can t imagine my life without Harry Potter  This is the kid that I grew up with  We both faced challenges and those ever awkward teenage years  and eventually Harry and I both grew up  I feel like Harry is someone I really know  and as corny as it sounds  he s a part of me  not just a part of my childhood I intended only to just reread this first book  but after being so enchanted once more by it  I can t wait to rush into reading the next  and I may just reread the whole series  Harry Potter is a modern classic for a reason  and he means the world to me  As a girl who loves all things magical fantasy  I think I can safely say that Harry Potter really was the most epic series of books that has come out in my generation  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone really opened the door to the world of fantasy for so many people  adults   kids alike  Once the movies came out  for people who don t read  Harry Potter really became a phenomenal adventure that everyone loved  Even my boyfriend   who would make fun of me for reading  kid books    fell in love with Harry once he hit the big screen   There isn t much I don t like about H P  The storyline was great  The villain was memorable and the characters were engaging and just all around likeable  You couldn t help but feel for Harry  or laugh with at Ron  or just shake your head in dazed exasperation at Hermione  And while none of us could relate to Harry on the parental level   how many people do you know with parents who were blown up by an evil wizard     we could still relate to so many other things  Ron with his self esteem issues   occasional burst of jealousy  having to live in the shadow of 5 older brothers   a famous best friend  We watched   waited as Hermione fell in love with one of her best friends   struggled to make him see her as more then the braniac girl next door   we felt Harry s joy in finding a loving family among his friends  From the minute you open the Sorcerer s Stone  you re sucked in and you can t let go until the Deathly Hallows  and by then you re screaming inside because it s the end of something awesome  One of my favorite aspects of Harry Potter is probably Hogwarts  Who wouldn t love the idea of a secret school that is the epitome of magic  Wouldn t you just love to climb the towers   learn Divination with Professor Trelawney  Or Transfiguration with Professor McGonagall  Having been young when I first read this book  I was captivated with the idea of a magical school where a child would be housed with like minded kids  Voldemort was the perfect villain  He was scary  ruthless and a right murdering bastard  What I liked most about He Who Must Not Be Named was the fact that while he was intelligent  a criminal mastermind even  Voldemort was weak  He feared love  shunned it   disregarded it  No matter how cunning or clever he was  Voldemort would never understand love  My favorite character is probably Luna  I love her strangely odd   unapologetic personality  She was fearless though Im sure it was mistaken for foolishness  A breath of fresh air  full of random possible facts  Luna was a loyal trustworthy friend who is stronger   more clever then people believe her to be I would very much recommend these books to anyone who hasn t read them  I would also recommend them to anyone who saw the movies but didn t bother reading the books  This is an amazing book that s a good read for people of all ages  Five stars is not enough  Is there an infinity star option The Harry Potter books are my favorite books  Ever  Unless you count the Bible  Then they re just below that If you haven t read these books  then you re probably wasting your life  and the rest of everyone s air  Just saying I remember reading this one for the first time in fifth grade  I was very excited because my teacher s name was Mrs  Norris  and that was Filch s cat s name  And I LOVED the twist ending  One things I love about these books is there s always some sort of ending you re never expecting  It s absolutely incredible  I fell in love with the Potter universe  not because it s magical  but because it makes magic seem    less magical  in a way  I don t want to say  real   I get annoyed when people try to finish my sentence with the word  real  when I m trying to describe what I mean  They always get this sort of   snarky  condescending  I know what you re going to say and its stupid and cliche expression  But that s not the word  I m not sure I know the word  But  real  doesn t really cover it  Believable  Down to earth  It s almost a de mystification of a magical world  But at the same time   it s so much better and more magical and incredible and absolutely UNbelievable at the same time  I think it gives a sense of normalcy to the magic that the characters do  There are governments  laws aside from just the usual dramatic  You must keep our realm a secret   laws  Schools  competitions  sports  banks   everything  Pretty freakin  awesome  The first three books in this series were among the last set of books I read for leisure during my childhood  I remember being completely enthralled by the book  The notion of going from a subjugated and mundane life to a world of womder  magic and reverence was so exciting to me  Full disclosure    I wanted to be Harry Potter  I wanted to discover that I had this great power laying dormant inside of me and be whisked away to a magical land to take part various fantastical activities  Sadly it never happened and I grew up  but I am appreciative of the escape that the book once offered me as I got lost in its pages and lived vicariously through Harry  becoming friends with Ron Hermoine  learning Quiditch and exploring the grounds of Hogwarts  Sadly I never got to the later boks but I enjoyed the movies and I this first book to thank for that  I plan to pass my books on to my future children and students in hopes that they provide them the wonderful adventures I know to be contained within these pages  Decided to do a re read of the entire Harry Potter series  mostly because I m beginning to miss the series and wanted to bring it back to life in my mind   not that it ever left  I ve just been focusing on other things   and I managed to read this book in just under three hours  As I found when I was younger  I thoroughly enjoyed the book and just simply couldn t put it down  Even though I knew exactly what was going to happen  I still found my heart pounding at every significant event  When Harry first saw the castle  I found my eyes welling up because of nostalgic feelings and I couldn t quite let them go throughout the entirety of the book  Despite how I have picked up more differences between the book and the movie than I did when I read it a few years back  I can still say that the book is tons better  I just love how J K Rowling has introduced us into the world of Hogwarts  and along with the characters telling Harry everything about the world  we have also been told about it too   and I find it amazing how she has grasped me once again into the series  and I find myself loving it even more than before   How is that even possible      If you haven t read this series before  please do  You won t regret it  Despite how this is said a lot  I m going to say it anyway  this series has really changed my life  It shaped me as a person  and has really influenced the person who I am today Overall  fantastic  Nothing to pick at  for me Thanks for reading     It was a rainy day in July 2002 when I was first introduced to Harry potter  My father had brought the book   Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone   from the local library  That was the day and its today in 2013 I am as hooked to Harry Potter  maybe more so than before  as I was in 2002 when I first read about him The Harry Potter phenomenon started in 1997 when the first book   Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone   was published in Britain  The same book was published as  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone  in the United States  It was the debut novel by J K  Rowling and brought great acclaim to her as an author The story revolves around Harry who is an orphan and is being brought up by his Aunt and Uncle  He is mistreated by his relations  who make him sleep in a cupboard under the stairs  Strange unexplained things have always happened to Harry like strange people bowing and winking at him as if they know him or howsoever times he got his hair cut they instantly became long and unruly like before or one time his aunt tried to forcefully make him wear Dudley s old sweater and it got so small that it didn t fit him which was impossible because Dudley was so fat The dilemma with Harry is that others know more about him than he does himself  He has no recollection of his parent s death and is forbidden to ask questions about anything  He is only told that they died in a car crash  He has a queer lightning shaped scar on his forehead and feels that that is the only notable thing about him for he is skinny  wears Dudley s old baggy clothes  has his spectacles kept together with cello tape and never seems to be able to get his unruly  black hair in order  But soon life takes a turn and he comes to know that he is no ordinary boy but a wizard  Yeah you heard me right  Harry Potter is a wizard whose parents died not in a car crash but trying to save him from Voldemort  or  You Know Who  or  One Who must not be named    who inspires such fear in people that no one dares to call him by name  Now its ten years since Voldermort killed Harry s parents  tried killing Harry and disappeared mysteriously  some say that he lost his powers but is still in hiding  waiting to come back  but his terror still lingers in the minds of the wizard community which fears his return Harry soon finds himself whisked to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry where he makes friends  fights trolls  plays quidditch  has classes on potion making  defense against the dark arts and other magical subjects and also comes to know more about his parents and the man who killed them  Voldemort  Voldemort is again seen trying to come to power through the Philosopher s Stone and soon it s up to Harry and his friends to prevent him from finding it The plot is very novel and stands out with its fresh story line  very innovative settings and heart felt characters which made it difficult for me to believe that its J K  Rowling s debut novel Though the theme of the book is magic and fantasy yet I never felt like I was reading anything far fetched  Such is the skill with which Rowling threads together the events that they feel authentic and I felt connected Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and wizardry is a creation of genius and is depicted as a mysterious place which thrilled me with lively descriptions of ceilings that looked like stars filled sky  of ghosts floating in air  castle like settings with long passageways  direction changing stairways  moving pictures  candles floating in the air  long tables with self appearing food  big grounds for playing quidditch etc Rowling gives a memorable introduction to Harry with the title  The Boy Who Lived   The setting of the scenes and the description of the characters is so lively that it created a picture in my mind and all through the book I felt like everything was happening to me firsthand She is able to make the reader feel each and every emotion experienced by the characters in the book like surprise and happiness which Harry felt when he came to know that he was a wizard or longing  sadness and half joy when Harry could see his parents standing behind him in the Mirror of Erised The introduction of the Durselys is also very funny  Mr and Mrs Dursely  of number four  Privet Drive  were proud to say that they were perfectly normal  thank you very much  They were the last people you d expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious  because they just didn t hold with such nonsense  I felt I had met such people while I read the description  Rowling also sketches her characters in a comical light with introducing statements like  a big  beefy man with hardly any neck  although he did have a very large mustache    thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck    pig in a wig  for Mr Dursely  Mrs Dursely and Dudley Dursely  The same method is also adopted for the other characters which not only made them hilarious  I ended laughing like a goon  but I felt made them feel more real and effective It s a 5 on 5 book with vivid characters that we all connect to and love like the wild looking but very caring Hagrid  gentle and a genius yet with a bit of humorous eccentricity Dumbledore  stern but kind  mother like McGonagall  bossy Hermoine  a best friend Ron  an enigma Snape  forgetful Neville  mischief makers George   Fred Weasely  The book is teeming with characters from teachers to students to house ghosts and it s very easy to love or at least love to hate them The book hooked me like it had done the first time I had read it years back  I have lost count of the number of times I have read this book but I still feel a thrill every time I pick it up to read such is the magic of Harry Potter  Kudos to J K  Rowling for writing such an inventive and imaginative novel and I am just dying to review the next book in the series This review is also available on my blog http   njkinny blogspot in Do visit my blog for more reviews     Wow  This book was perfection  Some may say it was written with too young of a hand  meaning it didn t have any depth to it whatsoever  but I think that fit perfectly  Yes  it wasn t a philosophical masterpiece like some other books of the time but it was from the perspective of an eleven year old Harry Potter  He hasn t grown up yet so  his  writing hasn t either  Ms  Rowling s writing perfectly embodied young Harry and the things a typical young wizard boy would do  say  or notice  I saw the movies  they were amazing by the way  and was expecting to love the books because I loved the movies  I was not disappointed and I don t think anyone else is either I honestly don t have any complaints  I was absorbed from the very first chapter and I couldn t help but laugh and cry and gasp while reading it whether or not I was in public  This is exactly what I look for in books   becoming them and being engaged in the story instead of it just being a few well chosen words on paper  I can t wait to read the rest of the books Five stars even though it deserves more  Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone by J K Rowling This is one of the most well known and popular children s books of all time  The fact that this statement can be made is for good reason  It is the perfect book for ages 8 12  The story is simple  a boy aged 11 called Harry Potter  He is an orphan who has grown up with his not so pleasant aunt  uncle and cousin Dudley  However on his birthday his whole world is turned upside down  He discovers from a half giant named Hagrid that he is in fact a wizard and his parents did not die in a car crash but were actually killed by an evil wizard called Voldemort  All this information is given in the first few chapters so truly captures the readers attention  Harry moves to Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry and befriends Hermione and Ron who become his two best friends  As Harry adapts to his new world he goes through many adventures  From finding out that he can actual fly on a broomstick  to tackling trolls at Halloween and helping a dragon called Norbit to be freed  All along the story Harry and his friends meet characters such as Professor Snape who has a strong dislike towards him and the brilliant Professor Dumbledore  As the title suggests the Philosopher s Stone emerges midway through the book  and it is the object which is trying to be stolen by Lord Voldemort through the body of the vulnerable Professor Quirrell   The trio ask questions why its being targeted or being stored in Hogwarts  These questions lead Harry towards Lord Voldemort at the conclusion of the book but what would the consequences of his thrill for adventure become  It is very difficult not to love this book the first in the Harry Potter series and one that sets the marker for the rest  I like that from the first chapter in his bedroom under the stairs the reader is drawn in and it is very difficult to put the book down I would pick this book for a more older child of maybe 8 12 to read themselves or as a class or group book to read  The book gives an emphasis to the importance of friendship and loyalty  The story from start to finish is written to a very good standard and ideal for children reading on their own  The final point would be that Harry epitomises a true hero  He has all the characteristics bravery  tenacity and of course his desire to protect those he cares most about   This is one of the best if not the BEST book I ve ever read  I honestly wasn t in to Harry Potter but I wondered why so many people ADORE it  Now I know why  J K  Rowling CAN WRITE  This book really became a part of me when I read it  I felt every emotion in the book  I didn t really expect in the end that SPOILERS Quirrel was the bad guy  I thought Snape was  Good thing I didn t spoil myself before reading this book  The scene that really tugged my heartstrings was the part where Harry saw his Parents  Family  in the Mirror of the Erised  I really felt his longing  for his parents  and it really broke my insides  He never felt their love I guess he does because of the love protection his mother gave him when Voldemort tried to kill him when he was just a baby  But it s kinda different from the love that you really feel when your parents are alive so it s not the same  and I really felt for him   End of Spoilers It was really a fun read and I wished I could have read it when I was younger   But I m still young   I will read the rest of the series   Can t wait for the 2nd book  Hope I have a fun ride at Hogwarts again  I want to experience a magical wonderful trip and now all that s left for to do is ride the Hogwarts Express  Everyone should read this book  Hope everyone who will read this will have a fantastic  or should I say FUNTASTIC  ride  I came into this book series late    I was nearly an adult when I cracked open the cover of this book  Reading it  though  made me feel like a child again  This is one of the few book series I hate to put down as I read at night  I will literally keep going until my eyes droop  no matter how late it is Reading this book after finishing the series  I can see where Rowling lays the groundwork for everything to follow  Some of it is less than obvious  such as Harry s observations that there are times he suspects Snape might be a mind reader  Even the Sorting Hat s attempt to place him into Slytherin takes on an entirely new meaning after the final book  My encouragement is    if you ve read this series only once  read it again  If you ve never read it  read it  Get lost in it  Laugh over it  Cry with it  Rowling is a best seller  and one of the greatest childrens  authors of our time for a reason  If you re a Christian and hesitant about  the magic   toss your reservations out the window  You ll be dumbfounded at the Narnia esque symbolism spread throughout the books   There s a reason J K  Rowling can t resist picking up a Lewis book  and she pays homage to him here in a multitude of little ways only those familiar with Narnia will understand   I somehow missed the original craze over J K  Rowling s new series  I was teaching and going to graduate school when the 3rd book came out  One day in class I turned from writing on the board to find about half my students busily reading away  I asked the school librarian about it  and she told me that she couldn t keep the books on the shelves  that they were incredible  and that the author was actually in town that afternoon for a book signing  and she wished she could go  I told her I d go ahead and go  and get a book signed for her  She said best to get there early  I said  Well  of course  I have class tonight  I ll just go  get the book signed  and get to class   I had No  Idea When I got to the bookstore  six hours before the signing was scheduled to start  the line was already stretched almost the full way around the block  This is a Washington  D C  block  folks   I asked the person in line ahead of me if she would save my place while I went to buy the books  and she kindly said yes  or I wouldn t have this story to tell   I went inside and bought the first three books  A store clerk was walking down the line  handing out tickets   What s this for    She s only signing 400 books at this stop   the woman replied  handing me my ticket and walking along  There were only ten tickets behind me before she ran out  The fuss made by those who came after was tremendous  The news crews started setting up hours before she was set to begin signing    BBC  local  national    That was when I figured I might as well find out what this was about  I opened the first book Needless to say  I was an insta fan  I blitzed through the first two books waiting in that line over the next five hours  I remain a steadfast fan to this day  Anyone who can get that many kids to read that much  is a genius    and the books really are that good  FOREWORDHarry Potter will become a timeless classic  and it was all started here  This is a series that will go down in history due to it s outstanding story  endearing characters  and overall feeling of  magic  MY REVIEWThis particular book is the one that started it all  and I had read this for the first time as a 10 year old  but now that I have gone back and re read it  it is truly even more amazing  A lot of people think that the underdog rising up to the hero is overused  but it fits Harry 100   The reason this character and book series stand out so much are because he is the hero  with his faults admitted  and his thirst for vengeance of his parents  who were murdered by Lord Voldemort when he was only 1 year old  The reason its so fitting is because he doesn t want to be the hero  he wants to be happy  but in order to protect his loved ones  he ll do anything  As for the Sorcerer s Stone  it explores Harry s introduction to the Wizard World and his delight with it  He loves being away from his aunt and uncle who could care less and abusive cousin  He s excited at having friends  Ron Weasly and Hermione Granger  whom he can confide to  And I could be wrong  but ANY kid would be happy about going to wizard school  He goes along regularly there until trouble arises and he is needed to vanquish the evil within Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry  Though there is one thing that makes him particularly different  his scar  It s why he s a hero  why he s famous  As a child  an innocent 1 year old  the Darkest wizard alive came after him and his family  all to kill Harry  Voldemort was victorious in killing his parents  but the Killing Curse rebounded on He Who Must Not Be Named and made so weakened  he could not walk  And Harry survived  known as a hero and savior throughout the world CONCLUSIONMy favorite fictional characters of all time are Harry Potter characters  Harry himelf  Albus Dumbledore  Fred and George Weasly  and Ginny Weasly  This series is close to my heart and will never be forgotten because of it s intricate way of storytelling and lovable characters that will stick with you  I would suggest Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone to anybody that hasn t read it and anyone that likes the fantasy genre Now I end here  with my final comment  J K  Rowling is a literary genius and has to be for this book to be written in her car  in which she was living in at the time   It s quite peculiar to reread the book after a couple of years  During my childhood I used to read it every two months or so yet there were some things I never noticed when I was 8 or 9 For starters  did Hagrid always drink so much  I swear those parts suddenly appeared in the book now  I can t remember them at all  When he came to pick up Harry from the Dursleys   he took out  a bottle of some amber liquid which he took a swig from before starting to make tea   Also  when Harry meets Draco for the first time at Madam Malkin s  when they were still quite hospitable to each other   Malfoy says about Hagrid  I heard he       lives in a hut in the school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk  tries to do magic and ends up setting fire to his bed   Hagrid also goes to have a drink at the Leaky Cauldron  whose barman seemed to know him well enough when he first appeared with Harry there  after the ride at the Gringotts when he retrieved You Know What from vault seven hundred and thirteen  He drinks so much at the Christmas feast that he actually kisses McGonagall on the cheek  Also  he frequents the Hog s Head  which I actually remember since it was an important plot point and I think I couldn t really figure out why he would do that back when I was nine   I guess I kind of skipped over these parts back then but now I find them somehow perturbing  since Hagrid was supposed to be supervising Harry at most of these times  I have also no idea how come I always dreaded reading the book s beginning  Harry s time at the Dursleys    It s positively absurd in a Roald Dahl inspired British way  I wonder why so many children found this part tedious  maybe the suburban life parody only becomes amusing starting a certain age Another thing   it was Fred and George who  after talking to Harry fleetingly while helping him with his trunk  introduced him and Ron to each other  If it wasn t for the twins then they could possibly have spent half of their train ride sitting awkwardly opposite each other  Couldn t be more realistic Also  Hermione really is annoying at the beginning  I wonder how possibly I could never see that before  Moreover  it seems like if it wasn t for Harry and Ron then she would have had no friends at all   which is just sad but so truthful Lastly  I admire how JK Rowling put some hints here and there of the rest of the series  view spoiler  Firenze the centaur saves Harry from the blood drinking Voldemort slash Quirell and the rest of the centaurs criticize him for trying to go against the stars  Was it the fact that Voldemort was supposed to kill Harry  But that only happened in the last book  I never paid much attention to this scene  turns out it was foreshadowing the ending of the series  Also  Harry asks about the prophecy near the ending of the book and Dumbledore answers him that he would tell him once the time comes  although I guess Harry let go of the matter far to easily for a curious eleven year old    hide spoiler  Great to see it was all planned out since the very beginning  Creativity Spices up Standard Fantasy FareWhile many fantasy books  I m looking at you  Terry Goodkind  often concoct magical mumbo jumbo or pull solutions out of thin air  JK Rowling deftly sidesteps this pitfall and delivers an entertaining  action packed romp through a magical word that coexists  fairly well  at least in this introductory novel  with the rest of modern society Starting with Voldemort s defeat and the ensuing celebrations  the story leaps forward ten years  Living with the bigoted Dursleys  Harry is whisked away to Hogwarts where his true talents and skills can be put to use  He meets Ron on the train and the pair later make an unbreakable bond with Hermione Granger  brainiac  living dictionary and oftentimes annoying creator of run on paragraphs  The characters are the true strength of the series  and can easily make or break a franchise  Rowling has done an excellent job of making characters relatable and realistic Even more creative and riveting is Quidditch  a rip roaring wizardly sport that soars through the skies  It s unique enough to hook adults into the series  It s certainly more interesting than baseball or golf A common trap  and trope  that writers can fall into is the Mary Sue Gary Stu syndrome  By creating a character so perfect that EVERYTHING goes their way  to the point that the final boss is a mere nuisance   plots and character development become chores  Nothing is surprising and readers often give up or trudge through  bored to tears by the penultimate chapter  None of that is present here  to Ms  Rowling s great credit Characters often work together to overcome obstacles  true courage and bravery is displayed  an exemplary example to young readers everywhere  and even Harry s warts are shown for all to see  He s impulsive and quick to anger  He has little inborn talent for magic  and certainly no eclectic memory  He has to strive and work for every mark in an exam  and that makes him more human  more realistic and more readable  J K  Rowling is one of the first writers I read when I was finally able to read alone  Of course I read books at school but I had a friend in Primary school  I will never forget her  She had this same kind of hair as Hermione  she was clever and adorable  She was my best friend  She read a lot and told me to go read Harry Potter  I think I was eight maybe nine  So I started this book  in Dutch of course and my mom had to drag me to the dinner table and all the other things  She bought me all the other books because she loved to see me read  I talked almost every day about Harry Potter thanks to my  Hermione Best Friend   How I fell in love with Harry in this book  Harry was in the beginning without a doubt my favourite character  He is funny and really brave  I liked him a lot  I of course also liked Hermione  She was like me  When I was younger  I didn t have many friends because I was to shy to talk to anybody  I rather read than talk to other people  in the end I was brave enough to make friends  Without knocking out a twelve foot tall mountain troll but that s beside the point  I read a lot and thought I knew a lot and my mom often called me a bossy know it all  So that s how I also fell in love with Hermione  The writing style from Rowling is of course very easy because it s a child book  However it s very funny  The things with Fred and George  Or the part with the mountain troll and becoming friends after that  The way she describes things speaks to me and makes me laugh all the time When I re read this now I have to be honest that it hurts very much to read about Sirius or James and Lily  Because the last two years I ve been a big Marauder fan  I ve got a phone case from it and I ve got James Potter his wand so I blinked away a few tears maybe a bit much but I felt the pain especially now Halloween is coming near  However the bright side of Halloween is Harry  Ron and Hermione became friends  Re reading is a great joy and I can t wait to continue  However this already took me a week because of school  I have midterm exams now  The only thing by the way that I don t understand is why Hermione lies to McGonagall about why she was in the toilets  If she just said  I was here not knowing about the troll and Harry and Ron came to get me  Nothing bad would happen but her saying she wanted to take on the troll on her own  Everybody knew she was lying come on at that moment Hermione wasn t a person who skipp the rules   I don t get this part  By protecting Harry and Ron she could have said that there wasn t a fight so McGonagall didn t have to know that  Although I was a keen reader at a young age  it was the magical Harry Potter series that really got me hooked  We all know what it is about so I ll keep the outline brief  The story begins with an abandoned and vulnerable baby Harry who has been left at his not so friendly Uncle and Aunty s after losing his parents in a mysterious explosion  After going through a neglected childhood  at the age of 11 he receives a letter from Hogwarts to find out he is actually a Wizard  During his time at school he meets his best friends  Ron and Hermione  They lead themselves into a series of magical adventures  their friendships are tested and Harry learns that an evil  powerful wizard named Voldemort is seeking the Philosopher s stone in order to be immortal and end Harry s life the same way his parent s did  The appropriate age range for this book is 7 11  Although it is set in a magical fantasy land  the deeply descriptive and personal writing of this book really allows the reader to feel connected to each individual character and experience their magical adventures with them  Consequently it could be used to inspire a creative writing piece in the classroom  The whole story  and series  teaches children about the importance of friendship  growing up and how doing the right thing is not always the easiest   Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone is the first book in a series of 7 written by J K Rowling  In this debut novel by Rowling we meet Harry Potter  a young boy who has spent the first 10 years of his life living a miserable existence with his Aunt Petunia  Uncle Vernon and cousin Dudley after his parents were killed when he was just a baby  He soon realises that he is no ordinary boy  he is in fact a young wizard  famous throughout the wizarding community as being the only survivor of the attack which killed his parents when he was 1 years old by the evil Lord Voldemort  He is whisked away to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry where he meets a close group of friends  discovers more about his past and learns how to become a fully fledged wizard  Discovering the significance of his survival all those years ago  he learns about the battle which raged between good and evil amongst the wizarding world at the time of his birth  When the evil Lord Voldmort threatens to rise to power once again  it is down to Harry  with the help of his new friends Ron and Hermoine to stop him I have given this book 5 stars  having read this book originally in 1998 when I was 13  I feel I read it at a time before the Harry Potter mania we know now had begun  At this time it was largely unknown by my peers and I felt as though I had stumbled upon something special  until that point there hadn t been a book that I was so engrossed with and I felt like it really did transport me into a different world  Despite being a children s book  this really is a must read for anyone aged 8 to 80  in fact as the series progresses the subject matter does become quite dark and in some ways I feel written to be read by an older audience As a tool for the classroom this book could be used in a number of ways  read by the teacher to the entire class it would be sure to inspire young minds and to encourage them to be more creative in their writing  Moreover  as the Harry Potter brand had become so famous nowadays  with blockbuster films and theme parks being based around it  it may encourage children to want to read the book  which may in turn spark a lifelong interest in reading and therefore improve literacy  Harry Potter  The first time i heard that name i was in primary school  probably in the first or second year  My older sister came home so excited  begging my mum to buy this book called  Harry Potter   promising that we were going to love it  Since both my sister and i had trouble reading my mum was eager to encourage us  as well as having a passion for books herself  These were the days when she would read to us  both curled on either side so we could follow the words with our eyes  I first met Harry Potter like that  curled up on the couch  I think my dad was listening in too as he quickly developed a fondness of  Potty  just as strong as ours  The books quickly became something special  a constant presence in my childhood as we waited for each book and then movie to come out  AND everybody was reading Harry Potter  Harry Potter was so much part of my childhood that rereading them is like going back to visit old friends  The books  to me  are never anything less than amazing I am completely and utterly bias   On my 3rd go around and this book still gets 5 stars  I remember about 10 or so years ago when I first heard of this  thinking that it would be a stupid teeny bopper fantasy series    and who knows maybe it is     But I love it either way  My 15 y o son has been a Potter fan for years  hey anything I can do to encourage my kids to read   and asked if we could reread these and then watch the movie and compare the differences  For the record he prefers the movies   Uuuuggghhhhh     I prefer the books  I don t think a review is necesary as most have seen the movie and or read the book   if not I am sure you have heard of it and the cult following it has generated  I also won t do a full comparrison of the book movie   just a couple of thoughts Uncle Dursley was cast perfectly   looks just like I imagined him I won t flatter many of the actors but Alan Rickman is a genius both in the past and in this role   brilliant actor plays this part to near perfection IMHO Petunia and Dudley have blond hair   why is that so difficult to cast   the first 2 books and movies have always been my favorites because they are so much more child friendly    from 3 on there seems a darker element which is still cool but loses some of it s youthful charm for me   my favortie from 3 7 has always been the half blood prince   but the movie was borderling atrocious for me   2011 review  This series never gets old  I truly feel that every single time I read these books  I m revisiting old friends  It s so comforting  I would even say that I enjoy re reading this series even more than I did reading it the first time  Why  Well  the first time around  I was so eager to know what happened that I just blew right through the story  wanting to read it for myself before anyone else could spoil it for me  But each time I re read  I m struck by the little things  I find that I go back and re read passages two and three times  and in this book especially  I love meeting the characters for the first time  I enjoy lingering over the funny moments  and I always tear up during the emotional ones  So excited to be re reading  2009 review  Rereading this felt like cracking open an old photo album and thinking   My God  I can t believe how much we ve all grown   I found it even more engaging knowing what I know now  having read all seven books   Such a different  but equally fantastic experience  I m looking forward to the progression of the plotline  Rowling s writing  and the development intricacies of the characters all over again This is a book that I look forward to revisiting many times in my life As I struggle with my rating  I realize that I m actually finding it hard to separate my feelings for this book from my overall feelings about the series  To me  they are all so wrapped up in each other that I just can t rate this book independently of the others  Hands down  this is a five star series  so I guess that s what I m going with  I rated this a 5 star because of the impact it had on my life rather than the actual content of the book itself  So this isn t really a review but more of an account of the impact Harry Potter had on my life  I was about 12 years old when this book came out and prior to this  I had a very vague interest in reading which to my family is a bit worrisome since they are all such voracious readers  I used to read a lot of comics  manga  and also what my sisters would call  childish  books like Sweet Valley Twins with large print that wouldn t hurt my eyes  My sisters tried to upgrade me to Enid Blyton  like Famous 5 and even Malory Towers  but I was turned off by the small words and didn t even bother with them  So my sister in a last ditch attempt to get me to read  proper  books  and knowing how much I loved reading manga  decided to get me Harry Potter and the Philosopher s stone  She literally told me that Harry Potter is a lot like Manga stories but in book form  So Harry Potter became the first  proper  book I read as a 12 year old kid and thankfully not the last  After that I was hooked to reading  I started reading all the Enid Blyton books that my sister had bought for me  Famous 5  Malory towers  Secret 7  St Clare s  and was wondering what an idiot I was to have ignored all these books  By the time I was 13  I had definitely upgraded in reading and started reading all the classics  Pride and Prejudice  Jane Austen  Women in White  Little Women  Anne of Green Gables  Robinson Crusoe  Count of Monte Cristo  Dracula  in my family s library Since then  it s always been tradition for my sister to give me a Harry potter book on the day of its release  all the way to Deathly Hollows even though by then I was full grown adult  As an adult  when I read the first harry potter book I can t help but smile  even though my adult brain keeps screaming about all the inconsistencies  the plotholes and stock standard side characters  because of what the first Harry potter book did for me as a 12 year old kid  Loved  loved delving into the world of Harry Potter  With four children aged 11 through 4 the audio edition on CD was a great Summer reading alternative for us  As a Christian I remember all the  Harry Potter debates  a decade or so ago when the books became such a huge success  I have no problem with the Harry Potter books  even while being a spiritual parent who strives to protect and instruct her children  I found it to be a wonderful  very fanciful piece of writing  The witchcraft  while the Bible does warn against it  I feel  is purely fanciful  Not much different from the magic found in most of children s fairy tales and fables written originally to instruct children in morality  J K  Rowling brings to the focus through literature the struggle of good and evil  I have a very nerdy confession  Having a hard time sitting still during our listening to The Sorcerer s Stone   I am not good at sitting  I worked on a Harry Potter wordle  and took some notes  Knowing that this series in fact a very intelligent read  I am trying to get the most of J K Rowling s work Renting the DVD the day after we finished the book was a fun family night too Highly recommend to the next up coming generation of young readers and their parents    Books  And cleverness  There are more important things   friendship and bravery  Re visiting Harry Potter is like going to see an old friend  you know what they look like and you know what they re personality is  you even know what kind of trouble they manage to get themselves into but it still feels new and exciting all the same It had been just over a year since I sat down and re read the Harry Potter series for the umpteenth time so I thought now would be a good time to start re reading it for my challenge and I was right  The second I opened those pages and read the first few lines I felt happy and secure  I was back with Harry  Ron and Hermione  I was home At 2 20 am April 25th 2011 I closed the Philosopher s Stone once again and sighed  so many more great adventures awaited and I wanted to immediately start Chamber of Secrets and continue my re reading adventure but  sadly  sleep beckoned me and I had to leave it Reading Harry Potter this time feels extra special because  all too soon  it s coming to an end with the second part of the Deathly Hallows movie coming all too fast  It feels like the last time I ll ever read it  even though I know it s not  and it also feels like the first time I ever read  again even though I know it s not  It feels old and new  and end and a beginning Philosopher s Stone will always be held closely to my heart because it s where I began making my friends  like so many others  these friends that will stay with me long after it ends  When I first read Philosopher s Stone I was 8 years old  now I m 22 and I still feel like that little girl that was eagerly awaiting her 11th birthday so she could get her Hogwarts Letter and run off to this magical place I ll always wait for that letter  no matter how old I get Just expect reviews like this for the entire HP re read because it always makes me a sappy  sorry mess when I read it  Well      this was a re read and it was like catching up with old friends It s where it all began  Harry s discovery that he was a wizard and his introduction to the wizarding world and all its danger and splendour  It has reinforced my love of these books  the settings and the characters  I remember why Hagrid is such a warm and gentle soul  why McGonagall is strict but motherly  why Dumbledore is     well  Dumbledore  why Malfoy is smug and horrible  and how Snape is mean and multi layered  Each time I re read this series I pick up new things that I hadn t noticed before  Small snippets that help the penny drop about things that happened later in the series  I can see the early signs of later plots that J K  discretely embedded into the story  I can see how the characters started  and compare them to how I know they grew later in their lives J K  did so much to get kids  and adults  into reading  Her impact is unmeasurable  When I wrote my first book  The Golden Scarab  I made sure that I wrote some of it in the same place that J K  wrote Harry Potter  sitting in The Elephant Cafe in Edinburgh  looking out the window towards the castle   I wanted to be where the journey began  and to hopefully channel her energy and skill This book was a great start to the series  It set up the characters  the world  the settings  the conflict  It hooked the readers     it hooked me  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone is a mysterious thriller with lots of action  The book starts off with Harry waking up in his aunt and uncles house as an orphan  Both of his parents were killed by  the one who must not be told   Soon Harry gets all these letters to go to the magical school of Hogwarts  Later he meets this giant named Hagrid who takes him to get his wand and owl and takes him to the train to go to Hogwarts  On the train Harry meets his soon to be best friends Ron and Hermine  When they are on the train Harry buys a whole bunch of candy  Latter when they get off the train they take little boats across the big lake to the magical school of Hogwarts  As they get out of the boats there sorted into teams  There is four teams  Grifindor  Huffelpuff  Ravenclaw  and Slytherin Another exciting part in the book is when Harry tries to find the Sorcerer s Stone  Harry  Ron  and Hermine all go through these challenges to try to get the stone  In one of the last stages Ron defeats the other pieces in wizard chess  Harry then meets  the one who shall not be named    The one who shall not be named  ended up being one of Harry s teachers  Harry then defeats him with his wand and gets the stone This book was an amazing action packed story  The ending was fantastic with great twists  I mean you would never expect that kind of ending  The best part is the author   J K  Rowling  wrote more books to the series  I d give this book a 5 5 stars    3 Okay  I ll have the same review for all the Harry Potter books  We started reading the series in 2004 and caught up quickly  My son and I read them and then we listen again as a family with my husband and daughter  For audio  the reader is the best reader ever ever ever ever ever  But back to the books  The books get darker as the series moves on  The series is about good versus evil  magic  and secret worlds that we muggles  non magic folk  can only dream of     I particularly like that there are so many rules with the use of magic in these books   that is  that there are guidelines that a good little witch or wizard must adhere to as a respected member of their society  JK Rowling is very clever when it comes to foreshadowing future events     her facts  check out   That is  I ve not found any major contradictions in the series  pretty difficult when working with the world of magic and wizardry    As for the controversy on whether or not to allow my children to read the series  It s a personal decision and I respect the take of those parents that won t allow it  Personally  I am not opposed to my children reading them as they are secure in their beliefs and they are clearly able to identify this as a fictional piece of fun fantasy  We all love this series  Anche questa volta ho letto il libro divorandolo  bevendolo e respirandolo  lasciando che penetrasse in me da tutta la pelle e in ogni piu piccolo poro L ho amato 12 anni fa quando la Rowlig era poco famosa ma stava gia cominciando ad essere letta in altre nazioni oltre la sua  Ho amato la saga al punto da fare la questua nelle librerie ogni volta che si preannunciava l uscita dell ultimo libro scritto  Ho avuto grande rammarico di non conoscere l inglese perche non potevo leggere i libri in lingua originale  Harry Potter e la pietra filosofale  in questa edizione mi ha provocato emozioni molto diverse  Intanto la sorpresa nel constatare che  nonostante abbia letto il libro piu volte  ancora sono tante le parti che non ricordo  i particolari che mi sfuggono  In questo credo che molta colpa la debba attribuire ai film  e molto piu facile ricordare le parti del libro che coincidono col film  diventa piu difficile rammentare quelle che non sono potute entrare nella trasposizione cinematografica In secondo luogo  sembra davvero un libro magico  E  vivo  VIVO  vivo per davvero  Lo guardi quand e chiuso e sembra che si muova  che ti sorrida o che urli  Terzo  la nuova traduzione  Per quanto mi sia piaciuto molto nella prima edizione  questa e decisamente piu curata  piu lineare nel linguaggio e molto piu fluida  Nella sua prefazione Stefano Bartezzaghi ci tiene a sottolineare di come sia stato difficile per i primi traduttori poter rendere in modo adeguato una storia che era solo all inizio e della quale erano completamente sconosciuti la maggior parte dei particolari  Non so se lo dicesse per giustificare il precedente lavoro  ma veramente questo e piu riuscito del primo  Anche la scelta dei nomi e stata molto studiata  Nella maggior parte dei casi  i personaggi si sono ritrovati i propri nomi originari   e questo a volte crea un po  di casino perche non e semplice far mente locale e ricordare chi e chi  Ma alcuni personaggi hanno mantenuto  nella versione italiana  il nome scelto dai primi traduttori  Il caso piu eclatante e stato quello di Albus Dumbledoore  ribattezzato Silente e mantenuto definitivamente Silente  Bartezzaghi spiega questa scelta proprio sulla base del  senno di poi   Il preside di Hogwarts nell arco della storia ha commesso vari errori  tutti legati al fatto che non ha voluto parlare a Harry Potter di cose importanti che lo riguardavano  Curiosamente alla fine il nome  Silente  risulto veramente adatto a lui Alla fine della storia  al di la dell enorme successo  che spesso e un cattivo consigliere per acquistare un libro   si tratta di uno scritto autenticamente notevole  di grande valore e di una profondita che va esplorata anche attraverso riletture in tempi diversi della vita  Sono molto poche le opere che meritano questo  Una e la saga di Harry Potter     Escribiran libros sobre Harry    todos los ninos del mundo conoceran su nombre    Los personajes me encantan  creo que haber visto primero las 8 peliculas y despues leer los libros le da un sentimiento distinto  Amo a Dumbledore  su sabiduria y experiencia me encantan aunque no haga mucho en este primer libro  Hay que tener un gran coraje para enfrentar a nuestros enemigos  pero hace falta el mismo valor para respaldar a nuestros amigos Harry como personaje me gusta bastante  al igual que Ron y Hermione aunque me parece que este primer libro es muy corto y no se llega a apreciar realmente lo que son entre ellos El libro esta narrado en 3era persona y este narrador es omnisciente  Algo bueno de este es que no deja que te pierdas mucho sobre lo importante y tampoco se excede en descripciones lo que favorece al lector Harry Potter sin duda es un gran exito  es un libro que puede ser leido tanto por chicos como por adultos y siempre van a pasar un buen momento  Creo que nadie deberia perderse la oportunidad de leerlo  Do you remember Scholastic book orders  I used to beg my parents to buy me books every time they came out  Up until third grade  I always ordered Goosebumps  Bailey School Kids  Ramona or anything that came with some girly toy I just had to have  When the book order came with Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone  I picked it out amongst a few Goosebumps I didn t yet have in my collection  When the order arrived  I read Harry Potter first Instantly  I was obsessed  My sisters were obsessed  Even my mother was obsessed  I lent the book to my best friend  who phoned me that night to gush over how obsessed she was  From that day on  we played Harry Potter every recess  We spent our lunch period copying out and personalizing Harry s acceptance letter to Hogwarts  and then pretended to be surprised when we  found  them  We were both Hermione Granger for Halloween  Our nerdom never ceased We were mocked heavily by the snotty girls in our third grade class  who insisted that sitting on the grass talking about the periods and bras they were all years away from was far more respectable than reading about wizards  of all things    But we didn t care  and we continued our devouring obsession through the Chamber of Secrets and the Prisoner of Azkaban Harry Potter had become something that we d never experienced before  Although we read constantly in attempt to escape the heinous plagues of school children during recess  we d never before been so immersed in a world so unlike our own  We wanted so badly to go to Hogwarts  to be sorted into a House  I in Ravenclaw  she in Gryffindor   to practice spells and eat Cauldron Cakes in the Great Hall  And though Harry s world was quite different from ours  it seemed so easy to relate to him  He was bullied  hurt  misunderstood  And with him  we kept going Shortly after the Chamber of Secrets became available through Scholastic  the other kids in our grade started to really get into them as well  Suddenly the snotty girls on the grass were loudly squealing about what houses they thought each other would be in  and how they just loathed Draco Malfoy  I remember one of them adamantly insisting that Hermione s name was pronounced  Her mee on Graunge urr  and got the entire class to agree with her instead of me  ah  third grade drama   But who laughed when the movie came out in fifth grade  Oh  that s right  I did It seems that there are a lot of catty reviews on here hating against Harry Potter  I guess I could understand why  considering how much I loathe Twilight  but the third grader in me still doesn t understand why anyone wouldn t want to disappear to Hogwarts every so often  Even in the later books of the series  when the action is obviously much heavier than that of the Philosopher s Stone  the Chamber of Secrets or the Prisoner of Azkaban  the books still have such a homely feel to them  I feel as if I ve grown up with these characters  I know them so well  Hell  they were a lot better than the kids I actually grew up with  so I d pick them no matter what  True story  this is how I first got into Harry Potter In 1999 I was in middle school  7th grade  and I had a friend who was super into reading  Regardless of how much I read now  for me  it was all about computers back then  And you have to understand  in 1999 computers were a big deal  My school got its first computer lab  where we d get to go once or twice a week and play on these huge MACs than ran DOS and we generally ended up playing Oregon Trail or education games  but still  it was a big deal But I digress  she was constantly telling me about this kid named Harry Potter  And she tried for ages to get me to read the series  Currently there were three books out  To get her to shut up  I agreed to put my name on the mile long wait list for the first book at the library  And because said wait list was a mile long  by the time I was notified that I could pick up the book  I d already forgotten about it  I almost didn t go get the book  I almost passed on Harry Potter  But that s the moment  in literary terms  that my life changed  Because I devoured the first book  forced my mom to buy me the next two books which I read each in about a week  respectively  and then had my first experience of waiting desperately for a next release My high school life  in terms of books  can be described as endlessly waiting for the next Harry Potter book to come out  and nerding out over it with my best friends  I still remember buying each book  who I was with  when it happened and how I did nothing but read forever afterwards  refusing to be interrupted So I don t know why I took me 14 years to reread the first book  But in a way  rereading thing was like reading it for the first time  because I remembered everything that happened in it  and I ve seen the movie a million times  but the words themselves were forgotten over time  So I really and truly got to have a second first time with this book  and it s still as magical now as it was when I was a kid Reading this book  now as an adult  I m still so completely charmed by it  This book made me laugh so unexpectedly  and I got teary at certain points  I felt like a kid again rereading this book  going on an adventure with Harry one more time  I knew how the story ended  but it still managed to surprise me  and delight me  and just wow me I really can t imagine my life without Harry Potter  This is the kid that I grew up with  We both faced challenges and those ever awkward teenage years  and eventually Harry and I both grew up  I feel like Harry is someone I really know  and as corny as it sounds  he s a part of me  not just a part of my childhood I intended only to just reread this first book  but after being so enchanted once more by it  I can t wait to rush into reading the next  and I may just reread the whole series  Harry Potter is a modern classic for a reason  and he means the world to me  As a girl who loves all things magical fantasy  I think I can safely say that Harry Potter really was the most epic series of books that has come out in my generation  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone really opened the door to the world of fantasy for so many people  adults   kids alike  Once the movies came out  for people who don t read  Harry Potter really became a phenomenal adventure that everyone loved  Even my boyfriend   who would make fun of me for reading  kid books    fell in love with Harry once he hit the big screen   There isn t much I don t like about H P  The storyline was great  The villain was memorable and the characters were engaging and just all around likeable  You couldn t help but feel for Harry  or laugh with at Ron  or just shake your head in dazed exasperation at Hermione  And while none of us could relate to Harry on the parental level   how many people do you know with parents who were blown up by an evil wizard     we could still relate to so many other things  Ron with his self esteem issues   occasional burst of jealousy  having to live in the shadow of 5 older brothers   a famous best friend  We watched   waited as Hermione fell in love with one of her best friends   struggled to make him see her as more then the braniac girl next door   we felt Harry s joy in finding a loving family among his friends  From the minute you open the Sorcerer s Stone  you re sucked in and you can t let go until the Deathly Hallows  and by then you re screaming inside because it s the end of something awesome  One of my favorite aspects of Harry Potter is probably Hogwarts  Who wouldn t love the idea of a secret school that is the epitome of magic  Wouldn t you just love to climb the towers   learn Divination with Professor Trelawney  Or Transfiguration with Professor McGonagall  Having been young when I first read this book  I was captivated with the idea of a magical school where a child would be housed with like minded kids  Voldemort was the perfect villain  He was scary  ruthless and a right murdering bastard  What I liked most about He Who Must Not Be Named was the fact that while he was intelligent  a criminal mastermind even  Voldemort was weak  He feared love  shunned it   disregarded it  No matter how cunning or clever he was  Voldemort would never understand love  My favorite character is probably Luna  I love her strangely odd   unapologetic personality  She was fearless though Im sure it was mistaken for foolishness  A breath of fresh air  full of random possible facts  Luna was a loyal trustworthy friend who is stronger   more clever then people believe her to be I would very much recommend these books to anyone who hasn t read them  I would also recommend them to anyone who saw the movies but didn t bother reading the books  This is an amazing book that s a good read for people of all ages  Five stars is not enough  Is there an infinity star option The Harry Potter books are my favorite books  Ever  Unless you count the Bible  Then they re just below that If you haven t read these books  then you re probably wasting your life  and the rest of everyone s air  Just saying I remember reading this one for the first time in fifth grade  I was very excited because my teacher s name was Mrs  Norris  and that was Filch s cat s name  And I LOVED the twist ending  One things I love about these books is there s always some sort of ending you re never expecting  It s absolutely incredible  I fell in love with the Potter universe  not because it s magical  but because it makes magic seem    less magical  in a way  I don t want to say  real   I get annoyed when people try to finish my sentence with the word  real  when I m trying to describe what I mean  They always get this sort of   snarky  condescending  I know what you re going to say and its stupid and cliche expression  But that s not the word  I m not sure I know the word  But  real  doesn t really cover it  Believable  Down to earth  It s almost a de mystification of a magical world  But at the same time   it s so much better and more magical and incredible and absolutely UNbelievable at the same time  I think it gives a sense of normalcy to the magic that the characters do  There are governments  laws aside from just the usual dramatic  You must keep our realm a secret   laws  Schools  competitions  sports  banks   everything  Pretty freakin  awesome  The first three books in this series were among the last set of books I read for leisure during my childhood  I remember being completely enthralled by the book  The notion of going from a subjugated and mundane life to a world of womder  magic and reverence was so exciting to me  Full disclosure    I wanted to be Harry Potter  I wanted to discover that I had this great power laying dormant inside of me and be whisked away to a magical land to take part various fantastical activities  Sadly it never happened and I grew up  but I am appreciative of the escape that the book once offered me as I got lost in its pages and lived vicariously through Harry  becoming friends with Ron Hermoine  learning Quiditch and exploring the grounds of Hogwarts  Sadly I never got to the later boks but I enjoyed the movies and I this first book to thank for that  I plan to pass my books on to my future children and students in hopes that they provide them the wonderful adventures I know to be contained within these pages  Decided to do a re read of the entire Harry Potter series  mostly because I m beginning to miss the series and wanted to bring it back to life in my mind   not that it ever left  I ve just been focusing on other things   and I managed to read this book in just under three hours  As I found when I was younger  I thoroughly enjoyed the book and just simply couldn t put it down  Even though I knew exactly what was going to happen  I still found my heart pounding at every significant event  When Harry first saw the castle  I found my eyes welling up because of nostalgic feelings and I couldn t quite let them go throughout the entirety of the book  Despite how I have picked up more differences between the book and the movie than I did when I read it a few years back  I can still say that the book is tons better  I just love how J K Rowling has introduced us into the world of Hogwarts  and along with the characters telling Harry everything about the world  we have also been told about it too   and I find it amazing how she has grasped me once again into the series  and I find myself loving it even more than before   How is that even possible      If you haven t read this series before  please do  You won t regret it  Despite how this is said a lot  I m going to say it anyway  this series has really changed my life  It shaped me as a person  and has really influenced the person who I am today Overall  fantastic  Nothing to pick at  for me Thanks for reading     It was a rainy day in July 2002 when I was first introduced to Harry potter  My father had brought the book   Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone   from the local library  That was the day and its today in 2013 I am as hooked to Harry Potter  maybe more so than before  as I was in 2002 when I first read about him The Harry Potter phenomenon started in 1997 when the first book   Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone   was published in Britain  The same book was published as  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone  in the United States  It was the debut novel by J K  Rowling and brought great acclaim to her as an author The story revolves around Harry who is an orphan and is being brought up by his Aunt and Uncle  He is mistreated by his relations  who make him sleep in a cupboard under the stairs  Strange unexplained things have always happened to Harry like strange people bowing and winking at him as if they know him or howsoever times he got his hair cut they instantly became long and unruly like before or one time his aunt tried to forcefully make him wear Dudley s old sweater and it got so small that it didn t fit him which was impossible because Dudley was so fat The dilemma with Harry is that others know more about him than he does himself  He has no recollection of his parent s death and is forbidden to ask questions about anything  He is only told that they died in a car crash  He has a queer lightning shaped scar on his forehead and feels that that is the only notable thing about him for he is skinny  wears Dudley s old baggy clothes  has his spectacles kept together with cello tape and never seems to be able to get his unruly  black hair in order  But soon life takes a turn and he comes to know that he is no ordinary boy but a wizard  Yeah you heard me right  Harry Potter is a wizard whose parents died not in a car crash but trying to save him from Voldemort  or  You Know Who  or  One Who must not be named    who inspires such fear in people that no one dares to call him by name  Now its ten years since Voldermort killed Harry s parents  tried killing Harry and disappeared mysteriously  some say that he lost his powers but is still in hiding  waiting to come back  but his terror still lingers in the minds of the wizard community which fears his return Harry soon finds himself whisked to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry where he makes friends  fights trolls  plays quidditch  has classes on potion making  defense against the dark arts and other magical subjects and also comes to know more about his parents and the man who killed them  Voldemort  Voldemort is again seen trying to come to power through the Philosopher s Stone and soon it s up to Harry and his friends to prevent him from finding it The plot is very novel and stands out with its fresh story line  very innovative settings and heart felt characters which made it difficult for me to believe that its J K  Rowling s debut novel Though the theme of the book is magic and fantasy yet I never felt like I was reading anything far fetched  Such is the skill with which Rowling threads together the events that they feel authentic and I felt connected Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and wizardry is a creation of genius and is depicted as a mysterious place which thrilled me with lively descriptions of ceilings that looked like stars filled sky  of ghosts floating in air  castle like settings with long passageways  direction changing stairways  moving pictures  candles floating in the air  long tables with self appearing food  big grounds for playing quidditch etc Rowling gives a memorable introduction to Harry with the title  The Boy Who Lived   The setting of the scenes and the description of the characters is so lively that it created a picture in my mind and all through the book I felt like everything was happening to me firsthand She is able to make the reader feel each and every emotion experienced by the characters in the book like surprise and happiness which Harry felt when he came to know that he was a wizard or longing  sadness and half joy when Harry could see his parents standing behind him in the Mirror of Erised The introduction of the Durselys is also very funny  Mr and Mrs Dursely  of number four  Privet Drive  were proud to say that they were perfectly normal  thank you very much  They were the last people you d expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious  because they just didn t hold with such nonsense  I felt I had met such people while I read the description  Rowling also sketches her characters in a comical light with introducing statements like  a big  beefy man with hardly any neck  although he did have a very large mustache    thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck    pig in a wig  for Mr Dursely  Mrs Dursely and Dudley Dursely  The same method is also adopted for the other characters which not only made them hilarious  I ended laughing like a goon  but I felt made them feel more real and effective It s a 5 on 5 book with vivid characters that we all connect to and love like the wild looking but very caring Hagrid  gentle and a genius yet with a bit of humorous eccentricity Dumbledore  stern but kind  mother like McGonagall  bossy Hermoine  a best friend Ron  an enigma Snape  forgetful Neville  mischief makers George   Fred Weasely  The book is teeming with characters from teachers to students to house ghosts and it s very easy to love or at least love to hate them The book hooked me like it had done the first time I had read it years back  I have lost count of the number of times I have read this book but I still feel a thrill every time I pick it up to read such is the magic of Harry Potter  Kudos to J K  Rowling for writing such an inventive and imaginative novel and I am just dying to review the next book in the series This review is also available on my blog http   njkinny blogspot in Do visit my blog for more reviews     Wow  This book was perfection  Some may say it was written with too young of a hand  meaning it didn t have any depth to it whatsoever  but I think that fit perfectly  Yes  it wasn t a philosophical masterpiece like some other books of the time but it was from the perspective of an eleven year old Harry Potter  He hasn t grown up yet so  his  writing hasn t either  Ms  Rowling s writing perfectly embodied young Harry and the things a typical young wizard boy would do  say  or notice  I saw the movies  they were amazing by the way  and was expecting to love the books because I loved the movies  I was not disappointed and I don t think anyone else is either I honestly don t have any complaints  I was absorbed from the very first chapter and I couldn t help but laugh and cry and gasp while reading it whether or not I was in public  This is exactly what I look for in books   becoming them and being engaged in the story instead of it just being a few well chosen words on paper  I can t wait to read the rest of the books Five stars even though it deserves more  Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone by J K Rowling This is one of the most well known and popular children s books of all time  The fact that this statement can be made is for good reason  It is the perfect book for ages 8 12  The story is simple  a boy aged 11 called Harry Potter  He is an orphan who has grown up with his not so pleasant aunt  uncle and cousin Dudley  However on his birthday his whole world is turned upside down  He discovers from a half giant named Hagrid that he is in fact a wizard and his parents did not die in a car crash but were actually killed by an evil wizard called Voldemort  All this information is given in the first few chapters so truly captures the readers attention  Harry moves to Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry and befriends Hermione and Ron who become his two best friends  As Harry adapts to his new world he goes through many adventures  From finding out that he can actual fly on a broomstick  to tackling trolls at Halloween and helping a dragon called Norbit to be freed  All along the story Harry and his friends meet characters such as Professor Snape who has a strong dislike towards him and the brilliant Professor Dumbledore  As the title suggests the Philosopher s Stone emerges midway through the book  and it is the object which is trying to be stolen by Lord Voldemort through the body of the vulnerable Professor Quirrell   The trio ask questions why its being targeted or being stored in Hogwarts  These questions lead Harry towards Lord Voldemort at the conclusion of the book but what would the consequences of his thrill for adventure become  It is very difficult not to love this book the first in the Harry Potter series and one that sets the marker for the rest  I like that from the first chapter in his bedroom under the stairs the reader is drawn in and it is very difficult to put the book down I would pick this book for a more older child of maybe 8 12 to read themselves or as a class or group book to read  The book gives an emphasis to the importance of friendship and loyalty  The story from start to finish is written to a very good standard and ideal for children reading on their own  The final point would be that Harry epitomises a true hero  He has all the characteristics bravery  tenacity and of course his desire to protect those he cares most about   This is one of the best if not the BEST book I ve ever read  I honestly wasn t in to Harry Potter but I wondered why so many people ADORE it  Now I know why  J K  Rowling CAN WRITE  This book really became a part of me when I read it  I felt every emotion in the book  I didn t really expect in the end that SPOILERS Quirrel was the bad guy  I thought Snape was  Good thing I didn t spoil myself before reading this book  The scene that really tugged my heartstrings was the part where Harry saw his Parents  Family  in the Mirror of the Erised  I really felt his longing  for his parents  and it really broke my insides  He never felt their love I guess he does because of the love protection his mother gave him when Voldemort tried to kill him when he was just a baby  But it s kinda different from the love that you really feel when your parents are alive so it s not the same  and I really felt for him   End of Spoilers It was really a fun read and I wished I could have read it when I was younger   But I m still young   I will read the rest of the series   Can t wait for the 2nd book  Hope I have a fun ride at Hogwarts again  I want to experience a magical wonderful trip and now all that s left for to do is ride the Hogwarts Express  Everyone should read this book  Hope everyone who will read this will have a fantastic  or should I say FUNTASTIC  ride  I came into this book series late    I was nearly an adult when I cracked open the cover of this book  Reading it  though  made me feel like a child again  This is one of the few book series I hate to put down as I read at night  I will literally keep going until my eyes droop  no matter how late it is Reading this book after finishing the series  I can see where Rowling lays the groundwork for everything to follow  Some of it is less than obvious  such as Harry s observations that there are times he suspects Snape might be a mind reader  Even the Sorting Hat s attempt to place him into Slytherin takes on an entirely new meaning after the final book  My encouragement is    if you ve read this series only once  read it again  If you ve never read it  read it  Get lost in it  Laugh over it  Cry with it  Rowling is a best seller  and one of the greatest childrens  authors of our time for a reason  If you re a Christian and hesitant about  the magic   toss your reservations out the window  You ll be dumbfounded at the Narnia esque symbolism spread throughout the books   There s a reason J K  Rowling can t resist picking up a Lewis book  and she pays homage to him here in a multitude of little ways only those familiar with Narnia will understand   I somehow missed the original craze over J K  Rowling s new series  I was teaching and going to graduate school when the 3rd book came out  One day in class I turned from writing on the board to find about half my students busily reading away  I asked the school librarian about it  and she told me that she couldn t keep the books on the shelves  that they were incredible  and that the author was actually in town that afternoon for a book signing  and she wished she could go  I told her I d go ahead and go  and get a book signed for her  She said best to get there early  I said  Well  of course  I have class tonight  I ll just go  get the book signed  and get to class   I had No  Idea When I got to the bookstore  six hours before the signing was scheduled to start  the line was already stretched almost the full way around the block  This is a Washington  D C  block  folks   I asked the person in line ahead of me if she would save my place while I went to buy the books  and she kindly said yes  or I wouldn t have this story to tell   I went inside and bought the first three books  A store clerk was walking down the line  handing out tickets   What s this for    She s only signing 400 books at this stop   the woman replied  handing me my ticket and walking along  There were only ten tickets behind me before she ran out  The fuss made by those who came after was tremendous  The news crews started setting up hours before she was set to begin signing    BBC  local  national    That was when I figured I might as well find out what this was about  I opened the first book Needless to say  I was an insta fan  I blitzed through the first two books waiting in that line over the next five hours  I remain a steadfast fan to this day  Anyone who can get that many kids to read that much  is a genius    and the books really are that good  FOREWORDHarry Potter will become a timeless classic  and it was all started here  This is a series that will go down in history due to it s outstanding story  endearing characters  and overall feeling of  magic  MY REVIEWThis particular book is the one that started it all  and I had read this for the first time as a 10 year old  but now that I have gone back and re read it  it is truly even more amazing  A lot of people think that the underdog rising up to the hero is overused  but it fits Harry 100   The reason this character and book series stand out so much are because he is the hero  with his faults admitted  and his thirst for vengeance of his parents  who were murdered by Lord Voldemort when he was only 1 year old  The reason its so fitting is because he doesn t want to be the hero  he wants to be happy  but in order to protect his loved ones  he ll do anything  As for the Sorcerer s Stone  it explores Harry s introduction to the Wizard World and his delight with it  He loves being away from his aunt and uncle who could care less and abusive cousin  He s excited at having friends  Ron Weasly and Hermione Granger  whom he can confide to  And I could be wrong  but ANY kid would be happy about going to wizard school  He goes along regularly there until trouble arises and he is needed to vanquish the evil within Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry  Though there is one thing that makes him particularly different  his scar  It s why he s a hero  why he s famous  As a child  an innocent 1 year old  the Darkest wizard alive came after him and his family  all to kill Harry  Voldemort was victorious in killing his parents  but the Killing Curse rebounded on He Who Must Not Be Named and made so weakened  he could not walk  And Harry survived  known as a hero and savior throughout the world CONCLUSIONMy favorite fictional characters of all time are Harry Potter characters  Harry himelf  Albus Dumbledore  Fred and George Weasly  and Ginny Weasly  This series is close to my heart and will never be forgotten because of it s intricate way of storytelling and lovable characters that will stick with you  I would suggest Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone to anybody that hasn t read it and anyone that likes the fantasy genre Now I end here  with my final comment  J K  Rowling is a literary genius and has to be for this book to be written in her car  in which she was living in at the time   It s quite peculiar to reread the book after a couple of years  During my childhood I used to read it every two months or so yet there were some things I never noticed when I was 8 or 9 For starters  did Hagrid always drink so much  I swear those parts suddenly appeared in the book now  I can t remember them at all  When he came to pick up Harry from the Dursleys   he took out  a bottle of some amber liquid which he took a swig from before starting to make tea   Also  when Harry meets Draco for the first time at Madam Malkin s  when they were still quite hospitable to each other   Malfoy says about Hagrid  I heard he       lives in a hut in the school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk  tries to do magic and ends up setting fire to his bed   Hagrid also goes to have a drink at the Leaky Cauldron  whose barman seemed to know him well enough when he first appeared with Harry there  after the ride at the Gringotts when he retrieved You Know What from vault seven hundred and thirteen  He drinks so much at the Christmas feast that he actually kisses McGonagall on the cheek  Also  he frequents the Hog s Head  which I actually remember since it was an important plot point and I think I couldn t really figure out why he would do that back when I was nine   I guess I kind of skipped over these parts back then but now I find them somehow perturbing  since Hagrid was supposed to be supervising Harry at most of these times  I have also no idea how come I always dreaded reading the book s beginning  Harry s time at the Dursleys    It s positively absurd in a Roald Dahl inspired British way  I wonder why so many children found this part tedious  maybe the suburban life parody only becomes amusing starting a certain age Another thing   it was Fred and George who  after talking to Harry fleetingly while helping him with his trunk  introduced him and Ron to each other  If it wasn t for the twins then they could possibly have spent half of their train ride sitting awkwardly opposite each other  Couldn t be more realistic Also  Hermione really is annoying at the beginning  I wonder how possibly I could never see that before  Moreover  it seems like if it wasn t for Harry and Ron then she would have had no friends at all   which is just sad but so truthful Lastly  I admire how JK Rowling put some hints here and there of the rest of the series  view spoiler  Firenze the centaur saves Harry from the blood drinking Voldemort slash Quirell and the rest of the centaurs criticize him for trying to go against the stars  Was it the fact that Voldemort was supposed to kill Harry  But that only happened in the last book  I never paid much attention to this scene  turns out it was foreshadowing the ending of the series  Also  Harry asks about the prophecy near the ending of the book and Dumbledore answers him that he would tell him once the time comes  although I guess Harry let go of the matter far to easily for a curious eleven year old    hide spoiler  Great to see it was all planned out since the very beginning  Creativity Spices up Standard Fantasy FareWhile many fantasy books  I m looking at you  Terry Goodkind  often concoct magical mumbo jumbo or pull solutions out of thin air  JK Rowling deftly sidesteps this pitfall and delivers an entertaining  action packed romp through a magical word that coexists  fairly well  at least in this introductory novel  with the rest of modern society Starting with Voldemort s defeat and the ensuing celebrations  the story leaps forward ten years  Living with the bigoted Dursleys  Harry is whisked away to Hogwarts where his true talents and skills can be put to use  He meets Ron on the train and the pair later make an unbreakable bond with Hermione Granger  brainiac  living dictionary and oftentimes annoying creator of run on paragraphs  The characters are the true strength of the series  and can easily make or break a franchise  Rowling has done an excellent job of making characters relatable and realistic Even more creative and riveting is Quidditch  a rip roaring wizardly sport that soars through the skies  It s unique enough to hook adults into the series  It s certainly more interesting than baseball or golf A common trap  and trope  that writers can fall into is the Mary Sue Gary Stu syndrome  By creating a character so perfect that EVERYTHING goes their way  to the point that the final boss is a mere nuisance   plots and character development become chores  Nothing is surprising and readers often give up or trudge through  bored to tears by the penultimate chapter  None of that is present here  to Ms  Rowling s great credit Characters often work together to overcome obstacles  true courage and bravery is displayed  an exemplary example to young readers everywhere  and even Harry s warts are shown for all to see  He s impulsive and quick to anger  He has little inborn talent for magic  and certainly no eclectic memory  He has to strive and work for every mark in an exam  and that makes him more human  more realistic and more readable  Why did you decide to read the book I decided to read the book  Harry potter and the Sorcerer s stone  written by J K Rowlimg because I was so amazed by the movie I wanted to see if the book was going to be the same Bingo board The category that the book completes is a book which has been made into a film  I think that having this category on the board is a really good idea because once you have finished reading the book you get to watch the film Favorite quote My favourite quote from the book is   Your mother died to save you  If there is one thing Voldemort cannot understand  it is love  He didn t realize that love as powerful as your mother s for you leave its own mark  Not a scar  no visible sign   to have been loved so deeply  even though the person who loved us is gone  will give us some protection forever  It is in your very skin  Quirrell  full of hatred  greed and ambition  sharing his soul with Voldemort  could not touch you for this reason  It was agony to touch a person marked by something so good skin   I find this quote very sad as it says that someone who is loved very much by another person they would risk their life for them and that love is a very powerful thing and nothing can defeat it  As it says that Quirrell  who was full of many bad things and only thought of doing horrible things he and Voldemort do not understand how powerful love is and what it is Something I learned Something I learned from this book is that it take a lot of courage to stand up to an enemy but it takes a lot more to stand up to your friends and someone that you love dearly even if they re gone they will always love you Favorite character A character that I found interesting was Professor Quirrell because he didn t care about anything good  he was full of hatred  greed and ambition  All he wanted was to become powerful  strong and to defeat Harry Potter  Professor Quirrell thought that helping Voldemort by sharing his soul with him would help him to achieve those things but he was wrong  In the end Professor Quirrell died trying to kill Harry potter because he was sharing his soul with Voldemort  Voldemort didn t understand how strong love was especially the love that Harry potter s mother had for him  Professor Quirrell showed us how having so much hatred and greed can lead to something horrible Difference from the movie There were quite a few differences from the movie  some scenes were before others and some scenes were not added in the movie from the book  Many lines from the book were not said and many lines were added in the movie  Some parts of the movie were exaggerated more than they were in the book an example is when Harry potter was at the train station going to Hogwarts  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone by J K  Rowling Why did you decide to read this book  I decided to read this book because I remember my mum reading it to me when I was little and I really enjoyed it  so I thought why not read it again What category on the bingo board does the book complete   I chose to put this book under the category of a book that has been made into a movie  I love this category because after you have read the book you get to watch the movie and decide which is better What s your favourite quote from the book  And why  It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live      J K  Rowling   This is my favourite quote from the book I like the message that it gives  I think it means that me cant live life thinking to much you have to live in the moment   If you spend all of your timing dreaming and worrying you might miss your chance to live  What is something new you have learnt from the book  Something new I learnt from this book was that you always need your friends  In the book Harry tries to go through things by his self but Hermoine and Ron being great friends reminded him he didn t have to do it alone  Sometimes we just need reminding that our friends are here to help A character or setting that was interesting  And why  I love the setting of Hogwarts  There is something about it that always make me so happy inside  It makes me excited especially when the music starts playing  I found it interesting how a author could make up such a cool place which i admire  Overall I really enjoyed re reading this book again  Fantastic  Sure  I have a problem with black and white depictions of evil  Between Draco Malfoy  Snape  the Dursley s and Voldemort  there s plenty of fire and brimstone worthy characters to go around  A strong tie between appearance  name  and a perceived  goodness  remains  Who wouldn t assume that people and houses named Draco Malfoy  Snape  Crabbe  Goyle  and Slytherin weren t iffy or villainous  Why wouldn t Snape  with his dark appearance and hooked nose  be viewed with suspicion  fear and loathing  Rowling does let some grayness into the mix as the story progresses  but some stereotypes do remain intact My issues with a simplistic depiction of good and evil aside  Rowling spins an entertaining  lush  and imaginative tale  Such great world building  The descriptions of meals in the main hall made my mouth water  I really want to hang out on Diagon Alley  I d be willing to overlook excessive fees to keep my money at Gringotts Wizarding Bank  I d risk triggering my gag reflex to try Bertie Bott s Every Flavor Beans  I want an owl messenger  And my kingdom to catch a train at Platform 9 3 4 Rowling uses humor and heartstring tugs well  I was genuinely touched by Harry s mirror aided encounter with his family  Personally  I can t imagine never having known my own mother  father and brother  Then there s the playfully disrespectful exchange between the Weasley twins and their mother at Platform 9 3 4  Fred  you next   the plump woman said  I m not Fred  I m George   said the boy   Honestly  woman  you call yourself our mother  Can t you tell I m George   Sorry  George  dear   Only joking  I am Fred   said the boy  and off he went Dialogue  world building  characters  You name it  Rowling nails it  I can t wait to move on through the Harry Potter series  And while I m at it  I can t wait till the day arrives when women like Jo Rowling don t feel pressure to disguise their gender through using ititials or masculine nom de plumes  Jo  Mary Anne Evans  aka George Eliot   and plenty of others deserve better  Where to begin  10 years  7 books  8 movies and 1 series that changed everything  These books are not just another fantasy series  They changed things  before Potter  reading was laughable  Kids would much rather sit in front of a TV screen all day long rather than read a book  Harry Potter changed that  Reading became fun again  it brought back the magic of sitting down in a quiet place  opening a good book and diving into a whole new world  Now parents are finding themselves taking reading privledges away because it s our TV now  All thanks to one British woman  One of the many things I love about these books is that they are for everyone  It doesn t matter where you are in the world  whether you are male or female  or whether you are old or young  All over the world there are copies of these books in peoples homes  Even now that the books are over  the movies are over   the magic never dies   Whether you come back by page or by the big screen  Hogwarts will always be there to welcome you home   JK Rowling Harry Potter will always be dear to my heart  It is one of those defining things in my life  That is just how amazing these books are  There have been no other set of books that have had the ability to do that and I know many many others feel the same  So I ll leave you with wise words of Alan Rickman  when I m 80 years old  my friends and family will ask  after all this time   and I will said   always  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone by J K RowlingWhy did you decide to read the book I decided to read the book  Harry potter and the Sorcerer s stone  because I was truly amazed by the movie  the characters  the themes  the settings and the ideas  The whole package  Which category on the bingo board this book completes The category that this book completes is   A science fiction or fantasy book I am not one to read science fiction or fantasy books as a preference however  the movie is one of my favourites so I had high expectations for the bookMy Favourite quote from this book  and why  My favourite quote from the book is  Your mother died to save you  If there is one thing Voldemort cannot understand  it is love  He didn t realize that love as powerful as your mother s for you leave its own mark  Not a scar  no visible sign   to have been loved so deeply  even though the person who loved us is gone  will give us some protection forever  It is in your very skin  Quirrell  full of hatred  greed and ambition  sharing his soul with Voldemort  could not touch you for this reason  It was agony to touch a person marked by something so good skin   Love is a deep  powerful  and ineffable emotion of attachment to  and affection for  another being or beings  It gives those who experience it the ability to do very great things  Someone full of hate  such as Tom Riddle  who has never known it even once in their entire life  cannot understand love s full magical properties  Love is one of the hardest and strongest kinds of magic and as such  there is a room devoted to the study of it in the Department of Mysteries  Something new I learned from this book is  No post on Sundays   And that no matter how badly you are treated through out your life  you deserve better and great things will come  There is always light at the end of the tunnel A character or setting in this book that was interesting to me  and why  Hogwarts  With moving stairs  wands  pet owls  fly keys  alive chess pieces  and MAGIC  Hogwarts is unlike anything I have ever imagined  far beyond what I imagined  J K Rowling is able to create a novel that engages the readers entirely  I felt like I was in the book interacting with the characters and experiencing everything for my self  Hogwarts played a huge part in the enchanting story and portraying the best story possible   How do you write a proper review for the book that changed your life I guess  you can t  I know  Harry Potter  isn t in need of reviews to make people read it  especially not a review written by me  but if someone  anyone  decides to read this book because of what I wrote  then my job here is done Like I said  this book is THE book  MY book  The one story that changed my life  though I was only seven years old when I first read it  I was deeply affected by it  I ve always had a very vivid imagination  and I have always enjoyed reading  but when I read this book  everything changed I started to truly believe in magic  But not the kind of magic that Harry practiced  but the magic of words  J K  Rowling wrote a beautiful  magical story that ricocheted my imagination and expanded my horizons  and while some people think books are just books  for me  they were  are and always will be  friends  with the power to change us  Harry is a character that defined a generation  He is the most amazing boy that could ever exist  So honest  nice  loyal  brave  selfless and big hearted  He was  still is  someone who I looked up to  And what is more beautiful than to read about someone like Harry  Reading about his life was a bit sad  can you imagine growing up as an orphan and with people like the Dursley s  But still  he s good at heart  When he discovers that there s a whole new world out there  with a new life for him  that is hope  Harry teaches us that no matter what horrible things happen to us  we should not let that change us in a bad way  Harry s story is about being a  misfit  with no friends  who suddenly finds himself immersed in a magical world  where he belongs and where he is finally happy  I loved Harry s friendship with Ron and Hermione  BEST FREAKING FRIENDSHIP EVER  This book taught me what is the true meaning of friendship  They complemented each other wonderfully  Every character in this book have a story  every single one of them become a part of you  It s like you  along Harry  meet all these new people  Neville  Hagrid  Seamus  The Weasley s  Dumbledore    They all felt like friends  So I was in very good company whilst reading it  Even the evil characters amused me Rowling wrote an incredibly original  engrossing and enchanting story that captivated me equally as a kid an as an adult  World building was one of the most complex  beautiful and complete I ve came across in literature YA ever  Spells  magical creatures  potions  professors  school subjects  magic books  wizardry pubs  shops  alleys  Hogwarts and the most amazing sport ever  quidditch  just to name a few of the incredible things you will find in this book   I could go on  and on with this non objective review  if this is still considered as a review   but I don t think you need to read more to see how much I love this book  All I have to say is that this is a classic  epic story  written by an epic author  That this is a magical book that holds great power within its pages  that holds the power of changing lifes  And that  is the real magic I wouldn t give this less than 5 stars even if Fluffy wanted to rip my head off  With Harry Potter and the Philosopher s stone  JK Rowling changed my whole life I was only 4 years old when my parents decided to buy this book and read it to me and my younger brother  I can tell you that the whole series has always had a great impact on the both of us We ve been playing Harry Potter the whole day  pretending to go to Hogwarts ourselves and listened to the audiobooks because we were still to young to read the books on our own  Nowadays  I still love the series with heart and soul  The first book is one of my favorites because it is the beginning of something big  something spectacular  something that will always be part of my life Of course  I have a different view on the Philosopher s Stone now  15 years have passed and I am now able to understand much more than I have before  I mean  how can a 4 year old girl grasp the topic of unconditional love  The book is easy to read and easy to understand  it is humorous and moving  All in all  it is wonderful  fantastic  magical  And I never get tired re reading it  I decided to read this book because of a couple of reasons  The first reason I decided to read this book was because I wanted to watch the movies but I don t like watching the movies before I read the books  The main reason I decided to read this book though was because my Mum had recommended it to me when I was in year 5 or 6  but I never got around to reading it  She kept persisting me trying to get me to read the books and I eventually decided to read it A character I found interesting from the book was Uncle Vernon  Harry s uncle   This is because of the way he treats Harry compared to his own son Dudley  Uncle Vernon doesn t see Harry as being normal and is very much a burden for him to look after  Harry doesn t get his own room but has to live in the cupboard under the stairs  His clothes are only hand me downs and has to cook meals and clean up  But for Dudley it is a whole different story  On his birthday he got 36 presents and complained that he got 37 last year so he wanted more  He is chubby  meaning that he gets over fed by his parents  He is going to one of the nicest schools in the country  and they were going to send Harry to a cheaper school until he went to Hogwarts   He always has the latest and greatest gadgets and never has to do any chores  I think that Uncle Vernon treats Harry and Dudley too differently and I find it really weird and interesting that he could treat Harry with so much disrespect when he is living with Uncle Vernon for his whole childhood  While at the same time he is giving his own child so much more love and presents This book comes under the category  a book recommended by a member of your family   This book was recommended to me by my mum  But of course because this book is so popular  lots of my other friends had recommended it to me as well  But it was my Mum s recommendation that got me reading the book a quote that intrigues me in the book is  Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself   This quote is said by Dumbledore to Harry  this means that if someone in the Harry Potter books was to say Voldemort s name  nothing will happen  But by not saying it  only more fear will build up  I like this quote because it is when I realise that Voldemort is just a name and by saying it  it doesn t mean that he will come and kill you  I also find it intriguing because no one else has caught on that it is just a name and that it has to be Dumbledore to make Harry realise what the effect is of not saying Voldemort I learnt from this book that if you have been treated badly through out your life  it doesn t mean that you need to treat others the way that you have been treated  I learnt this from Harry s personality  He was treated so horribly by his uncle and aunty and by Dudley  but he still has a very kind personality and doesn t let his family s bullying affect him or the way he treats others   I feel ashamed for not have read the series earlier  but it s really difficult to get books here   It s another major reason as to why I want to move away   I was not experienced with the whole  ordering books  ordeal  so I kept on delaying buying the books Anyway  it s really hard to review the Harry Potter books I enjoyed it  I started crying during the first two paragraphs  then crying again for 2 pages  then crying when the twins appeared  but after those first few chapters  I finally got  into it I forgot just how significant some parts of this book are and when I read this book  I feel like I remembered all those little things I love how we start very slowly in the first book  There aren t many  sad  parts and it has an uplifting ending The part that touched me the most has to be when Harry first meets the Mirror of Erised  I just cried so hard  That whole chapter broke my heart  It s hard to describe the emotions you go through  It s such a significant chapter I love how quirky Dumbledore is  He s still deep  but very gay  I love seeing just how happy he is  You don t see that much as the books progress  When a book or a movie gains widespread popularity  it s a phase  I knew this by my early twenties  It appeals to everyone because it sets up a stupid enemy for a larger than life hero to knock down with a clever catch phrase and a few well timed punches  In the case of Harry Potter and Whatever the Gimmick was  he knocked them out with magic  Every time someone mentioned it I explained why it was great for children  but adults were merely appreciating how well written it was for them  I would not personally read it  So when my little sister mailed me her own copy to my station overseas  my heart dropped   Sorry  honey  but I already know it s not worth my time   Hell no  You can t say that to an 11 year old  I d have to read enough to understand why she loved it  On page one  I had to give J  K  Rowling credit for describing what the Dursleys did to be unsympathetic rather than providing adjectives to circumvent our decision making process  On page two  I saw that she understood that a normal looking family might be hiding ugly behavior  and it wasn t necessarily the fault of the one they blamed  By page three  she was hinting that these peoples  world was about to be turned up side down by people far more interesting than themselves and I HAD to know why  For years  I felt that most writing failed to speak to me  YA books were too young  romance and crime felt formulaic  horror was hopeless and disgusting  and most classic literature required more engagement with politics than I wanted at that point in my life  Sci Fi and Fantasy were not real enough  J  K  Rowling combined what I wanted to see in a story in a setting I expected to love  Harry and his friends break rules and oppose unfair treatment to stop a bad guy whose name others are afraid to say  I expected Rowling to capitalize on our desire to feel heroic given our own inherent virtue against the inevitable failure of evil  Instead  she made a true hero who lives our desire to do the right thing even when others can t admit it s all around them  I started to love reading again because of this book  and I thank J  K  Rowling for enduring her own bad times to create it  Kelsey CollinsRowling  J  K   1998   Harry potter and the sorcerer s stone  New York  Scholastic Inc Genre  AdventureFormat  Audio bookSelection Process  Audio book was recommended by a friend This

wonderful  imaginative world  The audio book version of Rowling s book is read by Jim Dale  Dale does a fabulous job and makes the story even more exciting  The character s voices are so differentiated and he has a smooth and easy to listen to voice  Highly Recommended  Harry Potter and The Sorcerer s Stone is the first book of the phenomenal Harry Potter series  This book is about how an orphan named Harry Potter finds out that he s a wizard at the age of 11  He was supposed to know about the wizard world from a younger age  but his aunt and uncle hated magic  They despised it with a passion  They didn t want Harry to do anything with the wizarding world enough though he was destined to  Harry Potter was very famous but he didn t know it  He was famous for this scar and the fact that he  defeated  Voldemort  Lord Voldemort was an evil wizard who used magic evilly  He killed Harry s parents because they wouldn t join his side and become Death Eaters    his minions  After

people and goes on an epic adventure that finally shows who killed his parentsI thought this book was amaaazing  I love Harry Potter and I have an obsession over it  I thought this book was a perfect first book  It left you thinking about what was going to happen next  There was a lot of funny moments in the book as well  As usual  J K Rowling never fails to amaze me  bukunya bagus  menurut gue ini topik yg masih jarang muncul saat itu  makanya gue tertarik banget  untungnya bukunya ngga ngecewain    what i got from this book  i realize that everyone has his own specialty and you can t ignore it   resensi yg gue buat dari bukukita com        Buku ini sangat menarik minat saya untuk membacanya karena saya melihat sambutan yang luar biasa terhadap buku ini dari internet  Kala itu saya masih tidak bisa membeli buku dengan uang jajan saya sehingga saya meminta pada kakak saya  Pada awalnya  mereka ragu untuk membelikan saya buku tersebut  namun setelah mereka membacanya sendiri  ternyata mereka juga sangat menikmati buku yang dikemas dalam bahasa yang cukup apik ini Bermula dari datangnya surat panggilan Harry dari sekolah sihir Hogwarts  Harry  yang selama ini hidup sebagai seorang anak yatim piatu biasa  tidak cukup mendapat kasih sayang dan juga gizi  dan selalu menjadi yang kedua setelah sepupunya  Dursley  Ternyata dibalik itu semua  Harry adalah seorang yang sangat spesial Paman dan bibinya berusaha menyembunyikan hal tersebut dengan menghindari surat panggilan tersebut  Namun pada akhirnya mereka harus menerima kenyataan bahwa Harry kembali ke  dunianya  dan menjadi  orang orang sepertinya  Segalanya berubah menjadi sangat indah bagi Harry kala menyadari bahwa ia memiliki kebahagiaan yang selama ini tidak ia dapatkan  Ternyata di dunia sihir  seorang anak tak istimewa sepertinya justru adalah seorang pahlawan Sedikit demi sedikit Harry menemukan bakat dan kemampuannya  juga masa lalunya  Bersama dua sahabatnya  Hermione dan Ron  Harry menjalani hari harinya  Sampai suatu saat kejadian kejadian tak biasa menimpa Horgwarts  mulai masuknya troll  sampai beredarnya gosip gosip tentang sesuatu yang disimpan Dumbledore di suatu ruangan rahasia Kala Harry dan kedua sahabatnya mulai mencari tahu tentang banyak hal  ia menemukan apa yang selama ini hilang darinya  Masa lalunya dan kedua orang tuanya  Juga musuh abadinya  Lord Voldemort Harry yang telah lolos dari kutukan tak termaafkan yang dilancarkan padanya kala ia masih bayi  kembali harus menghadapi bahaya yang menghadangnya  Voldemort berniat mengambil sesuatu yang disimpan Dumbledore dengan rapi Berbagai prasangka menyergap Harry  Demi membuktikan itu semua  Harry bersama Ron dan Hermione masuk ke dalam ruangan tempat menyimpan benda tersebut  Tanpa mereka sangka  banyak rintangan untuk sampai ke dalam  Mereka harus melewati beberapa ruangan tempat beberapa orang guru memberikan semacam ujian Harry sampai ke dalam jantung ruangan dan menemukan Voldemort di sana  Dibantu dengan seseorang yang jauh dari prasangkanya selama ini  Harry harus menyelamatkan nyawanya dan benda yang disimpan Dumbledore tersebut  Berhasilkah Harry melalui itu semua Menurut saya  buku ini adalah salah satu buku terbaik yang pernah saya baca  Saat Harry Potter masuk ke Indonesia  belum banyak buku buku bergenre sejenis yang beredar  Karena itulah Harry Potter seakan membawa angin baru bagi dunia perbukuan Indonesia Ditambah dengan imaginasi luar biasa dari sang pengarang yang membuat alur ceritanya cukup menyenangkan untuk diikuti karena yang tertulis di sana bukanlah sesuatu yang sering dibaca orang  J K  Rowling sukses menelurkan sebuah buku yang dapat dinikmati oleh berbagai kalangan usia     It was September 1998  the third Harry Potter book had just been released  Pottermania  What s that  It was still unknown except to a vast population of younglings who d read it    and I fell in love  Oh  how I fell in love  I fell in love with the poor  starved for affection  later known to be a twit Harry  I fell in love with the pretentious know it all Hermione  I fell in love with the awkward  grew up in his brother s shadows Ron    and most of all  I fell in love with the snarky  unplatable  snarling  rude  hygienically disinclined professor of potions  Severus Snape  Almost ten years later  I m still obsessed with it in many ways  This is the book that started it all  and naturally  my love for it is quite boundless  I love meeting Harry for the first time and I love how sweet and awkward he is  None of this angry man at the world schtick he has going on in later  much later  books  He genuinely cares for his friends and it isn t rooted in some form of anger or obligatory love  He s not yet infested with pimples and he s yet to fall in love  This is before Sirius  before Ginny  before Voldemort  before Dumbledore  before Avada Kedavra  before any of that shite happened and you have to wonder    what might have been if Harry hadn t been the Boy Who Lived   I finally reread Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone after so many years  and let me tell you  I actually hugged the book afterwards  I hesitated in writing this review because what could I say that hasn t already been said  But my mind s been stuck on Harry Potter  and I just had to let it out  So here we are Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone is not my favorite book in the series  but it definitely holds a place in my heart because it s the book that introduced us to the amazing  fantastic world of everything Harry Potter  Even Voldemort because  as Mr  Ollivanders said   terrible  but great   Although in this context  when I say great  I meant that he was able to acquire so much knowledge and Voldy was  undeniably  highly skilled  which is more often than not the basis for the usage of the word  great  I first read this book in 2001  and this copy is so special to me for so many reasons  When the whole Harry Potter franchise first became popular in the Philippines around the year 2000  a lot of schools banned the books  and it was highly controversial  I was approaching high school by then  and I wasn t aware of the whole hype  You know how I got a copy  My parents surprised me with the book for my birthday  How cool were they   I mean  they re pretty conventional and strict Catholics  but they didn t buy into the whole  magic is evil  argument back then  All they thought about was that I might enjoy the book  and so they gave it to me  Gosh  I love them  Funnily enough  I remember my mom giving this to me while I was in my school and she came to fetch me  Hahaha  Are they cool or what Another reason why I like Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone is that aside from the loss of Professor Quirrell  whom I first pitied but is now one of my most disliked characters in the HP world  all our beloved characters are happy here  If you ve read the series  then you must know that the books progressively get darker and darker  and this is one of the books that still has a happy tone to it I love the different values espoused in the book even though they are not  in your face   There s strong family ties  great friendship  support system  discipline  and knowing when to give a person space and a little slack to get his act together  I also love that even at a young age  Harry  Ron  and Hermione took it upon themselves to do what must be done even though they re scared  or they might get hurt Now that I m older and have read more books  I am even more impressed by J K  Rowling  While reading Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone  I really wondered at her imagination and how she was able to create this whole world  all these characters with different personalities  the various structures  hello  Gringotts and 9 3 4 quarters    and the character progression  She put all these fantastical creatures in a single world and made it  and nay  even logical that they are just there  goblins   centaurs   unicorns    Plus  she made you just want to be in that book  or even that the whole wizarding world is not just a figment of her imagination  even though there s  real  evil lurking everywhere  I know she s into adult mystery books now but I m really waiting for another fantasy series from her  I hope I m not the only one How s your 2014 so far    Five stars  of course  Could it have been anything else Review originally posted on my blog My Book Musings    Harry Potter has a mystierios life with his aunt  uncle  and cousin  Weird thinks happen  And then  one day he get a letter in the mail  Addressed to him  Who would ever write to me  he wondered  Then  one day  he finds out  On his 11th birthday  he gets the best present of all times  A giant named Hagrid knocks on their door and tells Harry that he s a wizard and he needs to go to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to learn spells with a magic wand  He s like  me  me  I can t be a wizard  you must of made a mistake   But Hagrid says  Yes you are   So Harry goes to Hogwarts and befriends Ron Weasley  a couragoes red headed boy  When Harry and Ron are on the Hogwarts Express  they discover a bossy voiced  brown haired girl named Hermione Granger  Ron isn t so sure about her at first Harry s experence with the sorting hat is difficult  after a lot of  but where to put you       the hat finally yells GRYFFINDOR      Harry goes to join Ron and has lot s of fun After a few weeks at Hogwarts  Harry and Ron finally befriend Hermione  she turns out to be a nice girl with alotof noledge  When they find out that the Sorcerer s Stone is being gaurded by Fluffy the three headed dog  they set off to save the stone  Hermione helps them in alot of sticky sitchations  Finally  Ron is actully happy that Hermione is their friend  Now  for those of you who did not get to the part where Harry  Ron  and Hermione save the stone  I will not continue  Read the book to find out what happens next  Back in 1998 my husband picked up this book and Chamber of Secrets before we headed out on a 5 hour drive to another state  He had heard some buzz about them being really great  I was not yet a children s librarian  and had never heard of the books  We loaded our one  and three year old girls in the car  and my husband started reading Sorcerer s Stone aloud while I drove  After a few hours  we switched places  and I realized that the girl in the book was not  in fact  named  Her mee own   but Hermione  Still  I struggled with the proper pronunciation of Hagrid   Hay grid    Not to mention the author s name  ROW ling  as in  row  row  row your boat   we should know this by now  people   That s something that drives me crazy  not knowing how an unusual name in a book is supposed to be pronounced  Oh  And if you listen to Jim Dale s outstanding audiobooks  you ll see that the  t  on the end of Voldemort was supposed to be silent  But I digress We loved it  We finished it up and dove straight into book 2  Then  along with everyone else in America who had discovered Harry  we had to wait for book 3  At the time  we thought the books were tremendous fun and very clever  We had no idea how amazingly complex the storyline would become by the time we were introduced to the Elder Wand  Did we love every moment along the way  No  Harry was waaaay too fifteen in Order of the Phoenix  There was too much wandering in the forest in Deathly Hallows  But still  Say what you will about Joanne Row Row Row Your Boat Rowling  but just keeping all the characters and storylines straight would ve been impossible for me  I remember reading one of the later books and thinking  She introduced that in the first book  WOW Some may argue with me  but I think this lady deserves every penny she s received from Harry and He Who Must Not Be Named  She has definitely earned it  A wonderful debut    a captivating tale of witches and wizards and the muggles  non magical folk  living amongst them  clueless and unaware of the enchanted world that lies just beyond their grasp I first read this book in the year 2001 and I did so out of curiosity of what all the excitement was about  I couldn t fathom such a great story that would have the whole nation reading  especially those who d never picked up a book before  So when my sister received books 1 3 on Christmas of 2001 I too joined the adventure and was surprised at how unique a story it was  Not only that but her style of writing was also unique and intriguing  The Dursleys are unlike any character that I ve ever come across in a book  And though she writes of a fictional world of magic  she does so in such a way that you will not only believe it but also hope that maybe there really is a magical world out there and you ve only got to be more observant to find it  If only you could discover platform 9 3 4 at King Cross Station   Her characters are impressively real and though she presents readers with a huge cast of characters  she handles it in such a way that you will not be overwhelmed or baffled  And you will experience each character s every emotion  fears and triumphs as if they were your own J K  had me at   Mr  and Mrs  Dursley  of number four  Privet Drive  were proud to say that they were perfectly normal  thank you very much   right up until  I m going to have a lot of fun with Dudley this summer     Selama sebelas tahun  Harry Potter hidup dalam penderitaan  Keluarga Dursley yang selama ini merawatnya tidak memperlakukan Harry dengan baik  Harry diberi kamar kecil berupa lemari di bawah tangga  Sering menjadi korban kejahilan Dudley  sepupu Harry yang super gendut  Serta hukuman dari paman dan bibinya karena hal aneh sering terjadi  seperti rambut Harry yang tumbuh sendiri atau berbicara dengan ular di kebun binatang Semua itu berubah saat Harry menerima surat yang diantarkan burung hantu dari Sekolah Sihir Hogwarts dan membuka identitas asli Harry yang ternyata seorang penyihir  Komunitas penyihir menyebutnya Anak Yang Bertahan Hidup karena berhasil mengalahkan Lord Voldemort  penyihir jahat yang membunuh orangtuanya Tahun pertama Harry di Hogwarts diisi berbagai pelajaran menarik seperti Mantra dan Ramuan  olahraga Quidditch dimana Harry bermain sebagai Seeker  dan bermain dengan sahabat barunya Ron Weasley dan Hermione Granger  Berbagai kejadian aneh akhirnya membawa Harry berhadapan dengan musuh besarnya  Lord Voldemort   Ini adalah seri pertama kisah Harry Potter dan mengantarkan JK Rowling meraih popularitas sebagai wanita terkaya di Inggris  Buku ini seperti mendobrak pakem2 yang ada mengenai buku anak  Sebagai buku anak  buku ini lebih tebal dengan cerita yang lebih kompleks dibandingkan buku sejenis  dibandingkan buku karangan Roald Dahl misalnya  Melalui tangan dingin Rowling  buku anak yang tebal ini dikemas secara menyenangkan sekaligus mengibur pembacanya  Buku ini pun memperkenalkan istilah2 dunia sihir Harry Potter yang kelak sangat populer diantara fansnya  Seperti Muggle ataupun mantra2 sihir yang diucapkan tokohnya  Buku ini juga menjaring banyak fans tidak hanya tokoh utamanya  namun juga dari tokoh antagonis seperti Severus Snape ataupun sekaliber Lord Voldemort Sekali baca  gak bisa berhenti sampai habis    I know this isn t exactly the most unique  groundbreaking statement ever made but   I love this little series of books you may have heard of  it s called  Harry Potter   Loooove them  These books make me happy  They are downright delightful  Don t try to fight it  you  I don t read popular books  snobs  Think of it as less cynical but just as witty and inventive Roald Dahl  You will love it  Well  unless you are a dreary  soulless grump  in which case you probably won t like it  Okay  I m kidding    Obviously  no one book or book series is for everyone  but HP certainly does have appeal for many types of readers  hence the massive popularity  Sure  the marketing juggernaut helped it along in becoming ridiculously ginormus and certainly  immense popularity is it s own self fulfilling prophesy  the more exposure something gets the more people read it largely because of it s ubiquity  causing even more people to read it    But even so  the pure appeal of the books to a wide variety of readers shouldn t be underestimated  Like  for me  fantasy is not my favorite thing  and I don t read many new children s novels  so I was a bit resistant to picking it up initially  But I AM a sucker for  all things British  coming of age stories  boarding school tales  novels with complicated and imperfect but likeable characters  childrens classics  and fabulous writing  I also love intricate tales that can really suck you into a world  and this series does this as well as anything I ve ever read  There is also something to be said  I think  for reading something that so many other millions of people have read  It makes  from the gloriously solitary act of reading  something shared and communal  Our pop culture experiences are so fragmented now  there are so few things that a broad swath of different types of people truly share together  We watch tv not just on prime time all at the same time  but on cable or satellite or time shifted or on the internet or on our I pod   we get news not just from broadcast news or newspapers but from cable news or the msm internet sites or blogs from our own political spectrum  It is a lovely thing to  occasionally  share a common cultural experience with a whole lot of people with whom you might not usually have a lot in common  Not that I m going to be grabbing the latest Nicholas Sparks just because a whole hell of a lot of other people are reading it   my love of the communal experience doesn t go that far This first book is probably my least favorite in the series  all that world building to do  but it s still incredibly charming and enjoyable   Hey guys  there s this great new book series out that you probably haven t heard of yet  It s called Harry Potter  and he s this young wizard who goes on crazy adventures with dragons and giants and three headed dogs  Ah  I shouldn ta told yeh that So yeah  I never read the series before  I ve seen all but the last of the movies  but really  I never could get into them  I think part of the problem was that I couldn t remember half of the characters names  and honestly the special effects in the first few movies were pretty awful Against my better judgment I thought I d give the books I try  and I m glad I did  There s a very special feeling from reading the story that the movie just couldn t give me  I can t really put my finger on what the big difference is  but the book really does feel more magical than the movie  I think part of it might be that movies have to be visually appealing  so they tend to be heavy on the gags and humor and overplaying the characteristics of all the professors and students  In the book  you re not overloaded with the characters idiosyncrasies like you are in the movies and instead you re free to let your imagination fill in the gaps  Admittedly this is a bit harder to do when you ve seen the movie before reading the book  but I think I was still able to get away from the movie versions of Harry  Hermione and Ron Reading this first book gave me the same feeling I got when I read the first Chronicles of Narnia book  which contrary to popular belief is actually The Magician s Nephew  chronologically anyway   I got the sense of childlike excitement without feeling like the story was being  dumbed down  for children  Rowling actually throws in some pretty deep messages that kids probably don t appreciate  such as  The truth   it is a beautiful and terrible thing  and should therefore be treated with great caution  I m sure I ll be finishing the entire series now  I m very glad I never saw the final movie  so there s still some mystery left to me   Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts  Before we begin our banquet  I would like to say a few words  And here they are  Nitwit  Blubber  Oddment  Tweak  Thank you  My goal was to re read all six HP books before the seventh is released  but with so many books on my to read list  I don t know if this will be possible  With Philosopher s Stone being released ten years ago  I m glad I at least got this one refresher in I am going to assume that you ve either  already read this book  have seen the movie  or aren t interested in HP at all  so I won t bore you with a plot summary  I will  however  tell you why it was so enjoyable and worthwhile to read again  A lot has happened since we first met Harry  seven  Hogwarts years ago  Each year  or book  since then has gotten progressively darker  more intricate  and mature  The most recent book  Half Blood Prince  left us saddened  anxious  a little hungry for revenge  and definitely curious of the final outcome  Book 1 is so light hearted and fun in direct contrast to Book 6  that it is almost a completely different experience  By the end of Philosopher s Stone  we know there is evil at work in the world and there s more to Harry s past than we know about  we don t yet know how deep into that tunnel we are about to go  It was quite amusing to revisit the characters we now know so well  Hagrid  Dumbledore  the Weasleys  Ron and Hermione   but who were new to us in Book 1  Everyone seemed that much more carefree  seven  years ago  Dumbledore especially really shows his wacky  humorous  there s a fine line between genius and crazy side  Which  considering the events of Book 6  was extra nice to remember It may not be my favorite book in the series  I actually prefer the darker stuff  and especially love Sirius Black   but it s fun to look back on the book that started something of a literary revolution  The Harry Potter series by J K Rowling will always be my favourite books  When you start getting invested in the story  you will not be able to stop  or even take a breath before diving back in  The world is absolutely magical and breathtaking The characters are unforgettable and will build a permanent home in your heart  This book is a modern classic that will continously be passed down for generations to come  I make sure to reread this series every year  and it just keeps getting better and better each time  I m surprised I didn t review this way back when  but it had been years since the first reading  I wanted to wait a while for the movies to settle down before re reading the series  Revisiting it now  and having read many debut novels since the first time around  I m blown away at how fantastic of a first novel this is  It s cohesive  it flows  it is clear headed  That s so refreshing I can t even say  The characters are distinctive immediately  the world is seamless and fantastically creative  Who wouldn t want to go to Diagon Alley  or visit Gringotts  Nevermind take the boats to the grotto under Hogwarts  I envy Rowling s imagination and writing abilities  Harry Potter is still awesome even after all these years and  fresh eyes   I enjoyed the movies  but nothing will ever measure up to the wonder of the books  I didn t doubt they d survive a reread with flying colors  but I m still happy to find that I appreciate the books more over time  rather than less  I read this book to improve my Russian reading skills  having already read it several times in English  I imported it  chapter by chapter  into www lingq com  and studied all the new words and phrases The story is a splendid fantasy romp mixing humour and action with social comment and some darker themes  An adult can read it without feeling patronised by the plot  although the main characters are children Considering the book is intended for 10 year olds  it is surprising how complex the language is  It is at least a B2  requiring A level Russian  Watch out for all the made up words throughout the series I ve also listened to the audiobook  I forget the publisher  and it is clear  good sound quality  with excellent narration  I have listened to it several times  each time enjoying it and understanding more of the story If you aren t already very familiar with the story  both text version and audio version should be treated as C1  with some 15   20 thousand unique words  Harry Potter wanted to enjoy his time at Hogwarts but Lord Voldemort is after him so Harry must battle him In this story what J K Rowling suggests about the nature of friendship is many things can be acomplished with friends that could not be without them  The first evidence from the story is when Harry tried to cross the barrier from King s Cross to the platform 9 and 3 4  Harry had no idea how to get past but the Weasley family helped him get through and onto the train  Also  Harry and Ron often said they would not be able to get all their homework done without the help of Hermione  Lastly  when Harry has to pass the final challenges to get the stone both Ron and Hermione help get Harry past the obstacles and into the final room  I would reccomend the book becasue it is a long series and if they like the first one the y would have 6 other book after to read  Also  the books are very fun to read because they create a whole new world and are very fast paces  A great read  I decided to read this book because i have heard great things about the whole Harry Potter series  and wanted to start from scratch as i have never read any of the Harry Potter books  My friends are Potterheads and i wanted to see what the fuss was about This book completes the category  A science fiction or fantasy book   This is my favourite genre it creates a fantasy for me to live in  This category interested me because i love living in a world that is different to the one we live in  This belief is always a place you got to to feel safe My favourite quote from this book  It does not do to dwell on dreams  Harry  and forget to live   this sort of goes against what i said before but it s good to go to that fantasy some times  not all the time An interesting character in this book is Neville Longbottom  He is interesting because he is quiet and comes across cowardly but is chosen to be in the Gryffindor house  Which means he soon will be expected to do something great  I have to admit  it s pretty weird to read this and know that the series is now over  It was like revisiting part of my past  and knowing I could never return to that time again   And yes  I know exactly how weird that sounds   I ve never felt that way about a book before   Because of that  I can t say whether it was as good as I remembered or not  because it had this atmosphere of nostalgia hanging all over it   making it almost impossible to review properly There were some things I had forgotten   e g  how obnoxious Ron and Harry found Hermione in the beginning   and I can t help but think that Dumbledore s way of handling the last minute point giving was a bit cruel to the Slytherins  Why make them think that they had won  and then take that away from them at the very last moment  Harry had been in the hospital for 3 days  the points could have been given earlier But as always  the magic drew me in completely  and I pretty much read this in one sitting yesterday evening  YEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSS HARRY POTTER  This series got me into reading  I kept getting told to read the series I always refused  But one day I decided to start it  Then when I picked this up I was amazed  So yeah now I m a bookworm because of Dragon Rider and Harry Potter  This is an awesome 1st book  It s filled with humor great BA characters magic  of course it s a wizard book  and fantastic fantasy creatures and beasts  This staggering first book is awesome and I give it 5 stars  This book is magical  I wasn t very interested in reading the Harry Potter series  so I just thought of giving it a try and if I wouldn t like it I would just keep it in my bookshelf and not read it  But the when I read it  it took me to another world all together  I even made friends with Harry  It is a very good but book for children and adults  A plus point for children who don t really enjoy reading fat books are that there s a movie made of the Harry Potter series and as soon as they finish the book they can watch the movie  I love this series more than most other things in life  so I ll use this space to simply list moments from the books that I had forgotten about and leave it at that  Year One   Mr  and Mrs  Dursley  of number four  Privet Drive  were proud to say that they were perfectly normal  thank you very much    The scar on Dumbledore s knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground  Dudley s stick from Smeltings       used for hitting each other while the teachers weren t looking  This was supposed to be good training for later life    Harry s gift of a coat hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon s old socks for a past birthday   Mimblewimble    Professor Dumbledore enjoys chamber music and tenpin bowling   McGonagall turning her desk into a pig during Harry s first Transfiguration lesson  Ron advising Harry to throw away his wand and punch Malfoy in the nose during their wizard s duel  I must declare first that I have watched every movie in this series more times than I can remember before reading even a single page of the books Contrary to belief  having watched the movies made my experience of reading the first book even more enjoyable  maybe not in the same traditional way as someone reading about  Harry Potter  for the first time but nonetheless I had a visual image of every character and place in the book beforehand  reading through the book brought on some nostalgia of childhood  I grew up with Harry Potter and by reading the books I can in some way relive it As for the book itself  J K Rowling s way of writing just flows through so smoothly making it an easy read for anyone One of my favorite lines from the book which was changed for the movie was when view spoiler   Harry released the Boa constrictor from the zoo and the snake turns to Harry says  Brazil  here I come   thanksss amigo    hide spoiler   which was hilarious  D  LOVED IT     Rereading the first Harry Potter book was a joyful experience  I was dreading my decision to reread the whole septology  rather than just the fourth book to complete my quest to read and review the Hugo winners  When I opened Sorcerer s Stone  I was actually all warm and fuzzy inside  not unlike how it felt to reread The Lord of the Rings  I ve only read the series once  and seen all the movies once and one twice  But it took me to a happy place and the whole book was simply an awesome experience Come visit my blog for my full review   http   itstartedwiththehugos blogspot    Esta es la primera relectura que hago del libro desde que lo lei con 10 anos Tenia mucho miedo de que no me gustase tanto o que no lo sintiese igual que cuando lo lei en mi tierna infancia pero empece a leerlo y volvi a ser esa nina enterrada bajo las sabanas leyendo con la luz de una linternita y apagandola cuando se acercaba alguien  Volvi a sentir que volaba sobre la Nimbus 2 000  conseguia la snitch dorada y que peleaba contra Quien no debe ser nombrado Todo lo que senti cuando era una nina  volvi a sentirlo  eso solo puede hacerlo un buen libro  hacer que el tiempo no haya pasado y que sigas imaginando con toda tu imaginacion  I ve watched the Harry Potter movies before reading the books  Comparing both   i e the first book and the movie   they are similar and yet different at the same time  I m sure it s not a surprise to all  I like the book more than the movie  BOOKS always rule I truly regret not having Harry Potter as part of my childhood  well  honestly speaking  I didn t even know the series existed  but  even after finding out  I don t know why I haven e read it  because it is AMAZINGLY awesome  Reading the first book made me feel like a child living in a world of fantasies and I love that  Everything about it was magical and fluffy  I don t know why I chose that word  but it totally fits what I felt when I read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone  All I wanted to do was snuggle up in bed with the book to read and a hot cocoa prepared by my bedside table   I m just soo happy that I yet have six more books of that magical world and I have to cherish every moment of it  I reread this June 2007 in one afternoon  Most of it went very fast because I have seen the movie many times and it follows the book closely  including much of the dialog  However  I was feeling a little disappointed  thinking this isn t really that amazing  why is that I loved this book so much  It wasn t until I got to about the last four chapters that I really started to see why I love this books so much  It was the places where Harry was deciding to go get the stone and the conflict over the lost of his parents that made this more than a simple children s story  I also enjoyed rereading and seeing all the hints about plots and characters which come up in the later books  First reading June 2001Second reading December  Third reading June 2007  prep for last book Fourth reading Dec 2009   Jan 2010 aloud to NatalieFifth reading January 2011 for on line book clubSixth reading aloud to N  age 6  started Nov 2015   switched to illustrated edition This was absolutely delightful  Not since Roald Dahl have I come across such a broad  vivid world created for the young and the young at heart  Granted  it s much more reigned in than Dahl  but even so  Rowling delights in the magic of her world and magic of wordplay in equal measure  The writing is obviously for young readers  but  like Dahl  Rowling does not dumb down the prose  She keeps it simple while respecting her readers  intelligence  I m signed on for a full education at Hogwarts  Here we go   I thought that this book was an excellent novel with twists and turns at every chapter  I also have to compliment J K Rowling for an excellent book  One of my favorite thing about the book is how is completely bewildered Harry is when he finds out he is a wizard  When Hagrid comes to the shed on the island Harry is in denial because he has been brought up as a piece of dirt on the ground  Harry says   I m a what  Harry gasped  51   This quote shows how he has no idea about the wizard in world and can barely comprehend that there is something even remotely special about him  I don t think I need to review Harry Potter but here it is  the first book I ever read  When my parents said we have things to do  my uncle went to the horse races and Grandma couldn t pronounce the words right  it s said hermione grandma  its quidditch grandma  its hogwarts grandma   I decided to read it myself and spent the day sitting on the non magical staircase stumbling over the words  and I became in love with books  that day when I was like six years old    no access to book Harry Potter is my all time favorite book series  Many times I ve met people who aren t into the whole fantasy thing  but they have LOVED the Harry Potter series  This book will not ever leave you bored  It s starts out in London  England  showing a family on Pivet Drive  A young boy  Harry  lives with his very cruel aunt  uncle and cousin  Throughout the series  it shows you Harry s adventures he has with his friends after he finds out he is a wizard and is accepted to Hogwarts School of WitchCraft and Wizardry  I would recommend this to anyone above the age 10  since this book may get confusing   I only got the chance to start reading this whole  amazing series when I had just turned nine eight  I watched the films when I was really really young  and I still remember every last bit of it  I saw the third film first  then decied to buy it  along with films one and two  on DVD  That was the beginning for me These books are my favourite books of all time  and I was devestated when I had read the last book and seen the last film  I rate this book 100 000 000 000 stars     Please take a moment to read this  Everybody should read this book  I understand some people hate Harry Potter  But have they read the book  Or is it just the films  Well  ask yourself that  Remember that books describe details movies never can  so if you hate the movies  know that the books are different  better  even  But if you re already a fan  then let s continue to love this exciting  amazing  terrific  fantastic  loveable  well described  series  So    I m really late to the Harry Potter show    I ve always wanted to read them and just never got around to it  So I picked up the first book for our cruise  and of course  I loved it    Everyone already knows these books are amazing  so here are just a few of my thoughts    I was surprised how many of the scenes in the book were portrayed in the movie  and that the movie almost followed the book in exact order  There were a few minor differences and changes  but really I think I only noticed one or two scenes that were omitted from the movie   I know this changes drastically in the upcoming books though  As I was reading  I couldn t help but hear the actors  voices in my head as I read their lines in the book  But can t complain about hearing Alan Rickman s voice in my head    I love Rowling s writing style  Love  She is a great storyteller I definitely teared up a bit at the end  Not gonna lie  I can t wait to read the next one   I don t actually remember when I first read this book  but I ve read it many times since then  This book introduces the Harry Potter world to its readers  and does so in a deceptively light way  You might at first think you re reading children s litereature   which you are   but what I think has made these stories such as success  and what has appealled most to me about them is the hidden intellect  Character names hearken to Greek mythology  giving you deeper insight to their personalities  just for an example  Even better  you enter Harry Potter s life on his 11th birthday  and you grow right along with him  His first adventure holds the exuberance of a young boy  thrust into a world one could only dream of  As we get deeper into the series though  the reader and Harry open their eyes to the reality that things aren t always what they seem  that being brave doesn t mean not being afraid  and that there are things in this world worth sacrificing for    But from that moment on  Hermione Granger became their friend  There are some things you can t share without ending up liking each other  and knocking out a twelve foot mountain troll is one of them  I seriously don t know why I hadn t read this series before  I have seen the movies but I literally do not have a particular reason as to why I didn t read this book by the magnificent J  K  Rowling  Oh my god  even though I knew the plot and all I still enjoyed it and probably would have liked it more if I didn t know the ending and all but I still loved it  I just don t what to say and I just saw the movie again and I started crying because this series means a to to me and I m so grateful to my friend for gifting me this and just a beautifully written book and Ron is a so adorable   3 3 3 3 3 In Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone written by J K  Rowling  it is about this boy who doesn t now he s a wizard  He lives with the dreadful Dursleys until one day he gets accepted to Hogwarts which is a witchcraft and wizardry school  He does not know anything about wizardry and finds out that the person that killed his parents was a wizard and wandering around in the school  When Harry is accepted  he took a great risk of going to a school that a wizard   Professor Dumbledore   is asking him to come and be happy  Overall this book was a very good book and I would certainly read it over and over again  Must I say  this series is going to be one of my all time favorites   I had been putting off reading the series for a couple years because I wasn t into wizardry  But  after watching most of the movies and breezing through the hunger games and Percy Jackson  I ran out of popular books to read  When asking people  numerous recommended the Harry Potter series  I m so glad I am starting this series  It s is truly intricate and AMAZING Harry Potter is a normal first year in the Hogwarts school of witchcraft  He encounters many good and bad people  including his two best friends  Ron Hermione  and don t forget Neville    plus his nemesis  Malfoy  Of course  this first book is a lot about finding who he is  as Harry learns he is known as the Boy who lived  He also finds out a lot about Voldemort  and what he is trying to do to take control once again Read this amazing book  and it will surely encourage you to read the entire series     Five stars  I remember sitting in 7th grade Reading class and seeing this book in the hands of one of my classmates  The cover looked cool and my friend told me he couldn t put it down  so I figured what the hay  lets give it a shot  Since then  I have read this book upwards of 10 times and each time I fall more in love with Harry and the  wizarding  world in which he lives  J K  Rowling does a great job of creating feelings of sympathy for Harry in her readers through the relationship struggles he experiences at home with his aunt  uncle and cousin Dudley  Then you learn about Harry s parents being murdered and falling in love with him is almost inevitable  Once an author can create a relationship like this between the reader and one of their characters  success is almost guaranteed  This book has shown me the power of creating a true connection between character and reader  which is something I will attempt to do in any story that I write in the future  Firstly  the illustrations to go with this books are second to none  Absoloutly beautiful  and a wonderful  satisfying texture for the front cover  Secondly  I thought people were exaggerating when they said that much had been missed out in the films from the books  I was wrong  So many unanswered questions were answered in the first part of the series alone  I m shocked I havn t read them yet  and they will all be added to my  To read  pile   Excellent  highly imaginative story  It s the touches of whimsy that really make it for me    all the little details  Reading it again  I m remembering how much I liked Dumbledore in this first book  compared to how much I hated the secretive old sod later on   Granted  most of the action is confined to the end of the book  with 9 10ths of the thing being an exercise in extended world building  but it s all done so charmingly I just don t care  Antes de mais  foi a 1a vez que li o livro mas ja tinha visto algumas vezes o filme quando era mais novo Fiquei estupefacto com a semelhanca do livro e do filme  Este foi  do que me lembro  muito fiel ao livro  Esta tarde irei reve lo Apesar de ja conhecer a historia  o meu ritmo de leitura nao abrandou por um minuto que fosse  nas poucas horas livres que tive  e  como foi isso possivel se eu sabia tudo o que ia acontecer   So pode haver uma explicacao e essa reside no facto do mundo de Hogwarts ser realmente magico  Ele envolve nos de uma forma brutal  Ha sempre coisas novas a acontecer  novos misterios  constantes desenvolvimentos nas personagens    Estou ansioso para comprar os proximos volumes e poder continuar a levitar neste mundo magnifico Adorei e e uma leitura recomendadissima e sendo esta muito leve e rapida de ser feita  e perfeita para ressacas literarias e como  corta sabores  entre leituras mais exigentes     I m so glad I finally picked this up  I can definitely see why everyone loves this book  I am looking forward to starting the next The start of the book was a bit slow for me  This was probably because I already knew all about the world and life at Hogwarts  due to the movies  and just wanted to get into the action of the story  But once it started  I was hooked  The book seemed to whizz by  because I was reading so many chapters at a time My advice to those people who haven t read the books but have seen the movies is to read the books  It is such an enjoyable experience  getting to see this world from a different perspective  Basically everybody loves Harry Potter  so if you haven t read the books  I recommend it  I am definitely going to continue on with this series  I hope to complete it during this summer  I can t wait to see Harry  Ron  Hermione and the rest of the students grow up and become amazing wizards and witches  Fast paced  after the first couple of chapters   no nonsense prose  good storytelling  a little funny and even a little scary  I was wondering how exactly these books had become such a huge success  and the answer is pretty obvious  The author loves this story and these characters  and it shows  Some people coming to the series late  as I have done  seem disappointed that this isn t the best book they ve ever read  Why should it have to be  It s not going to replace Ursula K  Le Guin s or Patrick Rothfuss  as my favorite wizard school tale  but it is actually quite good  and a lot of fun  That s pretty remarkable  I think  I d never really planned on reading the Harry Potter series  but when me and my friend are at the school library we both promise we pick one book for each other  And she picked this book  Once I started reading it  I couldn t stop  It is an amazing book  This book is one of those books that start with a very interesting beginning  and ending with a very nice ending  I am looking forward to starting the next book  I ve never heard one single person that I know that has read this series say it s horrible  It is an absolutely terrific book that is suitable for anyone  from children to adults  Joanne has an fabulous talent for writing books  and hopefully she will write more for me to enjoy  For ANYONE who is out there  I would HAPPILY RECOMMEND it to you  It is one of my favourite books  and I haven t even finished the series  I love harry potter Thankyou J K Rowling  for writing this amazing book for all of us book lovers to read   This book and The BFG were my favourite 2 books as a child  This is the first in the Harry Potter adventures and is totally gripping  Harry is an orphan staying with his aunt and uncle  They  and their son Dudley  treat him horribly  The amazing tale of magic and excitement begins when Hagrid bursts through the door to reveal that Harry is a wizard and that he has been accepted to Hogwarts  A great adventure begins with new friends  enemies  magical creatures and quidditch  This is an amazing book about adventure  friendship and fun  I loved it because it flared my imagination  This is a gripping book for children in later ks2  It exciting and imaginative with very detailed descriptions but is very easy to read  Great for expanding vocabulary  creative writing skills  and generating an interest in reading  there is a whole series   It also teaches values such as friendship  love  differences between good and bad etc  Of course I ve known about the Harry Potter books and films for years  you d have to be on another planet to not have  What can I say  I was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked this book  I love the story  it s fantastically well written  and has a multitude of great characters  I watched the film after  which was pretty much spot on I can now understand all the hype  I m looking forward to reading the next book in the series  This is the only book in the harry potter series that I have read and I absolutely loved it  As a kid  i was completely drawn into all of the movies  I had every single one of them  This book made me curious to see what the other books have in store so I m considering reading them now  The amount of details in this book was just absolutely amazing and the elaboration was so specific  at some parts I felt like I was in hogwarts  I loved this book so much and it left me wanting more  I never saw the fascination in Harry Potter  and was convinced that it d be a dull read  God bless A Level English  where I was first exposed to the wizarding world  I adored every second of this book and all the rest  An excellent read that captivates ones imagination with its wild ideas  Harry appears to be an ordinary boy  living with the family from hell  His life is transformed on his 11th birthday when he realises he holds special powers  His quest within his new school  Hogwarts  sees him being faced with a 3 headed dog  giant chess pieces  evil professors and much more  Many a morals are revealed through this book  from friendship to honesty  Certainly a book that I would enjoy reading with my year 1 class  I feel it could aide children in using their imagination and coining new words  Truly an awesome book for absolutely any age group  The movies don t do the books any justice so I urge sceptics to READ   This book is gorgeous  I m reading it out loud to my Harry Potter loving 6 year old and this is perfect for him  None of the British words have been changed for American spelling or to the American versions of the words and so it s that much more awesome  My older children love to crowd around and see the art each time I turn a page and there are always lots of audible gasps all around  I can t rave enough about the illustrated version of Harry Potter   When the saga of Harry Potter reached the readers it also reached the culmination of what to become a huge success in sale and marketing  I was fed up before the hysteria ever reached its peak  soap  candy  goodies  toys as everything was supposed to have a Harry Potter sticker on it  A great franchise A friend handed me this book after the Swedish edition had been released  as a gesture to give it a chance  For some outraged reason I started to read it and not long after  I had become everything I loathed  A Harry Potter fan  It changed my reading habits  Today I am open to every sort of reading  For that obvious reason also a five star rating to J K  Rowling s Harry Potter  I have decided not to rate the series  I cannot be bothered to be recommended with Harry literature by Goodreads  The series have been read and I am more than please with that  The series follow 3 5 5 star ratings   Read in Swedish    I still remember the first time I read Harry Potter  It was a few months before Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire came out in print  and my parents had gotten my sister the first three books in the series for Christmas to try to encourage her to read  She was not the big reader  I was  So the books went for a while untouched  which made me sad  because they were such beautiful hadcover editions  so I decided to give them a try  I remember being so riveted by this first book that I stayed up all night finishing it  I completed the second and third book two days later  And thus  a fan was born    I think Harry Potter is so popular and wonderful not only because it is a beautifully well written story  but because it speaks to us as people about the importance of choosing your own path and destiny  no matter what your birth may dictate  I ve read this series countless times and plan on reading it many more   How wonderful  I know this is not everyone s cup of tea  but well done J K  Rowling  I watched the films first and am now reading the books to my son  There are definite chunks of the story that have been left out in the film and is a very interesting read if you liked the film  The plot is the same  the story flows in the same way  the main characters are the same  The excitement and detail in the writing is definitely great  Each chapter is detailed and as you read you can see what is happening  your imagination and mind sees the actions taking place  The author has definitely made it easy to see the story without the need of a film A lovely beginning to the rest of the books and definitely would recommend reading the story if you have enjoyed watching the films or vice versa  I would read this book to upper KS2 during story time  It has a good use of language and would help with children s story writing ideas  As a child I would never read  I hated books  My mum then showed me Harry Potter 1 when I was 6 and we read it together  I read the words  the   it   and  and slowly began to memorise the familiar words  Harry   Ron   Hermione   Muggle  and so on  From then on I read whatever i could  Harry Potter and J K Rowling changed my live This book started of the widely popular series and has it all  Suspense  Drama  Comedy and a little bit of romance  C mon ron and hermione so had chemistry back then       Dumbledores wise words touch all our hearts and Harry is just so cute when he really has no idea what he s doing  Hermione is the girl most of us can relate to and is a role model for us all  Growing up i always wanted to be her   For those who haven t read this series yet you are missing out  Pick uo this book immediatly and prepare to be hooked 5 out of 5 as if it could be rated anything else  Harry Potter has always been a famous series but until recently I haven t had the will to read it  I don t regret this only because that means I would already have read it and thus the enchanting writing would not be as strong  Although starting off slow  this book is a fascinating and lovely read  Any of the mysteries in it are only obvious had you seen the movie beforehand  The writing is fantastic and descriptive  the characters having depth and life  and being just undescribed enough for the reader to make up their own picture  This book is perfect for all ages  Todo empezo cuando tenia 7 anos  mis padres me llevaron a ver una pelicula que no sabia que cambiara mi manera de ver las cosas  Asi fue como conoci a Harry Potter  lo admito vi primero la pelicula  era un nino creo que ni sabia leer bien  no tengo palabras para describir lo que sentia para ese entonces  quede sencillamente impresionado con el mundo de magia  En fin  Soy fan de Harry Potter  es una de mis sagas favoritas pero nunca habia leido los libros  si lo se  como es esto posible      Hasta ahora  despues de tantos anos decidi leer esta magnifica saga  lo que encontre fue  recuerdos  me transporto a ese epoca de mi vida cuando era cien por ciento feliz y no lo sabia  nostalgia  aventuras  un lugar imposible de olvidar y muchas otras cosas mas  Harry Potter siempre sera mi saga favorita y  lo recomendare hasta mas no poder  creo que es un libro que todo adolescente debe leer  Primera Resena     Well  obviously  I loved it  I never won t love HP  I think  Through the Trap Door  is some of my favorite writing in the whole series  Listening to it was a fun experience  that I don t think I ve ever done before  Jim Dale is excellent  but everyone knows that  Except    sometimes he pronounces things differently than I ve always heard them in my head  For instance  he calls Firenze the centaur  Firenzey  which drove me bananas   And caused a lot of giggling while I was driving     Anyways  Harry Potter absolute favorite  Love Rating  5 stars out of 5  NOTA  Solo he visto la pelicula 3 de todas las series  asi que mi contexto siempre fue sumamente pobre No crei que el libro sobre la historia de un nino de 10 anos y su estancia en una escuela para brujos me llamaria tanto la atencion  pero asi fue  Curiosamente me devore el libro y me clave rapidamente en sus aventuras La ciencia ficcion  las aventuras y la forma de atacar un mundo paralelo es sumamente agradable y me deja con suficiente interes para continuar con la saga  J ai mis du temps a finir cette lecture car d autres choses me prennaient la tete mais j y ai mis bon ordre  Voila  HP c est toujours aussi genial et magique  C est super bien ecrit  on est dedans tout de suite  le personnage de Harry et l amitie qu il noue avec Ron et Hermione sont des elements toujours aussi emouvants  Les personnages  secondaires   pour moi ils n en sont pas mais bon  sont tout a fait delicieux  avec des mentions speciales a Dumbledore  evidemment  l un des personnages les plus profonds et fascinants que j ai eu la chance de rencontrer en litterature  mais aussi a Hagrid  le geant papa gateau au coeur tout mou  Je l ai deja mentionne  mais l histoire est prenante  immediatement  Ce qu on dit egalement trop peu a mon gout a propos de ce livre c est qu il est tres drole  un humour subtil et classe a l anglaise  Bref  a reprendre en main les yeux fermes  et le coeur grand ouvert   I wish I could give the harry potter series 10 stars  Ever since the 6th grade I fell in love with the books and the world that Jk Rowling created  I am constantly re reading and re watching the movies and they never get old  Every time i read the stories again i realize how deep each character truly is and how much detail was put into them  they are not just a pretty face but a real person  Harry will always be a part of me and I will forever love everything about the books and movies  I could never explain how much they mean to me  especially during my very hard and complicated childhood   they seemed to simply take me away from all my worries and I was transported into another world  I just recently got a tattoo on my hip that says  the stories we love best do live in us forever  Rowling said this at the final premier of the 8th film  I just thought I would share it because it is my favorite topic    Some friends told me this book was quite good  They were right  Some of them told me yesterday  but many of them told me aeons ago  18 years later  it s finally done From now until the end of days  you may call me Neville  If the wind is blowing right  you can try a quick McGonagall So  this review is for everyone who wishes they could read Potter as if it were new again  I did  And it was everything you could have wished for  And more   Have you ever wanted to flash a wand around and make magical sorts of things happen  Harry Potter will keep you on the edge of your seat with your eyes glued to the page  The book starts off describing the main character Harry Potter being a normal boy in a normal family  Although Harry has known he makes  magical  things happen at random when he s upset  he never would have thought he d get a letter to Hogwarts  Hogwarts is the school of witchcraft and wizardry  After arriving to the school Harry realizes there is a whole world of magic out there  He meets many friends and becomes one of the most popular wizard all because of him surviving a deadly blast from the most feared wizard known  I like the Harry Potter series because it is packed full of action  mystery  and adventure  I would recommend to anyone who likes fictional books and wants a long  interesting  and funny story  I found the first reading of this novel to be enjoyable   As much as I liked it and its sequel  The Chamber of Secrets  I initially didn t become  hooked  on the series until I read the third novel  The Prisoner of Azkaban  which remains one of my favorites   Reading it again after completing the series is an altogether different experience  as you recognize all of the subtle  quiet ways in which J K  Rowling was building the foundation for future plot developments and  more importantly  planting the seeds of truly profound themes and lessons that would come to full bloom in later novels  I ve lost track of how many times I ve read this book    the fact I teach it and write about it proves that I find it important as well as fun    and it s wonderful to discover that there are still new things to see in it  and new ways it can speak to me  It was a delight to reread this again   I don t know the reason why I have waited so long to read this series but I don t think it is too late  I thought it would be too juvenile for my taste but I was wrong of course  I loved every minute of this book with its funny  brave and exhilarating characters that you can t help but love  This book has everything that no one would have imagined  from talking chess to singing hats there is nothing too outrageous for a Harry Potter book  And then there s the lead characters  Harry  the most famous wizard in Hogwarths  Hermione  the young scholar who starts out prim and proper but later becomes a true caring friend  and Ron  the boy who has little money but an abundance of family and loyalty to his friends to make up for it  This exciting and thrilling story had me from the very beginning and I couldn t wait to start the next book when finished  I would recommend this book for ages 9   I ve seen almost all of the Harry Potter movies and decided that it was time to give the books a try  So many times before I tried to read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone and it wasn t until a couple days ago that I completed this  Being one of the many people that enjoyed the movies  I can honestly say I was afraid that the books weren t going to live up to the movies  How wrong I was  The books go deep into detail with some things that the movie skips over  But I must say  the actors and actresses in the movies fit the characters in this book so beautifully  However old you are  you must give this book a try  I hope to read the rest of the series in the next month as this book took me two days to finish  Read it  UPDATE  So I just reread this book and J K  Rowling is absolute genius  This world is so vivid  this book so great  and zero problems in the book  Oh my gosh  I love it   Que puedo decir de este libro que ya no se haya dicho antes  Pues nada  pero dare mi opinion aun asi   Es el primer libro de la aclamada saga de Harry Potter que consta de siete libros En este primer volumen J K  Rowling nos da una introduccion a lo que es el mundo de Harry Potter  nos cuenta como de un dia a otro la vida de Harry cambia gracias a la llegada de una carta del Colegio Hogwarts de Magia en donde se desarrolla la mayor parte de la historia  Antes de esto Harry conoce a Hagrid  este le hace saber secretos de su vida de los cuales ni el mismo Harry estaba enterado  Conforme avanzan los capitulos Harry descubre cosas que jamas penso que existieran Es asi como comienza esta magica historia y que mejor forma de comenzar que con este maravilloso primer libro que al final te deja con ganas de mas Harry Potter   I love Neville  Fred and George getting much more attention in the book  While I sometimes were almost about to ask myself if Harry Potter really is as amazing as I believed it to be while growing up watching the movies  the first book makes me ashamed of only the thought of it being not a 100  amazing I fell in love with the story a second time reading the book and can t await to discover the magic hidden in the next ones   I have grown up reading the Harry Potter series over and over again and Harry potter and the Philosopher s Stone is still my favourite book out of the whole series  This book is about a lonely boy who is shunned by his family and everyone else around him  Then one day he finds out that he is not an ordinary boy  but in fact a wizard  he soon leaves his lonely world and finds people that love him  but learns that his destiny is to fight against an evil wizard who killed his parents Children in today s generation are all aware about this story and it is a great hook to creating  developing and understanding adventure stories  What is more useful is that JK Rowling cleverly adds French words for spells and names of unknown creatures  This can be particularly useful if you were to ask children to write their own spells using particular words they have learnt in when teaching MFL   Enchanted chocolate frogs  invisible cloaks  potions  and three headed dogs    how can anyone in their right mind not love these books     First time reading it  after arguing with my parents over the matter for years  As a first time reader  who has been told these books can be satanic and bad examples  the whole time I was reading it  I kept thinking  how horrible it is that we judge things without giving them a real try  The world of Harry Potter is magical and immersing  not evil and corrupt  It s not some trick to brainwash your kids  but to show them that we need to believe in ourselves and do our part to fight evil    even if we are an eleven year old who has been bullied If you are debating whether to read these books  although I doubt you are  as everyone seems to have read them but myself   my advice to you  is give them a try  They are not all that they appear to be   I ve never really liked the Harry Potter books  No offense  But that was a couple of years back and before I read  The Sorcerer s Stone But a few days ago when I was trying to find a book to read in my bookshelf  I found  The Sorcerer s Stone  shoved in the back by me  You see  the first day I read it  I read the first two or just the first chapter  It was so confusing that I just put it down for about more than a year When I found it a few days ago I thought I could give it a try  So I started reading it  I understood it better and the first couple of chapters were actually really interesting    The book was really interesting and can t wait to start reading the next one     I m actually scared since I m such a Percy Jackson freak and I loved those series but now unable a feeling that ill be obsessed with Harry Potter too       I m not backstabbing Percy Jackson       Grr       There are all kinds of courage   said Dumbledore  smiling   It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies  but just as much to stand up to our friends  I therefore award ten points to Mr  Neville Longbottom  One thing I realized during this re read was that my memory of the movie was far far superior to the book  but that just made it better because quite a few of the scenes played out a bit differently than I was expecting  Overall  this book is still 5 stars for me  even though it made me quite sad that I m a muggle  P S  Ravenclaws rule  It was time to revisit the old favorites because  really  what better way to end a year than with the first meeting of a trio of old friends  And that s what Harry  Hermione  and Ron are at this point  I m bumping my rating of this first foray into the wizarding world up from four stars to five because I thought I knew this story  I thought I loved it as much as I could ever love it I was wrong Terribly and wonderfully wrong I picked up on things I d forgotten  I saw things I m 100  sure I didn t see before  and I remembered why I love this world I suppose I could say more about what happens in the story but    if you ve been a thinking  breathing  human being these last fifteen  twenty years  you know who Harry Potter is and what he s all about So    read it if you haven t read it before and read it again if you ve read it sixteen times already  My review is on a book called Harry Potter and the sorcerer s stone I really loved the story and the characters of the book I really felt like I knew the characters in the book The story of Harry Potter and his adventures with his friends was really good because Harry Potter didn t even know he was a wizard until Hagrid told him The characters of Harry Potter felt like real friends and it was sad to see them go when I finished the book I m really happy that I started to read this book because I never cared for it I heard all the good reviews of the book I just never wanted to read it till last year and I m happy I did I never wanted to put it down And those are just a few reasons this book is amazing I would recommend to read this whenever you can  This book is just fantastic  This is the series that got me to start loving to read  These books were really just my childhood and they are just fantastic  JK Rowling is the queen of writing  If you have not read these books then you should start them now  I re read the series before the last movie came out and I can say that I thoroughly enjoyed it the second time around as well   Even more enjoyable years laterRecently decided to re read this series and finding it even more enjoyable than I did the first time I read it  Like coming back to an old friend  I don t know what there is to say about Harry Potter that hasn t been said before  so if this looks good to you and you haven t read it  I say dive right in  and if it s been awhile  go on and read it again  It s so easy to get lost in this book  What can be said about Harry Potter that hasn t already been said It is a fantastic book  good for anyone  anytime  anywhere  Whenever you re feeling down in the dumps  lonely  miserable or just bored  Hogwarts is there to welcome you with open arms and show you a magical world  Rowling did an unbelievably good job of creating a world that feels sometimes more real than our real world  a world that you want to come back to time and time again  Her characters feel like family  even the ones that aren t quite likeable  we all have those in our families  too   She has done so much for kids who fell in love with reading because of Harry  but she s also given grown ups a chance to go back to a simpler  more magical time of childhood and the world of endless possibilities  I know that I will be forever grateful for Harry  and I will always want to come back to Hogwarts Always  Although the little girl I babysat for read Harry Potter  I never actually got into the books  I remember reading it with her and enjoying the writing  but not really paying attention enough to the story line   I happened to also be reading out of order   It was nice to finally sit down and read this book for the first time  I enjoyed the great level of detail put into creating the imaginary world  I felt like the characters were developed very well and that I could see why so many school aged children are attached to the series  By the end of this book  you want to see where Harry is going next  I think it s interesting because there are a lot of adventures to satisfy the child who loves adventure  but this is a story about relationships as well  Harry never lived with a family who cared much for him  and at Hogwarts he is able to find family in his friends  ages 8 12 I LOOOVE Potter  3Remember I told you I was a Harry Potter virgin  Well  it is not so anymore  I have been very gently  but adventurously  deflowered   I never thought I would enjoy a story set in a School of Witchcraft and Wizardry  but I was wrong The characters are introduced beautifully  Ms  Rowling is a wonderful storyteller  No matter what anyone else says  trust me  this is a really good book   I am almost a fan now   This book is a great piece of story telling  if not literature as claimed by many  Anyway  it was written for the young readers  and it is not very easy to write in a simple language  I like the flow of the novel  and the best part   the optimism    It started off as a four starrer  but because of the later part  I give it full 5 stars  It s one of the best books I ve read so far GargiP S  I d love to have The mirror of Erised   I had always wanted to read this book and a few years ago I tried  I was 8 and more into princesses than witches and wizards attending a magical school called Hogwarts  Though I did finish the book  reading it a second time was like i had never read it at all  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone opened up a new world for me  This new world consisted of witches  wizards  magic  Quidditch  three headed dogs and dark lords  Harry Potter didn t know he was a wizard  He also didn t know that he could speak to snakes and that he was famous  So it was a surprise when Harry got a letter from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry where he will be attending his first year of wizard school  At Hogwarts  Harry finds out a great deal about his past and that he has a great destiny that is waiting for him  This has been my favorite book I have read all year and I gave it 5 stars  This was such a different experience from the films as there were so many more details that just added more to the story  I also do have to say that I prefer the way the characters are written in the books to how they re potrayed on screen  having said that I truly believe the film adaptation is one of the best to date  I love this world soooo much and can fully understand now why people have read this series so many times over  Grade interest level  About 10 or upReading level  880Genre  Mystery and FantasyMain

no puedo quejarme de nada de este libro  ni siquiera de la adaptacion cinematografica  Creo que la pelicula de este libro es una de las mejores adaptaciones libro a pelicula que vi en mi vida  Tendria que comentar algo mas relacionado con el trio de oro o con algun personaje asi  pero como yo soy yo y yo soy genialmente asombrosa voy a hablar de Charlie Weasley  Se dan cuenta que en multiples ocasiones hablan de el y que cuando lo hacen hablan de lo genial que era  que era bueno con los animales  en el colegio y en el Quidditch y etcetera cosas  EXIJO un libro sobre la vida de Charlie  ahora Ame este libro  definitivamente voy a seguir con la saga  5 5 estrellas Pd     HAY UN TROLL EN LAS MAZMORRAS    Harry Potter has never been the star of a Quidditch team  scoring points while riding a broom far above the ground  He knows no spells  has never helped to hatch a dragon  and has never worn a cloak of invisibility All he knows is a miserable life with the Dursleys  his horrible aunt and uncle  and their abominable son  Dudley  a great big swollen spoiled bully  Harry s room is a tiny closet at the foot of the stairs  and he hasn t had a birthday party in eleven years But all that is about to change when a mysterious letter arrives by owl messenger  a letter with an invitation to an incredible place that Harry  and anyone who reads about him  will find unforgettable  For it s there that he finds not only friends  aerial sports  and magic in everything from classes to meals  but a great destiny that s been waiting for him    if Harry can survive the encounter  I picked this up when I was 10 years old after my cousin claimed it was  too boring for her   Hah  I am now almost 21 and I still enjoy Sorcerer s Stone and every other book in the series  I love it more then anything else I ve ever read  Not much more can be said about it that millions of others haven t  but honestly  it has changed my life for the better and that s the truth    I thought maybe reading a children s book when you are in your early twenties wouldn t exactly give you a thrill  but I was wrong  I really loved this book  the characters  the wisdom in it  everything  And I am really glad I haven t watched the movies  I have seen clips and trailers here and there but nothing enough to ruin the books for me  looking forward to reading the rest of the series  Dit was het eerste Harry Potter boek dat ik in het Engels las  Ik heb ze in het Nederlands een heleboel keer gelezen  van de Orde van de Feniks heb ik twee exemplaren omdat ik de eerste een beetje stuk heb gelezen  Het was een leuke ervaring om dit boek een keer in het Engels te lezen  De  magie  kwam voor mij weer tot leven  In mijn hoofd hoorde ik ook de stemmen van de acteurs  dat was een heerlijke ervaring  Dit boek kwam wel sloom op gang  het duurde ook een tijdje voor ik er echt in zat  maar toen Harry eenmaal op Zweinstein was  zat ik er ook echt in  Ik heb soms hardop gelachen  ontroeren doet dit boek niet  Sommige stukken zette mij wel aan het denken  zoals quotes van Perkamentus  Ik heb echt genoten van dit boek en ik kijk uit naar het tweede boek   It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live  remember that     Albus Perkamentus  I consider it an honor to be able to read books and delve into the worlds created in them  But never have I been more privileged to explore a more fantastic world than this from J K  Rowling s mind  Brilliantly dynamic characters  witty new words  such as  muggle  and  quidditch   which I today use on a daily basis  and magic  Magic that seems real because of the limits set and the fine line set between the non magical and the wizard world  Harry Potter has it all and this book is where it all began  With a scrawny boy wearing glasses  believing he had no one and nothing in this world that knew about him to care about him  But it didn t take long for people to discover him and start to care  Not only does this book speak about the importance of love and family  but it is the foundation of one of the biggest families out there  the Potterheads 3 Forever grateful to this book   J K Rowling for introducing my two teenage boys to the pleasure of reading  Without this book I doubt that they would ever have discovered the joy of losing yourself in a book  As an adult  I was totally absorbed in Harry Potter as well  We all need a little magic in our lives  The truth   Dumbledore sighed   It is a beautiful and terrible thing  and should therefore be treated with great caution    J K  wrote in many cafes in Edinburgh including The Elephant House  wherever she could get her baby Jessica to fall asleep   Releido Febrero 2016 Volver a leer este primer libro es como revivir una historia imborrable de la memoria  Las ilustraciones que acompanan al libro son perfectas y van al compas de lo que todo fan esperaria  no he leido los demas libros de la saga  pero tengo como proposito hacerlo este mismo ano El valor del libro es el precio justo para una historia entretenida y divertida  ademas de bien escrita  que va a juego con unas ilustraciones muy bien trazadas y elaboradas Simplemente recomendado  I don t re read books  When there are so many different stories out there  it feels like a waste of time to re read a book Turns out I have been REALLY stupid for a very long time  Re reading this was one of the best things I ve done  Truth is  I haven t really READ it  I audiobooked it  But with such a marvellous narrator as Stephen Fry  I couldn t have had a better reading experience Fact  I read Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone when it first came out  And I read it in Portuguese  So this was my first time reading it as an adult and in English The little details that were lost in the film all came back as the story progressed  all the little details that made me upset when the film came out     and I fell in love with the characters all over again  even though it has been 17 years since I read it 17 YEARS   How did this happen   Story of me reading this for the first time I was six  I hadn t heard of Harry Potter  and it wasn t so famous My mother said I had to read it  Being an extremely stubborn child  I immediately decided it would be awful  However  my mum had other ideas  She sat me on a couch and said she d read the first chapter  and then she d leave me alone  I  blocked my ears  and made a fuss  but listened  It was amazing  I loved it  Of course  I said it was horrible  why did you make me listen  I won t read it  etc    but then I snuck back and read it  So if you are one of those rare  endangered species who ve decided not to read these literary phenomenon  or have only seen the movie  or something like that  swallow your pride  Read this book  It is actually that good  Funny  clever  and nearly perfectly written  you just have to read it  Enjoy  A classic  What s there to say  Young Harry Potter goes from a family who is like this  To this   And how can that be a bad thing The writing itself is solid  if simple  Simple is not bad  Some people criticize Rowling s writing because it is apparently too simple  It s meant to be read by children  And it reads well  There aren t any awkward parts in the story If you re late to the party  read it  I just read one of the most amazing books in the history of fantasy books  Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone by J K  Rowling  This  amazing  book begins with the main character  Harry Potter living in the Dursley s home  Harry lives in the Dursley s home because his parents supposedly died in a car crash  The Dursleys are an average family  who like living a perfectly normal life  But Harry to the Dursley s is torture  and Harry is basically a slave  Later in the book he finds out     Drum Roll Please      He is a WIZARD with actual magic  and he has been accepted at Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry  Will Harry Survive school  Will Harry pass the tests  Read Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone to find out  I LOVED this book  I suggest it to young adult readers and up  I can assure you its amazing and adults find it cool too   This was the first  chapter book   I read with my son and it was a blast  It took an eternity to finish it between him falling asleep and him refusing to read it for fear of falling asleep  Having him recount events is adorable  I didn t realize  chapter book  was a term people used until I mentioned to people that I was reading this to him  I ve read this multiple times before  but not since I was in grade school  Being able to reread it while knowing what the final outcome of the story is is really fun  I ve been enjoying remembering all the little details I d forgotten since the last time  and to notice more sort of foreshadowing events  as well as subtle changes made between the books and the movies  I  3 HP  I ve read this book at least five times now but this was my first time reading it aloud  I didn t want to waste any time before introducing my newborn son to the world of Harry Potter   Just as wonderful a story as ever  setting the stage for a brilliant series  I will say that reading it aloud opened a whole new world for me  It let me experience the richness of Rowling s writing in a whole new way  the cadences of dialogue  the beautiful sentences  and the wonderful words  As a testament to the story  I still got choked up when Harry first sees his parents in the Mirror of Erised  when Hagrid gives Harry the photo album  and most of all when Neville gets awarded 10 points for bravery and wins the House Cup for Gryffindor  A simply magical story that I will share with Emmett again and again  Now on to The Chamber of Secrets  I have read this as part of my great re read project  I was slightly trepidatious that revisiting this book would diminish it somehow  yet I needn t have worried Harry Potter and the Philosopher is still a fabulous little book  Of course there are no surprises in it any more  instead I am finding myself treasuring the gems that have been planted and polished by J K Rowling  I get gleeful that Sirius Black is mentioned when he doesn t appear  Deadalus Diggle and his green sparks  Ginny Weasley being shy  All of these things that you don t notice on the first reading that makes subsequent reads more fulfilling  The language is stilted in places and dialogue feels stilted but still it has a right and proper place in my heart and I m glad I have revisited it  I shall be re reading the rest of the series in due course  This book was amazing  I cant wait to read the next one  I would rate the 5 stars because of all of the details that the author used in this book also I could not put it down  I like how she used a person that harry potter trusted for he who must not be named  This is a great book  You think that you know what is going to happen next but then something pops out at you  This book caught my attention the second that I started to read it  I would Recommend this book to people that like fantasy  magic  trolls  or just anything with magic or magic creatures in it   Revisiting this story as an adult was a strange and fun experience  Of course I can t feel the wonder I felt when I was 10  but it did bring back the memory of the wonder  I think that the first book in the Harry Potter series is a little different than I remember the rest of the series being  like JK Rowling is still finding her voice  I noticed some  errors  in perspective  where a line in a scene would suddenly be in Ron or Hermione s head and then jump back to Harry  The world and story are still magical  though  The art work in this illustrated edition is absolutely gorgeous  I can t wait to see what the artist does for the other books  I imagine books 4 7 will have to be split into multiple volumes    I still love the Harry Potter series and rereading the first book made me want to check out all the other books again  The HP Series will always be one of my top favorites  It is friendship filled with a great amount of action and the story line and problems go so deep you ll find yourself at Hogwarts and wishing you could read it again for the first time  I applaud JK Rowling for these masterpieces and all the thought and effort she put behind it   This is my second time reading this gem and oh boy  what a ride it has been  Ok so Hermione annoyed me very much up until the moment when they defeated the troll  Then from that point on she became my child   Snape was rather mean  duh  and I didn t like him at all especially when Dumbledore told Harry that Snape hates James all right  but the only reason he tried to save Harry was bc James had saved Snape once and he hated him for it  Not cool Snape not cool  I don t care how heartbreaking your story is  Also  Dumbledore literally left Hogwarts just so Harry could go on and have a nice lil chat with Voldy  Bloody brilliant  THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN THE WORLD IS THE TRIOS FRIENDSHIP OKAY DONT EVEN FIGHT ME ON THIS K THANKS BYE also i quite couldn t handle the amount of drarry in this book honestly       OTP YAS  I must say  this was an excellent book  I had never had any interest in reading this for no other reason than it wasn t my usual genre go to at all  but my husband had read them previously and had finally convinced me to  I definitely look forward to reading through the series  Rowlings in a pleasure  Her imagination is one of a kind   Neljan vuoden tauon jalkeen oli ihana matkustaa jalleen Tylypahkaan vanhojen ystavien luokse  Ja korkea aika olikin tehda paluu  silla paljon olin jo unohtanut  Esimerkiksi en yhtaan muistanut  etta kirjasarjan ensimmainen osa oli nain selkeasti lapsille suunnattu  nain lyhyt ja   nain mainio  Jain koukkuun jo muutaman sivun jalkeen ja se oli menoa  ensimmainen kirja oli luettava hujauksessa  Lammin huumori  ihana ystavyys ja kiinnostavat hahmot eivat pettaneet tallakaan kertaa Innolla odotan jo seuraavaa osaa  jonka aion lukea  Oli janna lukea kirjaa nyt  kun myohempien kirjojen tapahtumat ovat niin selkeina mielessa seka elokuvat  Paljon enemman sai irti kirjasta  Mutta vaikka kuinka yritin lukea kirjaa hitaasti nauttien ja yksityiskohtia huomioiden  niin kirjan imu oli melko voimakas ja sivut kaantyivat aika tiuhaan   My favorite series of books of all time  I have both the Hardcover and Audio CD  both US  versions of this entire collection  I LOVE Jim Dale s audio narration  A superb collection  I periodically reread the entire series  simply because I never want to let the magic go I have a special place in my heart for this  the story that started it all Update  I was granted  through a good friend  a chance to listen to the UK version of this series  read by Stephen Fry  I know  How great is that    but I still preferred the US version  read by Jim Dale  It was great to hear the different pronunciations of words as simple as  ate    it sounded like  et   However  I was expecting the terms like  toilet  to be replaced by  Loo   among other variations  Silly American As always  a great series  Absolutely my favorite  I read this book in summer of 2000 for a Library school class on fantasy  Maybe because it was right before my wedding  or maybe because I had read a lot of new fantasy that I loved  I just thought it was okay  I didn t become hooked until I read book 2  a few months later   at my sister in laws insistance   I immediatly read book 3 and 4  And then  like the rest of HP fandome  I had to wait three long years for Book 5 2012 My husband finished reading this first Harry Potter book to our kids  age 7   5  The older one is completely enchanted with it  2016 update  reading this with my sons  now aged 10   8  There s a lot they don t remember from 3 years ago  They think Fred and George Weasley are the funniest  After a decade and two kids later  I find myself sympathizing with Mrs  Weasley on a whole new level  Okay  I m finally giving in I ve read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone three times now  The first time because it was insanely popular and everyone loved it  so I had to see what all the excitement was about  The second time because I was less than satisfied after the first read through and I decided a second chance was in order  The third time because I had to for a class Admittedly  I didn t really enjoy it the first two times  I don t know why  I just didn t It s safe to say that I really  really like it now  and might even grow to love it after I read the second one  I got into it this time in a way that I haven t before  and I think it has a certain charm that makes it appealing to all audiences  I love books that can take me away to the world they create  and J  K  Rowling has done a beautiful job   Favorite I read this book when I was practically the same age as the main character  I literally grew up with Harry Potter  This is the book that made me fall so deeply and passionately in love with reading and genre of fantasy  I thank you so much J K Rowling  This made me become a writer Not only a deep and wonderful story line with amazing characters  such an accomplished and masterful approach to a story  I will read anything she writes  This author is a superb writer  To some HP is the butt of a joke  but truly don t underestimate this novel series  Great from start to finish  Simple as that One last thing  Jim Dale  the voice actor for this audio books series is the most amazing voice actor  Won tons of awards for doing the most voices in a single story  So if you ve never listened to Harry Potter  buy it today  This made me   Made me think   made me wonder   made me believe   This made my childhood   And It is pure perfection   I can never find a fault   because this book effected who I am today     I have been Harry   Ron   Hermione   Draco   Neville   Luna and Ginny   I could relate to those 7   And for me   All have been role models   Yes   Even Draco   especially Draco     He taught me   People can change   and People were raised to think the way they do   And that shouldn t make him the  bad guy This is a true masterpiece   And will remain   in my heart    This is the best book series in my 14 years of existence   After All This Time   I still believe in magic Always     I can t really write a proper first impression review because this must be the 100th time i ve read this book  I just wanted to mention that no matter how many times i read the series it seriously never gets old  I love coming back in to this world and spending time with the characters that will always take up a huge part of my heart  Once again  amazing and magical  Cannot wait to get through them all over again     Yes  I am reading this series for the first time and I m very excited    I don t know why I put off this series because this book was amazing and I can t wait to continue the rest of the books  This was so fun and the characters were all unique and just amazing  Hermione reminds me of myself lol  This book was just so good     Wow   This is way better than i remember it being when I read it in high school   This book is so incredibly enchanting  The Philosopher s Stone has elements of magic  mystery  friendship and so much more and I absolutely love it  I also really loved all the little things I picked up on because I have already read all the books and watched all the movies  Ps  I think these books are my favourite additions of the Harry Potter series to date   I thought this book was really good  and it gave so much details  The action in this book feels like as if I m in the book watching the action  The story is really well thought  IN this book they are some emotional parts too  I highly recommend this book  by the way this book has a lot of chapters to the people who don t like big books   Dios mio  Debo confesar que nunca me llamo la atencion leer este libro  ni las peliculas me interesaban  Y de lo que me perdi  La historia me gusto mas de lo que me esperaba  al principio no me llenaba y pense que no terminaria gustandome  pero vaya sorpresa   Me encanto  Harry  Hermione y Ron son encantadores  Ya quiero leer los siguientes libros  solo me falta juntar dinero y comprarlos    Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone introduces readers to Harry Potter  a young orphan taken in by his aunt and uncle  The Dursleys are terrible people and Harry suffers under their upbringing until his 11th birthday  when he receives his first letter in the mail  Harry discovers he s actually a wizard and has been accepted to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry  At Hogwarts  Harry has to deal with making friends  making enemies  and saving the world from evil  All in a day s work for a typical 11 year old  Oh gosh  it s been so long since I ve done a Harry Potter reread  Sorcerer s Stone hit me just as hard today as when I first read it in second or third grade  Check out the rest of my review at  my blog   Re reading Harry Potter books  I must have seen the movies ten times or more  but only read the books once  So last week I started with book 1   and it is still great  Now I see many details in the book that were not in the movies and that makes me appreciate the books even more  I don t think I need to tell anything about the contents   because is there anyone that has no idea what the books are about  I didn t read this book when it first debuted because thought I was too old for it  When I heard how many adults loved the story I still didn t read it because I rarely read anything outside the suspense genre  Then I joined goodreads and met people that adore books as much as I do  Their enthusiasm for different authors and genres was contagious and now I want to read books I never would have considered before  I finally decided to read J K  Rowling s modern day classic and I m so happy I did A long story short this is a wonderful  magical  well written story featuring a memorable cast of characters and I can t wait to read the entire series  I m not sure I can add anything that hasn t already been said about this book other than this  if you haven t read it yet  you should  An enjoyable read for all ages  In a word  amazing  Just began rereading this series because it s been a long  long while and I m enjoying it even more than when I first read it  The Harry Potter universe is just sooo intricate  yet so easy and fun to get into  All the characters are interesting in their own right  and there s something fresh and unpredictable in each scene  The mirror of Erised and the game of Quidditch are genius A must read   Reread  December 2015It s been quite some years since I ve read this book and I ve been dying to do a reread of the series for some years now  So I decided that now for  HarryXmas  Of course I was going to read it in this beautiful illustrated edition  The illustrations made me feel as though I was reliving the experience of a Harry Potter again  Jim Kay portrayed the story of Harry potter so beautifully and worked so magnificently with the glorious story that J K  Rowling has given us so many years ago  Reading Harry Potter is such a magical experience and I am so happy to be finally rereading them  I am coming across my absolute favorite quotes again and the such magnificently well crafted magical story of Harry Potter  Of course it is still a 5 5 star book  It will ALWAYS be a 5 star book   4 5 actually  I love this book and will be loving it as many times as I reread it  Still there were moments which made me cringe like this last minute awarding Gryffindor with points because every time I read this scene I can t stop thinking it s unfair to Slytherin because no matter what  they are still children there I love most of the characters of this series  and sometimes it s difficult to  forget  what s going to happen next to them  I feel so sad every time I read about Snape  There same very loved characters that I don t like as much as everyone does  For example I just can t get myself to like Dumbledore  shocking  I know Overall I loved this book as much as I loved it the previous two  or was it three  times  And I m looking forward to continue with the series   Me ha gustado mucho mucho mucho  He de decir que ya me habia visto las peliculas unas cuantas veces y ademas la ultima vez no fue hace mas de un ano  Harry Potter siempre me a gustado   asi que sabia todo lo que iba a pasar y a pesar de eso me ha enganchado y mantenido en tension  Me gusta mucho la manera de escribir de J  K  Rowling  de describir las cosas  las aventuras  la imaginacion  los personajes  todo vamos  Creia que me iba a costar quedarme con los nombres de ciertas cosas y ciertos personajes pero para nada  se repiten bastantes veces para que te quedes con ello y eso es un punto a favor en mi opinion  Estoy deseando ponerme con el segundo ya pero voy a darme un margen porque sino los devoro  y no puede ser  Siento que cuando termine de leerme la saga sere una fan de Harry Potter  The other day I decided it s time to go back to Hogwarts  It s been years since I ve re read any of these books  and even longer since I ve started from the beginning  And  I fell in love all over again with this story  My heart ached when Hagrid mentioned that a  young Sirius Black  lent him the flying motorcycle to bring Harry to Privet Drive and again when Neville mentioned that he was raised by his grandmother  I d forgotten that Neville went into the Forbidden Forest with Harry  Hermione and Draco when they all got detention  When Harry  Ron and Hermione all met I wanted to shout   You re going to be best friends     And of course  then there were Fred and George  Also  every time one of them bad mouthed Snape I cringed a little  So  now that this one is done  it s off to Chamber of Secrets  wooh  It has been 7 years since I read Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows  I appreciate the people who can make it a point to read them over every year  I  however  prefer to let memory take its toll  Recently  Bloomsbury and Scholastic has released beautiful editions and I zealously got home the Bloomsbury Children edition  Despite criticisms from close friends  who hate all the editions other than the original ones  I quite loved these cover illustrations by Jonny Duddle  As a part of comfort reading and also to do the honors to the newly bought edition  I am finally reading them over  This reminds me to ask my friends about their experience of reading Potter series as adults  What I realized after finishing up book one is that I love love The Weasley Twins  Wish book one had more quirks from them   Unfortunately I had watched the film first which I loved  The good news is that I haven t watched the H P films from the third book onwards  This book was like watching the film in my mind again  It s amazing how the film didn t leave one single thing out from this book  most films are missing the best bits and the book readers are usaully disappointed in the film  Well done to the film cast  they must have made J K Rowling proud  As I loved the film  I enjoyed the re read watch of this story  I read this thinking I would read missing bits in the film  I haven t had time to watch the third film and onwards thu I have them on dvd  and very much look fordward to reading the rest of the series  I can see why the kids all over the world were are Potter mad  Was a fun read  better late then never  Alright I kept this long ass journal  saved every single one of my favorite quotes  kept track of everything that I loved hated about each character  kept track of the plot  recorded EVERY SINGLE TIME that I fan girled  screamed  kicked  threatened to kill someone  cried  and DIED and I still can t write flipping proper review  There is too much praise to write into one review  and I applaud anyone who attempted to do that  Sorcerer s Stone is a work of art and I am not going to ruin it with a half assed review that basically recaps what everyone else is already saying  SORCERER S STONE IS THE BEST SERIES OPENER OUT THERE AND 10 10 WOULD RECOMMEND READING IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN BECAUSE THERE SHOULD BE NO ONE OUT THERE THAT HASN T ALREADY READ THIS BOOK  I HONESTLY HAVE NOTHING TO SAY OR COMPLAIN ABOUT OK   Ahhh I didn t deserve to give review on this book  What can I say is that  if you never read this book  you are a muggle  You didn t win at life  Your life will be boring  Harry Potter is my childhood  Harry Potter is my life  5 star is too small for it  The star this book deserve would definitely be 9    and three quaters  The classic hero s journey  There s absolutely nothing to dislike about this story  Harry is adorable and Hermione and Ron are perfect sidekicks  The villains are perfect and you gotta love Dumbledore and Snape  There s problem suspending your belief system to enjoy this story  So much fun  The writings great too  JK  Rowling is awesome   I ve read the books  I ve watched the movies  but listening to the audiobooks really adds another spin  The way Stephen Fry reads some parts  it s a little different to how the movie expresses it  Just adds another layer of awesomeness Definitely going to continue listening to the rest of the series  The illustrations add a unique character to the book  I like the songs  the sorting hat song and the Hogwarts school song  It would ve been nice to see them in the movie  And Peeves  OMG  I forgot how much I love his character  Plus Dumbledore s humor     Can I ask you something   Obviously  you ve done so   Dumbledore smiled   You may ask me one more however      haha  I m so glad I decided to re read this book  all the beautiful illustrations made by Jim Kay enhanced this already fantastic book  and it felt like a whole new experience reading this while looking at all the beautiful illustrations throughout the book  And now I m also really excited to get my hands on Chamber of Secrets Illustrated Edition  I ve of course read this book many times since it s release back in the late 90 s  I love it more and more each time  This time around  I decided to listen to the audiobook  It was amazing  Since the very first time I ve read them  I ve always thought J K  Rowling was absolutely amazing  It feels as if she s really attended Hogwarts herself  and was telling a story about her time spent in the magic world It really is a magical read You won t be able to distinguish Hogwarts from real life  Ms  Rowling really brings the characters and the castle alive for the reader This book will captivate and engross you from the first sentence  regardless of your age or religious background  The imagination and fantasy sucked me in and I will always love and appreciate the Harry Potter collection  Enter a world where the fantastical is the routine and the ordinary is the extraordinary  In the book that started a worldwide phenomena  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone  J  K  Rowling tells the tale of a young boy living a miserable existence as an orphaned child staying with his insufferable cousin Dudley and unappeasable Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon  Harry s fortunes are soon to change as he finds out he is really the child of wizarding royalty and overcame the darkest force in the magical realm as merely an infant  Get swept up in the adventure as Hermione and Ron join Harry in solving the mystery of the Sorcerer s Stone using a combination of brains  magic and a sprinkle of luck  A must read for anyone who has ever stepped out on Halloween and uttered the words   Trick or Treat   It has been 8 years since I decided to jump into Harry s Wondrous World  I have decided to do a reread through the series It was fun returning to Harry s first year at Hogwarts  Having watched the movies a lot more than reading the books  I had forgotten quite a lot  I still love the movies  but the books paint a better illustration for the individual mind I had forgotten how big of a role Neville Longbottom played in the books  In the movies  he and Seamus Finnigan play similar  small  roles  In this particular book  Neville is there when they find Fluffy  the three headed dog  He is also hanging around a lot in the Gryffindor Common Room quite a bit with the others This is a fun series  and I encourage everybody to enjoy the fun J K  Rowling brings to the fantasy genre  On to book 2       Yes  I read HP  Yes  I enjoyed it a lot  The first time I started on the series was at the age of 13 14 or so  during a spring holiday I spent at my cousin s place  but I got bored at book 4 and abandoned it  A couple years later a good friend convinced me to read it until the end  as my life would be incomplete without it  and she was right    If someone asked why did I like the series  I couldn t really make up an answer  And that s the best thing I guess  to like a book for that feeling you cannot describe  instead of liking it for a number of particular traits HP is perhaps the least original series I ve ever read  all its tropes had been used in dozens of earlier books  However  by today all these tropes became associated with HP  and that tells a lot about the story s quality  What can I say that people haven t said already  Loved it  Can t wait for my baby girl to grow up  so we can indulge in conversation about the book  about the characters  about predictions and how we can stop being Muggles  even it is for a little bit   I loved being sucked in in the world of magic  And it sucks being sucked in the real world  I have the Harry Potter series on audiobook  read by the marvelous Jim Dale   so I continue to reread them on my long drives  In a cycle of endings and beginnings  perhaps a bit like Fawkes the phoenix  once I have completed the last word of The Deathly Hallows  I open at the start with The Sorcerer s Stone   I wanted that sentence to say  I open at the close with  The Sorcerer s Stone  but wasn t quite sure that would make sense     There are no new words to say about this book except it is wonderful and I imagine that I will be revisiting Harry Potter many times throughout my life  Harry Potter has walked beside me through my childhood  teens  and twenties  I look forward to revisiting the magical world alongside Potter many times throughout my life   DECEMBER 2014 RE READGod  the nostalgia  I ve actually never given these books ratings on my Goodreads but I think I m content to just give them all 5 stars purely for nostalgic sentimental reasons  But yeah  re reading for the first time in years was a great decision and it s just as good as I remember it  Going into the magical world of Harry Pottrr created by J K  Rowling is like being sucked out of your house and being ploped in the middle if a hurricane  Every character us so unique  wirling around you while each little peices of the plot bump into each other until they finally connect  The adventure in the incredible series is a never endless void of imagination  curiosity  and well    magic  After reading just the first book you find yourself begging to be in the magical place where your room could be cleaned with the flick if your wand  yes  you too adults      Harry Potter is a life changer  bringing in the best interest of kids all over the world and put into the pages of this book  Harry Potter teaches everyone that there is magic in this world too        and its called love  I had trouble getting through this at first because I hadn t ever read it before but I had watched the movies  Needless to say  it still drew me in and boy I am glad I got to this finally  Despite the care and precision I had to exercise  unsuccessfully  while reading my friend s copy  I managed to get through it  This is a funny  adventure filled novel with quirky characters and creatures that just keep you tied in  This made me happy  Need not say more    After Alan Rickman passed away  these books kept coming back to the forefront of my mind  I re watched the movies almost back to back and then decided to turn back to the books when it wasn t enough  Since my to read list is already way too long  I decided to listen to them on my commute  I highly recommend the audiobooks  The narrator is fantastic and I found myself smiling all the way to work instead of screaming out the window at bad drivers  I loved diving back into this magical world and I can t wait to listen to the remaining six  If for some reason you haven t read these books yet  which is just cray   please do yourself the favor and pick them up  You won t regret reading them  but I promise you that you will be upset that you don t live in this world yourself   Always Although this is the longest book I have read this year  it is one of the best  I had seen the Harry Potter movies prior to reading this and loved them  and I was worried knowing what happens in the movies would ruin the book for me  but that did not happen  I still loved the book and I recommend it to anyone who likes fantasy  I just received my copy of this gorgeous book  so obviously I haven t read this edition just yet  I ve read the book  though  it s one of my favorite stories  and I very much look forward to rereading it with all Jim Kay s amazing illustrations  Because  they do make this edition special  Kay s wonderful drawings  I ve browsed through most of them  and really  w o w   Also  the oversized hardback  takes me back to all the great fairytales I ve read over the years  Anyway  there s no reason to actually reviewing a Harry Potter book at this point  but still  this illustrated edition does deserve some extra attention   This book changed me in a way  It made me open my eyes to the world of magic  I see things differently now  When I go to buy a book  each time I look for a story about sorcery  I am always comparing Harry Potter to the other books I m looking at  It s a fun way to escape reality and slip unnoticed into another world  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone was a great book to read  I love the effort put into the facial description of harry and Ron and my personal favorite Voldemort  I actually watched the first movie before I read the first book  but I soon realized I wanted to finish the books and later watch all the movies  As I was reading the first book J K Rowling described Voldemort as I saw Him in the movie  and I was very fascinated by the skill and years of practice it must take to get at her Writing ability  I actually thought as I was reading the book how awesome it must be to live and go to school at Hogwarts  Then again it must not feel good to get attacked by an evil user of dark magic EVERY SINGLE YEAR  But with Harry at your side you re all good   Except in the last book    I got on the Harry Potter train a little late  a couple of months before book four came out  I remembered hearing about it and brushing it off because it was a  kids  book and I was a  Literature major   Excuse me while I laugh at myself a moment  One day I sat down in my Literary Criticism class to discuss something heavy and boring and very important indeed  and my very stuffy and pompous professor looked at us all and said   Have any of you read  Harry Potter  I think we all looked a little dumbstruck  Then he continued   If you want a lesson in good characterization  read it  So I did  and I laughed  I cried  and I fell in love with a book in a way that I hadn t since I was a child  This book returned the joy of a wonderful story to me again  and I will adore it always    Harry Potter and the sorcerers stone by J K Rowling is the first installment of the Harry Potter series the book surprises the primary character  as  well as the reader when Harry is invited to Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry to become a wizard  Harry is learning more and more to become a wizard with his friends but more and more evil lurks around the school  Yet this role challenges Harry because he is known as  the chosen one   and for much of the book the reader isn t at ease with the Protaganist Harry Potter has moments of brilliance especially in the conception and discription of the world of magic  and specifically a new home for Harry Netherless  this installment of this series is an intresting step forward and well worthy of reading   Harry Potter and the Philosopher s stone is the first book of the Harry Potter series  This book is the start of the secrets Harry discovers about himself and his past  Harry uncovers that he is a wizard and is invited to attend Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry  There he meets fellow wizards  Hermione Granger and Ronald Weasley  Soon he discovers the truth behind the death of his parents and quickly learns that the dark wizard Voldemort is the reason  Soon Harry discovers the reason why the dark lord wishes to take possession of the stone  and together with his friends Hermione and Ron  Harry attempts to stop Voldemort  This book promises hours of entertainment and mystery of Harry s first adventure  This book is a must read for any fantasy suspense and mystery lovers  I would give this book six stars if I could  The Harry Potter series is in a class all on its own  The plot is wonderful and grows more intricate as the series progresses  However  it is not the plot so much as Rowling s brilliant writing style that keeps me coming back again and again to her stories  I can t get enough her clever unexpected wit and the richly detailed  whimsical world she has created  The Harry Potter books have set a new standard for fantasy literature that has yet to be matched  There is a void in my heart  a thirst for clean  delightful and well written fantasy that only Harry Potter can fill  This series is a must read for everyone  but be warned  once you have read Harry Potter you will never be satisfied with second rate fantasy again   Harry Potter  A lonely miss fit living under the stairs in Number 4 Private Drive  has a gift  A gift that would  disgrace  his aunt petunia and uncle Vernon good name    Harry Potter was a wizard and a terribly important one at that  Harry Potter was the boy who lived  And despite all of his Aunt and Uncle s merciless punishments and pushing him away from a good life  magic found him anyway  And he found himself being whisked away into a world of enchantment and mystery and all if it laced with danger  and a sweetened with friends that watch his back and are their for him like no one else has ever been In Harry Potter No  1  The Sorcerer s Stone  Harry Potter will face the most viscous enemy he will ever meet  and learn that the Philosophers stone is closer than he thinks  I don t have time for a proper review other than to say I really enjoyed the first book in the Harry Potter series  As is my style  or personal weakness  I tend not to read things when they come out  Somehow I just assume that if everyone likes this  I won t  Snobby  I know  I m working on it  But I really did love this story  For those who lump Potter in with Twilight  I think Stephen King s words are right on    Harry Potter is all about confronting fears  finding inner strength  and doing what is right in the face of adversity  Twilight is about how important it is to have a boyfriend    The other major theme  which I understand runs through the other books is well  is sacrifice  Harry s mother gives her life so that he could live  a theme of great interest to Christians  It s a story that will stay with me forever  After time  when I believe that I ve grown too old  and my tastes have changed too much to still enjoy the books or the movies  I know that if I go back and re watch reread it  I will always love it as much as I did the first time  Always  Just finished reading this to my seven year old  It s been 17 years since I first read it to my then 8 year old daughter  It was like revisiting old companions  and the illustrations are absolutely stunning  They add so much to the experience for children  A highly recommended edition Gli anni passano  ma la magia rimane sempre la stessaAnche se sono passati piu di 10 anni da quando lessi per la prima volta questo libro  le emozioni che ho provato nel leggerlo sono sempre le stesse La storia di questo maghetto riesce sempre a tenermi incollato alle pagine e alle bellissime illustrazioni di questo libro L unica cosa che non mi e piaciuta sono state alcune pessime scelte di traduzione che hanno fatto nelle ultime edizioni italiane  Truly enjoyed this first look into Harry s world  This book came out when I was about 16ish and I remember thinking  I am not reading a book about a 11 year old wizard     I wish I had  Now as a 31 year old professional  I have fangirled this series so hard  I enjoy the memes  the fan boards  the arguments  the youtube posts  etc  etc    Actually I have to admit it is extremely lucky or me that that fan pages blogs etc were not available when I was a teenager  I never would have gotten to go on a date or a gotten kissed or gotten knocked up  I would have been too busy arguing with someone in Maryland about the virtues of Hermonie vs Snape vs Percy     you know what I am saying  My social life would have  been completely virtual  like  virtually nonresistant   The first installment of the most phenomenal story of all is an amazing story The story is all about a boy who is destined to be the most strongest wizard who can beat the most dark wizard of all  Voldemort  His name is Harry Potter  The story is amazing because of it s plot and characters that excite the readers  Hogwarts Express here Harry experienced what is magic is all about  Maybe the best transportation of all  Everyone wishes to ride the most prestigious train of all Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry  the most extravagant school the we never imagined  It is a school that everyone of us totally freaked out to enter with  This school gives Harry the lesson and skills that he needed  It is where he grown up and it is where he become mature  I am a fan of the Harry Potter franchise  and as anticipated  I enjoyed reading this book very much  Needless to say  J K  Rowling is a very talented author with an incredible imagination  As this is a popular franchise  there is not much to say about the plot that is not already known  This is a story about a young boy who has to live with his repulsive cousin  uncle  and aunt since his parents passed away  When he turns eleven  he discovers he is a wizard  and is requested to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone follows Harry s adventures during his first year at Hogwarts and his adjustment to the Wizarding World  I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in magic  or simply enjoys fantasy literature   Que se puede decir acerca de este libro  En una sola palabra lo puedo describir como MAGNIFICO  No es un secreto para nadie  que J K Rowling marco una generacion con su fantastica saga de Harry Potter  una con la cual muchos crecimos desde sus libros hasta sus adaptaciones cinematograficas   por que sucedio este fenomeno  Simplemente porque J K Rowling es una excelente escritora  cuenta con la facilidad de adentrar al lector a un mundo lleno de magia y fantasia  narrando la historia de Harry Potter el cual no es un chico comun   Es un mago  y sus aventuras en Hogwarts en compania de sus amigos  Una lectura recomendable  rapida y realmente muy entretenida  Cinco de cinco estrellas  sin dudarlo        Gracias J K Rowling por tan magnifica historia  I was quite late to start reading these as most of my friends already have  but I still held out because I wasn t sure  I wish I d have read them years ago  The books offer details the film either cut out or couldn t showcase  and these little bits make my day  I love the story and the way it s written  I also love the characters and the way they re slightly represented differently in the book to the film  Unfortunately since I have seen the films  I already know what s going to happen  So some of the plot twists aren t really twists to me as I was expecting it  And I have to admit the book was a little slow to start with but you soon get into it  I read this book in under a day because I just couldn t put it down  I can t wait to read the rest of them    Only watched the first and the second movies when I was very little  All that I can still remember about the first one are the  flying broomsticks   The second movie once gave me a terrible nightmare    The translations of the books just lose their magic  Glad to meet all the characters in the original  Finally  Full Book Review  http   thereandtheir wordpress com 20   I have read this book countless times now  and each time it has been as much of an interesting read as the first time  This review can be slightly biased  as owe a lot to this series J  K  Rowling s writing is just phenomenal  the way she breaths life into her characters  her witty dialogues  the way her writing create a scene so vivid in your mind that you forget you are reading  She makes up her world in your mind  and you just need to curl up inside and wish you never had to come out of it  ever I had borrowed this copy every time from a library  and by the time I had started earning  the first editions had stopped being in print  I used to think  what is so special about  Harry Potter  books  after watching the movie  But after reading the book  I have to say that the movie does not do the story justice  I loved almost all the characters  And hats off to J K  Rowling  What an imagination  I love this novel by J K  Rowling  She really makes you feel as though you are in the wizarding world with Harry  The characters are strange yet believable  I love that when you read the Harry Potter books  you really hate some characters and love others  It makes you want to keep reading since you want the characters you like to survive  The 1st book is about how Harry Potter  the main character  grows up with his mean aunt  uncle and cousin Dudley  After many attempts from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry  he finally gets his letter that invites Harry to go to the school  He then attends his first year at Hogwarts  This book has many exciting and suspenseful moments  but also has funny and light parts  I recommend the Harry Potter books to anyone  Harry Potter discovers he s a wizard  and arrives at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry  when he leaves his horrible uncle s house and meet new friends A lot of people don t like the first book  for the reason that the beginning is an introduce to the entire wizarding world  Like a very long exposition  and less focus on the main plot  which is Voldemort and Harry  But I think there are many discoveries in this book as well and I loved that she gave us a taste of her incredible world slowly  sip by sip  Besides  the following books matures later together with the reader I read this book when I was 12  already then I knew I was addicted  DI think you could say we grew up together and I m proud to say that I m from the generation of Harry Potter  Can there be anything more wonderful than Harry Potter  Well  of course there is  Wonderful things are wonderful for different reasons  Harry Potter isn t wonderful in the same way that a really perfect pizza is wonderful  It s also not wonderful in the same way that a lot of books that I ve loved over the years are wonderful  Harry Potter is full of wonder wonderful  And stands up to rereading I ve reread Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone for the first time  in English  I did read it in German a couple of years back  since I first read it  The important thing is it s still enjoyable  and knowing the ending  it s fun to try to find the foreshadowings in the earlier books  Yes  I am old enough that I have to intellectualize the re read to justify it  I think I read the book when I was around eleven or twelve years old and I loved it  the entire series had a huge impact on my love for reading  They re probably the only books I ve read over and over again  and will continue to read for years to come   RE READ It always amazes me how much I love this series whenever I re read the books or re watch the movies  The story of Harry Potter is absolutely brilliant and words could never explain how much I love it  I can never get over how much I love these characters  Snape  the mysterious asshole  Hagrid  the giant friend  Dumbledore  the strongest wizard  I feel like I actually know the characters in this world because they are so authentic This first book is fantastic  The world and characters are so unique and well written  No other fantasy book could ever come close to the world built in this series  I was captivated by every single word while reading this  We all know how amazing this book is so I don t even need to say anything else  Really Good book  Although I have watched the movies and I know what happens it is still a page Turner This is a great book for all ages and also if you have watched the movie Read the Book still its like another Story to Harry potter but still the same Story line  I always swore I would never read these  I m actually glad I never saw the movies either as nothing in the book was ruined for me  As I ve been reading a lot of children s books lately I have to say that these are so much better than I ever expected   The first in the Harry Potter series so love these books  The magic  the creativity  the humor  everything about them  If you haven t read the books  but have just seen the movies  you re seriously crazy  This series is one of my absolute favorites  The book that began the fandom That gave the Potterheads something to live for That led up to deaths  sadness  and bonds that could never be broken The book that will have you joining the fandom upon reading the first chapter Read it and love it  I m reading this with my kids  so it s been super slow going   I only have them every other week  and they have been busy with end of the year schoolwork and wanting to read other books  so we have only been getting through about one chapter a month lately       I was into it right away  it has taken them a little longer  but now that Harry is on his way to Hogwart s they have taken much more interest in it  Which is good  because I definitely want to read the whole series   preferably within the next year  lolWe finally finished Harry Potter several months ago  and all three of us ended up being fans  Got the second book  hopefully when we get around to reading it  so many other books in our queue   we will get through it more quickly   11 10 2014I read this book to my 7 year old daughter  she loved the book Now I will start to read to her the next book in the series I love to read books with my daughter  is fun to see her enthusiasm in some parts of the book Now this book is one of my and my daughter favorite books This first book is a brilliant start to the captivating series that so many people have grown to love all over the world  Harry Potter s world is just pure genius The characters are fantastic and both Harry Potter and Lord Voldemort are super complex characters  For me the Harry Potter books are the best books ever written  the world created by the author is amazing and the story is breathtaking  I loved every one of them  books  characters world   This series man  Ive gotten so much   you haven t read harry potter  Who are you  We cant be friends  from people  So i finally gotten around to read this and i have to say i REALLY enjoyed it  I must have not liked the movies because i watched it when i was younger and i just wasn t a fan of harry  I have to say  i think either Hermione or Ron is my favourite character in this series   but we shall see where this will take me in the later books  Im very very very excited  The good thing about not enjoying the movies is that i don t really remember anything that happened  Only an general idea but nothing on the details  I absolutely love this world of harry potter  I cant believe i never tried to read this series but I m glad i am now   Harry potter is a huge part of my childhood both the books and the films  I never get tired of re reading  For all the people out their who have only watched the films the books are better with more characters just read okay   Please you won t ever regret  Wow  I can t believe I ve never rated this book It will always hold a special place in my heart  My Potterphile origin story  As a grown woman  I picked it up wondering what all the hype was about  and deciding I d read the book before I saw the movie  Hours later  I finally peeled myself from my chair  having devoured the entire book in that one sitting  Only the first four books were out at the time  and I read the other three in rapid succession  then attended midnight release parties for the remaining books  Those other three books caused me to lose a great deal of sleep Now  years later  I m working my way through the series with my first child  and it s taking on an even more special significance for me  5 stars overall  3 5 for this particular read  It was weird because I ve read it so many times that it like  felt strange to actually be reading it  you know  It was like  okay  well  I could just   be reading this mentally right now  I don t know   Oh I loved this    I ve been waiting for my oldest to read them with me and I m loving reading with him  I have held off on watching the movies too so once we finish each book we will watch the movie for it  Cannot wait to read the next book    I really think JK Rowling has talent  despite many arguments to the contrary  Either way  this is  as someone has said  sort of  The Beatles  of the books of my generation I love it now  it is my childhood embodied  and I will love it always That said  I by no means think it is the best book ever written  I do  on the other hand  think it s quite good and will survive its author  I know for sure that my kids will read it Yes  this book has its faults  but it is still amazing And for those saying things about it being tripe that was manufactured for a bunch of illiterate teenagers  think twice Yes  I am indeed a teenager But I am a teenager who likes to read And I am a teenager who loves Harry Potter What of it  A legelso konyvsorozat  amit megszerettem  Igazabol mar nagyban ment Magyarorszagon a Harry Potter laz  amikor megnyertem a 2  reszet alami versenyen es amikor elkertek elolvasni  akkor beszelgettem a csajszival a sztorirol  Ajanlotta  odaadta az o 1  es 3  reszet    En  aki nem szerettem olvasni a kotelezok miatt   egy het alatt befaltam 3 konyvet  A tortenet csodalatos  a szereplo imadni valo  az iskola es a tortenet osszes helyszine atgondolt  kidolgozott es jol felepitett   DE konnyed olvasmany  Sokadszor is mosolygok az elejen a

tudom    I have a Hagrid sized place in my heart for the Harry Potter series  You can argue against them all you like  and if your points are valid and not just the knee jerk reactions to hype than many have proven to be  I ll even agree with you  My admission that there may be weaknesses in these books in no way diminishes my love  It is a wordless  intuitive thing but by no means fragile  I have read and re read them to the point of losing count  I didn t pick them up to see  what the fuss was all about   my introduction was accidental and fortuitous  I can t bring myself to write the straightforward reviews I am used to  their effect on me is too elemental and non academic for a rigorous analysis  Are they perfect  No  Would I change them  No  I really wish I would have been into reading when I was younger  I completely missed out on so much  including Harry Potter  This was such a fun read and I m glad I m finally getting a chance to read the series  I m proud to say that I m in my twenties and am not ashamed   This is my favourite book from the Harry Potter series  Just love this book  The only problem I had was that I kept comparing it to the movie lol  Both the book and the movie are great   Although the book was much better   Absolutely amazing  What a way to start this year  All those memories  reading Harry Potter  revisited again  That joy of entering the amazing world again  but this time with the beautiful illustrations to go along with the story  Its tough not to love these characters  the story  the way its written  Even tougher to put the book down  once you have picked it up   Amazing to read this in the place of inspiration and origin     So different to read the names of places in the book and know where they are  or what they  and their surroundings  look like     Overall just a completely different read  being in the UK    5 5 stars Ahora me pregunto   Por que de nina nunca los lei   Por que nunca nadie me lo regalo   Por que  Pero mas vale tarde que nunca  3  Gracias a todos los que me han presionado y mirado mal porque ser una muggle pero ya no mas    i just finished this book   am watching the movie now as we speak    wow  the ending    i did not see it coming  i still can t believe it   but i m so excited to get straight onto the second book  i know this will be a series i will love and treasure What can I say I loved it  from the beginning to the end It was the first time I ve read it in English  I read it once in French  and I absolutely loved it It felt good to be back to Hogwarts  and to remember a lot of things we don t see in the movie There are a lot of details in Hogwarts  description  which easily lead us to believe we are there with Harry  Ron   Hermione  Well   i have to say that I can talk for hours about Harry Potter series   but I ll make my review as short as I can   promise I have read all the Harry Potter books over and over again and I can t express the feeling of joy that comes from them  I can t imagine my life without those books   I grew up with them and no matter how silly it can sound   i actually think that they made me the person who I am right now  I will ALWAYS love the saga  not only because the books are part of my life   but because they show me what a great friendship means   what means a sacrifice of a mother   what means to see only the good side of the life abstracting by the bad one  Seriously   Harry Potter is a phenomenon  which won t be replaced   I just want to start saying that I ve been doing things backwards with this  I ve watched all Harry Potter s movies  I ve even gone to Universal Studios and visit the Wizarding World of Harry Potter  but I ve never  ever read one word of the book  not even once  and I think I m kind of glad that things happens this way   cause written word is like zillion times better It was about time for me  to buy this book and catch my train to Hogwarts  it s never late you know   the plot was great  and even though I already knew how it ended  it didn t matter  cause I found myself dragged into Hogwarts and Harry Potter s adventures and twists and mystery that I didn t want to come back to the muggle s world  sniff   It is not an exaggeration that Harry Potter is the best series in existence  JK Rowling has inspired a whole generation   her stories will ALWAYS live in our hearts The wizarding world is carefully planned out   from the school  currency  electric system  the ministry of magic and spells  Rowling has created such an extraordinary world with an astonishing amount of detail that it is not surprising Harry Potter is known all over the world  If you haven t embraced the wonderful series yet  you need to do so immediately  I turn to Harry Potter in whichever mood I m in and will never stop being a Potterhead  It is amazing to escape to a new world where my worries don t exist anymore  Thank you  JK Rowling  for my childhood  One summer at the beach in my teens was when I finally succombed to the temptation  Just like most everybody else  I couldn t put it down  I think I finished it in three days  Wonderful start to perhaps my favorite series of all time  I thought that this book was very well written and most of the time authors have a very hard time concluding the story and this one had the perfect ending for the first book  To be continued is a lazy way of ending the story but this series has a very wonderful storyline  It only took me 19 years to find out what the big deal was  I finally gave up reading it aloud with Miranda  Not enough time in the day  I admit  what made me decide to finish reading it on my own was our upcoming trip to the Wizarding World of Harry Potter at Universal Studios in June  I want to know what I am experiencing  Hopefully I can get Miranda to read it too  It does live up to the hype  To clarify  I gave the book 5 stars on a Children s book scale  As adult entertainment  I would still rate it 4 stars  I was most impressed with how much heart this book had  I m also really glad I have stayed away from the movies  because I have to admit  the final chapter did surprise me  Well played  Rowling   Ok  Reading these for myself  not the kids this time       still as much fun as the first time  Have to disagree with my sister  These characters and the creations are so magical I would give it six stars if they allowed it   What took me so long to read  Not sure but probably because it was about wizards  Well  I decided to give it a whirl after my grandkids said to read the first book and we d all watch the movie together while we were there visiting last week  Well  I m on book   3 now  Guess that makes me a Potter Head  Is that what we are called   Enjoying the chance to read Harry Potter for the first time to my four youngest children  now  fifteen years or more after reading them to their older siblings  This new beautifully illustrated edition was a wonderful invitation to do so  Falling in love with the story and the characters and J K  Rowling s delightful prose and masterful dialogue all over again  Such a treat  I m sure we won t be able to wait for the illustrated edition of the Chamber of Secrets  since I understand that these new editions will be coming out at a rate of one per year  But we ll be looking forward to welcoming each one as they become available  and in the meantime  we ll savor the chance to live with Harry for a good long time  I had fun revisiting this part of my childhood and I owe a lot to Philosophers Stone as this was THE book that made me really fall in love with the Fantasy genre  It s funny how after 17 years and roughly 10 readings I can still discover some stuff I hadn t noticed before  There s just no faulting this one  the first and still one of the best of the series in my opinion  This was a fun  quick read  I ve already seen the movies and know a lot of the story  but this definitely helped fill in the gaps  Now I can properly join in the Harry Potter fanfare  even if almost 20 years after the fact  This book is the third time I have read this book  In my opinion  this is one of the best books that I have read  This book takes place in a whole different world that consists of wizards  witches  poltergeists  giants  and all around imaginative creatures  This book is about a young boy named Harry Potter who has to live with his obnoxious aunt  uncle  fat cousin  He has had to live with them for 11 years until something magical happens    JK Rowling wrote this book in a way that really made you feel the emotions that Harry felt  For example  when his brother gets 38 presents and he only gets old socks  He felt very under appreciated and sad  In conclusion  JK Rowling did a fantastic job writing this book  This book is a classic  meant to be read again and again and again   I can t wait to discuss with the book club group   Maybe we can talk about our favorite Dumbledore quotes  I just love that character    wise  quirky  a father figure to Harry   Reread  2 7 15Firstly    the pages of my book smell like my childhood  Secondly  while I ve reread this book countless times  I haven t reread it for YEARS  And I love it  Brings back all my love for HP and the world and the series   After seeing the first half of the 7th movie and then re watching allllllll the other movies and getting psyched up for HP landia again  I decided to re read all the books OMG I LOVE THIS SERIES SO MUCH I just do   3 Mijn Harry Potter liefde kan gewoon niet meer stuk  De afgelopen maand het audioboek geluisterd voor het slapengaan  Het leuke is dat er telkens weer kleine dingetjes zijn waarvan ik denk  O ja  Dat gebeurde er ook nog   It s only taken me this long to start reading the entire harry potter series  BUT  I always knew I would eventually  which is why I have not watched the movies  Now I am loving reading each book and following it up with the movie   Tak to byla parada  Necekala jsem  ze se mi to bude tolik libit uz od prvniho dilu  nejradeji bych se hned pustila do dalsiho  priznam se  ze uz jsem zacala cist  ale bohuzel jsem si slibila  ze konecne prectu dokonaly sen  takze promin Harry  Muggles gonna hate  First off Secondly  this is hands down one of my favorite books of all time  Why  Who doesn t like a novel where the protagonist does what s right  overcomes evil  and learns makes friends in unlikely places  Not to mention that this book contains  wizards  magic  friendship  adventure  trains  witches  school  good guys that seem like bad guys  bad guys that are bad guys  and of course    Quidditch  Before you knock it or don t read it because you re afraid of magic  take a step back and look at the important messages that it gives to the youth of today Doing what s right isn t easy Don t ever give up You are in charge of your destiny You are meant for incredible things  Una lectura realmente encantadora  Me rei mas veces de las que soy capaz de confesar  Por supuesto que me se la historia y los detalles no hacen la gran diferencia en este caso  Pero me gusto de principio a fin  y no queda mas que decir que J  K  Rowling es grande P S   A una  lunita93 le va a gustar el hecho de que le haya dado 5 estrellas  I had such a fun time reading this book  It s one of the lighter books in the series  and I know the rest of the novels won t be so light hearted  but it was great to get reintroduced to the world of witchcraft and wizardry  Can t wait for the Chamber of Secrets   I am probably very biased  I have loved the movie franchise since I was a child and when I started reading the books I loved it even more  I have read this book more times than I can count and have lent my copy to others for them to read so many times I should have made library cards  Will read for ever  no matter what the critics say  I am reading this for the 15th time and it never gets old There are new feelings you get from reading it each time  You find something interesting in the most normal chapters  Unlike in most books there is a crave to do what the characters did  see what they saw  and feel what they feel  You feel like going to hog warts to experience it all  When I was 11 I would practically wait outside my mailbox  hoping for a letter from hogwarts  J k Rowling  in short  wrote one of the best book ever  The first time I read this book was when I was in middle school  I m going to assume I was more interested in boys and socializing than the world of magic created around THEE Harry Potter  I decided to give it another go because I really WANTED to like it  I m definitely not one of those people who just doesn t like something because it s  mainstream   I love twilight  chai and Conan  To make a long review even longer  the second time around was an exciting journey into a world full of magic and enchantments  I am charmed by the characters and how they interact with each other  The writing is never boring and the dialog is flawless  But  most of all  I m  Officially  Hooked   We don t have any wood    J K  Rowling introduces magic as never before  that excites the reader from begining to end  The way she writes is truly magical  and even more so the story  I read this book in 5th grade  and although I already loved books  I was introduced to a book that made me forever love reading  When I had only one chapter left in the book I started jumping up and down  and raced home from school  and when I started reading I couldn t  thats how excited I was to read this book and to continue on to the next one  J K  Rowling is an amazing author with extrodinary detail  she kept me in my toes throughout the book  Harry Potter has given me inspiration that I will never forget  Harry Potter s adventure is now mine  This story is a great mystery and well written fantasy book  It talks about a young boy named Harry Potter who is told that he is a wizard  In the beginning of the book it basically gives definitions of everything  the term muggle  which is just a word meaning  human  for the witches and wizards  the buildings  the schools  the stores  and even people s names  Later on in the story  Harry is shipped off to the school called Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and goes on adventures with his new friends  Hermoine Granger and Ron Weasley in search of rare stones  and mysteries  I recommend reading this because you can actually imagine everything that is described in the book  It s truly amazing   Sam This book  Completely blown away by Kay s illustrations  A must have edition and proof that Harry Potter will continue to impress  This is my second read of this book in the month  first was Greek   and I loved it more than the first time  Such a timeless story  I think it s really cool  I mean can you imagine the boy who lived because of both of his parents died and he luced with his abusive realatives and somehow he still working hard on saving the wizarding world  I MEAN WOW  I loved read this illustrated version of the famous book  This is my first rereading of the book since it first came out  The illustrations are great and add another facet to the book that you don t get from the movies  If you feel like rereading this book   or reading it for the first time  I heartily recommend this edition  I saw the movie way back when I was in first grade  and reading this book now gave me great memories  I heard that this book was different than others and special  but I just didn t believe it until I read it  This book  truly  is a work of wizardry  Una edicion fabulosa para los amantes de los libros y de Harry Potter en concreto  Las ilustraciones me han parecido preciosas  pegan muy bien con el tono del libro  La calidad del papel es excelente  La unica pega que le puedo sacar el libro es el gran tamano que tiene y su peso  que puede dificultar un poco la lectura  The reason I give Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone 5 stars is simple  this book is beautiful  I m 21 years old and this is the first time I read it  I ve known about Harry Potter since I was a kid but I had only watched the movies    Many years later  I decided to give it a try after a trip to the UK and my Potterhead friends  persuasion  I love you  girls  P  Once I finished the book I wondered why it took me that long to get into it  Harry is a wonderful kid  the kids  friendship is definitely the cutest  and the story is full of adventure    all that magic made me feel so happy  I mean you ve seen the movies  But nothing beats the awesome feeling it leaves after finishing the book   Wow  Simplicity and exceptional  Love this sentence   as much money and life as you could want  The two things most human beings would choose above all   the trouble is  humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things which are worst for them   p 320  I just finished reading this book for what  the 7th time  I don t know but I ve read this series a lot  Which is odd  because I have never considered myself a Harry Potter fan  But I have forgotten how much I enjoy the Potter books  I had rated this book a 4 star  but reading it this time just made me want to bump up the rating to a 5  So I did  I love this book so much  I feel like I should consider myself a Harry Potter fan just by how I felt reading this book  The writing is just so dang good and the story is absolutely amazing  I found myself smiling  laughing  and even surprised myself by crying a little at the end  It s a crazy good book  Super excited to reread the rest of the series   I ve never read the Harry Potter series  Just recently  I watched all the movies back to back  and was surprised at how much I liked them  So I thought   The book is always better than the movie   so I picked up the first one  and now I m hooked   I had forgotten how much I love The Harry Potter books  I almost cried a few times  not because there was anything sad  but because of the feeling of re reading it and re living it all again  I remember when I first read the book  It s actually my father s and I used to carry it around without reading it  but I wanted to start it  I had watched the movie twice already  So one day I sat and read it and I remember my dad coming home and I m like  Daddy  I read the book  They missed so many cool stuff in the movie  They didn t add a whole quidditch match  Can you imgine this  What a silly child I was I don t have the second book  but if any of the bookstores works tomorrow  I m gonna go buy it  SO  the first time I picked up Harry potter series was when a friend of mine told me to not just judge it by movies  and Damn she was right Now  the first time you pick up  when you reach halfway through the book  the very thought that there are total of 7 wonderful books by the lovely J K Rowling  you are amazed and then begins your journey of HARRY POTTER and his 7 school years  in which you experience every possible  well  lets just say that  adventure and emotion that you very less likely get close to in real life The book is wonderful  much more detailed that the movies  and that makes you think how on earth did Rowling imagined such a intriguing story and its characters Enjoy  July 2014Harry Potter is always a fun reread  Read it to my seven year old this time and he ate it up  It s an excellent read aloud book  March 2012Second time through this book was a really fun experience  Now that I know what s going to happen in the other books I can appreciate the brilliance Rowling exhibited in this first book in the series  The foreshadowing upon foreshadowing done in a way that you would never know it was supposed to be foreshadowing is lovely to behold  Funny  sad  exhilarating  and slow by turns and never a dull moment  A book for all ages  Even my four year old enjoyed listening  Truly brilliant I listened to it this time round and the narrator was fabulous as well  One day the dark wizard known as Lord Voldemort disappear  And Harry Potter did it  But his parents died and now he is with his uncle and aunt and they like to be perfectly normal  They have a son named Dudly and Harry hates everything in the house  Then a letter comes but his uncle and aunt hides it from him  Why It  was an exciting story with many twists and turns  Because Harry is loyal  brave  and positive  he soon makes a friend  I liked the way first his friend avoided him but then  the friend thinks he too will be famous  Now  they knock out mountain trolls  make a new friend  and go on an adventure they had never imagined they will be never before  It tells about friendship and bravely    A boy named Harry Potter knew he wasn t anyone special I mean he lived under the stairs  but Harry was very wrong about himself  Harry discovers that he is a  famous  wizard  and is taken to a magical school named Hogwarts  were he will learn all about magic  Harry is thrilled about attending Hogwarts  and quickly makes friends and enemies  but is nevertheless happy to be a wizard  On going to Hogwarts though  Harry uncovers some of his depressing past  and an old evil that is rising again  Will Harry survive his first year in one piece  And  has he truly found somewhere where he belongs  Truly magical  HP and the Sorcerer s Stone is a great start to one of my all time fav series   I never really got the chance to read the books when they came out  Everyone was reading them during elementary school  and I think I built up some irrational fear for the series since I was at such a low reading level compared to the other students  I was dyslexic and my mother never bothered to tell me  I ended up finding out through a test at school and more than a couple comments on my spelling habits  Now that I am finishing my English linguistics major and heading off to graduate school for rhetorical theory  I guess I wanted to give it a shot  It sounds silly  but the best part of this book was feeling the accomplishment of no longer being afraid of my own lack of reading ability   I was five when I read this the first time but I reread the book often  It is one of my favorite books ever  and I recently got the illustrated edition  It is beautiful  This book has changed my life   I have been a Harry Potter  movie  fan since I can remember  I have seen all of the harry potter movies in the cinema and have been a huge fan  I recently got into the reading phase and never was eager to start reading harry potter  I thought whats the point when Ive seen the movie  But when I found out the illustrated version has came out I couldnt resist buying it  I have to say Harry Potter is now my fav  book  It brought back soo many good memories  I loved reading this book and couldnt fault it  The illustrations were amazing as well  I dont know wheither I should wait for the second illustrated book to come out or to read the chamber of secrets because I absolutly loved this book  I don t re read books It s just something I never do and never did in the past  I didn t even re read Twilight when I was a 16 years old and willing to sell my soul to the devil to be in Bella s shoes  I tried but I couldn t bring myself to finish it again  But when I received this in the mail and I browsed through its pages I had to re read it  I HAD TO  And so I did  And this time I finished the whole thing in a few sitting  A M A Z I N GI m gonna need stronger arms in order to be able to hold and read the rest of the series  Luckily for me I didn t went thorough with the selling my soul to the devil stuff when I was sixteen so I can make a bargain now for better  stronger arms   I have lost track how many times I have read this book  but it has been several years and now that the series is finished it is fun to go back and find the important clues of what is to come  I have always wanted to write a book but I read this series and am so overwhelmed with the details and creativity of Rowling  I am way too lazy to accomplish something that would even be 1 10th of what she has done  Desde el momento en que abri la primera pagina en mi infancia  mi vida cobro sentido para los restos  Una saga que me la releo con el paso del tiempo  que me recuerda que la vida es maravillosa   Resumen de mi relacion con Harry Potter  Dumbledore watched her fly away  and as her silvery glow faded he turned back to Snape  and his eyes were full of tears  After all this time   Always   said Snape   Always   I had read this several years ago but wanted to read them all again in succession now that they are all out  I listened to this on an audiobook which I really enjoyed  I was impressed again with Rowling s creativity and rich characters and how she unwraps layer after layer of the mystery of Harry Potter   The wand chooses you   There is no good and evil  there is only power and those too weak to seek it  It doesn t need a review the name Harry Potter says it all  This book was so much fun  it made me laugh  and was definitely an amazing read  I am so happy that I read this book and I can t wait to get started on the 2nd one  I am already obsessed with this series     407   2015 Program BUBUPertama kali dibeli dan dibaca pada tanggal 9 Februari 2001                                         Buku pertama serial Harry Potter ini termasuk golongan hard to put down  yaitu buku yang tidak bisa dilepas sebentar pun ketika membacanya Meskipun termasuk kalangan yang telat kenal Harry Potter  baru baca setelah terbit 3 buku terjemahannya  karena mengira buku ini adalah buku khusus anak anak   begitu mulai membaca jilid satu ini  tidak ada jeda sampai habis dibaca  Begitu terpikatnya dengan dunia yang dikenalkan J K  Rowling  yang membuat kita menyesali bahwa kita hanya Muggle biasa  yang tidak sekeren jago jago sihir di dunia Harry    I gave this boook a five star because it s fantasy  fast paced  and a realy good story  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s stone is fantasy and by J K  Rowling and is 310 pages long So one day at a sidewalk in the middle of the night  this story begins  Harry Potter  just a baby  is given to his aunt and uncle to be raised by them  Problem is  they hate him  For being a Potter and for being a wizard  Yeah  they hate him for being awizard  As soon as Harry found out he goes to Hogwarts  the school for wizards and witches  But will he be able to get things right like the other kids  Will he survive quiditch and the orgs and spiders  and most immportantly  Fluffy  Read the book to find out  Finally  after ten years I m able to read this books   I grow up with the HP movies  and I loved them but it was not the same  I just needed to read this stories because I knew it was different and now I did Harry Potter is just like the Little Prince for me  I could have read it as a kid  I m reading it as a young adult and probably I m going to read it as an adult and as grandmother I will read it to my grandchildren  That s just how magnificent this stories are  They let us get into the magical world where friends and family are more important than any kind of power we could have  And what better than having a little fun and great adventures while we learn those things   Me gusto mucho el libro principalmente porque los personajes son tan inocentes y conforme ellos aprenden magia nosotros tambien  Aunque ya sabia lo que iba a pasar me gusto leerlo porque habia algunas situaciones que no lograba entender  It took me forever to start reading these books and this one was magical  I don t get why I waited so long to take time and read it  From beginning to end this book was amazing and I couldn t put it down   Always a fantastic readIt never fails  no matter your age Harry Potter is always a fantastic read  I have read this book at least 8 times and it always gets better   Re Read Completed 12 31 15 GAH  this is such a magical read every time  Jim Kay s illustrations allowed me to newly experience a story I ve read seen dozens of times  and I can t wait for the other illustrated editions to be released  I also can t wait to continue on with the series after watching the film  This was a fabulous way to end the year    5 5 re read in December 2015  illustrated edition  I SPENT A GOOD FIVE MINUTES DROOLING OVER EACH PICTURE THROUGHOUT THE BOOK AND TELLING MY FAMILY TO LOOK AT THE ARTWORK  JIM KAY IS AN AMAZING ARTIST  AND J K  ROLLING IS AN AMAZING AUTHOR obv   To no surprise  the story was amazing and reading the Philosopher s Stone with pictures was a whole new reading experience and I adored every moment of it  In addition to that  I also remembered a lot of the scenes that didn t make it into the movies because I have watched the movies many more times than reading the books  I cannot wait to get my hands on the Chamber of Secrets illustrated edition in 2016   Picking up this slim volume is always like picking up my very childhood  being 10 years old and as enchanted by the Wizarding World as Harry is  Rereading Harry Potter as an adult  I always find some stylistic flaw or other that I would pick at in any other book  but in Harry Potter  they are as familiar as old friends  It really is one of those books you ll probably occasionally reread even when your grandchildren aren t around to give you an excuse to read it aloud   Enjoyed it  looking forward to reading the other books I would recommend to all ages  an easy read but a good read  Keeps your attention  I like the characters so far  I think this book was very interesting and amazing  I liked the part when Harry  the main character  found out he was a wizard  I would defenintly read it again if I have the time with the other book series I am reading  I would recommend it to others in a heartbeat  Creci junto a un nino Potterhead que me leia los libros y me contaba lo que sucedia  Es la primera vez que leo este libro sola  pero aun tengo muy bellos recuerdos de la primera vez que conoci las historias de Harry Potter  me gusta la manera en que el ritmo no decae  Algo corto para mi gusto  pero me agrado mucho  Citas favoritas   todas de Dumbledore   Despues de todo  para una mente bien organizada  la muerte no es mas que la siguiente gran aventura   La verdad  Es una cosa terrible y hermosa  y por lo tanto debe ser tratada con gran cuidado    Hay que tener un gran coraje para oponerse a nuestros enemigos  pero hace falta el mismo valor para hacerlo con los amigos   Reread Sept 2015 I remembered THREE parts from it  haha  A part near the beginning  a part near the middle  and the very end  ha Anyway  this was absolutely wonderful  and it was almost like reading it for the first time  I wish I had read the whole first book before seeing the first movie though  I wish I could have read it in its entirety without having prior knowledge of the world   I started reading it before the first movie came out but didn t finish it before seeing the movie  I read book 2 and book 3 before deciding to go back and finish the first one Ah well Anyway  it was lovely  and wonderful and magical  And I cried at the end when they all got their extra points   Che bello  E cosi finalmente anch io ho letto Harry Potter  Bello  anche se e per bambini non e stata affatto una lettura noiosa  La Rowling ha creato un mondo incredibile  Appena posso leggero il seguito  Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone by J K  Rowling is about a boy named Harry  Ever since he could remember he has had a scar on his he d  His parents had died a long tine ago and now harry lives under the staircase with his cruel Aunt and Uncle  When he gets a letter saying they he has magical abilities and is going to a school for other witches and wizards  he is thrilled  When he arrives at the school many strange and dangerous things happen  Will Harry and his new friends keep the school safe Harry Potter is one of the most amazing series ever  it is a must read  I recommend and encourage anyone and everyone to read these books I hope that you enjoy them as much as me    Todo el dinero y la vida que uno pueda desear  Las dos cosas que la mayor parte de los seres humanos elegirian    El problema es que los humanos tienen el don de elegir precisamente las cosas que son peores para ellos    I will fill this in more later  Writing Technique   Hilarious and engaging Character Development   I enjoyed watching Harry s progression from the boy who wishes the sorting hat had a house for people who felt queasy to the one who lives up to his Gryffindor sorting by being the bravest   willing to risk everything to stop Voldemort  Plot Story Development  1 2 Not a perfect story  but a great set up for a series  Message Theme   Bravery v  Cowardice  risk  bullying  destiny  friendship  Rating  PG for action violence  thematic elements  and very mild languageOverall   Thoroughly enjoyable  Just realized I d never added a review for the first in the Harry Potter series  tho  I ve read almost the entire series 3 times this year so far   Read through 2 times  now on a 3rd go round  but won t finish the whole series by the end of 2008   This is the book that started the phenomenon    I have to admit  I didn t like it all that well to begin with  I thought it was cute  but nothing special  Boy  was I wrong  Going back and re reading it  I now realize that the Harry Potter books really have to be read as a whole to appreciate the entire scope of the books and how brilliant they are  I know I shall continue reading this series over and over for a good  long time  A recent viewing of the film series made me nostalgic for the novels and so with them now available on Kindle I decided to re read them  While the story was well known to me there were still details that had slipped from memory  I adore the series and it was wonderful to return to Hogwarts and its students and teachers   Well it s finally official I love berry potter  It s great to know that a book can bring your imagination to life as well has bring you to a place that is magical  Also with universal studios having  the wizerding world of Harry Potter  open its great to know that the Harry Potter flame is still boring after all of these years  And me being a huge Harry Potter fan  The books definitely have a big impact on how far my imagination gets to run   Again another series I have waited so long to read  I m so mad at myself for waiting so long to start Harry Potter  see I ve had all the books since I was like 12 and they sit up in this built in shelf in my wall that I can t get to without a ladder  Im 15 and I m only 4 10 I literally just can t reach them and that is my lame excuse for not having started this series sooner  and they are still on the top of that bookshelf I bought the paperback box set from target just so I could read them  Harry Potter and the Sorcerers stone was amazing and now I understand why so many people are obsessed with the Harry Potter series  I m sure when I finish book 7 I will be too  Fantastic as always  Haven t read Philosopher s Stone in SO long  so it was really great to go back and read it all over again  Can t wait for the rest of the illustrated versions come out  they are all going to be so beautiful  I know it s not everyone s cup of tea  Everyone has their opinion about it  but it was great fun for me to enjoy it all over again And as a writer  I was reading this and thinking   people turned this down  I have always chosen not to follow the crowds when it comes to books to read  I have chosen to read Harry Potter to help with the weekly pub quizzes  Oh what a mistake I am hooked  Fantastic first book can t wait to read the next   This book is marvelous  It plunges you into a world that you wish would exist  After you read this series  nothing else will ever do  The book is a great kickoff into the Harry Potter series  I suggest this to anyone who likes adventure fantasy drama  and a little bit of mischief  I recently re read this one on audio  I decided with all the walking I do  I could easily get in an extra book every week or two by adding audio books and I m glad I did  It had been quite a while since I read the HP books and despite knowing everything that was going to happen  it was still completely magical  It made me excited for when Sadie is old enough for me to read them to her  I do like the later books better  but I think I will have to give them all five stars because they are still better than most other books on my list I had the Jim Dale audio  and he is such a good reader  I ll definitely be making my way through the rest of the series with him   It was one of those rare occasions when the true story is even more strange and exciting than the wild rumors    HarryEverybody knows of Harry Potter  My grandma knows about him  my cousin who dislikes reading has read through the series many times  and there s been a giant sign of Harry in Orlando  Florida for about five years  Everyone raves about it  Since I wanted a little taste of the magic  I borrowed this book from my friend  I was expecting something written like a classic since this book is one  But nope  no shants and shalls  Instead  I found a really good story about discovering who you are and then coping with it  Can t wait to dive into the next one  This should be a novel that generations of children continue to discover  There is the obvious magic and adventure to recommend it  Harry is truly a likable main character and his friendship with Ron  Hermione and some of the adult characters makes this much more than an action book to read for plot  I d put off reading it for years  had made a couple of half hearted attempts to start the book  but someone recently suggested I try the audio version  What a treat  It is more like a dramatization from a single reader  and very well done  Adults who haven t made the time to work this children s novel into their book pile  could try the audiobook  Highly recommended  I read this with my boyfriend  taking turns to read aloud to one another  It was a wonderful experience  certainly enhanced by the illustrations and definitely a worthy purchase for those new and returning to Harry Potter  this book is really great I do recommend this book for kids and should read all of the books because it tells many adventures of harry potter Loved this color edition  I read this book when it was first published so it was good to read it again and remember some of the details I had forgotten  A beautiful book  I am so sad that I didn t read it before  It s amazing  It s just far more interesting than the movie  even if the movie was soooo good   Everyone should read it  it s never too late for Harry Potter  Reread for the bajillionth time  The introductory chapters are still brilliant  I feel like it gets bogged down a little in the middle  but it s still a great read  You guys  YOU GUYS  You must read the illustrated edition of Philosopher s Stone  Now  I know what you re thinking   Lindsay  I  like you  already own three different editions of Philosopher s Stone  Do I REALLY need to buy a fourth just because it has some pictures in it  And to that I say yes  Yes  you do  The illustrations took what is already a pretty perfect kids  book and brought it to the next level  Gorgeous illustrations on almost every page and some absolutely knock out full page spreads interspersed in a few key places  It has been too long since I did an HP re read and it was a delight to start up again with this beauty  Harry Potter es uno de los libros juveniles infantiles mas conocidos   y por que no  El mas conocido  porque aunque estemos libros tengan ciertos anos de ser escritos  el numero de ejemplares que se venden sigue en aumento Y puedo creer que uno de los factores de esto  es la gran  GRAN   en mayusculas de ser necesario  imaginacion de Rowling  parece que todo un mundo se le planto a lujo de detalle  y eso es lo que mas te mantiene clavado en la lectura  cada vez quieres  aprender  mas  llegar a siguiente suceso  No tiene la mayor prosa  pero la autora ha sabido sobrellevar bien la trama  Esta de mas mencionar mas respecto a este libro mundialmente conocido  My God  Why haven t I read this book before   I waited until I was 17 to read this book  and that is possibly the studpidest thing I ve ever done I was so surprised by how good it was  I assumed the book would be a bit childish  but  wo man was I wrong  The main characters being only 11 years old  did not affect the amount of entertainment I got from it  Definetly the best childrens book of all time Read it  Por fin tuve la oportunidad de empezar a leer esta maravillosa saga  Fue una experiencia increible y magica    Me hizo recordar la primera vez que vi la primera pelicula  3 No se si es porque todo el mundo la ama  o porque me tarde tantos anos en leerla  pero tengo que darle un 4 5  pero aun asi me fascino y me encanta decir  al fin  que ya soy parte de esto     D Wow  I had forgotten just how powerful the HP books were  I read Sorcerer s Stone  initially  when I was 6 years old so I had a lot of trouble remembering the plot or small details  Or I didn t understand just how beautiful it is  I am so excited to be rereading the series  It s making me feel like I m a kid again  Tengo una duda  Por que no creci leyendo Harry Potter Albus y sus malditas hermosas frases  No es bueno dejarse arrastrar por los suenos y olvidarse de vivir   Despues de todo  para una mente bien organizada  la muerte no es mas que la siguiente gran aventura    Todo el dinero y la vida que uno pueda desear  Las dos cosas que la mayor parte de los seres humanos elegirian    El problema es que los humanos tienen el don de elegir precisamente las cosas que son peores para ellos   Hay muchos tipos de valentia  Hay que tener un gran coraje para oponerse a nuestros enemigos  pero hace falta el mismo valor para hacerlo con los amigos   Releer este libro fue hermoso  ya sabia como iba a terminar todo  pero el libro es tan magico que queria seguir leyendo y conforme pasaban las paginas me seguia sorprendiendo lo que pasaba  fue como la primera vez que lei HERMOSO  3 Wow  It has been a VERY long time since a book pulled me in like this  I can see why Harry Potter so quickly became a cultural mainstay  Absolutely masterful storytelling  Even as a re read  this is one of the best books series I ve ever read  In this first of the seven books  we meet Harry Potter and his  family  the Dursleys  What a horrible bunch of people our Harry is forced to live with  but as we will find out  it is for his protection  We travel with Harry through learning of his true heritage as a wizard and through learning how to be what he is  We also meet Ron and Hermione and all of the Wesley clan What a fun and outstanding read  Even knowing the story I laughed and I cried  I cheered for Harry and his fellow housemates as I ready their triumphs again I m looking forward to started the next one again  This book is a well known book so I decided to read this book  I like how the story flowed especially with all the creativeness the author has involved in this book  I like how this book is part of a series because after I finished the first book  I was wanting to read more  Overall us is an amazing book filled with magic and has an intriguing plot  I recommend this book to everyone out there that is looking for a book packed with adventure  Originally read in December  2001 Reread September 2nd to September 7th  2013 What do you say about a book that s had such a major influence on you  I have trouble writing positive reviews  period  For this book  it cannot be done  All I can say is that I read this  and the next two books  over December 2001 and January 2002  along with the LOTR trilogy  They both showed me things I never knew could exist in storytelling  I didn t know what fantasy novels were  In the years since  I ve become defined by my love of reading  specifically fantasy  This seris has has given comfort in hard times  and lonely times  There is nothing else to be asked of a book  What s not to love  I am not one to jump on the book bandwagon  but almost felt it a social obligation to do so in the case of the famous Harry Potter series  plus my 8 year old wanted to read them  so I conceded   Also  fantasy is absolutely not my thing  but of course  J K  Rowling is rich for a reason  and I applaud her for an unparalleled writing talent  So enjoyed this book and loving the second so far    it s also fun to watch all the movies right after I read the books with no waiting necessary   just finished reading with my son   his first Harry Potter experience  so special watching his eyes follow my words  and hearing him gasp as he turned the pages to beautiful  magical illustrations   Why do they allow people to rate this anything other than 5 stars  This should be a no brainer  It s fucking Harry Potter  5 stars people  That is all  D Re read this with my grandson  I love it and find Harry Potter a fun read  the story a young boy who over come many think in his life that has goes wrong  Brain Food  Spaghetti and MeatballsScandal Level  blushViolence  2 wandsMust be ___ old to read  8Read if you liked  Chronicles of Narnia or Septimus HeapRe readability  I could read it once a yearThoughts I always wonder how good these actually are  There is so much nostalgia associated associated with these books  But whenever I reread them I am again overwhelmed by how wonderful they are  They are so multi layered that a 10 year old can love them and a 30 year old can love them and find deeper meaning  There is a reason these books help to define our generation  I can t wait till my kiddos are old enough to read these with me   Just as good reading Harry Potter again as an adult as I remembered it when I was a child  Maybe better  and the gorgeous illustrations enhance the story and bring it to life even more than Rowling herself did  Loved it  A treasured book I will keep for ever  I believe that every story has its own magic  However  Harry Potter seems to have taken 99  of the definition of that word and wove another one of its own  I was bewitched deeper and deeper with every turning pages  Moreover  I fell in love with this book a lot of ways differently than how I did elsewhere  I was brought 5 years back when all the essence of love was just being introduced  then I fell in love  I was so happy to finally start the best series of all time  I think one of the biggest regret of my childhood was not starting to do so long before  But Hogwarts has had forever to stay  so I guess it s never too late to receive a letter   When you read this  you understand what all the hype is about  Rowling is a great author that has created a wonderful world  I can t wait to go deeper  I really enjoyed rereading these  It was like slipping into a warm blanket and drinking a hot cocoa on a cold winters night  Sometimes I found myself getting sad at times because I used to read these with my great grandma and we would talk about the books and what we loved about them  She died about 4 years ago  I m also getting a lot of good emotions from just being back in a world I loved so much  I ve actually laughed out loud several times but was also ready sad when Harry was treated bad by the Dursleys  There were parts that I had forgotten and it was fun to relive them  I cannot wait to continue rereading this series with a friend of mine  D  This book is the ultimate comfort food   This is the only book I could read after The Dovekeepers  It s a great story  and Rowling writes in such a way that you really are right there with Harry  Hermione and Ron  That is one of my favorite things about her writing Oh and the humor  I forgot how much humor there is in the books  Lee Jordan s commentary on Harry s first match   I had to try not to snort on the train   And Fred and George   the movies do not do them justice  What else can I say besides I absolutely love this book  and series    Of course I loved this  Who doesn t love the H  Potter series  It s a fun  entertaining read and full of magical goodness  A totally great experience   I recently re read this one on audio  I decided with all the walking I do  I could easily get in an extra book every week or two by adding audio books and I m glad I did  It had been quite a while since I read the HP books and despite knowing everything that was going to happen  it was still completely magical  It made me excited for

un 4 5  pero aun asi me fascino y me encanta decir  al fin  que ya soy parte de esto     D Wow  I had forgotten just how powerful the HP books were  I read Sorcerer s Stone  initially  when I was 6 years old so I had a lot of trouble remembering the plot or small details  Or I didn t understand just how beautiful it is  I am so excited to be rereading the series  It s making me feel like I m a kid again  Tengo una duda  Por que no creci leyendo Harry Potter Albus y sus malditas hermosas frases  No es bueno dejarse arrastrar por los suenos y olvidarse de vivir   Despues de todo  para una mente bien organizada  la muerte no es mas que la siguiente gran aventura    Todo el dinero y la vida que uno pueda desear  Las dos cosas que la mayor parte de los seres humanos elegirian    El problema es que los humanos tienen el don de elegir precisamente las cosas que son peores para ellos   Hay muchos tipos de valentia  Hay que tener un gran coraje para oponerse a nuestros enemigos  pero hace falta el mismo valor para hacerlo con los amigos   Releer este libro fue hermoso  ya sabia como iba a terminar todo  pero el libro es tan magico que queria seguir leyendo y conforme pasaban las paginas me seguia sorprendiendo lo que pasaba  fue como la primera vez que lei HERMOSO  3 Wow  It has been a VERY long time since a book pulled me in like this  I can see why Harry Potter so quickly became a cultural mainstay  Absolutely masterful storytelling  Even as a re read  this is one of the best books series I ve ever read  In this first of the seven books  we meet Harry Potter and his  family  the Dursleys  What a horrible bunch of people our Harry is forced to live with  but as we will find out  it is for his protection  We travel with Harry through learning of his true heritage as a wizard and through learning how to be what he is  We also meet Ron and Hermione and all of the Wesley clan What a fun and outstanding read  Even knowing the story I laughed and I cried  I cheered for Harry and his fellow housemates as I ready their triumphs again I m looking forward to started the next one again  This book is a well known book so I decided to read this book  I like how the story flowed especially with all the creativeness the author has involved in this book  I like how this book is part of a series because after I finished the first book  I was wanting to read more  Overall us is an amazing book filled with magic and has an intriguing plot  I recommend this book to everyone out there that is looking for a book packed with adventure  Originally read in December  2001 Reread September 2nd to September 7th  2013 What do you say about a book that s had such a major influence on you  I have trouble writing positive reviews  period  For this book  it cannot be done  All I can say is that I read this  and the next two books  over December 2001 and January 2002  along with the LOTR trilogy  They both showed me things I never knew could exist in storytelling  I didn t know what fantasy novels were  In the years since  I ve become defined by my love of reading  specifically fantasy  This seris has has given comfort in hard times  and lonely times  There is nothing else to be asked of a book  What s not to love  I am not one to jump on the book bandwagon  but almost felt it a social obligation to do so in the case of the famous Harry Potter series  plus my 8 year old wanted to read them  so I conceded   Also  fantasy is absolutely not my thing  but of course  J K  Rowling is rich for a reason  and I applaud her for an unparalleled writing talent  So enjoyed this book and loving the second so far    it s also fun to watch all the movies right after I read the books with no waiting necessary   just finished reading with my son   his first Harry Potter experience  so special watching his eyes follow my words  and hearing him gasp as he turned the pages to beautiful  magical illustrations   Why do they allow people to rate this anything other than 5 stars  This should be a no brainer  It s fucking Harry Potter  5 stars people  That is all  D Re read this with my grandson  I love it and find Harry Potter a fun read  the story a young boy who over come many think in his life that has goes wrong  Brain Food  Spaghetti and MeatballsScandal Level  blushViolence  2 wandsMust be ___ old to read  8Read if you liked  Chronicles of Narnia or Septimus HeapRe readability  I could read it once a yearThoughts I always wonder how good these actually are  There is so much nostalgia associated associated with these books  But whenever I reread them I am again overwhelmed by how wonderful they are  They are so multi layered that a 10 year old can love them and a 30 year old can love them and find deeper meaning  There is a reason these books help to define our generation  I can t wait till my kiddos are old enough to read these with me   Just as good reading Harry Potter again as an adult as I remembered it when I was a child  Maybe better  and the gorgeous illustrations enhance the story and bring it to life even more than Rowling herself did  Loved it  A treasured book I will keep for ever  I believe that every story has its own magic  However  Harry Potter seems to have taken 99  of the definition of that word and wove another one of its own  I was bewitched deeper and deeper with every turning pages  Moreover  I fell in love with this book a lot of ways differently than how I did elsewhere  I was brought 5 years back when all the essence of love was just being introduced  then I fell in love  I was so happy to finally start the best series of all time  I think one of the biggest regret of my childhood was not starting to do so long before  But Hogwarts has had forever to stay  so I guess it s never too late to receive a letter   When you read this  you understand what all the hype is about  Rowling is a great author that has created a wonderful world  I can t wait to go deeper  I really enjoyed rereading these  It was like slipping into a warm blanket and drinking a hot cocoa on a cold winters night  Sometimes I found myself getting sad at times because I used to read these with my great grandma and we would talk about the books and what we loved about them  She died about 4 years ago  I m also getting a lot of good emotions from just being back in a world I loved so much  I ve actually laughed out loud several times but was also ready sad when Harry was treated bad by the Dursleys  There were parts that I had forgotten and it was fun to relive them  I cannot wait to continue rereading this series with a friend of mine  D  This book is the ultimate comfort food   This is the only book I could read after The Dovekeepers  It s a great story  and Rowling writes in such a way that you really are right there with Harry  Hermione and Ron  That is one of my favorite things about her writing Oh and the humor  I forgot how much humor there is in the books  Lee Jordan s commentary on Harry s first match   I had to try not to snort on the train   And Fred and George   the movies do not do them justice  What else can I say besides I absolutely love this book  and series    Of course I loved this  Who doesn t love the H  Potter series  It s a fun  entertaining read and full of magical goodness  A totally great experience   Love   3 Well worth a reread if you haven t in years  I d forgotten so much and they will still draw you right in  Just beautiful writing   I loved this book so much I actually bought it from the book store along with the rest of the books in the series  J K Rowling you go girl  And absolute masterpiece  I LOVE Harry Potter  It has been awhile since I read the Sorcerer s Stone and there were lots of parts that I had forgotten  Gotta love Harry Potter  always a great reread  And I loved the illustrations   I watched the movie first  and as per usual  the book exceeded the movie  For being in the children s fiction section  this book was a great read and I m excited to finish the series  As always  3I also listened to the German audio book when I had to do adult stuff today  AND IT WAS FANTASTIC   Great narrator Rufus Beck     This book was absolutely perfect I mean  it s Harry Potter so what s not to love about that in the first place And the illustrations are so beautiful  They are enormous and fill the whole page sometimes  It s perfect for everyone who loves Harry Potter  and for real  who doesn t    the only  downside  is the fact that s it s a heavy and big book so a bit awkward to haul around   Like everyone else in the entire world i LOVED harry potter  I remember saying how much i wanted to be int hat world   Still Feel That way  J ai simplement ADORE cette re lecture  J avais le souvenir  lointain  d avoir trouve que l intrigue mettait du temps a se mettre en place  et j avais peur de m ennuyer un peu au debut    et finalement j ai TOUT aime  du debut a la fin  Les descriptions de cet univers magique sont vraiment parlantes et tous personnages absolument geniaux Neville  Ron  Mc Gonagall  ou vraiment detestables  Malfoy  Snape   D ailleurs  je ne me rappelais plus a quel point Hermione est agacante dans ce premier volet  Et il y a tellement d humour egalement  merci les jumeaux Weasley et le grand Dumbledore  que c est absolument parfait  though I m finally having the pleasure of experiencing this wonderful adventure  there s still one question remaining  why the hell haven t I read this a kid   I wanted to re read because all of my memories of the stories basically come from the movies now  And I haven t read this one since I was about 12 years old  Of course  it s still amazing and very little is actually different in this one than it is in the movie  But it s also a short book  I m sure as I read the rest more and more will not have been in the movies  Also  reading about Harry s awful childhood is so much sadder than watching it   Its a really good book  I ve been reading it for like 5 times  I know its not much but i will still continue reading it  I just started the British audiobook editions  read by Stephen Fry   I ve only heard the first chapter  but already I m giddy with excitement about being immersed in these stories again  I thought that the book was interesting and enjoyable  I recommend this book to all who like fantasy  magical and exiting books  Well now   this book hardly needs a review  I mean   is there anyone  who doesn t know what this book is about  But still   it deserves one  So  on a personal note    this is the first book I ve ever read  The book  that introduced me to reading in general  The book that truly helped me learning english as my second language  And  the book  that walked along with me from my young years to adulthood  I ve read it at least 13 times  lost count but it s probably more   and I still enjoy it  So   thank you  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone for having a strong influence during my life  I will always be your fan    that is a very long time to rebel since the first book came out in like 1997 XDfor goodness sake go to the nearest bookstore and buy the setevery bookworm should have a HP set  D  Que se puede decir que no se sepa de este libro  y saga   sin embargo  la experiencia de leerlo ah sido grandiosa  una historia que te transporta inmediatamente a un mundo en el cual quisiera uno vivir  al menos yo si   conmovedora y divertida  conocer a los personajes  sus distintas personalidad y que congenien de esa manera para luchar contra los peligros que hay  nos ensenan que en definitiva por mucha magia que se tenga  la union  hace la fuerza    nqdr fylm hryptr rw dwst drm khh tmm SHnhh rw z HfZm  wly hych wqt khtbshw nkhwndh bwdm mytrsydm tSwr khwby

small details  I m excited to reread Chamber of Secrets this month as well   14 years since I first read this and surprisingly the story still absorbed me  Genuinely thought this probably wouldn t resonate that much with me now   After getting a new edition I decided to reread this book for the first time in a while  Still as magical as ever  Harry Potter definitely is at the top of my list of favorite books  He brings magic into my life and wows me with every new adventure   This series is my childhood  If you have not read this book  what are you doing with your life  Stop reading this review and go read Harry Potter   Seriously  I loved this book the first time I read it many years ago now  and I still love it  Love all the Harry Potter stories   I think this book was really good  This book really captivated me beacause it is really good about the little things  He releido este libro varias veces desde que la primer pelicula hizo que me interesara por el mundo harrypotteresco  Siempre disfruto mucho la lectura y recuerdo detalles hermosos sobre los personajes y el mundo que les rodea  Quisiera que existiera Hogwarts y despues de ir ahi  dedicarme al cuidado de criaturas magicas   ravenclawvet Para comentarios mais detalhados estejam atentos ao canal https   www youtube com channel UC1vl   Sim vou dar 5 estrelas    o que e que eu andei a perder durante a minha infancia Querida J K  Rowling estou rendida a seus pes perante esta obra repleta de unicornios  magia e muitas coisas que me fazem sonhar Tinham me dito  Agora com essa idade e que vais ler Harry Potter  Isso passou de moda     queridos Harry Potter tornou se numa historia intemporal   que decerto marcara geracoes e geracoes   Um livro para rir   chorar e aprender que o amor   a amizade e a coragem sao o que mais importa  I finally read Harry Potter  I was so scared about reading this because almost everybody knows and loves it And all the hype is worthy  at least for this first book  I laughed  I cried and I was surprised  this book was amazing  it is reall good My favorite parts of the book 1  At the station when Harry is helped by Mrs  Weasley 2  Jordan s comments on the first quidditch game 3  When Harry finds the mirror  4  Dumbledore giving points to Ron  Hermione  Harry and Neville 5  And at the end when Ginny is excited to see Harry  she s so cute  The one that started it all  The one that got me into a great book series  The one that sent me to Hogwarts     Somehow  we also love with Harry and his remarkable tales If you were to describe the story and tell us that millions around the world  both adults and children alike  would be falling in love with Hogwarts  wizards  Quidditch and all of the other amazing aspects of this fantasy world  I would not have believed it And yet  over a decade later  we are still enjoying them and wishing that there were more stories in the series The characters of Harry  Ron and Hermione along with all the other myriad players make us feel at home  even in such a unique and foreign place as the wizarding world of Hogwarts  I read this book when I had my tonsillectomy and couldn t talk  eat  or really do anything  but wallow in my own misery for two weeks  But somehow  J K  Rowling made me forget all that  Through Harry Potter  she took me on a journey I will always treasure and never forget  Although this book is for 7 12 year olds  The magic  heart  and characters endeared me to the point I couldn t put the book down  I read it in one sitting  and enjoyed every moment  from the train ride to Hogwarts  to celebrating his success for defeating the evil Lord Voldemort from rising through the use of the Sorcerer s Stone   this time  With a year of college latin at some point in my past  getting through the first page of this tome took a fortnight  But it was fun  The translation is excellent  I know  because I had the english version with me for the first half to verify mine   although the neologisms are sometimes challenging  The combination of latin spellcasting and prose proved no trouble at all  A fairly basic grammatical foundation is adequate to reading this  given lots of patience Oh  and the story was pretty good too  particularly compared to the usual latin fare  I never had any intention of reading it in the original  though  I think that it s a good start for an adventurous and dangerous world that becomes more and more creepy  I loved the artwork that was added to the story  It was beautiful  I m really hoping Jim Kay will illustrate all of the Harry Potter series  popsugar2016 A book guaranteed to bring you joy I love this book  One of my favorite books  I use to think these books wouldn t be any good but after a few pages I got hooked  I highly recommend this book  Lavish  magnificent illustrations  A truly beautiful volume for children and children s book collector s   This was just all kinds of fantastic  This is my first time reading HP   I know  I do live under a rock  and it was everything I d hoped it would be and more  Brilliant  That last chapter though was cray cray   I re read the first Harry Potter and went crazy about it here  https   www youtube com watch v H4f5o    El libro perfecto que toda persona en su sano juicio quiere leer  definitivamente es mi saga favorita  Ha sido TAN maravilloso reencontrarse con la magia en su idioma original que creo que quiero llorar muy fuerte  En serio  si teneis la oportunidad  leed Harry Potter en ingles  Es increible  It is the magic book month  First Borne wicked which was boring unfortunately and haven t finished it yet  Then Throne of glass and now Harry potter  I heard many people say that reading Harry Potter series was the real motivation for reading in general  now I knew why and I m really excited to continue the rest books  The book was so light and fast base which it surprised me as I was thinking that Magical word can t be simple or easy to understand  I regret waiting for purchasing the physical copy to read it  It was fantastic and like watching the movie but in a much better way   I had been putting off this series for years  thinking it to be utter rubbish  but then I had become in management of a toy store and  since we carried Harry Potter action figures  I decided to read the first book in the series so that I could have a working knowledge of the characters  I became as hooked as every other person in the world who read this series  We read books to escape reality much like an alcoholic goes to a bar and this series helped me escape this dismal world into a magical place  JK Rowling spins an epic well planned story in this book and all the others that follow it   I had listen to the audio books read by Jim Dale  which is brilliant  So now I am reading the series  Potter love    The Harry Potter series are great  I love the unique characters and scenes the author comes up with  I didn t think I was going to like Harry Potter but after I read the first book  I knew I had to get the rest  I even went to the party for the last book I like how the first one starts with the bad treatment from the Dursleys and all the letters that keep showing up by all the owls  Harry then finds out he is a wizard  And after Harry meets Hermione and Ron  and they get together to solve the mystery of the Sorcerer s stone It was well written and easy to follow  I couldn t stop reading it  even though it s classified as a kid s book   till I got to the end  I think it may become a classic  Read this with my 9 year old daughter  I had 2 goals in mind  motivate her to read more advanced books and prove to her that  the book  is  almost  always BETTER than  the movie   She just wanted to take the lazy way and JUST watch the movie instead  I ve satisfied these 2 goals even though I thought the movie did an exceptional job depicting the book These are my daughter  Joelle s  comments   This book has tons of details and lots of excitement  It was very fun to read and TOTALLY EPIC  The movie scared the crap out of my sister  7 years old   I can t wait to read the second one   I really enjoyed reading all of the Harry Potter books especially the Sorcerer s Stone  I grew up reading these books and I believe they lead into the craze for fantasy books such as Twilight and Hunger Games  When I read this book in 6th grade I had no idea it would become this popular  I should have assumed since I was unable to put the books down  I never pictured myself as a reader but books such as this one really engages me  I loved the concept of a young boy moving out a a terrible situation to a land filled with magic  It was a nice escape from reality  I love all of the Harry Potter books   Harry Potter has lived under the stairs for as long as he could remember  Never would he had dreamed of being a famous wizard  but when a large mysterious man comes into his life claiming that Harry out of all the people were wizards  Harry couldn t believe it  He is enrolled into a school of magic  Hogwarts  and his life is turned into a thrill ride  He makes new friendships  plays a magical sport on brooms  and is known as the boy who lived  He is born to a great destiny  That is    if he could survive the encounter This book will leave readers waiting for the next train ride back to Hogwarts  I ve been reading Harry Potter since Day 1  I m a total Potterhead and I m proud to say so I wanted to review this edition separately in order to mention the new illustrations  As much as I enjoyed the original ones  these full color and in some cases double page illustrations are just beautiful  Can t wait to see how the rest of the books look  I am so glad I finally came round to reading the saga  So far so good  Can t wait to reach the end  and then despair because it s over   My SO and I just reread this book aloud  He had never read it and I hadn t read it in years  Honestly  I always say to people that the first two books are really  kids books  and can be skipped  but I absolutely loved this book upon reread  Rowling s imagination and imagery  her attention to detail and her character development are fantastic and amazing  Compared to other literature in this vein  nothing else really stands a chance  I know I will come back to Harry Potter again and again forever  I m thrilled to be sharing the experience with my partner for his first read through too  Time for a Harry Potter reread  Or rather re listening  I listened to the audiobook read by Stephen Fry  He did a great job And the book  Was great  as always  Always gives me the cozy feels  3 And I re did this chapther in Pottermore aswell  Awsome  3 It is possible that I loved this more in English than in Portuguese    Full review to come   Aca comienza el universo HP  Al libro lo lei en un dia  no hacia mas que leer  porque es terriblemente llevadero  muy facil de leer  extremadamente interesante  entretenido  y entonces no lo queres soltar Mejor que las peliculas  Aca en los libros se puede percibir al mundo HP mas realista  estan mejores armadas las cosas  y los personajes son diferentes  mas serios  Read it aloud to my five month old daughter  What a wonderful way to experience Harry Potter world again   i am liking this book so far  In the past i never really understood the story of Harry Potter  but now reading the first book it turned out very amusing  You could really feel what Harry is going through living with non  wizards  and how he found out he s  famous  for his parents also that he is a wizard  He had to adjust to Hogwarts  This is a very exciting and addicting book to read  Many things go on in this book  i do recommend for you to read this  I look forward to reading all the other books of Harry Potter after i am done with this one  i really like the sequence of this story  A fun  engaging  and relatable beginning to a brilliant series with the best world building of all time  A must read  obvs  Showcased in My Very Most Favorite Books  For Banned Books Week  Top Ten Tuesday  Childhood Favorites  and Top Ten Tuesday  Book Boyfriends  Muito bom  Deu me ainda mais vontade de continuar as leituras e rever os filmes    I think there is not much to say about this book  I m glad that I ve finally read it and I really really enjoyed it  Fantastic rendition  The reader does a great job with voices and brings it alive  Brought me into a whole new World  Introduced me to books and Literature  and changed my life  Las ilustraciones son preciosas  La traduccion    que es eso de buhos        Me dieron ganas de llorar por no haber conseguido la edicion original  En fin  el libro es precioso  las ilustraciones  la calidad del papel y de la impresion  realmente vale la pena tenerlo  It was wonderful  It keeps you entertained from beginning to end  I recommend it  It s been years since I started this series but never finished  I forgot how absolutely magical it is  It s roughly ten years ago that my dad first read me the first Harry Potter book  This book series is truly incredible with the writing style  world building  and making it feel as if there is a magical world right before our eyes  It was such a wonderful experience re reading Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone for the first time  A story everyone can enjoy again and again  Also  the artwork in the illustrated version is fantastic  So incredibly detailed and almost exactly what I imagined  All in all such a great experience and I can t wait to keep re reading the series   No se porque no se me ha ocurrido leer Harry Potter antes  todo este mundo que creo Rowling es de lo mas magico y maravilloso que he leido  no puedo esperar por seguir con los otros Este libro me mato a carcajadas y de gratos sentimientos  No solo para adolescentes y pequenos lo recomiendo  sino para aquellos adultos que les encata la magia y  aunque ya haya visto la pelicula leerlo me trajo muchos buenos recuerdos  bonitas emociones y creo que la palabra que mejor lo describe es FABULOSO   Nose porque espere tanto para leer este hermoso libro   Muero de ganas por leer el resto de la saga   Realmente imperdible  Harry Potter never gets old  Thoroughly enjoyed listening to the audiobook this time  Loved it  It s such a beautiful book  with a beautiful story  I regret i have never read Harry Potter until now  read this book to many times and I love it soo much need to read the rest of this series October 2015  my latest reread and the first of 7 discussions for  The Big Harry Potter Read   There is something about this series that will always be apart of my identity and a huge part of my childhood memories  Reading this as an adult in my twenties is the same and very different from the first and other times I ve read this book  I have so many questions for JKR knowing how things turn out  I think my biggest realization is that even though I haven t read any of these books for years the story still means something to me and I find it very captivating and relatable  REREAD Oct 2015  Still as amazing as I remember with the added nostalgia  You can never read it too many times   Non riusciro mai a dare a questo libro meno del massimo dei voti  perche ogni volta mi sembra di scoprire particolari nuovi  diversi  interessanti Ogni volta e come la prima  un po  piu emozionante e un po  piu  casa   What a wonderful imagination  The lessons about bullying  courage  responsibility  friendship  family  study  honor  karma and more are what made this book one of the best fairy tales ever in modern times  I have read this book LITERALLY over 300 times  I once read it 17 times in one week    omg this book  you might never have heard of it before but its really good ok  read it   Good  If you like magic  drama  and other good books  cheak out school 4 good   evil I purchased this in a used bookshop in York and started and finished it in Edingburgh  after dining at the Elephant House Cafe  the place where JK Rowling worked on the book  It s at least the second time I ve read the book that launched the HP series  and it was a pleasure to re read it  Rowling knows  clearly  how to build suspense  surprise readers  create interesting characters  and to all the other stuff that makes for enjoyable reading  By the time I finished it  I had renewed admiration for Rowling and the work she s done on this series  Well  admiration and envy  How do you review a book like this  This is not a book  it s an epic  It is my entire childhood the reason I still read the reason why I didn t become stupid all wrapped into one You cannot just write a review for Harry Potter or comment on the things like language  imagery and all that  It s like watching a movie between the pages of the book  The biggest tribute to history  mythology and world literature  Harry Potter is something every chid  every reader and everyone who claims to love books MUST read because everything you ve ever loved about books and cleverness is in there   Not quite sure I qualify as a Potterhead but I did enjoy this book  Well written first book in a series  and the ending really surprised me  You can read my review here  http   embracingmybooks blogspot be 2   5 stars My first introduction to Harry Potter  I m hooked  Now I can relate to my seven year  old  Can t wait to read the rest  The last One that missed to finish my 2015 challenge had to be an epic one just like Harry  This is so much more than just a book series  it is some kind of Religion I read this years ago and loved it  I just recently listened to it and fell in love again  5 5 stars THIS IS A REREAD  I ve decided to participate in the  HarryXmasToYou year 2 event since I ve been meaning to reread one of my favorite series ever  I loved reading this for the second time  I read it back in 2nd 4th grade the first time  I noticed a lot of things I didn t at first  like references to future characters  which I thought was really cool  if you haven t read this series go read it right now because j k Rowling has been such a huge part in my reading life and if it weren t for Harry Potter  I don t know if I d be reading like I am   Reread a childhood favourite with my 7yr old for the first time  He gives it 5 stars  obviously   Listening to the audiobook a while ago  So lovely to relive the whole series This book was very great and it is a book that can be read over and over Obviously this was going to get 5 stars  I m thoroughly enjoying the reread so far   Don t know why it took me so long to read this book  It had everything I look for in a good book   mystery  laughter  adventure and wonderful writing  I think I remember learning this story It was really familiar when I read it  My mom might have told me it before  I just remember a boy with glasses who went to this school   The truth   Dumbledore sighed   It is a beautiful and terrible thing  and should therefore be treated with great caution  I loved reading this  I forgot almost all the details of the story since it s been almost 10 years maybe  I was very young back then and of course didn t see it the way I see the story now  I did not expect that I d like the book this much but I did  Just so magical and smart and I am filled with a longing to be part of their world  This feeling of not fitting in would make a lot of sense if I were to found out I m a witch  Well  a girl can dream     I am planning on reading the entire Harry Potter series this year  And I m ashamed to say that this will and is the only reread    Yes  I have never read the other books of the HP series  I have seen the movies but never the books  I loved this book  J K Rowling is the best   Now i m gonna order Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets   BEWITCHED   after more than a decade later  Just as magical as the first time I read it  I haven t reread this series in quite some time  but I gave watched the movies a lot  I loved how many lines they pulled straight from the book for the movie   There really isn t anything I can say about this series  that hasn t already been said  besides  I LOVE IT  Favorite Parts  Devil s Snare  Devil s Snare      what did Professor Sprout say   it likes the dark and the damp   So light a fire   Harry choked  Yes   of course   but there s no wood   Hermione cried  wringing her hands  HAVE YOU GONE MAD   Ron bellowed   ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT  And of course Dumbledore   After all  to the well organized mind  death is but the next great adventure   I love all these books  I love the world Rowling has created  I love the characters  In Canada we got this as  Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone   which is  of course  Rowling s original title  How sad that Americans allow their media to dumb them down all the time  The fear of the American publisher was that Americans would not know what a philosopher s stone was  and might therefore give the book a pass  Well  it wasn t a problem in Britain and the Dominions  Canada  Australia  New Zealand   Surely these marketers don t give their audience proper respect  Even with this being probably the twentieth time I ve read it  this book does not disappoint  Harry is introduced  a poor boy coming from a life of extreme hardship  Horrifically neglected by his aunt  uncle  and cousin Dudley  he is shocked and amazed to learn that he is  in fact  a wizard  His life takes a total change for the better when he enters the Wizarding world  Yes  there s something mysterious going on in the 3rd floor corridor and yes  Snape is up to something  but this is better than anything in his wildest cupboard under the stairs dreams  Lovely book  My daughter begged me to let her read this book  and I finally broke down and read it first to see if it was at  above or below her reading level  third grade  and to decide if she would be allowed to read it  content   I fell in love with Harry  Hermoine  Ron  Hagrid  Fang  Dumbledore  McGonagall and the rest of the characters  This book started a revolution of reading that has probably never been witnessed before  I can t say that I learned anything from story  but I throughly enjoyed the time I spent at Hogwarts with my family listening to me read as we traveled   Loved this so much  Cant believe I haven t read the series before now  Absolutely fabulous   I m happy that I got to read an illustrated  non altered version of Harry Potter year 1  It sucks they are only putting out one illustrated version per year  So it will be this fall until we see the Chamber of Secrets      On my wonderful non existent New Years resolution list  I have decided to reread one of the greatest series of all times  Harry Potter As I was rereading this book  a lot of overwhelming emotions came flooding back  I ve forgotten how magical this book truly was  Great way to start off the new year     Es un libro que en mi opinion extraordinario  cada personaje es un complemento perfecto de la historia  disfrute mucho el libro lo recomiendo  Finally listened to the audio book read by Jim Dale  Absolutely brilliant  Re read December  15 still as wonderful as ever  I d forgotten how fast paced these books are First time I read it in english  absolutely loved it  Bless this book  Ready to rewatch the movie this weekend   Read whole series and would love to reread over and over till I die  Favorite book series ever  and this is my favorite out of the series I cannot say anything that has not already been said a thousand times  These books are so much fun to read  I recently finished The Sorcerer s Stone and The Chamber of Secrets as bedtime readalouds with my 9yo  He has seen the movies and likes to tell me   Oh  I  know  what that is   Truth  though  there are plenty of surprises hidden in the pages that the movies didn t cover or simply get wrong  We re now reading The Prisoner of Azkaban  I m planning on reading through The Goblet of Fire  but then he ll have to go forward on his own  Heh  Evil mom plans  Loved this book  Loved this series  Magic  adventure and heart  I m finally ready to enjoy this series  Looking forward to the next book  loved the whole series  Couldn t wait to get the next volume  The first ever book that turned me into one of the bookworms lol  Just as intresting as the movie  it was a fun read and I loved it  with every book in this set the story grows and gets darker   great fantasy  endlich nach ein paar Jahren wieder gelesen und aufgefrischt     freue mich schon auf den nachsten teil der  hp2015bl I once read the Harry Potter saga in French  but I didn t remember well the world of the books  which is after all quite different from the world of the film  So    I read it in English and it was amazing  it just makes me realize  once again  how much I love Harry Potter and J K  Rowling s style  so fluent  so natural and so diverse  humor  amazement  surprise  joy and fear  these emotions all ran through me while I was reading and I can t help but consider the Harry Potter saga as one of the best ever  I highly recommend it if you haven t read it yet   Bello tornare a Hogwarts   Erano passati tanti anni  ma le emozioni sono sorte vivide ed intense come la prima volta    I just read this book again with my six year old son  I have been looking forward to when he was old enough to start reading some of these books  He has enjoyed reading some chapter books before  but he has never been so excited and into a book as he was this one  He not only would come to me and ask to read the book  but he would be disappointed if it got too late on school nights to read any of the book  I ve always really enjoyed reading the Harry Potter books  but reading them again now with my own child has made it an even more enjoyable experience  This story was so amazing  I m so happy I m finally reading Harry Potter  2014  re reading books is not that great as i though it will be  This book was wonderful compared to the movie because the movie was boring  This book was a total page turner because I could not take my eyes off it  I thank Natalie for recommending this book to me because with out her I would have never read this story  Since this story is a series I would continue reading it because this book caught my attention and it was awesome  I recommend this story to people who like magic  fiction  and fantasy  I am astonished that Harry defeated You Know Who twice  One weakness is that Harry s parents died when he was a year old  Unlike anything I have ever read  Loved it  Adored it  Just amazing  Can t wait to continue with the series   One of the best books and series ever  Would make anyone read them  This book definitely makes you want to read the entire series  It really interested me and I would recommend reading it  First book is my all time favourite Harry Potter book  Love it   The begining of the young wizard shot to stardom  Obviously the fasination of this book as seemingly disappeared when Twilight came into the picture  Now its more of  Harry who   At its time it was interesting  Harry potter Young Wizard  Lighting Bolt Scar  Evil Person trying to kill him  Living with an unloving family does give you a sense of you being unwanted and not important  the  hello  Your a FAMOUS wizard  All hail Sir Harry Potter  I say that even though it has been yesterday s news for a while  I say that it is worth reading  It is a classic after all  Obviously  there is no reason to summarize the story  so I will just say that I am an adult who had no interest whatsoever in reading the Harry Potter books until inundated by all the Harry Potter movies being shown on tv this Christmas  I liked the action but was just missing too much information to  get it   I decided that the book series would be on my reading list for 2012  so I read the first one today  It was truly more than I hoped for  really enjoyable just as a story  I m surprised and ready to read the next one right now  I m glad I gave it a chance  Rereading a series is always a fun and new experience  Seeing who we now know is Professor McGonagall in cat form  staring down Mr  Dursley is definitely chuckle worthy  I enjoy this awkward introduction to the world of Harry Potter  because you meet the series long minor antagonists first  These are the people you will loathe for seven novels  folks  except right before the end  but we ll get to that in book seven  Read more and add your own commentary at R  J  Spindle Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone by J  K  Rowling was an amazing book  I loved it  It was best in the end because it was when Harry  Ron  and Hermione went into the under ground tunnel  My favorite room they went into was the room of the giant chess game  Poor Ron had to get taken out of the game  But it was to win so he did good  Harry is so lucky he had his friends with him  Other wise he would be dead  In the end it totaly changes  I would have never guessed that it was Quirell instead of Snape  Thank goodness that Dumbledore was there to save him  Stephen Fry s audio version on Audible   just lovely   After all these years  I finally started the series  I absolutely love this series  What a great escape from reality  reread for the umpteenth time but made even better in the beautiful illustrated edition   so fun  so creative  let s play hogwarts all winter long Mesmo sendo maravilhoso  gostaria de mais ilustracoes I loved re reading Harry Potter  and the illustrated edition is absolutely gorgeous  Loved the images  and I thought that they provided particular insight on the books  Does anybody know if they are making any more books in this edition  Because that would be amazing  Christmas  the best time to have a Harry Potter marathon   3 I love it  I couldn t stop reading it until I finished  First time I read it  and god I loved it I still can t really understand why I never asked my parents to buy me this books as a child  but better late than never  I thought that the language used would be a little more basic  but it s quite complex for children  which means that it s also suitable for young adults  like me    The world is so amazing  I really was into it all the time  The characters are fully developed from the start and I m so glad Rowling didn t fall into topics  she really did a great job I can t wait to re watch the movie   The most beautiful book ever  Jim Kay is a genious  It s hard to rate this book lower than 5 stars  I would be lying and it wouldn t be fair  Unfortunately  I didn t grow up with this series and honestly  I was never really into fantasy and that kinda of things  What I missed    This book  oh my    It s just beautiful  I felt absolutely in love with the world  the places and the characters that I want to read more about  It was such a wonderful and magical read  Interesting how  after all this years  it still had such a good effect  I look forward to continue with the rest of the books  Aj po treti krat to malo pre mna caro a bavilo ma to Harry Potter je proste skvely viac v recenzii    I haven t read this book in the longest time and after all these years the story of Harry Potter is as magical as ever   482 points will be rewarded to J K  rowling  for writning the best bookseries in all Nicolas FLamel s life  Looks like I will be reading all of the books and watching all the movies from now on Im reading a Harry Potter book each August after my Birthday  I m going to grow up with Harry Potter  Re read this with my 7 year old and I just love this book   audiobookI m a Potter head   I love the first book     Officially Harry Potter devirginized  Thoughts later  I dont know why i have always postponed and procrastinated on reading it for all this long time     Oh my  When this series first came out  I haven t had my eldest baby just yet  But I eventually started buying them when she was a baby to a young child  Nonetheless  I never started to read them myself until now  Especially after a friend would tell me I need to read them  I had watched the movie since my baby sister and nephew were fans  So as a 37 year old woman  I enjoyed reading Harry Potter  J K  Rowling is a wonderful writer  I m now starting The Chamber of Secrets  I know  I know  I m a late bloomer  Evidently  I do that with everything I do      I remember picking this book out at the library and being happy that it was the first book in a series  I read it with no notice of hype  it was probably fall 1998 and I was in elementary school  and I made it to the chapter of the Mirror of Erised when I stalled  But I decided to renew the book and lo to my surprise  I devoured it and fell completely in love with Harry  Hermione  Hogwarts  and the rest of the wizarding world  I m not really a big Weasley fan   It left me desperate for Chamber of Secrets and even more in love with reading than before  I must admit that I started reading H P  sequels on Book 5  I know it is crazy and impossible to understand  Actually  I was challenged by the characters I haven t had any idea who they are  J K  Rowling always tickles my creative imagination whenever I read her books  It doesn t leave me disappointed  I like how her books keep you attentive to details that a slight disturbance would literally piss me off In all of the H P  series  it s hard to choose the No  1 so I will choose to list all of them in no specific spots  I simply just LOVE it  This is one of the few series I have read multiple times  I think this is probably my 4th go at it  Anyway  the series just doesn t get old for me  Every time I pick it up I get something new out of it  Also  it never fails that I end up laughing or tearing up on certain parts even when I know the part is coming up  When I was having a bad day this week what got me through was thinking about a good cup of tea and curling up with Harry Potter and friends  It s just a great world to get lost in  I m so thankful to Rowling for sharing it with us   My oldest daughter desperately wanted to read this when she was in 1st grade  I was very skeptical that she would understand it  so I read it at the same pace she did  She could retell the story and she re read it several times over the years  This book changed my reading habits completely  After reading HP  my new favorite genre was young adult fiction  It probably was always my favorite genre  but after JK Rowling  I felt  ok  reading YA in public again    Thank you JK Rowling  for opening the world of reading for young readers  and for me  Mi primer libro de Harry Potter  no mi primer contacto  me toco escuchar un resumen del segundo libro en clase de literatura   Tenia yo 14 anos y apenas habia 3 libros  los conseguias en Office Depot por 90 pesos Y de ahi nacio mi obsesion  Adore el primer libro  se me hizo la historia mas bella y emocionante de las que habia leido en  aquella  mi corta vida Ame la sabiduria de Dumbledore  la inteligencia de Hermione  la dureza de Snape y el cinismo de Ron Y en cuanto me lo acabe  en una tarde   sali corriendo al siguiente dia por los otros dos  Call me crazy  but when I first read Harry Potter I was convinced I was a wizard  Like  all I wanted to do was take the train  leave my door open so a stranger will walk in  in the middle of the night and tell me I m a witch  a very powerful one  Hahaha  it was a little creepy but  still a girl can dream right  This book started my childhood  and I ll love it to the end  Rowling is just a wonderful author  to think all those amazing places  words  characters and plot came out of her pretty head  This book was an era I m happy I lived through    Interesting to hear the differences between the wording of the American version Nach bestimmt uber 13 Jahren  als ich es das Letzte Mal gelesen hatte  kann ich nur sagen  wow  all time favourite  Wonderful  This book lives up to its hype  I thoroughly enjoyed reading it  This book is amazing  I love how J K  Rowling described everything  I adored this book through out the entire thing  It was very hooking and I had to force myself to put it down so I could get some sleep  I am looking forward to reading the rest of the series  Go read this book now if you haven t   First time reading this in English It gave me a whole new experience and I of course loved every second of it      Third time through and it s still great   Re Read  There will not be a day when I don t love this book  ALL audiobooks should be read by Stephen Fry  I will always prefer the book to the movie I m actually really mad I didn t read this book sooner so good   Can t wait for the next six    Yay  I did it  I read a whole book in German and it only took me 3 days  D I really don t know why it took me so long to start the Harry Potter series  but better late than never right  I was a pretty light read so I was able to finish it within a day which was nice  I ll be starting the next book soon  I believe the difficulty level increases for each book  but I could be mistaken  We shall see  Hopefully I ll finish the series before the year ends  This book is amazing and is very detailed  snukmaakkha naatuuenetn aimaephduuainhnangely I haven t read any of these books since I bought the 7th one  that is the entire reason as to why I decided to reread the series over the summer  It was so much fun slipping back into this fantasy world I grew up reading  I had forgotten some of the magical things that happened  I also forgot how long it seemed to take for Harry to actually find out that he s a wizard and make his way to Hogwarts  I took my time reading over certain parts that I used to speed through when I was younger  I can t wait to grab Chamber of Secrets off the shelf     How I love Harry Potter  I am rereading the series  It s bringing me back to my childhood     This was the best book I ve ever read  Very creative  I can t wait to red the others   11 26 14  I was worried when I began my  6th    re read of this book  that I wouldn t enjoy it  The last time I had read this was in 2006 or 2007  I have changed so much since then  some types of books that I used to love  I don t anymore  So I wasn t sure if I d enjoy it the same  But I DID  I did enjoy it so very  very much If anything I enjoyed it more than I remember  I can t put into words just how much I love this book  this series  It will forever be my most favorite of all books  of all time I will  always  love Harry Potter   I am never going to like this book   This was my first reaction when I heard about it  Everyone loved the book  they were talking about it and writing about it  there were even shows and comercials about it  Then I had enough and I decided I am not going to hate a book I haven t even read  And the I was hooked   The book is amazing  The world is impresive and well thought  I wanted to become a wizzard at once  I became a fan just like soo many others before me  And to say J K  Rowling is one of the best writers in the world by far  I had  unfortunately and quite stupidly  considered myself a bit too cool to read Harry Potter books until about the time the fifth book came out  and I decided to give it a try  I was amazed and felt like kicking myself  It s too rare that an author produces a work of honestly imaginative and original work  and I had missed out on it for years  The world the author created in this book absolutely delighted me with it s scope and detail  I loved the cleverly named wizarding world and the sense of childlike wonder of it all  Fantastic book  This is not my favorite of the Harry Potter books  but I always love a good reread  It is great to pick up on new details and to go back to where it all began  It is like seeing a friend you haven t met up with in a few years Dec 2014 Thoughts  as always  I love this charming story  While attempting to  read as a writer  this time around  I found it even more charming  Se manages to maintain the idyllic voice of an 11 year old while creating this entire world  The POV is mildly inconsistent  but that is changed on later books   Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone is a great book to start off the series since it has a great plot where Harry Potter s mom and dad had die where he now lives with his uncle and aunt Dursley who have a son Dudley  Harry has been forced to live in a closet under the stairs and is fed very little But now strange things are happening like a snake talking to him and many other things Eventually  not to spoil what happens  he gets taken to the magical place of hogwarts and finds out hes a wizard and this starts his first of amazing adventures  I don t know what s wrong with me  I ve been waiting since the last century to have a kid who is old enough to share the Harry Potter experience  That kid was midway through the second book in the series while my Harry was still riding the train to Hogwarts in a book that was overdue at the library  Maybe it s the fact that I know how everything will turn out  or maybe it s that I discovered The Good Wife  and watched all 100 episodes  this month    whatever the reason  a page of this book was enough to put me to sleep each night  For shame  I knew it  Re reading the series is a great idea  Oohhh  HP will always be in my heart  It s Harry Potter  Need I say more      Very compelling story telling  Characters are well developed   Literally the best series in the world  Everyone who hasn t read them is missing out  Ashamed it took 20 years to read this beautiful book   In a way this book becomes more and more magical every time I read it  August 2015   We decided James and Sarah were old enough to introduce them to the world of Harry Potter on our recent long car trip  We listened to the always fantastic audio book version narrated by Jim Dale  It was so fun and nostalgic  Jim Dale s audio books were the way I was first introduced to Harry    James had been enjoying the Chronicles of Narnia  but when we started getting into this  he was blown away  He gasped  laughed  and shrieked in all the right places  It was so much fun experiencing it with him  I just love it  Always good to re read a classic  I just finished rereading it for the hundredth time and its still amazing  This is book is my life  It brought back so many childhood memories and it warms my heart  Everyone should read this and you d be lying if you say you didn t enjoy it   3 Okay  I m starting to understand all your references now   REREADING ONE OF MY FAVORITE SERIES I like how the book has different stuff  This makes the whole book interesting to read  Loved it even more the second time around   One of the best works in fiction You have got your mother s eyes   Had so much fun re reading this     This is one of the most unforgettable books ill ever read And have to admit the film adaption was also pretty cool Harry potter thinks hes an average 11 year old boy who lives with his mean Aunt and uncle but little does he know hes a wizard Late when he attends Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry he learns so much about it Basically theirs a whole adventure But the ending is just so awesome i mean they graduated like this      Why cant Hogwarts be real  My all time favorite book series  This is a must read for anyone  despite age   IMPRESCINDIBLE     no hay mas que decir I read this book after everybody else  I had seen the movie and hated it  I think the at least the fourth book was out if not the 5th  I think it was about the time the 3rd movie was coming out before I picked up my copy of the Sorcerer s Stone  It read it in 2days  It was fantastic  The world J K  Rowling created is wonderful  My favorite part was Christmas time at Hogwarts  I could see the snow and feel the warmth of the fire  I immediately picked up the second book and read that one in 2 days also  I was hooked from that point   How do you review a book that opened you up to a world of magic that became so beloved and so dear to your heart  that when you read the book  it feels like you are going home  Rowling is a great author  there is so much foreshadowing present in this book for things to come  the characters are loveable and despicable as they need to be  It s an excellent book for a family to share together  parents reading to their children  so they can experience the magic with one another  And isn t that what reading is supposed to be about  Every time I start reading the series  I ask myself where my Hogwarts letter is  I am determined to believe that it must have got lost in the mail I haven t read the series in two years and I wanted to re read the books for quite a while now And I m kind of surprised that every time I m reading the series  I m always laughing at the jokes and crying at the sad parts although I already know what will happen This series never cease to surprise me and I ll be happily continuing the story of the famous trio Harry  Ron and Hermione  Well  let me join the hoards of people worldwide who declare this book  and the rest of this series indeed  to be one of the most remarkable  whimsical and heart warming pieces of literature ever produced  I remember the distinct sensations as I read this book for the first time  Harry s loathing of the Dursleys  shyness on the train  wonderment  anger  love  comradeship  those feelings were all mine  Being drawn into this story was one of the most excellent journeys of my life and J K Rowling  wherever you are  I applaud you       This book brought magic to my childhood  Thank you  JK Rowling I loved it  couldn t put it down  BEAUTIFUL AND MAGICAL  I reread this book over Christmas  I will forever love Harry Potter  and I am so happy I have decided to reread the series  There is so much to learn from Harry Potter and his friends  and nothing can beat escaping into a magical world   the illustrations are amazing  Bolo super sa znovu vratit do Rokfortu  A este k tomu s tymito krasnymi ilustraciami  Teraz mam chut na dvojku  Audiobook  wonderfully read by Jim Dale  The ingenuity of invention never stops coming in this first of the series   Gringotts  Diagon Alley  Hogwarts  Quidditch  but it s the story and characters I remember  not the world building  Listening to Jim Dale reading and  doing  all the characters is simply delightful  Harry is your ordinary boy living with his Aunt and Uncle after his parents die when he is just a baby  He is regular until the owls start dropping off letters for him to go to a wizard school  He gets wisked away on a great adventure with new friends to stop the most powerful dark lord from rising to power again all while just barely learning how to use magic I love this book and I read it over and over  It is a book good for all ages to let you know there is still magic in this world even if it isn t from wand waving   Great story  can t wait to start on book 2  So glad I picked this one up after all these years  I tried watching the film in the early 2000 s and didn t like it  but my sister said recently that I should read the book first  and so I did  and now I can t wait to re watch the first film  It is a children s book  but is still enjoyable for an adult in his second childhood  I have only had time for about 20 pages per sitting  and I thought this might break the continuity but it is very easy to keep coming back to  best book eva    1   2 hello from the other side It was so good to be back  gee whiz that was a fun read  Tanto tiempo desde que lo lei que habia olvidado muchos detalles  No cabe duda de la maravilla que es este libro  Love this book    every single time     Potter fandom here I come After watching all of the film s  I ve finally started reading the series and they re great  I m ready to read the rest  So guys    it happened  I finally picked up Harry Potter  FROM THE BEGINNING  I d read the last book and enjoyed it  so I figured  let s read this and become an official member of the fandom  So I found the book and bought it  IT TOOK ME SIX MONTHS TO ACTUALLY PICK IT UP AND READ  But I did  and now I m angry I didn t do it sooner  Harry is much more sassy than I thought  and I enjoyed it sooo much  So yeah  we re doing this the right way and reading the entire series  starting with book one  Next up  Chamber of Secrets  Reread for  HarryXmasToYou 2014 Amazing  Kept me on my toes  Ahhh   Harry Potter  A very popular book series with a LOT of people  and I am one of those  This book  telling the story of a young boy who finds out he is a Wizard and leaves his terrible home life in order to learn magic at Hogwart s School Of Witchcraft and Wizardry  is just captivating  J K Rowling has put so much thought and effort into the world that she has created  the characters she has invented  and the simple yet enthralling story line  It is of no surprise that this became so well loved and a British classic  if u have never been into reading and suddenly decided to go on about it  then i can assure u that there is no better book then this  like many others this is my first book  and by first i mean after reading it    the hidden thirst for knowing more suddenly became so unstoppable that  now i read at least 2books per week this book is a masterpiece of writing  and every one should read it  though u might not show the same reaction as i did but i can assure u that u won t regret the decision all in all Good Luck   Wow  How did I not read this series for so long  This book was an enchanting blend of humor  magic  personal growth  and friendship   with a dash of mystery thrown in as well  I thoroughly enjoyed getting to know the characters and learning all about this amazing world J K  Rowling has created  It was so easy to lose myself in this book  The ending was full of twists and turns   I thought I had it all figured out and I was so wrong  J K  Rowling weaves a magical tale that I can t wait to return to in the second book  It was interesting because the main topic  story about wizards was interesting  Harry  the main character was characteristic I love this book best in the Harry Potter books becausethere were some informations about the school that Harry is going  there re some magic spells in and also in the movie there re some great actions like they ride the broomsticks and play the game and the best thing was Harry s parents aredead from other great bad wizard and Harry fright with thewizard who killed his parents   I have to admit that I was worried when I started this book  worried that it couldn t possibly live up to all the praise I ve heard for it over the years  and worried that I might be too old to be captured by it Thankfully  I was wrong on both counts  I d even say that I appreciated this story more now than I could ve when I was ten or eleven  It s a remarkable book that can appeal to both me and my eight year old daughter equally  although I m probably not  quite  as keen to dress up as Hermione for Halloween as she is   It s magical  Loved every bit of it     Perfect  Lots going on and full of adventure  One of my favorite books   an excellent and fun read  Si lo confieso hasta ahora no habia leido Harry Potter era una muggle total  me sorprende la gran imaginacion de la autora ha creado un mundo gigante  maravilloso y realmente magico y comenzar mi primera aventura en Hogwarts en este hermoso libro ilustrado fue fantastico  todas las personas amantes de Harry Potter deberian tener esta fabuloso edicion  mientras tanto ire a buscar mi siguiente aventura en Hogwarts Stephen Fry s voice suits the world of HP perfectly And my mind was blown when  You re a wizard  Harry  wasn t a direct quite from the books   Harry  you re a wizard       And by 5 stars I mean 120 stars   Still love it     Even at the age of 18 I really enjoyed reading Harry Potter and the Philosopher s stone  I can t understand why JKRowling had any problems getting this book published  because it is so cleverly plotted  very well written and has the perfect mixture of suspense  action  comedy and magical wonders  The characters are exceptional and unique  the magical world she has created never fails to surprise I m so frustrated that I didn t read it as a child  because I think I would ve liked it then even more  Re read in August 2015  after re reading it 5 times since I first read it in 2011 OH MY GOD  the feels  Wow  JK Rowling really is a genius  I love coming back to this series  Just holding this book feels amazing Also now I realise that I can relate to Hermione and Neville a lot And   I have to admit that Draco is THE shade queen  He s mean  I know  but   And why is everyone hating Slytherin in this book   I m feeling personally attacked since I m a Slytherin myself    Sixth read for the booktube a thon  just amazing AmaZiNggggggg This book is great  Of course  10 5 stars to Mr  Potter I love that every time I reread the HP series  I notice something that I haven t noticed before   It feels so great to be back and reading about the harry potter universe again  This is definitely a 5 star read and I can t wait to read the next one  I loved this book so so so much   I m so happy I started reading this series I can t even tell you   Can t wait to read the rest of the books in this series    I read it once before and read it again when I finally bought all the paperbacks  I must say the excitement I felt is amazing  The books starts great and end greats and you are wrapped up in a world of magic and sorcery  It is not the best book in history but this first book sets the story that will bring me a million smiles on my face  I can see that for sure  Whole review in http   pollymaurovich13 wix com books      It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live  remember that  Albus Dumbledore  Better late than never  Bylo to naprosto uzasny  Co jineho bych od Harryho mohla cekat  ze   Love to revisit this old friend  it s like a comfy pair of old pj s  First Harry Potter book  and I loved it   4 5 5 Stars  I have never been one to be  hip  or  with it   so I m quite late jumping on the Harry Potter bandwagon   but I m sure glad I did  Even being older than the HP target audience  I still really enjoyed it  I also haven t seen the movies  so it s nice not knowing what s going to happen in this series  I only know a couple spoilers   I love this world that J K  Rowling has created  I don t know how many times I ve read this book but I don t stop loving it  Its one of my most favorite books  It just takes me on a magical world  away from realty which is what I really like bout reading  Rowling wrote fantasy but in a completely realistic way because of how harry potter reacts  He is just like an ordinary kid minus the magic  I can t write a complete review beacause it would take me a while and I m too lazy buy this is an amazing book  twilight can never come close  Sorry stepanie mayer   HARRY POTTER by J K  Rowling  The audiobooks are amazing  but not the Jim Dale versions  His voice is bland and has no flavor  kwim  The original  British versions by Stephen Fry are astounding and far surpass anything Jim Dale could spit out  Plus  it s un Americanized  I personally think Scholastic effed up and ruined the books integrity by demanding such differences as THE TITLE of the first book  HARRY POTTER AND THE PHILOSOPHER S STONE  anyone  What the hell is up with this Soccer s Stone crap  Psh  NEXT  This is one of my top ten all time fantasy favorites  Now here I am with egg on my face saying this is the first time to reread this book  But  the good news is that its like finding an unwrapped present in the attic  Its fun all over again Yes this is brilliant work of fiction  great humor  a sense of timing that is fantastic  Misleading the characters about who the true villain is  is great for the young mind to be reminded about assumptions  Powerful because of the lack of adult words  wow all

I am older and have kids  This is my life  my childhood  the air that I breath  This helped me to discover there was a place out there that would take me in and shelter me in my hard times  Hogwarts opened it s doors and the students opened their arms  I would not be the person I am today if not for the Harry Potter books  One of my favourite books of all time This novel centres around Harry

was further from the truth than ever thought possible  Strange behaviour in the cities began to arouse suspicion with the Muggles  Muggles  These are non magic folk  In fact  Petunia and Vernon want Harry to be associated with the Muggles as much as possible  as they believed that this would be the best thing for him  As it turns out  just before Harry s tenth birthday  he begins to receive letters from somebody  he would know sooner had he been given the chance to read it by his Aunt and Uncle  Eventually  Vernon is driven mad by the mad rush of letters coming through every morning  in the hope that one reaches Harry  and he packs the family on a visit to an isolated shed in the sea during a storm  However  a storm is not a match for Hagrid  the Groundskeeper of Hogwarts  Harry soon learns of the true tale behind the death of his parents  and answers behind his strange experiences He soon enrols at Hogwarts where he learns Potions  Defence against the Dark Arts  Transfiguration

something which any other young person could not do  he puts off Voldemort he who shall not be named  whilst nearly killing himself  saves Hogwarts from flattening  saves the Philosopher s Stone and all of this  through courage  persistence  and downright snoopiness A fantastic read for all  and the book  remains so much better than the film  loved it Since it is now  about fifth time i read this book  i think i should get right into it First of all  to all of you who haven t read it yet   i doubt it though    read it  It will change your life  It will shape your life  It will make you smile  It is everything Without Harry  if i saw a book now  i will run as far away as i can from it  But nope  Because of Harry  if i saw a book now  i will go crazy and scream  FREE BOOK FOR ME  SUCKERS   There s much more to it  but i will just go into the review  I will separate the review into three parts  characters plot writing Let s starts with the characters then From the very first few chapters  i knew that soon Harry will become someone like a fictional best friend for me  i could relate to him with the littlest things such as  my hair is also always messy  or i really don t like some of my cousins too etc  Harry  yes  in the later books can be annoying and very VERY moody  cough cough order of the phoenix   and i just loved seeing him so little and innocent in it but most of all  easy to relate to Ron  My little baby Ron  Without him  Harry Potter would not be the same  Ron is the one who always brings humor to the series   he s not the only one  of course   but honestly  yes Ron has his flaws  but how can you not love him  plus  his LOYALTYNow  let s talk about Hermione  HERMIONE  FREAKIN   GRANGER  She s smart  bossy and amazing  has flaws  loyal and a good friend  I will only say  that without Hermione  WE WOULDN T EVEN GET THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS BECAUSE HERMIONE KNEW HOW TO KILL THE DEVIL SNARE  Here you go  Enough said Now the side characters  Hagrid  He s sooooo lovely  3 now Dumbledore    Dumbledore Next we have  the plot Of course  Harry Potter started as a kid book  so obviously we don t need to expect some best plot in the world  but the thing is  that it was entertaining and got us to ask questions about the next book  For example the first time i read Harry Potter  i was really intrigued by the whole Snape and  Why old Voldy wanted to kill Harry in first place   I can t actually remember if the first time i read it  i suspected Quirrel  but i know that every time i go back to it  there s always this little sentence or a moment we didn t notice before  that gives us clues for the next books Now  the writing The writing wasn t anything that made me say  WOW   but it was entertaining and highly enjoyable  making me imagine clear pictures in my mind  Of course  as there was more books  the writing was getting better and better Now     just my favorite quotes It does not duel on dreams  and forget to live   Albus Dumbledore To the well organized mind  death is but next  great adventure  Albus Dumbledore  It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies  but just as much  to stand up to our friends  Albus Dumbledore   duh  and finally     Yer a wizard Harry      Hagrid The audio book is a joy   Harry Potter and the Sorcerer 19s Stone is a ten stars  A plus  all the way  Previously I had heard about Harry Potter and didn 19t even give it much thought  Then a friend told me to read it and after this book I was hooked  a HP fan for life   It is SO so easy to get wrapped up and captivated in the magical world of Hogwarts  At first impression I was APPALLED by the Dursley 19s  After I got more into the series I often wondered why in the world did they keep treating him the way they did KNOWING what he was and was surprised and happy on a few occasions when he does decide to get his revenge on them  But from the moment he boards the Hogwarts Express until he enters the castle halls I was captivated  From the beginning I loved Hermonie 19s intellect  and Fred and George 19s wit  I was also under the impression that Snipe just like everyone thought was the culprit  Boy was I surprised in the end  haven 19t having seen the movie first   I LOVED every bit of it  the characters  the spells  the plot  EVERYTHING  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this book  It was a wonderful introduction  This review is for the Jim Kay illustrated edition of  Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone   and the book is delightful  Kay s detailed and quirky illustrations offer an imaginative and atmospheric visioning of Rowling s world that is more whimsical but also darker than the films  Hogwarts is  by turns  eerily gothic and cosily inviting  all vine wrapped gothic tracery and rook haunted towers  Kay pictures Hagrid s hut made from the inverted hull of a ship  and his scarecrow as a dragon made of rusty garden tools  Diagon Alley covers the bottom half of four pages and is filled with a thousand tiny details  lunatic shop signs  perching owls  mad magical plants  Special sections offer a mock serious looks at the natural history of dragons and trolls  Portraits of the key characters are interspersed throughout  as are small sketches of spiders  wizard chess pieces  other odds and ends  Great fun J K  Rowling cast her spell over me in 1999 with four words  nitwit  blubber  oddment  tweak  The whole Potter phenomenon has been amazing fun  and I ve enjoyed every minute of it I look forward to seeing this artist s vision for the other books in the series  In a small home  in England  on number 4 Privet Drive  lives an ordinary family  free from abnormality and danger  However  this all changes when a young baby is left on their doorstep after the murder of his two beloved parents  Years later  during the very early hours of young Harry Potter s eleventh birthday  an abnormally sized man confronts his ferocious family about the importance of encouraging Harry s unknown abilities by attending a special type of school  This encounter begins Harry s transition from an abused  frightened and normal child to a powerful young wizard  Harry quickly makes friends with two other aspiring young wizards  and together they embark on an investigation to discover a dark mystery that lies in the school  Harry and those around him slowly begin to notice that they are threatened by the impending return of an evil wizard  responsible for the deaths of many witches and wizards in previous years  including Harry s parents  The Philosopher s Stone  is the first book in the well known Harry Potter series and centres the life of a young wizard discovering his newfound abilities  The fantasy is set in England  in one main location  the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry The young and adventurous protagonist  Harry Potter  is forced to live with his Aunt  Uncle and Cousin after the horrific murders of his parents when he is just an infant  Harry is new to the whole concept of the world of magic and somewhat frightened when his professors challenge his knowledge on the subject  His character  as demonstrated in the novel  is obviously very well thought out and designed  Harry displays different emotions and skills throughout the novel  making his existence believable and relatable  Harry s aunt and uncle see Harry as a burden and a bad influence on their son  Dudley  and as a result have treated Harry terribly throughout his childhood  Due to his tough and cruel upbringing  Harry is a very strong willed and resilient individual  which makes him a very likeable character  Harry and his two friends  Hermione and Ron  possess courage and bravery  which assist them through their impending obstacles throughout the novel  The group of friends is very relatable  approachable and also quite a likeable close group of youngsters The author  J K Rowling is to be commended for her extensive writing abilities  which are exhibited through the use of strong language  vocabulary  imagery and symbolism  The story provides an insight into an imaginary world of magic  of which many of us have wished existed  The target audience is ages 7 16  J K Rowling has done an excellent job of designing a story that appeals to most ages  not just the original target audience  She includes aspects of thrill  adventure and wonder  which can be thoroughly enjoyed by people of most ages The Harry Potter novel is an excellent way to escape the real world for elements of excitement  adventure  mystery and fantasy  which are all displayed in J K Rowling s extremely entertaining and gripping novel that takes the audience on a wild adventure that will keep you wanting more  A five star rating shall be awarded for this excellent story  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer 19s Stone  J K Rowling  The book is fiction  The genre is Fantasy Adventure  I chose to read this book because my sister said that it is very good  and that I would really like it  J K Rowling also wrote  The Vacancy  The Cuckoo 19s Calling and Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets and many more that are very interesting  This story takes place in a magic school named Hogwarts  Harry Potter in the main character  as well as Hermione Granger  and Ron Weasley  Harry Potter lived with his aunt and uncle thinking he was a normal person  whose parents died in a car crash  But on his 11th birthday  he finds out what actually happened  and who he actually is  He goes to Hogwarts  and has many great adventures and gets almost killed     This book made me feel very alive because it has times when you just get a shock because of what happens The plot was very exciting and made me want to read the rest very quickly  Most of the characters seemed real excpet for some because they were made by magic  There were some scary bits when Harry Potter almost died  My favourite part of the book was when he finds the invisible cloak  The recommended reading age is about 10 adult  I give this book a ten out of ten  The day I started reading Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone is also the day I first read a Harry Potter book  Apparently I have watched all the movie adaptations and let me just say I m one of those  books are better than movies  type of people  The book  basically  didn t disappoint me  The movie did  just kidding  I like them both but I love the book more  No   love  is an understatement  If only I could turn back time  I would have read the book first rather than watching the movie  It won t help even if I have gotten a hold of Hermione s Time Turner Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone is a perfect book to let you unwind after a dreadful week  Though it is intended for kids  J  K  Rowling proved to us that age doesn t matter  Every page makes you want more  and after I have finished it  I wanted to run into a bookstore and buy myself the next book The movie lacks a lot of things that the book explained to me  There are also the hints that the author has shown to us before the other books have been published  I didn t miss the mention of young Sirius during the first chapter  I also had a hard time in memorizing the names  especially when Harry had sworn he had heard Nicolas Flamel s name  I felt that too  though I m worse at recalling  Throughout the whole book  I could imagine myself as Harry  I suspect people when something s fishy   if only I didn t know about Quirrel because of the movie I might have suspected Snape too  I will like Dumbledore  and miss him at the empty room where the Mirror of Erise was  And so much more  I enjoyed the book as much as kids  and teenagers like me enjoyed it  After finishing this mind blowing  MAGICAL book  I was left with three very important questions  What have I been doing  no  READING my whole life Why the hell was I rereading New Moon when I had the whole Harry Potter series resting in my bookshelf  AND WHERE THE FUCK IS MY OWL            Basic Plot Summary  Harry Potter lives a miserable life with the Dursleys    his horrible aunt and uncle  and the abominable Dudley  His room is a tiny cupboard at the foot of the stairs and he hasn t had a birthday party in eleven years  All this changes when Harry receives a mysterious letter by owl messenger that invites him to Hogwarts  a magical school for witches and wizards  because  you guessed it  Harry s a wizard  At Hogwarts he finds not only friends  broomsticks  and magic around every corner  but danger  Harry will have to uncover a plot and face off with the most evil wizard that has ceased to exist  and the reason why he has no parents                        Quick Thoughts Gred and Forge are hilarious  Everything Dumbledore says is genius  Severus Snape  I do not like this guy  Draco Malfoy  Ditto to him too  I share my name with Ron s little sister  Though mine is for Imogen and her s is for Ginevra     Daniel Radcliffe was so cute when he was young  Rock on  Neville                        Still not convinced to read this book  I was like that too  Oh  how I m regretting those days  Quotes   Now  you two   this year  you behave yourselves  If I get one more owl telling me you ve   you ve blown up a toilet or    Blown up a toilet  We ve never blown up a toilet   Great idea though  thanks  Mum    Nitwit  Blubber  Oddment  Tweak   I hope you re pleased with yourselves  We could have been all killed    or worse  expelled          no  he was being stupid  Potter wasn t such an unusual name  He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry  Come to think of it  he wasn t even sure if his nephew was called Harry   OKAY  NOW TIME FOR BOOK TWO          Sve do 2014  nisam procitala  Kamen  iz razlicitih razloga   knjige iz serijala su bile poprilicno skupe za moj jadni dacki dzep a u biblioteci ih nikad nisam nasla  Medutim  jednog dana sam bila u biblioteci  i potpuno slucajno  trazeci knjige iz drugog serijala nabasala na ove  I pocela sa citanjem Knjiga kao knjiga je fantasticna  Predstavlja zaokruzenu celinu a kraj je opet otvoren i ostavlja pitanja za nastavke  Dz  K  Rouling ima neverovatnu mastu   svet je potpuno kompletan originalan  i bukvalno magican  i znate ono   svako bi zeleo da ide na Hogvorts    Likovi   DA I NE POCINJEM SA LIKOVIMA  Svaki bolji od boljeg  Nema tu kao u drugim serijalima   glavni lik i par sporednih su razvijeni a ostale ko sisa vec potpuno suprotno  Vecini Hari nije cak ni omiljeni  sto se obicno kod popularnih knjiga ne srece  A koliko ja samo volim ove likove  Omiljeni  Pa  od onih koji se u prvom delu pojavljuju   verovatno Hermiona   I Ron  I Fred i Dzordz  I Dzini  Mada svi oni vise sijaju u narednim knjigama   Za mene su likovi srz svake price a ovi su neverovatno razvijeni i veoma ih je lako voleti   3Stil pisanja se neverovatno lako cita da zavrsim s tim inace osdadosmo ovde ceo dan Prvu knjigu doduse  mislim da sam  s obzirom na njenu velicinu  najsporije citala  Nisam sigurna zasto   daleko od toga da mi se nije svidela mada mi je ipak verovatno najmanje omiljena od svih  Wow  this brought back some memories  I haven t read this since it came out   when I was five    This book was an important part of my childhood  I read this as it came out so it felt as if I was sat beside everyone else in the world who was reading it  Never had reading felt so little like a solitary activity that it usually is I think it s amazing how clever J K Rowling was when she weaved in hints of what was happening  I noticed these things as I ve read it before and it was great fun to see the clues the second time round  This is a brilliant book that moves quickly and is written well  There are so many rememberable lines in it  Each of the characters have their own strengths which makes them equal  Harry  while obviously important  is not the  best  and the be all and end all  Those who don t read these books are missing out on a wonderful world and wonderful  real characters  I will get my nieces and nephews to read this even if I have to follow them around and read it to them  Leimos este libro con mi mama en el verano del 2001  ella leia un capitulo en voz alta y yo leia el siguiente   cuando cumpli los cinco anos y quede fascinada  La narrativa es excelente  los dialogos son acorde a las edades de los protagonistas y es muy rapido de leer  Como nene a leyendo el libro  podes reirte de los dialogos  asombrarte con todo lo que ofrece el mundo magico  deporte  varitas magicas y sus propiedades  colegio magico y mascotas exoticas  y apoyar a Harry en su primera batalla contra Voldemort  asesino de sus padres   Aunque sea yo  con cinco anos  no pude entender profundidades de la historia y mensajes de amor  amistad  traicion y demas  Rowling mezcla en cada personaje inocencia  valentia  miedo  curiosidad  arrogancia  Los adultos del libro son sabios  valientes  solidos  comicos  personajes muy bien construidos y leyendo el libro de chico son casi tus idolos  Dumbledore  McGonagall  Hagrid    Releyendo el libro cuando sos mas grande  pasan de ser tus idolos a ser personajes que queres muchisimo pero que cometen errores y tienen defectos como cualquier persona Como adulto  tenes que leer entre lineas para poder entender la profundidad de la historia y dejar los prejuicios de lado  Varias veces escuche adultos decir   No voy a leer Harry Potter porque es un libro para chicos   GRAVE ERROR  NO  NO Y NO  Si sos adulto y tenes ese prejuicio  evidentemente te olvidaste de mantener vivo a tu nino interior y te vas a perder una de las mejores historias jamas contadas Relei la historia siete veces  seis en espanol y una en ingles  y cada vez que la leo entiendo y extraigo muchas ensenanzas mas  Nada mas para decir  excelencia pura   Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone is an excellent story about a boy named Harry Potter  His background is that when he was a baby his parents were killed by Voldemort  the darkest wizard of the age  and that Voldemort attempted to kill Harry  Harry somehow survived and no one knew how  Harry grew up in the house of his muggle relatives  they detested magic and thought that Harry was disgusting and treated him terribly  When Harry turned eleven he received a letter telling him he was accepted to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry  After buying all the necessary things in Diagon Alley  he was ready to head to school where he would finally be away from his relatives  At the train station he met a boy his age named Ron Weasley  They immediately became friends and were put into the house of Gryffindor  While learning about magic  Harry was the only first year in a century to play on the Gryffindor Quidditch team  Harry was the seeker and a very good one at that  However  Harry also had other problems  A professor at the school hated Harry and was sure that he was trying to kill Harry  On Halloween  a troll had somehow gotten into the castle and was in the dungeons  Harry and Ron  knowing that Hermione another Gryffindor was in the bathrooms in the dungeon  went to go save her  They defeated the troll and realized that Snape had gotten his leg bitten by a three headed dog that was guarding something on the third floor  Harry curious about this all decided that he would go down the trap door and stop Snape from stealing whatever was down there  When Harry gets to the end of all the obstacles with the help of Ron and Hermione  he finds out that it is not Snape  Instead it was Professor Quirrell who had been sharing his body with Voldemort without anyone knowing  Harry was able to hold off Quirrell long enough for Dumbledore  the greatest wizard of the age  to come and stop Quirrell  Gryffindor won the house cup after seven years straight of Slytherin winning it  Harry was a hero and was even more famous I liked this book because it is a great adventure about an eleven year old going on an adventure in a whole new world  He is making friends and learning magic while playing a really cool sport  J K  Rowling uses only the perspective of Harry the main character  except for the very beginning of the book where it was Uncle Vernon seeing odd things happening  A great book that I would recommend everyone to read   J K  Rowling s purpose for writing Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone is to entertain readers with a fictional story of a young wizard named Harry  along with his friends Ron and Hermione  going against all odds to overcome the evil that is present in Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry  This novel is written in the third person point of view  so the reader can understand the emotions of most of the characters throughout the story  Towards the very beginning  the narrator s focus is mainly on the thoughts of Vernon Dursley  Harry s uncle  and for the majority of the story  Harry s own thoughts were highlighted  Rowling wrote this novel for an audience who likes mystery and adventure  The idea of sorcery combined with our normal society may attract a certain audience as well One theme of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone is the importance of friendship  In this story  having good friends gets Harry through the ups and downs of an entirely new world with all new people  When Harry lived with his aunt and uncle  every day was glum for him because of the way he was treated and the fact that he really did not have any friends  The mood changes to a much more happy one when he meets his new best friend Ron at the train station  He also meets a girl named Hermione on the train  and even though the three do not hit it off right away  they grow on each other and both Ron and Hermione provide Harry with the love and support that he never had growing up  Friendship is a key factor that gets these three through difficult times such as dealing with the troll in the girl s bathroom  real life wizard s chess  and taking on Voldemort himself  the villain who killed Harry s parents when he was a baby  The strong friendships that Harry develops further distinguishes him from Voldemort  who must gain servant like followers  not true friends This novel is a narration  Rowling writes the story to be a enticing adventure filled with mystery  and also aspects of a young boy s every day life  Although Harry is very famous and powerful in the world of witches and wizards  he is also just a young eleven year old boy with the thoughts of one  He does not view himself as better than everyone else by any means  but rather stays humble  One example of how he is just a regular kid is when he  Ron  and Hermione adventure around the school and accidently come face to face with the three headed dog  Harry does not act fearless  but instead he screams and runs away  After this encounter  Rowling writes   Harry slammed the door shut  and they ran  they almost flew  back down the corridor   Rowling 161   This excerpt demonstrates the style of narration because it shows the characters  reactions to the horrifying event that had just occurred Having watched this movie many times throughout the years  it was really nice to finally read the book  They matched their storylines very well  but the book included even more detail  J K  Rowling did a magnificent job of bringing all of the characters to life  Personally  I loved watching the movie then also reading the book  It adds a new element of imagination whilst reading of the events unfolding  This story  indeed  was as expertly written as so many people claim it to be  and truly one of a kind  so I cannot think of any other novel that relates  I would give this book more than five stars if I could  I would honestly recommend this book to anyone with a high enough reading level  Even if they do not typically like stories based off of far fetched topics such as sorcery  I think anyone could enjoy it  I am not usually one to read stories like this  but yet I still loved it as much as the movie  I would absolutely love to finish off this series  there really isn t much left to say about this series that hasn t already been said  but I will give my two pennies worth anyway  The Harry Potter series starts here  and while this is an engaging and important outing  in my mind it s the weakest of the books  Dont get me wrong  not because there s anything wrong with it  it s just that the series built up and improved so much over time  The best thing about this book  and all the harry potter series  is the impressively detailed world Rowling creates for her characters to live and breathe in  in this first instalment  Harry is a clueless Noob for most of the time  his main purpose to take the place of the reader and stare with goggle eyed wonder at the amazing things to which he is introduced  Harry comes into his own in later books  as Rowling adds layer upon layer to all the characters  but even in this very first instalment  it s abundantly clear that the Wizarding world has been fleshed out thoroughly in her mind for quite some time  Her enthusiasm and love of her subject translates clearly in the sheer richness of the world  and i think with fantasy that s always half the battle  The series would go from strength to strength from here on in  but five starts for this first outing for being the jumping off platform  9 3 4  for so many peoples childhood   Not a whole lot I can say about this book that hasn t already been covered by thousands of other reviews  most probably better than anything I have to say  This book set the stage for a series of excellent books and a deeper dive at the popularization of teenage fantasy and supernatural while struggling with the day to day of school life The story follows the hero s journey of a boy stuck in an oppressive situation that discovers he carries within himself a greater power and a rich legacy that he will ultimately have to bring to bear against a greater evil  The characters are fun  and Rowling does an outstanding job of painting her settings as unique and believable  as believable as a magical university can be    Some of the characters are a little stereotypical  but that doesn t take anything away from them  as they still come to life with their own spins This is an iconic kickoff to a series that every reader should experience and is well worth any time you spend reading it    Re reads are just as fun  Great read again  Been awhile  Nice book for a snow day  Absolutely  loved it  Reading again January 2015 Much better than the movie  9  I am of the generation that grew up with this series  and as such I find I m too closely tied to it to be able to review it properly  So instead  I d like to share the magic of the series from my point of view I did not enjoy reading when I was young  I found it to be boring and I could hardly concentrate on all the words  My imagination was much more colorful  you see  I had a very small attention span that coupled to never give a book a chance  My mother  knowing that it was more an effort of patience than of interest  began to read the first of this series to me at bedtime  Before the first book was finished  I was hooked  I would sneak to find where she stored the book beside my bed and struggle to read the next few pages before she came up to read them to me The truth was  I was not a strong reader  I did not have the concentration  the patience  and thus lacked the experience  By the end of the first book that all changed  In fact  more than just my enjoyment of reading changed  My school work  usually sloppy and often forgotten  improved  My grades rose drastically  I slowly learned to control my own attention span  In fact  I went into hyper attention  When reading there was no one and nothing that could distract me  There was nothing that could pull me from the world created by words on the page  The Harry Potter series was the start of a new me  I grew with him and his friends  I learned as he learned  I became strong and my mind became smart  I even got glasses  which I had never realized had held me back in my studies I learned to love to read  And I cannot imagine where I would be today without this series  I don t want to imagine it  The magic of this book shaped my young mind  And ever since I ve been hooked   Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone by J K  Rowling is a great fantasy book that focuses on a trio of kids that are brought into and brand new world full of magic and danger  Theirs Harry Potter the boy who lived from being cursed with death by a terrible wizard named Voldemort  whose name struck fear in everyone to the point they never say his name  but due to the curse the wizard was vanquished as the spell ricocheted and hit him  this leads to his trademarked scar that everyone in the wizarding world know from the stories about him  Then theirs his best friend Ron Weasley  who he meets at Hogwarts the School that teaches it s students how to use magic and defenses against it  they become quick friends on their way to the school and this leads to the meeting of their other best friend that makes up this trio  Hermione Granger a very smart and hard working girl of Muggle born descent who becomes close friends to the two boys and balances things out as Harry works as the leader  Ron as the right hand man and Hermione the brains They are all first years in the school of Witchcraft and Wizarding and they all create a strong bond and are all put in the same house of the schools four main houses the Griffindor house Though trouble is on the way as Harry is being put into danger from many different circumstances that seem to targeted to be simple accidents  This leads to the trio to investigate a certain teacher that seems to have it out for him  They believe he is after the Sorcerers stone that would provide eternal life  They figure out how to stop him and set out to do so  but this results in a twist for its not the teacher they believed to have tried to steal it  And this results in Harry by himself have to face off against the teacher who is working for Voldemort the and that tried to kill him as a child and killed his parents This book was very entertaining as it was such a fleshed out world full of wizards and witches and magic that leads to amazing possibilities  The characters are complex and each are very fleshed out showing their views and ideas and a range of emotions It exceeded my expectations and I now understand how come their are movies made from the books I don t think the author should do anything different she does a great job and amazingly well written book I highly recommend this book to others who want to read a book showing such amazing imagination and great characters that show how strong the bond of friendship in dark times I recommend this book to everyone  but young teens and older ones will love it either way from how great it is After reading this I ll read the second book to see what happens and see how the Magical Trio do in these books and what happens   Reread this book just last year in order to get my best friend to read it as well  So far  so good  We re on the fourth book now  D This is one series I could go back to time and time again to read over and over again the way my father rereads his favourite Steven King novel  The Stand   My BFF hadn t read it at all because the first book had been fairly slow for her and she had trouble getting into it  Now that I m reading the series with her  she s giving it a more thorough try and managed to get through the first book  I m so proud of her lol I personally love this series and although the first book is fairly slow  I would assume most first books are because it builds up the world  the characters  the backbone and foundation of the rest of the story  as soon as Harry gets to Hogwarts  everything starts to pick up and you can t wait to get back   As the great J K Rowling has said   Whether you come back by page or by the big screen  Hogwarts will always be there to welcome you home    It s entirely true  Hogwarts will always be home  3 Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s StoneHarry Potter and the Sorcerer s stone is the first of the Harry Potter series written by J K  Rowling  It is centered by a young man by the name of Harry Potter  Harry is a young orphaned boy raised by his uncle and seems to be an outcast by there actual son  Harry hates his uncle and eventually gets some extraordinary news  That news is that he is a wizard  Harry s life changes when he meets his friends on the way to his new fascinating school where only special wizards go  There aboard the train he meets his best friends throughout the series   This is my first Harry Potter book and it is the first one in the series so Harry Potter is still a mystery after one book  However  from this one book we can see that Harry Potter is a young curios boy who has a large a large amount of courage and he is also very smart and tactical in challenges that may seem to be harder for most young boys and adults  Because Harry Potter is so young it is hard to fully understand what makes him who he is and like most series it s hard to under stand a character in just one book because the author is not going to pour every once of knowledge we need to know about his or her main character in the story because then there would not be a series  From the first book Harry Potter in the Sorcerer s stone we can conclude that Harry Potter is smart  cunning   able to make friends  and is able to take on challenges normal people can t  With further reading of the series I will fully understand who Harry Potter is  For book it is highly addicting I recommend this book for anyone who wants a wacky read but also a very serious book  What ca I say abut Harry potter and the sorcerers stone   I love it very much  I have read this book 11 times and will re read it again and again  It s good for all ages and if I ever had children I would read it to them to get them into reading  I even tell my nieces and nephews to read these I don t get why Christians complain about these series  Ohhhh witches and wizards  burn them    oh brother is what I say  And trust me I ve read darker fiction So I give this book 5 magical wands out of 5 no puedo creer que haya esperado tanto tiempo por leerlos  son increibles   This book deserves more than 5 stars and If I could I would give it way more  This is one of the best books that I have ever read and each time I reread it  it feels as If I am reading it for for the first time  This book is for everyone and I am sure everyone will enjoy it  It is very exciting and suspensful  Trust me once you start reading it  you just can t put it down  The characters are very real and developped  They have flaws and I was able to relate to some of them This book proves that friendship is the most important thing in the world This book is magical  Rowling succeeded in creating a whole new world  I wish from the bottom of my heart that Hogwarts will be created in the real world  My favourite quotes   Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself    There are some things you can t share without ending up liking each other  and knocking out a twelve foot mountain troll is one of them    Your mother died to save you  If there is one thing Voldemort cannot understand  it is love  Love as powerful as your mother s for you leaves it s own mark  To have been loved so deeply  even though the person who loved us is gone  will give us some protection forever   I will never give this book less than five stars  it is perfectly perfect   As the start of a series the first book is always the most important  It needs to draw the audience in within the first few lines  Rowling has managed to do so  and so much more  Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone is a book about a lonely boy  orphaned at a young age  living with relatives that don t seem to want much to do with him  And then it all changes when Harry is accepted into Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry  a life changing school where Harry will find true friendship  love and acceptance while also facing an old foe that had been previously unknown as well as new adversaries  This book is full of twist and turns that are so subtle you don t realize they re there until Rowling wants you too  This book has mystery  intrigue  friendship  acceptance and bravery all entwined so completely it will change how you see things   This book  and series  will stick with you through the ages  Rowling s writing is compelling  making this book a true page turner  one you will not want to put down until the very end  This is a book that is great for all ages  young  new readers just starting out  and adults wishing for a good read  Personalities of all type will enjoy Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone immensely   A 11 ans  le petit Harry vit dans un placard a balais sous l escalier de la maison de son oncle

action ne reste pas sans consequence Et c est juste le debut de l histoire     Actual rating  4 5 starsThis book was so damn amazing  This was my very first time reading this series  and I still have the rest of the books to get through  but it was definitely a very satisfying experience  especially at Christmas  I can completely understand the love around this story  and I wish I had enjoyed it while I was a child  I remember picking it up but not getting through with it   now  however  I enjoyed every second of it Looking forward to continue on with the series next year     Revisiting Harry Potter  1  Reviewing the first book that found its way into my heart is difficult  How do you do it justice  The task of reviewing it aside  it was a pleasure to revisit such an essential part of my childhood  I found to my surprise  that as an adult  the simple themes of love and friendship have somehow taken on an even greater significance to me  The whole  you were saved by love  thing used to frustrate me  especially as a teenager   It seemed like a corny cop out back then  a sappy deus ex machina of sorts  Now it seems like the backbone of the whole series Reading as an adult also means noticing the gaping plot holes  but I didn t mind ignoring those for the most part  I would also like to add that the prose in  The Philosopher s Stone  is far better than I had expected As much as I like getting some deeper perspective on the book  I do miss the visceral thrill of that initial childhood experience  Hagrid bursting into the cabin on a stormy night to deliver Harry s letter  the trio taking on the troll in the bathroom  the aching melancholy of Harry gazing into the Mirror of Erised  the hooded figure drinking unicorn s blood  Ron s heroic sacrifice during the giant chess game  there are so many moments that made me feel as though the book itself was as magic as the world it described  I had read a good deal at that age  but I simply wasn t prepared for something like this  Revisiting these well worn moments are comforting  but not always engaging  and I would occasionally skim a few pages here and there out of boredom  Overall though  this was a much needed literary homecoming  Nie wiem  co napisac o ponadczasowej fenomenalnej powiesci J K Rowling  poniewaz ciezko opisac jest magie tej ksiazki  Tak   ta powiesc jest oczarowujaca  trudno sie od niej

calego serca POLECAM  A dear cousin of mine lent me the first in the series and swore that I would enjoy it  though I protested and just KNEW I was wasting my time  By page 15 or 20 I was hooked and by page 100 I was placing an order for all of the books available at the time  Afterwards  I was one of the millions of dedicated fans chewing my fingernails to the bone  pacing the floors and waiting impatiently for the next installment  I would constantly check publishing news sources for information pertaining to release dates and followed the trail of information being released in teasing trickling tidbits greedily and by the time the new hardback came out I was practically foaming at the mouth  I pre ordered as soon as it was possible to do so  paying extra freight expenses to have my book in my hand the absolute second it was humanly possible  Mind you  I was 40 years old when all of this was going on  I was not some teen and part of the original target demographic group  But  I think that is what the cultural phenomenon surrounding these wonderful  SENSATIONAL novels is all about in the first place  The massive appeal hits home with everyone  From what I have read in the past  this series was originally intended for children and teens  but they hold a special kind of magical appeal that is highly addictive to everyone  By the time the dust settled  I read every book at least thrice  owning copies in Hardback and Paperback and have also listed to and own the entire series in Audiotape and DVD  I share my love of literature with a beloved Aunt  now deceased  in her latter years she had gone legally blind and had to finish the last 3 books in audiotape  One of my fondest and most precious memories of her there  near the end   was a weekend when she and I spent a Saturday and Sunday watching the entire Harry Potter DVD Movie series from beginning to end  I was nearing 50 and she was 83 there are no age requirements for Harry Potter  the only requirement is a vivid imagination  an open mind and the willingness to explore new worlds and or boundaries GOD BLESS YOU  J K  Rowling for this gift you have bestowed upon us  The beginning of a series very near and dear to my heart  The amount of creativity and innovation needed to not only create a magical school  but an ENTIRE wizarding world just blows me away  The story begins with the death of Lily and James Potter at the hands of dark wizard  Voldemort  Their baby  Harry  survived with only a small scar on his forehead  When Voldemort attempted to kill Harry  something strange happened   the spell rebounded and the wizarding world celebrates his downfall  After 11 terrible years of living with his muggle  non magic  aunt  uncle  and spoiled cousin  Harry is found and told that he is a wizard and that it is time for him to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry  The reader is just as new and unfamiliar with this new world as Harry is  discovering the norms and customs as he goes  The book is filled with new friends  questionable professors  a new sport  quidditch   trolls  wands  moving pictures  wizards chess  and many other new and exciting plot elements  What I like best about this book is that it is enjoyable for readers of all ages  And personally  series tend to be my favorites because I know exactly what to pick up next  This series in particular does an excellent job of weaving all of the installments together rather than building on top of each other  I personally think Harry himself is a brave young soul  and the book has so many thoughtful plots with lots of new and exiting twists and turns but put in very clever ways  I gave Harry Potter two big thumbs up and a 5 star rating because the story is original but still with a classic story line with heroes and villains but disguised them so well  I got so lost in the book  in a good way  I lost track of time and ended up reading an hour to an hour and a half a night  There were no down times where I thought  oh I don t like how she wrote that  or   I don t like how she put it that way  J K  Rowling did an AMAZING job on this book and I hope she has a million more series like the classic Harry Potter  I love how when Harry was at the zoo  reptilian section  and when the glass disappeared she used so much detail on how is out of thin air vanished  I watched the movie first so the book was a little spoiled but I almost completely forgot except for when Hermione introduced herself to Ron and Harry in the train looking for Neville s toad   that was one of my favorite lines   Also one of the most funny parts for me in the book was  when the sorting hat barely touched Draco Malfoy s head it practically screamed SLYTHERIN  When I said there wasn t a part in Harry Potter I didn t like  well the very gloomy part where Harry keeps getting in trouble I didn t like it OR dislike it I was in between  But some of my favorite parts were when Harry caught the snitch or the really funny Hermione  Ron and Hagrid moments  Overall I loved the first book and for sure I will read the sequel and J K  Rowling is very original and creative   A boy who doesn t know who he is and is introduced to a whole new world he didn t know existed  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone by J K  Rowling is a classic  This book is very good and written very well  The plot is as good as the actually writing  J K Rowling can make you feel like you are in a different world very easily   Harry Potter is taken place in London and is a fantasy  It is written in 3rd person and narrates the main character  Harry Potter  life  This book is very creative and the plot is very elaborate  It doesn t slow down  Each page makes you want to turn it and read more  You can t get enough  Harry grows up with a horrible family who neglects him  The Dursleys don t let him go Hogwarts at first  That s when Hagrid comes into play  He has been there for Harry without Harry even knowing  Harry is thrown into this world of wizards and meets his best friends on the way to Hogwarts  Hermione and Ron  They help him through everything  Including the right friends   The climax of the book was when Harry  Ron and Hermione try and get the Sorcerer s stone before Voldemort does  While trying to do that they get split up and Harry is alone with Professor Quirrell who is happens to have Voldemort at the back of his head  When Harry is looking at the mirror Erised it shows what he desires the most and that is the sorcerer s stone but he discovers that he already has it  He lies to Quirrell when he asks what he sees  Than Voldemort tells Quirrell to let him be face to face with Harry Potter to kill him  Harry ends up burning both of them and they die  Harry wakes up in a hospital with the stone  Once the school year is over he goes back to London to live with the Dursleys  This book I feel like is a good fit for people who like a page turner and a classic  This book was very enjoyable and I was done with it quickly  I would look forward to read it  The plot was very good and all the detail that was put in the book was what made it so good  I liked it because it was different to other fantasy books  It was written with patience and was not rushed   I would recommend this book to anyone who hasn t already read it  This book makes you feel like you are in a different place and that you are watching over Harry  The way the book is written is the dialect is precise to different people  You can hear the people saying their part  She made the book come alive  I specially liked the different characters  The different traits they had and their behavior  Each person had their place in the book as well as in Harry s brain  People like Snape and Ron  This book was very good and I m going to finish the series  It is a page turner and action packed  Anyone should read this book  It might be very long but it is interesting and never bores you  I would read this over and over again  It is on my list of favorite books  Anyone who likes the genre fantasy and action  If you want to be a part of another world read this book  If you want to be someone for a while read this  If you want to read a great novel that amazes more and more each time you read it  read this book    Hagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect blazing in his eyes  but Harry  instead of feeling pleased and proud felt quite sure there had been a horrible mistake  A wizard  Him  How could he possibly be  He d spent his entire life being clouted by Dudley  and bullied by Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon   57  The book Harry Potter and the sorcerer s stone by J  K  Rowling is probably one of the greatest fantasy books of all time and is also the winner of the Nestle Smarties Book Prize award  This book is about a boy who is very mistreated by the relatives who adopted him when his parents were mysteriously murdered  One day he is visited by Hagrid who tells him the truth about magic  the fact that wizards are real  and that he was registered into the school of magic  While Harry is at Hogwarts  there is news that someone had attempted to see the sorcerer s stone  a stone that can make its user immortal  Knowing that there is danger  Harry and his new friends set out to discover the truth about the sorcerer s stone and to discover the culprit of the attempted theft The book is rich with many great figurative language and has an amazing plotline  This is a must read book that magically combines suspense and mystery  This book will be enjoyed by any type of reader  one mesmerized by magic or one excited by thrilling adventures  I re read this after Clare finished it  It was just as amazing as I remembered it  Brilliant  magical  well written  Dumbledore for president  I loved getting back into this series  It s been 16 years since I first picked up Harry potter  We read it in fifth grade before the religious zealots got it banned from schools  It was the most life changing experience I have ever had  The impact this book has had on me over the years is enormous  I know I m not the only one either  The book was great  I think  though  that I d have to give it more of a 4 75 rating  My judgment could be clouded by how great the other books are in the series though  The only real negative thing I noticed  and I was surprised by this  was how perceptive Harry was in this book  And I mean perceptive in a bad way  Like  how would an 11 year know to put those clues together  I just felt like there were some conclusions that he jumped to that seemed a but unrealistic  Yes  I know we re talking about a book about magic  I know it s not real  but still On a good note  I had forgotten how sassy Harry is  I don t think the sass is played up nearly as much in the movies   Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone is the first novel of the insanely popular Harry Potter series  The book begins with Harry Potter  a boy whose parents were tragically killed  and his life at his aunt and uncle s house  the Dursley residence  When strange occurrences start happening the Dursley s become suspicious of Harry  Potter soon finds out that he is a wizard and that he has been accepted to Hogwarts  a school for witchcraft and wizardry  In his first year at Hogwarts  Harry befriends two other kids Hermione and Ron  At Hogwarts terrible things begin to happen  and Harry begins to learn the secrets of the magic world  He learns about  He who shall not be named   a dark wizard who used his powers as evil and murdered many wizards and muggles on his attempt at a rise to power  Potter also learns that Harry was the only person to ever face  He who shall not be named  and to live to tell the story  it happened when Harry was a baby and his parents were killed in the incident  There is a specific professor at the school that is weirdly suspicious  He happens to always be around when bad things begin to happen  this professor is professor Quirrell  In the last scenes of the book  Potter is seen fighting Professor Quirrell  who also shares his body with Lord Voldemort  He who shall not be named   Voldemort takes over Quirrell s body in search for the sorcerer s stone  a stone that gives people the power of eternal life  Potter defeats Quirrell but Voldemort s soul releases from his body and escapes   What can I say  This book blew my socks off  it ticked all the boxes  orphan boy  nasty step father and mother  boogan step brother and no one to save our hero from his ill deserved fate  Harry accepts his lot like the nice boy he is and it would seem there is no one to save him  But history will not let Harry alone  family lineage takes life by the scruff of its scrawny neck and gives it a good shake in the form of a big hairy thing named Rubeus Hadrid  or Rhubarb for short  This plump ball of fur  aptly riding a Harley Fatboy motor bike with rocket power lifters  takes the place of John Wayne s Seven Cavalry and give bad ol Uncle Vernon a proverbial drubbing  Rhubarb  like a noble knight of old  rescues Harry and takes him on an aerial charge that would leave Marty McFlea of Back to the Future  green with envy  We must not forget Dudley Dogood  Harry s stepbrother and icon for everything wrong in a human being  I secretly harbored the hope Hadrid would take him on a test flight of his Harley and do a German Stuka dive bomber dive into the nearest volcano  Mount Etna in Sicily would suffice  Dudley s scream would drown out even Etna s roar  This classic s first chapter alone set it aside and showed me J K Rowling was a literary force to be reckoned with  The rest of the plot is classic fairy story  Harry meets his best friends  Ron and that girl who refuses to shut up and the real plot hasn t started yet  strange school in the middle of nowhere  even weirder teachers who must have been escapees from freak show or even worse  my primary school  down to the last chimney pot and swishing cloaks  Lord Voldermort  Harry s deadly enemy and killer of his parents  is almost overkill as there are so many fascinating characters at every nock and cranny who pops up like proverbial cook coos out a clock Rawlings must have got her inspiration by been looking over her shoulder and seeing my boyhood  That s why this book works so well for me  5 stars for Gryffindor  This novel marks the beginning of Harry Potter and his journey to defeat the dark forces that plague his magical world  His story begins in a cupboard under the stairs of his Uncle Vernon s and Aunt Petunia s house  who took custody of him after his parents passed away  Harry had grown up believing that they had died in a car crash and he had escaped with a mere lightning shaped scar on his forehead  However  on his 11th birthday  he discovers that he comes from something much greater than he ever could imagine  A very large man who goes by the name of Hagrid appears and lets Harry know that he is in fact a wizard  which adds up to explain the mysterious happenings that Harry could not quite figure out  After Harry is removed from his evil Aunt and Uncle s possession he is transported into the magical wizarding world where he finds that he is actually famous as  The Boy Who Lived  and defeated the most evil of dark lords when he was only a baby  The same dark lord who actually caused the death of his parents  In this amazing  new world Harry meets those who will become his lifelong best friends and has an incredible first year at his school  Hogwarts  defeating beasts and destroying the evil forces  upholding his title as the ever powerful  Boy Who Lived   I love these stories  as they were a huge part of my childhood and the Harry Potter series was the first full series I had ever read  I would love to provide at least the first three books in my fourth grade classroom because I think that there are important lessons and morals throughout these books which are invaluable to young children still working their way through their own friend groups   Nooruddin AlabdallaWaldorf   Hour 7ELA 1123 November 2015Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone ReviewJ K  Rowling conveys Harry Potter as mysterious  by showing how when he introduced himself as harry they identified him as the boy who lived  In the beginning harry was with Rubeus Hagrid so he can get his first wand and Harry did know he had had secret powers to unlock  When  Harry took the wand  He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers    65   the reader sees that harry has a long journey ahead of him  This shows how harry came to be in his future mature and wise  This shows how the audience got hooked onto the book because it was full of mystery and excitement  Another place where the reader sees mystery is when Harry was with Dursley s in the beginning while they were at the zoo  When  Piers and Dudley are looking at the snake through the glass when suddenly the glass vanishes    20  Rowling reveals how harry came to be when he was growing up and having relationships with some people who he disliked and people who he liked   This book is about an eleven year old boy named Harry  who lives a very unfortunate  and lonely life  He has lived with his aunt and uncle ever since he was a baby  and they have always treated him terribly  Everything turns around when a giant named Hagrid tells him that he is a wizard and that he will soon be attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry  He also learns that in the wizarding world he is a hero because when he was an infant the evil Lord Voldemort killed his parents and tried to kill him  but somehow Harry lived  When he gets to school he becomes friends with Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger  and they set out to solve mysteries that are going on around the school  One particular instance leads them to gigantic three headed dog that is guarding something in a dungeon in the school  They figure out the thing its guarding is the Sorcerer s Stone  so they sneak past the dogs and go into the dungeon  Here they are faced with many obstacles that they have to overcome  When they finally make it past the obstacles  Harry goes on to battle the professor who is trying to steal the stone  He finds out that the professor is disguised as Lord Voldemort  and Harry is able to overcome him and save the lives of many in the wizarding world  From the beginning of the book  you are very attracted to Harry s character because of the hardships that he is experiencing  Everything that he is going through is very believable because it is stuff that children everywhere have to deal with  This offered so many elements that make an amazing fantasy novel   1  Identifying the appropriate genre  Modern Fantasy Science Fiction2  Review Summary  Harry Potter has never been the star of a Quidditch team  scoring points while riding a broom far above the ground  He knows no spells  has never helped to hatch a dragon  and has never worn a cloak of invisibility  All he knows is a miserable life with the Dursleys  his horrible aunt and uncle  and their abominable son  Dudley   a great big swollen spoiled bully  Harry s room is a tiny closet at the foot of the stairs  and he hasn t had a birthday party in eleven years  But all that is about to change when a mysterious letter arrives by owl messenger  a letter with an invitation to an incredible place that Harry   and anyone who reads about him   will find unforgettable 3  Rating  5 Stars4  Writing Trait  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone includes many writing traits  a  Ideas  The story has interesting details for young readers and these

book report or do a project about this book if they are reading it independently  Students could analyze one of the many characters and take their point of view for a project  This book could also be read aloud to younger elementary school students  This book incorporates themes such as hope  success  survival and friendship and students could analyze the characters and these themes as the story is read aloud  I read this when I was little and it was absolutely one of my favorite books  The newly released illustration version is beautiful and would be a fun picture book to show the students as it is read aloud  6  Interest Level  3 87  Reading Level  880L  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone is a very suspenseful and adventurous Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone is about the mystery of when Harry s mom and dad  passed away from an attack from the evil Lord Voldemort   When Harry receives a letter from Hogwarts Magical School  While at Hogwarts he meets fellow friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger and arch nemesis Draco Malfoy  All is not safe at Hogwarts Professor Qurill turns out to be LORD VOLDEMORT  Voldemort is trying to kill Harry with his bare hands  Also  Harry shows pure nerve and outstanding courage and Harry meets the potions teacher Snape  Harry thinks that Snape wants to steal the stone for himself  No  Voldemort only wants the stone so that he can destroy Harry and the stone together  So that voldemort can escape hogwarts on time I connected with the character Harry Potter because his whole backstory is wonderful because it is talking about family and his mom and dad s death I would give this book a thumbs up because it is intriguing and exciting  good reads typer silas callison  I first read this book more than a decade ago  when the movie came out  I thought the book was OK but didn t think it was that fantastic  I wasn t much into children s and YA fiction at that time  Also  I think I was annoyed that people were talking about Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings in the same breath and felt indignant on the latter s behalf  Now that I read a lot more YA  I found much to like in my re reading of the first of the Harry Potter series First of all  the characterisations  Sure  many of them are stock characters  the arrogant bully  the bully s mindless minions  the brainy goody two shoes  the bumbling but loyal friend  but I like the way Rowling puts them all together  I especially like the dynamics of the friendships of the main cast  First year Hogwarts students Ron and Harry become friends almost immediately  both being misfits in that they are poor  or rather  Harry was  so he understands Ron  and have much to live up to in their illustrious family members  But Ron knows enough of magic and Hogwarts from his older brothers to provide the reader  via the conduit of Harry  with a lot of the explanations necessary to understand Rowling s world   thus saving Rowling from having to do countless expositions  Hermione is another misfit  and I like it that Rowling starts her off as being ostracised by Harry and the others  being an irritating  bossy know it all  but ends up as part of Harry s inner circle Hagrid  the Hogwarts gamekeeper and the one who prepares Harry for Hogwarts  is a simple minded and eccentric character  I wonder if he started off in Rowling s mind as a plot device  but grew to have a stature of his own as the novel got written  Being rather absent minded and unorthodox  it is natural that he neglects to tell Harry a great many things  For example  he tells Harry to take the 11am train from London King s Cross  but neglects to explain how in the world to find the mysterious Platform 9 3 4  Such instances allow Rowling to let the reader experience the wonders of the magical world first hand through Harry s eyes  rather than spoil it through prior explanation The story is not complex   that is left to the later novels  I think  In this first book  the plot is fairly simple  with the dark force  represented by Voldemort  trying to steal something of importance from Hogwarts  and it falls to Harry and his friends to foil the evil plan  Much of this first book is devoted to developing the world of wizardry and Hogwarts  so it is good that the plot is kept simple while the world building is being done  That is not to say that the novel isn t exciting  Indeed  there are a number of page turning moments  and the straightforward but engaging language makes it even easier for the reader to get engrossed in the book  Speaking of language  there is a great deal of humour in it as well  pitched at different levels  straightforward non sequitur type of jokes for the younger reader and clever puns for the more mature ones  All in all  very well written to suit the target audience   and it is an added bonus that it appeals to adults too  Definitely going to read more of the series  view spoiler  There are some who say Hermione should have ended up with Harry  not Ron  But I can see that even from the first book  Rowling is setting Hermoine and Ron up as a couple  He accidentally offends her  feels embarrassed with her  is paired with her for lab lessons  etc   whereas Harry is not shown to have any special chemistry with Hermione at all  beyond pure friendship  There s lots of foreshadowing in this first book  not just with the love interest but with the other characters as well  Looking forward to seeing how it all plays out in the subsequent novels   hide spoiler   You probably don t even need a review  Why would you  You definitely have heard about it  if you haven t  then I welcome you to Planet Earth random lost alien reading my opinions   Or you probably have watched the movie   in which case I ask you to read the book  Perhaps you probably have already read the book   in which case I ask you you to read it again Why are people even trying to compare this to Twilight  I mean Twilight is basically  Edward  I love you    Repeat dialogue 50 100 times  add words like vampire and  BOOM  you re done   that s what I think know Stephenie Meyer did anyway I judged this book once upon a time  The Harry Potter series lay complete in the library next to our house and I never bothered to even look at it  I was maybe 10 or 11 years old  immature  not that I m very mature now  and I thought badly of 3 things at that time 1  Cricket2  Harry Potter  owing to the fact that I had hated the movies 3  Oreos  don t even ask And I was proved wrong  Thankfully  It was one morning that I tentatively picked up Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone  A few hours later   Why hadn t I trusted the billion people who had said it was amazing  This was the first book I fangirled about  Go ahead and do the same   I remember seeing hearing about Harry Potter for the first time in 1st 2nd grade  We were due for out quarterly book fair at my catholic school  We always watched the short videos that came before traveling down the hall to the beloved book fair  The videos always talked about the books that would be there  New  Older  And all of a sudden  pops up   now introducing the new story of the boy who lived  Harry Potter is thought to be a normal boy until he receives a letter from       And I was so excited to read this  I bought my very first copy of  The Sorcerers Stone  and I fell madly in love with this magical read  I truly believe the world if books would be completely different  had J K  Not scribbled down ideas on a napkin in a local diner  Five stars obviously  And the fact that someone rated it just 1    goes to show that trolls exist EVERYWHERE  Even in my favorite app  Losers  There are actually people   who download goodreads JUST to give books one star just cause  It s maddening  Anyways  a stone  Muggles  Wands  Hogwarts  Spiders  Chess  I could go on but if you haven t read Harry Potter yet  I don t know where you ve been all this time   Harry Potter and the sorcerer s stone is an all time classic and one of the best books in our generation  The book starts out on the night the Antagonist   Voldemort  tries to kills the main characters parents  Voldemort is able to go through the parents with his dark magic However  something goes wrong during that night  Despite Harry s parents being murdered  Voldemort is unable to hurt Harry and Is forced to be put in hiding  Through out the book Harry is seen as a hero when coming to Hogwarts  He makes friends along the way with different personalities and that is what makes this book unique  J K Rowling is able to create a friendship many of us can relate to and connect when something goes wrong in the story  If you love sports Rowling also creates a new sport called quidditch that Harry has a talent from his father  What also makes this story great is the clues given in this book and future books to come  Each book seems to make you more and more willing to go to the book store and buy the next one in the series  and it all started with this  I encourage anyone to read this book as it can relate to anyone despite your background  Because of this I would give the book a Five out of Five  Meine Gedanken Mister Potter  Unsere neue     Beruhmtheit  Ich liebe die Harry Potter Reihe  wie wohl fast die ganze Welt auch Doch obwohl man die Geschichte in und auswendig kennt ist es jedes mal wieder ein absolutes Lesevergnugen Ich tauche so gerne in die Welt von Harry und seinen Freunden ein und die Geschichten sind so gut geschrieben  dass man fast nicht glauben kann  dass diese  nicht echt  sind Albus Dumbledore   Es ist nicht gut  wenn wir nur unseren Traumen nachhangen und vergessen zu leben  Diese  Schmuckausgabe  ist wohl das schonste Buch aller Harry Potter Bucher  Jim Kay ist ein grossartiger Kunstler und hat die Geschichte fabelhaft in Bild umgesetzt  Seitenweise habe ich mir nur die Bilder angesehen  diese auf mich wirken lassen und war begeistert  Er hat fantastische Arbeit geleistet  Albus Dumbledore   Es verlangt einiges an Mut  sich seinen Feinden entgegenzustellen  doch genauso viel  den eigenen Freunden in den Weg zu treten  FazitHarry Potter kann man immer lesen  Egal wann  egal wo  J K Rowling schafft es ab der ersten Seite an  die Leser in die Welt von Hogwarts hineinzuversetzen    Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone   by J K  Rowling  is about a boy named Harry  Harry has been told all 10 years of his life that he is a very unremarkable person  So  it comes as a surprise to him when he begins to receive mysterious letters from a strange school just before his 11th birthday  He discovers that he is indeed very remarkable and is very well known in the wizarding world  In fact  Harry quickly finds out that he himself is a wizard  He agrees to attend a school called Hogwarts and it is there that he makes many new friends  There is trouble brewing at the school  however  Harry will need the help of his new friends to discover the secret behind the Sorcerer s Stone Discussion Questions  Why was Hermione acting so superior to everyone else at the beginning of the book  Is it fair that Harry has to live with the Dursleys  Why couldn t Harry just stay at Hogwarts during Summer vacation instead of returning to live with his Aunt and Uncle  Was Professor Snape really acting suspicious  Or were the kids simply determined to see him as the villain because of his attitude and appearance  What do you think would have happened to Harry if he hadn t ever been accepted into Hogwarts   Why do you think the Dursley s agreed to adopt Harry Rowling  J   2013   Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone  15th Anniversary ed    Scholastic  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone is the first book of The Harry Potter series written by JK Rowling  The book contains a fascinating story of a young boy  He is son of James and lilly Potter who were killed by the dark wizard lord Voldemort and was left with his uncle and aunt by the management of Hogwarts School of witchcraft  The uncle and aunt of him ill treated him like a servant but when he turned twelve there was a big twist in his life as he was invited by the Hogwarts school as a student and was free from his bad life  This started with a new life foe him when he came to know about the fact that he was really very famous in the magic world and the people there had a sort of respect for him  He was rich but came to know only after having a look at the bank account of his at the wizard bank  He made friends there with Ron on the train and was given the place of a seeker at inter house broom flying game and becomes a friend with Hermoine when he saves her from a monster which entered Hogwarts due to some security issues  In the climax he comes to know about the fact that his teacher of defence against dark magic was himself with Dark Wizard Voldemort and was there just to get the philosopher s stone which will lead to revival of Voldemort and over the he has a fight with the Antagonist  the defence against dark arts teacher and wins but is hit with the power of Volemort and gets unconscious  He wakes up at the hospital bed where he is visited by Professor Dumbledore  The story resolves when the courage and braveness of Harry and his friens was rewarded with points and their House was given the best House title  The book is really fun to read and takes a person fully into a world of fantasy  The person gets lost in the book and wants to read the next book of the series  The book is one of the best books in the genre of Fantasy  The Author has used a lot of imagery to describe about the place  The book is full with flashbacks about the parents of Harry Potter is worth read once   Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone is an amazing fantasy and adventure story about a young boy named Harry who lives with his neglectful aunt  uncle and cousin because his parents got in a car crash  One day a letter arrived at their house addressed to Harry but his dreaded family wouldn t let him open or see it  He overheard conversations about the letters and more appeared each day  When the family goes on vacation to get away from the letters  Harry suddenly learns that his parents didn t die from a car crash  they died from the evil Voldemort who also attempted to kill Harry but he couldn t  leaving Harry with a lightning bolt scar upon his forehead  Harry was a wizard and would be attending the school Hogwarts  He learned this new information from Hagrid  who was a professor at Hogwarts  Harry meets Ron  Hermione and many others on his way to Hogwarts  Harry was placed in the house Gryffindor  What adventures will Harry encounter at this new school  Will he meet Voldemort  I recommend this book to people that like fantasy and adventure  someone who enjoys series books   Harry Potther and the Philospher s Stone was my very first  what I call   grown up book   It was given to me as a christmas gift from my aunt and it was the hardcover edition  I didn t know what it was  and it hadn t particularly intrigued me at first sight  But the moment I started reading it  I was hooked  This book was the introduction to a whole new world of fantasy and adventure  This book is what made me fall in love even more with reading and books of this genre  I grew up with the Harry Potter books throughout elementary school and high school  I got attached to all the characters because they were the same age as I was back when I was reading it  so it was as if I was living the story with them  going to Hogwarts and learning spells and potions  It is also one of the very few series transformed into movies that I really liked  that sentence didn t really make sense  but you get what I mean  I hope   P   I usually don t like the film adaptations because they take out so many important details  or they the casting is just not right somehow but the HP movies were great  in my opinion I recommend this book to everyone  You HAVE to read this  It s a must    Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone is a thrilling fantasy book about a 11 year old boy who finds out that he is a wizard  and is taken to Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry  Here he learns how to be a wizard  while dealing with the fame of being the only person to ever survive the killing curse  While at Hogwarts he soon meets his two best friends that never leave his side  When the headmaster of Hogwarts warns the students not to enter a specific room on the third floor  all the children wondered about its mystery  As Harry discovers more about his dark past  strange things begin to happen at Hogwarts  In order to protect the school and all the new people that he adored greatly  Ron  Hermione  and himself uncover the mystery of the Sorcerer s Stone  The three main characters of the story are completely different characters that have a deep friendship for each other  Each character is unique  because they each have a skill that covers for the others weaknesses  Harry for example  is brave  and a powerful dueler  but his lack of spell knowledge that Hermione owns holds him back  Ron on the other hand has knowledge about the wizarding world that Harry and Hermione lack  as they both were raised by muggles  or non magical people  The book is set in Hogwarts  a enormous castle with moving stair cases  talking paintings and ghosts  The setting helps amplify the magical feel of the entire book  because anything could happen at any point in time  There is also a certain theme that seems to run through all the Harry Potter books  is the connection between Harry and Voldemort  the main antagonist of the story  In each book he is tied to some part of Harry s life  even in the books that do not show him physically  Overall  the Harry Potter series is my all time favorite  and will continue to be  I CAN T BELIEVE I M JUST NOW READING HARRY POTTER   Right now I am reading this book  I have seen all of the movies so I know what happens  One thing I noticed is that the books have SO much detail that if I get confused  then I am able to think of what part of the movie it is at  I haven t gotten confused yet  but as the series goes on I think I will because the books differ from the movies  So far I like the movies better because I am more of a visual person  but because J K  Rowling is such a good author  that might change  In the Story though  I loved how much the book made Harry literally not know how famous and well known he actually was in the Wizard world  I also like the relationship between Harry and Hagrid  In result of me seeing the movies  I know the relationship between Harry  Hermione and Ron and it has been one of my favorite parts of the book when they met each other  Lastly  J K  Rowling has written this so well because she uses so much detail for the reader to really get into the book and feel like they are on the journey with them at Hogwarts  Aaaaah Harry Potter  C est sans doute LA saga qui a change ma vie  Mes parents m ont offert le coffret des 4 tomes en format poche alors que je n avais que 11 ans  A cet age la  je n aimais pas lire  c etait pour moi un cadeau inutile qui allait juste prendre trop de place sur mes etageres  Puis pour la curiosite  j ai ouvert le premier tome et j ai lu une page  Puis deux  Puis un chapitre entier  Et sans trop savoir comment  je n ai jamais su m arreter  Quand j en ai eu termine avec le premier tome  je suis passee au suivant et ainsi de suite jusqu au quatrieme  Et quand il a fallu attendre le tome 5  j ai relu les quatre premiers opus en attendant  C est pourquoi Harry Potter a l ecole des sorciers doit etre ma quinzieme relecture au bas mot  et ca devait bien faire 7 ou 8 ans que je n avais pas replonge le nez dans les aventures du celebre sorcier  Et meme apres tout ce temps  a l age de 25 ans  presque 15 ans plus tard  j ai senti la magie qui impregnait ce livre  Et ca m a fait le meme effet que quand j etais enfant  Je fais partie de cette generation qui a appris a aimer et respecter les livres avec la saga de J K Rowling  Hum  un resume   Vraiment   Ca me semble un peu ridicule sachant que tout le monde connait cette histoire  mais pourquoi pas  Harry est un garcon de 10 ans qui a perdu ses parents lorsqu il etait tout petit  Il a donc ete confie aux Dursley  son oncle et sa tante  des etres obtus persuades de valoir mieux que tout le monde  Maltraite moralement  Harry dort dans un placard miteux et doit composer avec son cousin Dudley  aussi brutal que gras  Ce dernier est pourri gate  alors que le pauvre Harry  lui  n a droit qu a des reproches Un jour  les Dursley recoivent une lettre qui s adresse a Harry  Celui ci n a pas le temps de l ouvrir pour voir ce qu elle renferme  puisque son oncle la detruit immediatement  Le jour suivant  une serie de nouvelles missives sont envoyees  la encore interceptees par son oncle  Mais le jour de son onzieme anniversaire  quelque chose d extraordinaire survient   un geant vient le chercher et lui annonce tout net qu il est un sorcier et que son destin est d aller etudier a Poudlard  la celebre ecole de sorciers  Son entree a Poudlard va etre remarquee  car contre toute attente  Harry est une veritable celebrite dans le monde des sorciers  Entre cours en tout genre et rivalites  le jeune garcon ne va pas etre au bout de ses surprises Ce qui m a interpellee dans cette re re re re re      lecture  c est la facilite avec laquelle on se laisse porter par l histoire  Ce premier tome commence tres gentiment  avec un style d ecriture abordable  mais pas si enfantin qu on pourrait le penser  Pour cela  Rowling est particulierement douee puisque si la plume est assez simple pour etre comprise par un enfant tres jeune  il y a des subtilites que l on decele par la suite  sans parler de la poesie et des lecons de vie qui en emanent  Harry Potter est une merveilleuse aventure dans laquelle Rowling a demontre toute son originalite  Cela va du detail le plus infime a l aventure la plus grandiose  Tout est aborde avec justesse  a tel point que meme en 300 pages   ce qui est assez succinct   on devine que derriere tout ca se cache un monde d une tres grande complexite  Et pourtant  l auteur n en fait pas trop et il n y a pas ce  trop plein  d informations qui peut noyer le lecteur  Non  la vie a Poudlard est decrite sans precipitation et avec moult details Quel bonheur de retrouver cet univers  de ressentir cette petite pointe d impatience et d excitation lorsque Harry fait ses premiers pas dans le monde des sorciers  J avais encore des etoiles plein les yeux   Retrouver le celebre heros et sa touchante naivete  Hermionne et son temperament de  miss je sais tout  ou encore Ron et sa delicatesse a toute epreuve    pfffiou ca a fait remonter en moi une foule de beaux souvenirs Dans ce premier opus  les personnalites sont brossees assez superficiellement  mais avec les yeux de Harry  ce qui ne derange pas du tout  A cet age  on a tendance a se referer a ce que l on voit dans l immediat  pas a ce que l on sent emaner de quelqu un  Je sais que par la suite  les personnages seront beaucoup plus creuses  et ce tome est avant tout la pour poser les bases d un univers extremement vaste dont on connait mal les limites a ce stade la  Ce moment que j ai passe en relisant ce livre qui me tient vraiment a coeur a ete un veritable regal  Parce que je n avais pas de questions particulieres a me poser  est ce que je vais aimer ou non     J ai redecouvert une multitude de details que j avais oublies et qu on ne retrouve pas dans les adaptations  Et encore une fois je tire mon chapeau a l auteur dont l imagination a transporte des millions de personnes dans le monde En resume  une plume accessible qui nous devoile les pans d une aventure formidable  J K Rowling mene tres bien sa barque des le debut  avec un concept assez simple mais qui finit par se complexifier et surtout se bonifier par la suite  J ai ete charmee du debut a la fin  et je m apercois que je suis toujours aussi sensible a la poesie qui se degage de chacun de ses mots Ma chronique   http   april the seven weebly com fan    What s all the hype about you ask  Why are these books so popular  J K  Rowling has created a splendid book  It s a magnificent  colorful  and imaginative world this book introduces you to  With its immersive imagery and well thought out characters  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone sucks you into the world of Hogwarts This book is filled with imagery  The way the author describes the setting is spectacular  If the reader has a good imagination  it ll be like watching a very detailed movie in your mind  A good example of this  trying to keep spoilers at a minimum  is the introduction to Platform Nine and Three Quarters  Smoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering crowd    Owls hooted to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and the scraping of heavy trunks   A good addition to the imagery is that Rowling uses a third person point of view  It leaves a massive amount of room for this type of writing  Instead of focusing on Harry s thoughts  the reader can be appalled by his surroundings instead  The point of view makes the reader seem as if they are a companion of Harry s adventures instead of felling as if a friend is telling you his experiences  However it s not only the setting that that is very well detailed  but the characters introduced in the story as well  Rowling captivates emotion very well throughout the story The characters in the story are very well developed  If the reader is the type to look for an interesting character than this is one of them  I feel that Rowling made  the main character  Harry  a lot easier to figure out than other characters  Although it is a book about Harry Potter  other characters should receive some spotlight along with him  Hermione Granger  a main character along Harry Potter  seems like a demanding know it all girl  but as the reader learns later  she an insecure girl  clinging to fit in with her peers With its immersive world  Harry Potter is a must  could be enjoyed by anyone with a thirst for fantasy  J K  Rowling s series does live up to the hype  It s a great read a 10 10 hands down  I got this book for my birthday when I was either 10 or 11  I started reading that night and thus began my love for Harry Potter  Now  over 10 years later I am still completely in love with this story  I can t count on my fingers how many times I ve read this series  I think I watch at least one Harry Potter movie a week and I can quote every single movie from beginning to end    without watching them  I think my parents have somewhat regretted giving me that book so long ago  I don t think they ever expected a story to have such a big impact upon my life  This is an amazing story  At first  it seems like a children s book but as the books progress major themes start forming  I feel like a 10 year old who begins Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone and continues reading all of them consecutively may not be able to fully comprehend what happens towards the end  J K  Rowling entwines very deep and dark themes into Harry Potter so I feel like a lot of it would be hard to grasp at a young age  As for me  I grew up with the books  I read them as they came out so I had just turned 15 when the last book was published  It was easier for me to understand  But even now when I re read them I pick out things I hadn t caught onto before  This book and the rest of the series is incredible  J K  Rowling is brilliant  Harry Potter lives with his terrible Aunt  Uncle  and Cousin  They treat him like scum and one day he receives a letter  but he is not aloud to open it  His Aunt and Uncle wont let him  After trying to keep it from him more and more letters arrives until they leave town to escape it  One night on his birthday a huge man shows up and gives him the letter personally  The man tells him he is a wizard and it is an acceptance letter to go to a Wizard school  He is introduced into a world of magic and finds out that he is actually famous in that world for having survived a magical attack as a baby  He goes to wizard school and finds that some strange things are happening  With the help of his new friends Ron and Hermione they unravel a mystery of things happening at Hogwarts  wizard school   Like most everyone else in the world  I love this book and the series  The world she has created is so extraordinary and amazing that you can t help but want to be there as well  If you like magic and adventure this is definitely a book for you  Don t just avoid it because of the cliche of it all  Give it a try and I guarantee you will magically be taken into the story  There is nothing with the content to warn about in this series  It does have some creepy elements that might not be good for little kids  but overall it is pretty low key    Let there be Light I

etonnerai pas en vous disant que j adore l histoire d Harry Potter   La plume de J K  Rowling est magistrale  elle a un reel talent de conteuse  J ai lu et relu ce livre des dizaines de fois  et j avoue etre toujours autant bluffee par le monde qu elle a su inventer  construire  jusque dans le moindre detail  Peu d auteurs peuvent se vanter d avoir un tel talent Des la premiere page on est

pour ses allusions et sa construction integrant politique  histoire et psychologie  Dans cet article  je laisserai cet aspect plus analytique pour rester dans le domaine de la magie et du fantastique  ce livre etant relu dans le cadre du challenge Halloween  Peut etre vous livrerai je un jour ma propre analyse plus approfondie Pour en revenir a ce premier opus  celui ci nous permet de faire connaissance avec les principaux protagonistes de l histoire  D autres suivront dans les prochaines tomes  je vous conseille donc de les lire dans l ordre si vous les decouvrez C est avec plaisir que l on decouvre Poudlard  la celebre ecole de magie  dirigee par Dumbledore  On sympathise avec Ronald Weasley  Hermione Granger ou encore Neuville Londubat et Hagrid le geant garde chasse  On se familiarise avec les cours de magie des professeurs Macgonagall et Rogue Mais Harry Potter  c est aussi un cote plus sombre  terrifiant et tragique  Affronter les dangers  les coups bas de    camarades    peu scrupuleux tel Drago Malefoy  Ou tenir tete au terrible Voldemort Plein de sagesse  de camaraderie et de jolies valeurs  ce roman est a mettre entre toutes les mains    Let there be

5Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone will be in my heart forever  This whole series is a staple in YA Literature and Sorcerer s Stone does a whimsical job at kicking the series off  Harry  an orphan living with his less than loving Aunt and Uncle  is given the opportunity to leave his aunt and uncle in order to learn and pratice magic and Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry  After this proposal  his life is changed forever  much like the fate of anyone who picks up this book  It is not all fun and games  however  Harry discovers many dark things interwoven into the wizarding world and his life in particular that prove to balance out the seemingly perfect idea of the wizarding world  Harry is  The Boy Who Lived   the protagonist in the dark tale of  He Who Must not be Named  and his downfall  For some  Harry is the hero of the wizarding world    For others  he is the reason for suffering I couldn t not love this book  It kicks off the HP series wonderfully which is truly THE Young Adult series of this century  I would recommend this book series to literally anyone who had not read it  Harry and his friends are highly relatable characters that  throughout the series  have some of the deepest character development is YA literature  There s something for everyone to love in HP  I had decided to read this book because everyone had been saying it was a really good book  My brother had also encouraged me to read this book Harry is a boy who finds out that he is and orphaned son of two very powerful wizards and has the same power as them  He is pulled out of his normal life to become a student at Hogwarts which is one of the best wizard boarding schools in England  He meets many new friends in his house called Gryffindor  His two friends also help him to figure out the mystery of his parent s death  In order to solve the mystery he goes through obstacles that can take one person s life There were many great characters in this book but the one that stood out the most was Rubeus Hagrid  Usually just known as Hagrid  he helps Harry to fit into the school and helps him with all the good and bad things in the school  He is a great helper to Harry and is more of the funny and friendly type of characters Throughout the book I learnt was that you a have control over your own future with the choices that you make in life  If you have the right mind set and the have the right choices in mind  you can change your future from being bad to good  Harry does this when the sorting hat was going to put him into Slytherin but Harry was whispering not to be in Slytherin  This made Harry go into Gryffindor   It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies  but just as much to stand up to our friends   This was said by Albus Dumbledore  This means stick by our friends even in the situation of when your enemies are up to no good This book made my childhood ten times more enjoyable and had me hooked to read the rest of the series  I rate 5 5 easily  So  I FINALLY started to read the famous Harry Potter series I have to admit that I would have loved to read this series when they were being realized or at least before watching the movies  but I was too young back then and reading a serie of 7 books seem a bit too much for me  Even though I had read other series already  Harry Potter didn t really interested me that much How wrong I was No wonder J K Rowling is probably swimming in a pool of gold galeons by now  with this mega best selling books and stuff The books are amazingly good  They are a young adult novel that is intriguing and perfectly interesting to older audiences  which some times is very hard to achieve Rowling manage to put magic in the normal world  without rally changing any normal world rules and nailed it  Witches and wizards could be roaming around Diagol Alley right now and no one would know But we have internet though  D   Pretty good book  Harry is way more interesting in the Books than he is in the movies though  I always saw harry as a lucky ass boy who survived everything by mere chance and luck  At least until the last movies In the books the boy got guts dude Great books  good Still in love with it Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone1  Harry Potter doesn t have a very good life living in his Aunt and Uncle s House with his annoying cousin Dudley  The reason for this is because his parents  died in a car crash   He practically lives under the stairs of his Aunt and Uncle s house  But  one day something strange happens at the zoo for Dudley s birthday  Harry talks to one of the snakes in the Reptile House  Later that week he got a letter but his uncle took it away to see but they kept flying in until they thought it was outrageous  So they left the house to a rocky mount in the middle of the ocean  They got more letters for Harry when something came bursting down the door  Harry felt his life finally changing around  2  Well  not every character in this story seems real except for Dudley  Aunt Petunia  Uncle Vernon  and the people living on 4 Privet Drive  All of the other characters are sort of real if you want to call it that 3  Harry looks like a studious boy with slick black hair and a lightning bolt in the middle of his forehead  Dudley is a plump spoiled kid that has dirty blond hair and has everything he wants  Aunt Petunia is thin and has blond hair  Uncle Vernon is like Dudley  but can run with a dark brown kind of hair  Ron has freckles and has read hair  Hermione has a dark brown too  and is thin and petite  4  Harry obeys but he does what he wants sometimes  like in the Gryffindor Tower he sneaks out with Ron to find hidden things  Dudley screams whenever he doesn t get his way and he is a tattle tale  like when Harry was looking at the snake and not keeping up Dudley told on him  Hermione is studious and smart because in one of the battles she knew what spells to use and what dark magic not to use  Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia cater to Dudley and are mean to Harry at the beginning of the story 5  There was a ton of action in this story  Harry snuck out a lot at night with Ron because there was suspicious things going on  Hermione and Neville would stay behind  Ron s 2 twin brothers were huge troublemakers  I am not going to say who Harry fought in the end but I am going to give a   HINT    Voldemort  He doesn t necessarily fight Voldemort himself though 6  I loved this book because it never got less interesting or a dull moment  It has a really nice end where you have to read the next book in the series to find what happens next  I recommend whoever is reading this review to read the book 7  The theme of this book is I think to stand up for yourself and to keep somethings out of your business    First Reading  2013  no review     Second reading  22 09 2015   24 09 2015   The first time I read this book series I didn t appreciate how impeccable it was  okay  I wasn t this mature  _    No wonder it made such a big hit I don t read books for more than once since everything loses its wonder  it s not intriguing  when you already know the plot  Be as it may  I still loved reading this book for the second time   And I ll read the next books soon  so stay tuned  However  I was amazed at the number of things details I had forgotten about in the two years that have passed since I last read the book On the back of the book  there was this praise for the Harry Potter series  The Harry Potter stories will join that small group of children s books which are read and re read into adulthood  I imagine that the number of readers waiting for the next instalment grows by the day  TLS  Yup  It s exactly what I plan on doing  to read it again in a few years  time  PlotAwesomely original plot   Nothing to say really    all good LanguageSimple yet very good  10 11 year olds won t have much trouble trying to understand this book  Though I have no doubt the language will seem too simple or boring to grown ups  ahem  books that contain nothing but a few simple sentences  because  J K  Rowling   our one true idol   manages to describe everything in detail despite the lack of difficult words  And  oh  the beginning  Such beauty  Such captivation  It won t let you go Favourite QuotesThere are some things you can t share without ending up liking each other  and knocking out a twelve foot mountain troll is one of them   End of chapter 10 Should you read this Is that even a question  YESJust saying   The Dursleys do NOT approve of imagination  originality and other such things  Then they said that the name Harry was too ordinary     uh oh   Harry life has been very peculiar  he lived with his aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon and there spoiled son Dudley  they very much despised Harry but he never knew why  Because Harry s aunt uncle didn t like him they made him sleep not in a bedroom but under the stairs in the cupboard  He was pretty much there personal slave he had to do everything they told him to  Harry asked about his parents and what happened to them because the only thing he remembered of his childhood was a flash of green light and a women screaming  They said they were in a car crash and died  But one day a letter in the mail will change his life forever  It was a ticket to a magical school called Hogwarts  Little did harry know anything about where he was going or what he was doing  When he first was told anything about Hogwarts he quickly discovered that he was known every around the wizard community as the boy who lived  When the day would come to his first day to go to Hogwarts  He had no time making friends  with Hermonie Granger and Ron Wesley  But the first time he arrived at the school he realized that mysteries lingers threw the walls  When harry and his friends finds out about a name he wasn t suppose to and find out a about a stone of internal life  But Harry finds out that dark wizards are trying to steal and use it to revive the strongest dark wizard in history  Will harry find the mystery and stop them from from getting the stone This book was amazing it kept you wanting to read more and more  You read and find out more and more clues and put the mystery together like a giant puzzle  When they find out something that  its like your right there next to them and trying to figure it out with them  I would highly recorded this book to people who like fantasy  When you read this book you will be hooked     This is a re read review  and it looks much prettier on Books Over Bros       A SHORT INTRODUCTIONAs you know from my last post  after some well needed inspiration from a couple of very good friends  I am currently making my way through my first ever full read through of the Harry Potter series  Although I feel slightly ashamed to admit that it has taken me so long to re read such a well loved series of books from my childhood  I m really  really glad that I ve decided to do it at a time in my life where I have a platform to fully write about the experience   and  of course  to share it with others However  as much as I am enjoying delving into these novels again  I have  at this very moment  realised that reviewing them is hardly going to be a walk in the park  Nope  It s probably going to be closer to a traipse through the Forbidden Forest  I mean  how do you put into words how much a series meant to you as a child   as well summarise your thoughts on this series as an adult  I m definitely going to struggle with this one  but I hope you ll all bear with me as I try to organise my thoughts and feelings on a set of books that changed my life for the better           THE REVIEW Mr  and Mrs  Dursley  of number four Privet Drive  were proud to say that they were perfectly normal  thank you very much  When we first meet ten year old Harry Potter  he is nothing more than a young  scrawny boy  leading a miserable existence with his Uncle Vernon  Aunt Petunia and cousin  Dudley Dursley  He is treated in a horrible and mindlessly abusive manner by his only remaining  family   who he has been forced to live with due to being orphaned at a very young age  when his parents died in a car crash   the same horrible accident that left him with the strange  lightning shaped scar upon his forehead  Or so he has been told However  on Harry s eleventh birthday  everything changes A huge and towering man with the kindest eyes literally batters down the door to tell Harry the most startling piece of information that he has ever heard in his life  Harry Potter is a wizard Before he knows it  Harry Potter has enrolled in Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry  is learning how to do actual magic  has made real friends and  for the first time in his entire life  is actually happy  However  in a world where photographs move and broomsticks fly and dragons rule the skies  things can never be as simple as they appear Soon  Harry and his friends find themselves tangled in something more dangerous than they ever could have imagined   and what started as a fun and exciting year at school for Harry  could end up being his last            First things first  I think it s important to say that the first novel in this series is  by all definitions  a children s book  I m aware that the whole series was written for children   however  I do feel that adult themes are far more obvious in the latter books in the Harry Potter series  In fact  that s one of the things I loved most about this series when I first read it  that the characters and the writing grew up with me  When I read the final installment at 16 years old  I didn t feel as if I d outgrown the writing   which is really saying something  since I read the first book and entire nine years before the release of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Anyway  I digress What I wanted to say here was this  although Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone is  quite clearly  a children s book   when re reading it as an adult who has already read the entire series  the book is quite a bit darker than it ever could have been on a first reading  I m going to try and put this into words that make some sort of sense  so bear with me  please  Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up        He couldn t know that at this very moment  people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices   To Harry Potter   the boy who lived   When I read these novels as a young  innocent and carefree child   yet to be tainted by the death of well loved characters  and revelations about others that would change my entire perception of events in the series   I was just so caught up in the sheer magic of it all  I approached this novel with a sense of childlike wonder and curiosity  that made me eager to find out as much as I could about these wonderful characters and the enchanting world they lived within  The thin bearded man with the Put Outer and the stern woman who could transform herself into a cat excited me  The whispers about the Potters seemed nothing more than that   just whispers However  on a re read  I couldn t help but let my mind wander to what those whispers were referring to  The events at the very start of Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone all took place at the height of a violent war that had spanned over eleven years  The Potters were just brutally murdered at the age of around 20 21  and their best friend Harry s godfather had just given his bike to Hagrid and was now being carried off to Azkaban  where he would serve the next twelve years of his life And when you really go into the timeline of things  if Lilly and James were only 20 21 when they were murdered  and Sirius was around the same age when he was sent off to Azkaban  then that means that Dumbledore and McGonagall were still teaching them just three or four years before this happened  So  although there s a sadness hanging over this scene in the first chapter of this novel  it becomes much darker when you re able to really think about it in a way that you never could have without the knowledge presented to you by later novels in this series  It s pretty heart breaking  to say the least  Sunshine  daisies  butter mellow  turn this stupid  fat rat yellow  On top of this  moments like when Ron tries to turn Scabbers yellow end up having a sort of bitterness attached to them  due to knowing who Scabbers really is  and how he is involved in events later on in the story And  of course  there s Draco Malfoy  I m not sure if I ve ever openly expressed this  but I love Draco Malfoy  He s one of my favourite characters in this series  I can t help but like villains  okay  I actually forgot how early on we meet him in this book   but it was good to compare my initial reaction to him as a child with my initial reaction as an adult  with more knowledge about his background  Obviously  he comes across as completely odious from the get go  however  this was another part of the book that was tinged with a sort of sour taste for me  I tried to feel that initial dislike for Malfoy that I had as a child  but I couldn t   because all I could think about was the fact that Draco Malfoy is nothing more than a product of his awful parents  Draco Malfoy spouts hateful nonsense that he has learned from his parents  and it s really sad to think that he could have been a totally different character if it were not for his family and therefore the sort of upbringing that he received  Some of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter  imagine  I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families  Anyway  moving on   Oh  the foreshadowing  As my good friends Jonny and Lonna mentioned  it was easy to think that J K  Rowling never had a plan for this series when she started it   however  when re reading these wonderful books  you realise that the plan was there from the very beginning  Borrowed it  Professor Dumbledore  sir        Young Sirius Black lent it to me   The first time I read this series  the name Sirius Black had been long forgotten by the time I finally met him in book three  However  this time round  my inner fangirl did a little squeal over the realisation that Rowling had been setting up major characters in the very first chapter of this magical series On top of this  we have mentions of Mrs  Figg  Harry s first instance of speaking Parseltongue  or  at least  understanding it   and about the dragons in Gringotts   as well as Hagrid s advice to Harry   Yeh d be mad ter try an  rob it   which certainly made me chuckle due to events in a later novel in the series           HILARIOUS  HEART WARMING AND INSPIRINGIt s safe to say that a re read of the Harry Potter series is not all doom and gloom  though  Reading this novel again allowed me to realise how incredibly funny J K  Rowling really is  She has been criticised often for having a writing style that is very straight to the point   but I think that such a style only adds to her effortless sense of humour And Neville  Oh  poor  clumsy  adorable Neville  He s such a lovable and relatable character  I totally felt myself getting all emotional near the end of the book  when he wins those final few points for Gryffindor  What an excellent move from Rowling in starting the development of this clumsy and cowardly boy  into the loyal and courageous man that he will one day become  It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies  but just as much to stand up to our friends  And the Christmas chapter  It s definitely the loveliest chapter in this entire book  Obviously  as I ve mentioned already  there s a lot of dark stuff going on in this book on a second reading   so it was really lovely to have such a merry and heart warming chapter to lighten the whole thing up  Everything from the moment Harry receives his gifts   til the moment where he tries on his Invisibility Cloak is just an absolute joy to read  Of course  I can t write about this chapter without mentioning the drunk teachers  either  I grinned in real life when I read the line  Up at the High Table  Dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizard s hat for a flowered bonnet  and was chuckling merrily at a joke Professor Flitwick has just read him  Also  to digress a little  I mean  I never forgot how inspiring Albus Dumbledore s words were   but it was really nice to read them again and realise just how much they d stuck with me over the years  There s nothing much better than that moment where you can literally feel your heart swelling in your chest because the words on a page have inspired you in a way that you never thought possible  It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live            AND CAN WE TALK ABOUT HERMIONE GRANGER  When I read this book as a child  I eagerly joined Harry and Ron in their dislike of the snobbish and uptight Hermione Granger  However  just like them  as I grew and matured  I learned to love and admire Hermione Granger for everything that she wasn t   and everything that she was As an adult  I read the scene where we first meet Hermione  and realised that her know it all attitude and high speed rambling was nothing more than defence mechanism  to cover the nerves that she obviously had about being a witch coming from a muggle family   with no prior knowledge of the wizarding world  aside from what she had managed to cram into her brain over a summer of voracious studying  I hope you re pleased with yourselves  We could all have been killed   or worse  expelled  Now if you don t mind  I m going to bed  In this novel  Hermione really doesn t get a chance to shine  Like  really  In fact  in the first part of this novel  I d be impressed if you could point out any particularly redeeming qualities about her  at all  Even in the latter part of the novel  although she becomes friends with Harry and Ron  she s still definitely more of a sidekick  rather than a particularly impressive character in her own right But  if I m being honest  I sort of liked that on a re read   because it made me realise how much Hermione grows as a character throughout the course of the series  and I m really excited to watch her develop as I work my way through the rest of the novels           I SHOULD PROBABLY SUMMARISE NOW   If you ve got this far  then thank you so much for bearing with me  I m hoping that organising my thoughts in regards to the other novels in this series will be a little easier  now that I ve got all of this off my chest  However  let me just take this moment to apologise in advance  in case I don t manage In case you didn t gather  I had a wonderful time reading Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone again  There was always this fear that prevented me picking these books up again   a fear that I wouldn t love them as much as I did as a child  and that the magic that surrounded these novels would have thus been destroyed by this awful realisation  However  I m so  so happy to be able to say that I loved this book just as much   if not  even more   than I did the first time I delved into  and I m super  super excited to work my way through the other novels in this series  and to write down some more reviews for you guys to read   If you can tolerate the length of them  that is     Serie  Harry

blogspot com br 2015 0    Todos conocemos la historia de Harry Potter  ya sea  por las peliculas o por las diversas menciones que ha tenido en los diferentes medios de comunicacion  asi que no es de extranarse la mayoria de las personas conozcan esta historia Aun no es considerado un clasico como tal  puesto que todavia no cumple con los cien anos desde su publicacion  pero se considera como un  clasico moderno  debido a la difusion que ha tenido y su influencia tanto como en cine como literatura  Desde la primera vez que lo lei me gusto y lo considere como un de las lecturas indispensables que todo nino deberia leer  ya que contiene morales y valores que cada quien deberia aprender durante la etapa de crecimiento  combinada con comedia  aventura y fantasia Sumado a esto  hay que considerar que esta escrito de una manera amena y agradable que te hace sumirte en la lectura hasta el punto de considerarte un personaje mas dentro de su mundo  Desde esta primera parte  amaras a Harry  Ron  Hermione  Dumbledore  entre otros por las diferentes personalidades que presentan  Leyendo los libros que le preceden  he de decirles que la historia mejora conforme avanza  poco a poco se complica cada vez mas  Diria que no es el mejor de toda la saga debido a que lo veo mas bien como un libro introductorio a los demas libros aunque eso no quiere decir que sea malo  Es excelente como libro introductorio Mas adelante hare otra entrada contandoles acerca de las influencias de Harry Potter en otros aspectos  This is a book about a boy named Harry Potter who finds out he is a wizard and his struggles and trials with this new part of his life  When Harry turned 11 he finds out that he is a wizard as well as being famous in the wizard world for stopping Lord Voldemort in his attempt to kill him  He goes to a wizard school and learns about his past  makes friends  and even has to face a old enemy of his  This book was very interesting to read and pulls in the reader very well  Probably the only thing I didn t like about this book was that it was too short  It felt like the end was a little rushed and could have gone on a little more  Even though it was short the story line has plenty of twists and turns in it that weren t expected  All the characters in the story have so much personality and depth even though this is only the first book in the series This is a great book and I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a book to read  The type of person I would recommend this to the most is anyone who doesn t enjoying reading  Even though it might take a few pages to get into it quickly becomes something you enjoy and look forward to instead of dreading having to read    Harry potter was attacked by Lord Voldemort and lived  Dumbledore take him to his aunt and uncle they don t like him he finds out he is a wizard and goes to Hogwarts and meets Ron and Hermione  He finds out professor Quirrell is helping lord Voldemort and kills Quirrell  The conflict in this book is man versus man  man versus nature  and man versus self  throughout the book Harry is constantly fighting himself  Quirrell and the forces of nature magic  He over comes these conflicts with the help of Dumbledore  his teachers  and most importantly  his friends  The point of view in this book is third person  This is a good thing because of all the characters in the book  Using another different point of view would make it harder to understand  The book works very well using third person point of view  I think this book is amazing many people like it and is the perfect marriage between fiction and real world things like paris and London etc  Ive read almost all the books and am exited to finish the series  Harry Potter is normal kid  living in with his Aunt  Uncle  and cousin  But they are mean to him  and make him live in a cupboard under the stairs  But one day his life changes when he starts to get letters from owls  In these letters  he finds out that he is a wizard  and that he has been accepted to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry  But he s no ordinary wizard  because when he was just a baby  a very dark wizard  Voldemort  tried to kill him  but did not succeed  As Harry goes to school  he encounters many different things  both good and bad I really liked Harry Potter because the author really makes you feel like you are going through everything right along with the characters in the book  Everything is described in detail  and you can just see everything that the author is describing I would recommend this book to pretty much anyone  Personally  I would want people to read the book before they saw the movie  because it makes the whole experience of reading this book even better  So I would recommend it to anyone who wants a fun and really good book to read  Pulls me in every time   Harry Potter is an ordinary 11 year old boy living an ordinary life  except for the fact that he s a wizard   Summoned by a letter  well  quite a few actually  he joins a prestigious boarding school for ordinary boys and girls  except that they re also wizards and witches   He experiences typical school life  attending the usual school lessons like history  of magic   under the tutelage of wise and experienced teachers found in most private and exclusive schools  except that one has a face sticking out of the back of his head   Harry faces the same dilemma s that most school students face  making friends  finding his place in the school community  struggling with homework and being pursued by an evil overlord  His lively escapades with his faithful friends bring to mind the simplicity of boarding school thrills and pranks typified by Enid Blyton such as midnight meetings  triumph at lacrosse style sports  different kind of sticks though   adventurous wanderings and puzzling riddles to solve  not so much  Who stole Mary Lou s money   as  Who s been drinking unicorn blood     Harry s final tasks that demonstrate his growth as he learns life s lessons include learning to work as a team  accepting just punishment by authority  coping with the pressure of exams and surviving the stress of attempted murder  At the conclusion of the book he returns home  older and wiser  to his ordinary  no  really  relatives    Note  I just made a goodreads account  so please excuse my poor writing   reviewing skills  This book was released in 1997  and here I am  reviewing it in 2015  Where have I been all these years  you ask  Reading and re reading the books and watching the movies  that s where  This series is probably the only reason I made a goodreads account anyway  to tell the world how awesome this series is    not that it needs to know  since it s so popular  but anyway   The Harry Potter series are well written  breathtaking  enchanting etc etc  Jk Rowling s world is so broad and vast and the earlier books contain so many references to the later ones that you don t pick up on your first read  The characters are so detailed  with all their unique personalities  The boy who lived  won won  aka weasel king   Hermione  Ginny  Luna  Neville  Seamus  Dean  Draco  You know who  don t say his name    Bellatrix  Lucius            The first book is not that well written  but there is a definite improvement in the series as it progresses  If you haven t read this series  read it  If you have  read it anyway  I hope my flimsy little review is enough to convince you to read it  Isn t it  Isn t it  whips out wand  Ps  check out the movie series too  it s amazing  Pps  I love pizza  don t ask me what that has to do with Harry Potter  I don t know myself  Ppps  Fantastic Beasts and where to find them will be a movie trilogy  with the first one being released in 2016   squeals excitedly  Pppps   how do you add gifs and pictures in your review   Blush    harry potter was a childhood favorite book for me of course one of the first book series i ever picked up  This series was full of magic  friendship and bravery  the book were it started my first year Hogwarts and the journey that i was alongside with harry  Ron and hermione  I can honestly say that I loved every minute of this  It s a spectacular little romp with funny  courageous  and endearing characters that you can t help but love It has talking chess pieces  singing hats  a giant three headed dog named Fluffy  a hilarious giant with a dragon fetish  a master wizard that s just a little bit crazy  mail carrier owls  goblins running a bank  unicorns  centaurs and even trolls  And then there s the lead characters  Hermione  the young scholar who starts out prim and up tight but soon becomes a true friend  Ron  the boy who has little money but who has an abundance of family and loyalty to his friends to make up for it  and then there s Harry  the boy who starts out sleeping in a closet and ends up being a hero  Harry is kind to those that deserve it  fearless when it counts the most  and wonderfully intelligent  What s not to love  i could keep writing about this series until my character limit reaches zero  this book is perfect for children who get books read to them   If you haven t heard of this book  you ve been living under a rock  The Harry Potter series has turned into a huge book and movie franchise  It is loved by people of all ages all over the world  Recently  I decided to read the series once again  much to my delight  and I decided that it was about time for me to review this book This book is timeless  along with the rest of the series  and rightfully so  This might be a children s book series  but this book is not all fun  games  and magical beasts  This book deals with friendship  bravery  and sacrifice  There are all sorts of things that can be learned from this book  My absolute favorite part of this book is the characters  They are all expertly written and complex  All the characters are very realistic  and are often not how they at first seem  They all are highly individualized  and I have never seen anybody like them in any other books  They are far from stereotypical  Even though Hermione at first appears to be the epitome of a nerd and a goody two shoes  you soon realize that she s funny  and willing to break the rules when she finds it necessary  I also love the tie ins that are all throughout the book  It is a bit of a mystery  but evidence doesn t just pop out of nowhere  Things in the beginning tie in to things later  and you never know what is or isn t important  The crew takes all sorts of wrong turns and some right ones as well  You never know if you are looking at the golden key that explains everything or a red herring that is trying to trick you  Overall  this book and the entire series are great works that I would suggest to anybody  This is a book that can be read and enjoyed by a child or an adult  Plus  there is a huge network of Potter fans who will be there to talk to you about the series  If you haven t read this book  read it as soon as possible  Even if you don t enjoy it  you will still benefit from reading it because there are many references to this book and series in every day life Four Point Five out of Five StarsYou can also find this review on my blog  http   themessengerreviews blogspot c     J K  Rowling s  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s  Stone enchanted me with its mythical tale of a young wizard in the making  There are many themes in this book such as family  friends  and home  However  I would like to touch on only one of the three themes I had recognized which is home  In this book our young wizard Harry hates the home he has  He arrives at the school of wizardry  Hogwarts  by mysterious means and is mesmerized by its grandeur  As the days go by he begins to love the school more and more until its his favorite of his two homes  It may even be the only place he can call home  Home is   where you make it  The author also connects to us all who were once young children dreaming of magic and dragons and adventures only existent in our imaginations and stories  One cannot help but wish they were right there next to Harry every footstep he made out of England  Our main character  Harry Potter is also famous and known to all because of what he had survived by the one that cannot be named  This book takes you through adventures  magic  mystery  suspense  grief  and happiness  A young wizards tale may be the best emotional roller coaster of your life  Join Harry and his friends in the story that will have you running around your home in a cape wishing you were a wizard   I recommend this book to anyone who has even for a second thought of the possibility of magical beings as being the most amazing thing in the world  5 out of 5 stars   The Harry Potter series has become a world favorite as well as one of my personal favorites  This book takes us into the life of Harry Potter and the magic world that comes with it  Throughout this book you experience Harry finding out the truth behind his parents  death and the powers he possesses  After finding out the truth he is sent away to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry where he can learn how to properly perform his magic  While he is there he makes friends as well as enemies and faces the force that killed his parents  I loved this book because there was never a dull moment within the book  there was always something going on with the right amount of detail without being too drawn out  Another reason I enjoyed this book is partly because of the creativity of the last scene  Towards the end of the book Harry and his friends set off to find the Sorcerer s Stone which has many obstacles in the way  From a three headed dog to a riddle involving deadly potions Harry and his friends faced many challenges trying to get the stone  This book has become one of my favorites and has been a great source of entertainment   Harry Potter is a wonderful modern example of fantasy literature for young readers  The interplay of the Muggle  real  world and the fantasy world of magic provide an accessible entry point for readers  Children can find themselves in one of the many characters who possess relatable qualities and struggles  Harry Potter  as all fantasies do  provides children an escape into another world where they are allowed to play out their dreams and desires  Not only does the plot  setting  and characters allow children access to this fantasy world  the text and invented words provide children a vocabulary is successfully manage and travel through this world  The vocabulary also helps students understand more difficult topics that are hard to discuss in the real world  This fantasy world allows students to safely explore issues in the real world  such as discrimination and racism  muggle vs  wizards  and socioeconomic issues  Malfoy family vs  Weasley family   Harry Potter has become a cult classic that young readers should have in their libraries   Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone is a great examples of the fantasy genre for any age  but especially for young readers  In particular  in Sorcerer s Stone  the reader must identify what elements of the story are in the real and what elements are actually a part of the fantasy wizarding world that Harry becomes thrust into at a young age  Being able to go through this journey with Harry  young readers are able to decode clues and analyze figurative language that allows them to create their version of this fantasy world from chapter to chapter  Additionally  the overall theme of good versus evil that encompasses the entire series also lends itself to the fantasy elements that have shaped the genre  The unclear nature of who is good and who is evil throughout the book also allow readers to deeply analyze characters and their motivations as they read through the novel and ultimately discover the overarching evil power at the end of the story Overall  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone is a great example of fantasy for young readers because it allows them to create the described fantasy world for themselves and interact with the text on a deeper more meaningful level   Harry Potter  1When I first started reading this series  only the first three books were out  I read all three of them  and then not so patiently waited for the fourth book to come out  When the fourth book came out  I reread the first three and then read the fourth  I followed this pattern all the way through the series  rereading all of the previously published books in order before reading the newest one that had just come out  As of this reading  I have read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone  a grand total of nine times  I know this sounds excessive  but considering that it has been spread out over the course of 16 years  I hope you ll agree it s not I simply love this series  It is so well written and engaging that it sucks you in  grabs a hold of you and holds on for dear life  This series is what I would call addictive  And I have once again gladly fallen into my need to read every single word Harry Potter for President   Read 1999 Hardcover2000 Hardcover2003 Hardcover2005

at introducing readers to the complex and compelling  Harry Potter Readers are introduced to Harry Potter as a young teen  living under the scrutiny of his abusive aunt and uncle  Bounded by their unethical rules and regulations  it isn t long before Harry receives a mysterious letter  awakening him to his wizardry and forever changing his life  Shortly after receiving this letter  Harry is enrolled into the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in which he meets numerous compelling characters that help shape him into the determined and powerful wizard that he was meant to be  Much of the novel follows Harry and two of his new magical friends in saving the Sorcerer s Stone from the wicked Voldemort  Rowling s use of new  magical language makes this book impossible to put down  She leaves readers wanting more  I think that this book is perfect for students who are interested in beginning more in depth reading and or are looking for an extended reading series  I would place this book in 5th and 6th grade classroom libraries  Overall  I loved this book as it is one of my favorites in the series  I would give this book a 5 5  Pages   322Tags   Magic  Fantasy  Harry Potter  Hogwarts  Wizard  Witches  Naomie Bailey5 11 15 The book Harry Potter and The Sorcerer s Stone is about about a boy who is dropped off on his mother s sister s doorstep when his parents die  Harry grew up with his aunt and uncle Dursley for eleven years and lived a horrible life  Dudley  his cousin  would always bully him but as soon as he would  something odd would happen  Harry could never explain these odd things  On his eleventh birthday  Harry kept getting these letters but his uncle Dursley would never let him see them  The letters kept coming so the Dursleys moved  Harry got an unexpected visitor named Hagrid and he told Harry he was a wizard  After that Harry went to Diagon alley to prepare for Hogwarts  When he started there he was the talk of the school  Harry had gotten into trouble  and had to help find ingredients for potions  In the woods he met his worst enemy  Lord Voldemort  Harry found out about the stone and thought someone was trying to steal it  so he was trying to find it and protect it from He who must not be names  The main conflict is Lord Voldemort is killing unicorns and drinking their blood to get stronger  He is also trying to steal the sorcerer s stone  The main characters are Harry  Hagrid  Ron  Hermione  Snape  Lord Voldemort  and Professor Quirrell  The main setting is at the Dursley s home  and at Hogwarts  I liked this book because I liked the movies and I love magic  I would recommend this book to people who liked the movies and like magic filled books  I would recommend it because it is better than the movie because it has more details  Say you ve spent the first 10 years of your life sleeping under the stairs of a family who loathes you  Then  in an absurd  magical twist of fate you find yourself surrounded by wizards  a caged snowy owl  a phoenix feather wand  and jellybeans that come in every flavor  including strawberry  curry  grass  and sardine  Not only that  but you discover that you are a wizard yourself  This is exactly what happens to young Harry Potter in J K  Rowling s enchanting  funny debut novel  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone    The truth   Dumbledore sighed   It is a beautiful and terrible thing  and should therefore be treated with great caution    This quote explores many great themes from this novel especially in regard to the truth being both a good and bad force  In the nonmagic human world  the world of  Muggles   Harry is a nobody  treated like dirt by the aunt and uncle who begrudgingly inherited him when his parents were killed by the evil Voldemort  But in the world of wizards  small  skinny Harry is famous as a survivor of the wizard who tried to kill him  He is left only with a lightning bolt scar on his forehead  and a host of mysterious powers to remind him that he s altogether different from his aunt  uncle  and spoiled  piglike cousin Dudley   In J K  Rowling s  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone   it tells the thrilling story off an orphaned boy who soon comes to learn that he is a wizard  He also learns off the legacy in which he is famous  Being an orphan  and growing up in a non magical household  he quickly learns everything there is to know about the wizarding world  HE also quickly gains many friends whom often times go on adventures  getting into trouble along the way  One quote that really stuck out to me in this book was   After all  to the well organized mind  death is but the next great adventure   This quote is said as Harry  the main character  just escapes death  for the first time    I really enjoyed this book  I feel like many kids  teens  and adults  can really relate to it  minus the wizard part   and that helps for many to enjoy the book even more  Many can relate to not fitting in  then finding friends  school  going on adventures  and getting into trouble along the way  All these characteristics make the book perfect and for those who have not read it  I would highly suggest it  I instantly became hooked when I finished it and have begun to read the rest of the series   This fantasy is intended for children ages 9 12  It has won many literary awards including Mythopoeic Fantasy Award for Children s Literature in 2008  British Book Award for Children s Book of the Year in 1998  Rebecca Caudill Young Reader s Book Award in 2001  and the American Booksellers Book Of The Year Award for Children in 1999  The book is a story about a tormented orphan named Harry Potter who goes off to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry  Harry must face many fantastical challenges in order to survive the school  I gave this book five stars for its great creativity and imagination  Harry Potter and his friends discover many interesting powers and endure interesting obstacles that require an open mind on magic  There aren t any illustrations in the book because it is not a picture book  It is intended for a slightly older group  who doesn t need illustrations to draw them into the story  The book is appealing to its intended audience because it involves magic and unexplainable events  which children love to explore  Even the language used isn t conventional to normal conversation  We learn new words that have only been introduced in this story  I would have no use for it in an early childhood education setting  but I would definitely recommend it to someone teaching this age group   This is the beginning of my review of the issues and plot holes in the Harry Potter series  volume by volume  which can be found on my blog under the  Novel series  section  You can write a novel with a lot of issues and holes in it if you can only get the readers on your side  If they re like me  they will forgive a lot for an engaging story  It s worth keeping in mind as you write  I m not a fan of series  but this one did keep me engaged and even gave me a few ideas for stories of my own   capitalizing on the plot holes in this one  But I am not about to write a series It felt stupid reviewing a series of novels which pretty much everyone in the western world  and many a one in the east  has read or at least heard of  so I decided to do a different kind of review for this series I always maintain that a writer can get away with pretty much anything with me  as long as they write me a story that s engrossing and has interesting characters  I will overlook plot holes and even a goodly number of spelling or grammar errors  Just entertain me  So the plan here is to look at the plot holes and other problems with this Harry Potter launch vehicle  and later with the other six books  In doing this  we ll see that despite some pathetic problems and hellish holes  Jo Rowling still got the job done and admirably so The main character is now so well known as a heroic figure that it may well have escaped you what a loser he is  Harry Potter is one of the most selfish  lazy  and stupid main characters ever created as we shall see  as I work through all seven volumes  He has very poor self control  few smarts  and no work ethic whatsoever  He s completely unmotivated and he blithely squanders pretty much every chance he s given He will not take advice  will not learn  and flatly refuses to take the golden opportunities to educate himself that are endlessly laid in his lap  He shows little curiosity about the world around him  even though it is quite literally magical  Everything is laid out for him on a platter  yet he does nothing but waste his time and indulge in self obsessive meanderings  He refuses to follow rules and refuses to ask for help even when it s there for the taking  Yet Rowling turned this guy into a hero To be fair to him  he did start out life in one of the most lousy ways imaginable  and we can thank the other loser at Hogwarts  Albus Dumbledore  for that tragedy  Dumbledore and Hogwarts consistently failed students  and Harry in particular  by offering a lousy education which ill prepared them for the dangers which came crashing down on the school in volumes six and seven Continued on my blog     The Magical  Mystical  Awesome Book of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone Wow  This book is some kind of story  No wonder why J K  Rowling became famous after writing this masterpiece  This story boasts some awesome magic that you should probably not try at home  Running through walls to catch a train is not a good idea either  On the sincere side  the story implements a Marxist criticism with its social inequality  It is a shame that magic is fake  because this book s magic would be amazing to use in the real world  Say somebody swiped a nice lady s purse  We would either have to call the police  or chase the person down  If we had Potter magic  there would be no need for the effort  All we would have to do is say  Avada Kedavra   and the assailant would be dead  I mean it s a little harsh  but Harry was just a young wizard in the beginning  so he doesn t know many spells in the Sorcerer s Stone   I believe that J K  Rowling did an excellent job of implementing social inferiority into her story  Harry is born  but must shortly move in with his Aunt and Uncle  the Dursleys  after Voldemort kills his parents  The Dursleys treat Harry with the utmost belligerence  His aunt locks him in the closet  bedroom  numerous times  The Dursleys strongly dislike Harry because he is different than them  He is a descendant of a wizard  and they are dry  plain folks  This social inequality leads to the start of Harry s magical experience at Hogwarts  which I think was the most exciting part of the story   Here a story for anyone whose up to nothing and looking for something In first grade  as a tiny dyslexic child  i would visit the school library daily to admire at the covers of books  Since i always jumbled up my letters   numbers  it was hard for me to read anything  even as short as this book  I was afraid to read  All the other kids could read perfectly and quicker than i ever could  They attained such skill and grace upon absorbing words  as if it were some super power  leaving me as the confused sidekick  or your average Ron Stoppable   I couldn t get into reading books for fun  I didn t understand the craze  I was a movie goer  I loved visuals  Reason being why i only liked books for their covers  In which the covers i remembered the most just so happened to be Harry Potter  I d spend HOURS in the library just to admire the covers  Creating little stories in my head of who Harry was  what he did  what world he was in  i still remember my world of assumptions  I plan to do something with it in the future   I would pick up these books throughout elementary school  but never read them   Believe me i wanted to  I was so desperate to read these books but the fear of sucking at comprehension and understanding ate me away    I feared that my reading would be so terrible that i would just read the book and not register what was going on in the story  As if i would have such a hard time with the words that i wouldn t be able to understand the story at all    I thought i could never be able to read as well and fast as the other students   They used to tease for it every time i picked up a book    Considering the fact that the only books i read were junie b jones and picture books  from 1st to 6th grade  and they were all on 300 page chapter books  Apparently you re an uneducated fool if you read children s books aS A C H I L D     I wasn t at chapter level    And because of that  all i ever did was watch movies as a result  Which i enjoyed a lot  So when the Harry Potter movies came out  you can only imagine how fucking ECSTATIC I WAS    The story was as magically as i pictured and more  I almost cried when i found out how many movies were being made  It was the greatest gift from the universe i ve ever received Until years and years later  when highschool became a pain in my ass   I still didn t read much  I mostly googled summaries and cheats for summer reading and mandatory English Class reads  Junior Year fell into effect  and it was one shit of a year    Possibly the lowest point of my life to the point where all hope was close to being lost in a sea of depression    UNTIL  one study hall  free period  i was stuck in the library   Homework  finished  Projects  done a week ago  Tumblr  blocked b c the school system was and probably still IS a JOKE     i decided to explore  A few books reached out  nice covers  sounded interesting  but not worth the read    Then i came across this book  Nostalgia STRUCK  I felt like a huge piece of me  a part of my youthful happiness was restored to this dark presence i had become  I took the book  found a comfy seat  began reading  and HO LY SHIT    THIS WAS ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS  I HAVE EVER READ  i CANNOT EXPLAIN THE MAGICAL SENSATION THIS BOOK GIVES YOU  THE WAY IT CURES YOUR LONELINESS AND HUGS YOU WITH HUMOR  VIVID DESCRIPTIONS  AMAZING CHARACTERS  HARMONIOUS PLOT TWISTS INTERTWINING SO PERFECTLY WITH THE ENTIRETY OF THE STORYLINE  THIS BOOK PULLED ME OUT OF THE SHITTIEST PERIOD OF MY LIFE  THIS BOOK OPENED ME UP TO THE WORLD AROUND ME AND THE POSSIBILITY OF WORLDS HIDDEN AMONG ME NOW  I HAVE A LIBRARY IN MY ROOM  BOOKS UPON BOOKS UPON MOVIES UPON BOOKS  I M CURRENTLY READING 5 OR SIX BOOKS AT THE MOMENT AND ENJOYING EVERY ONE OF THEM  SINCE HIGHSCHOOL IDK HOW MANY I VE READ  BUT I M GETTING BETTER AT IT EACH DAY  I VE COME TO FIND THAT THE WORDS OF OTHERS WERE THE REASON MY READING KEPT SUCKING AND MY DYSLEXIA COULD BE CONTROLLED IF I PRACTICED MORE  I mean i still jumble  but it s easier for me to control catch myself now NOW  I READ LIKE A MANIAC B C  1 READING IS FUCKING FUNNER THAN EXPECTED AND  2 SCREW 12 YEAR OLD HATERS  I just  WOW     Bottom line  this book altered my entire life and helped me discover a world of my own  Bottom Bottom line  it s not just a book  It s SO much more than you d ever expect it to be and that s why i love it so much and recommend it to EVERYONE  READ  THIS  BOOK       This story is the first book in the Harry Potter series  This book is about a boy named Harry Potter who lives with his Aunt  Uncle  and terrible cousin Dudley  One day  Harry discovers he is a wizard and is taken to a place called Hogwarts to study magic  Within this book  Harry finds out that his parents were killed by an evil wizard named Voldemort and that Voldemort is still alive  Through many adventures with Hermione and Ron  Harry finds the sorcerer s stone and escapes a near death experience by Voldemort  This book is amazing when dealing with imagination  the entire world is made up but is extremely intricate  This book is fairly long though and can get boring at times  This book can be used in the classroom to teach about fiction and magic books  This book is a very good leisure time book and can be a good source to spark imagination  The most beneficial use of this book is to teach about fiction novels and series books Rowling  J K   1997   Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone  New York  NY  Scholastic Inc  I always seem to hear people talking about the Harry Potter series one way or another  as it became a large part of my generation s childhood  However  it wasn t until recently I found out why Rowling s Harry Potter series is in no way for everyone  The way it was written just from reading the first book made it almost inevitable that movies would be adapted from it  Rowling provides many images for your imagination to comprehend  but it can often be overwhelming for readers  However  it may be that those that are more childlike find this book fun to read  because the story line is one that any young person could enjoy Harry Potter was just a baby when his parents mysteriously died  and since then he was always the almost nonexistant child in his aunt s family  Living a life without birthday celebrations or toys or decent meals was only half of his struggle  the worst of his life was the terrible Dursleys  His aunt and uncle absolutely despised him for what seemed to be no reason  Perhaps it was the strange things that always seemed to happen to Harry  His hair grew wild  so wild that not even a terrible hair cut could fix it  because the next day it all mysteriously grew back   and strange things happened particularly when bad things happened to Harry  or whenever one of the Dursleys caused him trouble  What Harry had always assumed coincedence ended up being much  much more  A letter informs him of his being accepted into a wizard school called Hogwarts   but not before his Uncle Vernon goes to extreme measures to try and prevent him from finding out In short  the young child in anyone would adore such a book about the strange world that grows with you  the excitement and danger it holds  and the admirable protagonists  The first installment of the Harry Potter series lets characters relate to feelings almost everyone has had  feelings of fearing acceptance  the relief of making new friends  and the confusion of growing up and facing bullies and school If you re a fan of fantasy  sci fi  and books geared towards children  or the children within us   then I would suggest picking this book up  The pace tends to be quick at some points  but it s worth trying to read if you re curious about the hype  The book can definitely be read into deeply if you want to  but overall it s a nice read if you re looking to get away from the real world or to get cozy and relax for a bit  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone By  J K  RowlingMeaghan G   Spring 2015   Fantasy Scifi  I give this book 5 muggles out of 5 muggles  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone is a really magical and adventurous read  This book of the series starts off with introducing the main character  Harry Potter  and goes through how he becomes a wizard at Hogwarts  Reading this book  I could picture all of the characters  the magical different settings  and the emotions that were all taking place  The author did an amazing job with word choice and imagery selection because I literally felt like I was standing inside of Hogwarts  In the beginning of the book  it talks about how poorly Harry Potter s aunt  uncle  and cousin treats him  I felt so bad for Harry  I wanted to climb inside the book and beat them up  They were absolutely rude  I loved when Harry first gets to Hogwarts because you can feel his emotions of curiosity  excitement  and nervousness  After reading this book  I want an invisible cloak and a giant friend  This book is filled with mysteries as well as magical spells and inventions  This book is directed to middle school students and older  I know after reading this book that it brought out my inner child and I could NOT put it down for a second  I can not wait to keep reading the series   J  K  Rowling has the imagination like nobody else  She created a world that we can relate to but not relate to at the same time  We can relate to it because there is a lot of diversity  in her book Harry Potter the diversity is amongst muggles and wizards  In the book  we see how a young boy named Harry Potter is a wizard but being raised by his muggle aunt and uncle  However  Harry Potter s aunt and uncle hide the fact that he is a wizard and won t even talk about his dead parents  We see the process of Harry Potter learning about who he is  no matter how much his aunt tries preventing it  in a way people usually wouldn t think of  Harry Potter starts having strange events happen to him  He goes to a zoo and he manages to talk to a snake  He s clueless when that happens but he knows something isn t right  His aunt and uncle started receiving letters for Harry but they burn the letters because it s from Hogwarts  a wizard school  One day  hundreds of letters start appearing inside the house for Harry and this giant appears in the house wondering why Harry hasn t responded to the letters  When Harry learns he s a wizard  he gets excited but a bit nervous at the same time  He manages to go to Hogwarts  but he has absolutely no clue what to expect and doesn t know any other wizard there  except two that he met on the train ride there  Throughout the whole time this is happening  you feel like you re with Harry  You can feel his anxiety about going to the school  you can see what the school looks like when he gets there as well as feeling the atmosphere  you can feel his struggle about being in a world he didn t know existed   J  K  Rowling s fantastic writing skills not only made the story come alive  but in a way most people can t do  She not only created a new setting in the book thats fantasy  but she made a whole new world altogether  Although she does write in a way that you might have to get used to  such as using a lot of made up names for spells and things like that  it s not too hard of a read and it leaves you wanting to read more  The book doesn t stop after one  the magic lives through 7 books in the series  Free book for honest review  juliesbookreview blogspot com Harry Potter gets a once in a lifetime chance to get away from the Dursley s  his only surviving family who treat him badly  He has magical powers from his parents who died from Lord Voldemort  a evil wizard  He asks to go to Hogwarts  a magical school for young wizards  Harry has been invited accepted to the school  The Dursley s are not happy and try to keep him from going  When he gets on a train for Hogwarts  he meets his soon to be two best friends  Ron and Hermione and they all get in house of Gryffindor  When halloween comes around a giant is let in Hogwarts Harry and Ron have to save Hermione from the giant  making even closer friends  When Harry and his friends find out about the dark lord  Voldemort  is still alive and wants the Sorcerer s Stone  a magical object that grants immortality  to gain his own body no one believes them  Harry and his friends must find out how and who is protecting and helping the dark lord or else the wizarding world will fall   This book was fantastic  It was full of action and friendship  It has mind blowing secrets and scary parts to the book as well  It was far better than the movie  Kids of all ages will love this book  I give this book a 5 star ratingJames RamseyA middle school Student This is defiantly an odd book for myself  I would like to preface my reason for reading it  I went to London a few weeks back  and inevitably to King s Cross  where Harry was dropped off to go to Hogwarts  and I took a picture where he stood  All of my friends that were there have read the books  and I had not  This was a weird situation for me  since it is usually the other way around  I have never had an interest for contemporary fiction  I have always been the classical type when it comes to stories  Even more  I do not get into science fiction  But out of mere curiosity  I bought the first book  the pervasively famous Sorcerer s Stone  I am glad I did  During the past years of my life I have heard nothing but praise for her work  I now know where they are coming from and they are well grounded  Her simplistic manner through me off guard  there wasn t a vocabulary word I did not recognize  perfect for any age  Even more than her vocabulary  her style of writing kept you intrigued   fast paced and always something new  The characters were well developed  I found myself laughing at the quarrels between Ron and Hermione at the beginning of the story frequently  Above all else  Rowling s creativity is unmatched  I was blown away by her use of mind  There were so many  made up  topics covered in her book that one seems to question how she come up with all of this  I wonder what she was doing  her state of mind  as she was writing these books  Her vicarious readings must have been witchcraft  followed with some books that centered on profound characters  Her process perplexes me  but I guess we all have that notion towards the greatest of writers  I do wish to continue the series  but there are more pressing matters in my life at the moment  My feet are wet  and will come back when the time is right   Harry Potter and The Sorcerer s Stone Review I have always been fascinated with a world of magic and adventure  I ve longed for it ever since I was a kid and in this book I have been able to escape into that world  J  K  Rowling made me feel as if i was enrolled into Hogwarts with Harry  In the book you follow the famous Harry Potter The Boy Who Lived  Harry is a lonely confused boy when he arrived at Hogwarts but quickly found friends with Hermione and Ron  This trio goes on an adventure of your wildest dreams with flying brooms  dragons  and wild beasts  But they run into trouble with their arch enemies The Slytherin especially Malfoy and Snape who try to ruin their year and get them expelled  Heemione is the reason I loved this book  She was born as a wizard into a human family  And I can relate being different from what you were supposed to grow up to be  She had such a strong voice in this book to the misfits in the world   J K  Rowling s writing style in this book is very simple but elaborate at the same time  She is able to tell the story so well the book will consume you so much you can t put it down   Overall Harry Potter and The Sorcerer s Stone is a classic book that I think everyone should read  I would give this book a five out of five stars  It is definitely one of my favorite books of all time  This is the first and only book I was required to read in high school  I attended Ecorse High School in Ecorse  a very small suburb of Detroit  This is also only the 2nd book I had the privilege of reading  I believe I was a Sophomore or Junior  that makes the year 2002 or 2003  At this time  I was unaware a movie had come out  I remember being very engrossed in this book  I had been writing in my journals for years at this point  My journals were full of nonfiction and teenage angst and my shenanigans of the previous weekends  My imagination didn t have any say in my writing  This book opened my eyes to something playful and difficult  Harry is a boy raised in a small closet by his aunt and uncle  He s very strange and different compared to his cousin and other kids  I immediately felt close to Harry  Growing up in a difficult situation and feeling a little different from everyone myself  And the magic  To create something new and play with dimensions was so new to me  I highly recommend this book to children who need more imagination in their lives  And doesn t everybody  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone by J K  Rowling  I used to watch the film when I was young and this year I felt like I should read the book so i can tell the different between the film and the book  I enjoyed reading this book even though it s a lot and also it s totally different form the movie  For example on the scene the they were in the big room toward the ends for the book  the book tells all the detail of the room and explain all the feeling or the character which it s hard to see on the movie and that s why I enjoyed reading it because it s a great book  When I was reading this book it reminds me when I was young playing with my friend and pretend like I was one of the character from the movie  I think the writing is powerful and beautiful  I can feel how powerful all the characters were by just reading it  The strength of the book would be the detail on the book which we can imagine while reading it  I would recommend this book to everyone and all the ages  because it s not easy book and it s also not complicated and I m sure people will not regret reading it  That s not a mistake in the title for this book  I own a British published copy of the book  thanks  Sis   where a bunch of the vocabulary is different  My children are finally old enough to have it read to them  so we are starting the series  They have seen the movie and were curious about differences  though there are hardly any with the first two books and movies  They enjoyed it immensely This was my first re reading in over ten years  For me  as an adult whose already read it twice before  the story is still exciting  I forgot how Rowling s early writing style leaned more to fairy tale  The oppressed boy who has a fabulous destiny awaiting him is fairly common but has a freshness here thanks to the modern day setting  The story moves quickly and has an amazing amount of detail in it about the wizarding world which makes a nice contrast to our everyday world  Some of the detail is light satire  Quidditch s crazy rules are a parody of cricket  though my favorite bit of satire is the history professor who died in his sleep but keeps teaching classes as a ghost   Most of it is just plain great storytelling  The book doesn t get old and I m looking forward to reading the next one with Jacob and Lucy soon  Harry Potter and The Sorcerers StoneAuthor  Jk RowlingBook review by  Daniel HemmingerThe book I read was  Harry Potter And The Sorcerers Stone  by JK Rowling  In this magical story  there is a boy named Harry Potter  Harry thought he was just an average boy  with no special powers  Harry soon finds out he is a wizard  a very famous wizard  Hogwarts  which is the wizards school  soon invites Harry to come to to their school and learn magic  While at Hogwarts  Harry meets Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley who both become Harry s best friends JK Rowling s theme for the book is trust  The book was was easy to read and had a lot of meaning to it  JK Rowling did a nice job writing this book  One thing I learned after reading Harry Potter  was that always to trust your friends even in the darkest time  For instance  during the first night at Hogwarts  Hermione was in the bathroom when a huge troll came in and attacked her  Ron and Harry were close and saved Hermione s life  This book was very good and I would recommend it I would rate this book 5 out of 5  Harry Potter was a easy read but still a great book  This book expresses a lot of emotion  wether it s celebrating the first night at school  or dreading a potions test  this book has it all  Harry Potter is a great book  Defiantly would recommend it   This book came out when I was seven years old  My copy is stained  falling apart and is my most cherished book  I grew up with this series and remember waiting and waiting and waiting for the next one to be released  Nothing will ever compare to the story of Harry Potter  J K  Rowling is a genius  She is my inspiration for wanting to be  and becoming  a writer  Her imagination gave my childhood so many memories  I read every book to my brother   he s five year younger than me   and every Easter  for some reason  we always watch the movies  I find the most amazing thing about this series is that the books grew up with the readers  I was seven when Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone was first released and I was seventeen when Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows brought a conclusion to the most magical adventure ever written  Over ten years Harry  Ron and Hermione grew up along side me  and even though I ve read the series seven times through now  I still enjoy it as much as the first time and the morals of friendship and love will never be lost on me   Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone is an amazing book  When I read it  i feel like I am placed in the halls of Hogwarts  among the witches and wizards  It makes me want Hogwarts to actually exist  It makes me want to be a witch waving my wondrous wand  turning socks into snakes and back again  I wish there was a platform of nine and three quarters to board the train to a new dimension  Books like this and the Chronicle of Narnia  fantasy books in general  awaken my soul  Sounds corny  I m being completely serious though  I can feel magic course through my veins as I flip page after page  I want to be best friends with Hermione  Harry and Ron  I want to do magic  I want to explore every crack of corner of Hogwarts and just have fun  I really wish I could do what Harry can do it  No but honestly  how cool would it to be able to do magic  I want to go out and buy a cloak now I also wrote a poem I want to fly on broomsticksI want to play quidditch in the sky I want to wear a cloak all dayAnd mae rainy days dryWith a flick of the wristAnd a tap of my wandAll my troublesAll my worries will be gone I thought Harry Potter was an interesting  mystery book with a little humour  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone was also an actioned pact book with a very peculiar plot and on unexpected twist in the end  The main characters are Harry Potter  Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger  Harry Potter is an adventurous young boy at the age of 12  His friend Ron is an unlucky red haired boy who is friends with an extremely smart girl named Hermione Granger Harry s parents met an unusual death at the hand of the evil wizard Voldemort  so Harry went to live with his mean Aunt and Uncle  Harry thinks he is an ordinary boy  but he is a wizard  He goes to a special school for witchcraft and wizardry  Harry and his friends search for the Sorcerer s Stone which holds incredible powers  While doing this  Harry and his friends have many thrilling adventures The creation of Hogwarts is truly magnificent  I d love to go there  Not only did it create a great fantasy  but it also related to everyday life by including the muggles  non magic folk  and writing about everyday problems that a normal kid like myself might encounter  Overall I think that Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s stone is an amazing book and recommend it to EVERYONE  Enjoy the rest of the series too   The day he turns 11  Harry gets an unexpected visitor Named Hagrid  He has been neglected by his aunt and uncle and their son  Dudley  since he showed up 10 years ago after his mother and father died  He has been accepted to Hogwarts School of Witch craft and Wizardry  He noticed he does strange things happened when he dreaded something or got overly happy  He noticed strange things involving a certain teacher at school and became suspicious  One night when the Headmaster  Albus Dumbeldore  had to go away on a trip Harry went to where he thought the suspicious teacher wanted to get to  knowing if he was caught he could face expulsion One reason I think people should read this book is because it explores the world of magic like no other book I have read  The author  J K  Rowling  does an excellent job of using plenty of censor images to describe how she sees the wizarding world  It does a great job of luring your imagination into what could you do if you were a wizard  The vast wizard drinks and food that they eat in the book makes you want to dive in and devour the whole scene Another reason I like this book is because it is fast paced and can keep any reader interested  One of the most interesting scenes in my opinion is when Harry is first learning how to ride a broom  Also  another interesting scene is when a girl  Hermione  is crying in the bathroom because people were making fun of her  So  she was in the bathroom and a magical creature got into the castle and found its way into the bathroom she was in crying  That is when Harry and his best friend  Ronald Weasley  had been in the feast and were told to go upstairs to their dorms and remembered that they had made Hermione cry and went to find her The last reason I like this book is because you never know what you are going to get at every turn  An example of this is when Harry first learned how to ride a broomstick  He did something he was not supposed to and I thought he would be punished but instead he was granted the privilege to play on the Quidditch team  the wizarding game that resembles soccer  If you like the first couple chapters of the first book then you will be hooked for the whole series  This is a book about a boy named Harry Potter and him learning about magic  His aunt and uncle  take care  of him until something happens when he is 11  He starts getting letters from someone that knows the exact place he lives  His uncle doesn t wantt to get anymore letters  but they just kept coming and coming until his uncle snaps  They moved to a hotel but the letters still came and then they moved to an island  On Harry s birthday a man named Hagrid came to the island and gave Harry s couzin a tail and his first present  Hagrid explained it all how Harry was a wizard and how his parents had really died  Hagrid took Harry shopping for supplies got something else for hogwartz  Harry eventually went to Hogwarts and met 3 important people his two best friends Ron and Herminone  and his enamy  At first Herminone wasn t their friend  but then was saved by the two  His enamy was Malfoy  he once tricked Harry into a duel late at night but he never showed up  Hardy barely made it back to his bed without being expelled  Harry became a member of the quittage team and his first game was cursed by supposedly Snape  As they went through the year Hagrid had obtained a dragon egg in exchange for some information  The dragon quickly grew too large and had to be given away  Harry and Hermione had to sneak it through the castle at night where they gave it to Ron brother who worked with dragons  They pulled it off  but got in trouble along with Malfoy who also sneaked out at night and Neville who had tried to warn Harry  Their punishment was to go into the woods where they met Voldemort and a few centaurs that saved him  After the punishment the tried to figure out why Voldemort was there and came to the conclusion he was after the sorcerers stone  They found out everything about the stone and decided to go after it  They studied for their exams and took them then went through the trials to get the stone  The had to put Fluffy to sleep  go through the devil snare catch keys  play chess  pass a logic puzzle  and finally Harry faced Snape or Voldemort  When Harry saw who it was he was shocked Professor Quirrel was there looking at a mirror that showed him what he wanted  He pulled off his turban to reveal Voldemort was combined with him  Harry somehow got the stone and when Quirrel tried to get it he was burned because Harry was full of so much love  Harry and his friends recovered and they all passed their exams with good marks  I really enjoyed this book  because I couldicture what was happening as I read  I also liked how J K Rowling wrote  This book starts off the best book series ever written  Harry Potter has been known by wizards around the world since the day he was almost killed  He has been living with his muggle aunt  uncle  and cousin for years without even knowing what he truly is  until he gets a letter accepting into Hogwarts  a school for wizards where he meets many friends that he will never forget  All in all  if you are in search for a thriller this is the book for you  This book is simply the best book you will ever read  Imagine you re sitting at home one day and all of a sudden the mysterious letters start to appear  Imagine living with a mean uncle and aunt and not knowing anything about your past and then a giant shows up and knocks down your door  Well that is what happened to Harry Potter in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone  Harry was brought to his aunt and uncle when he was still a little baby after his parents were killed in what they told Harry was a car accident  He then received several letters delivered by owls from a place he s never heard of before  Hogwarts School of WitchCraft and Wizardry  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone is a thrilling and exciting book  J K  Rowling really knows how to draw your attention and keep it  The details she uses are vivid and keeps you want you to read deep into the night  This is the first book in the series and it is a good and exciting way to start it off  This book shows and depicts Harry living with his mean aunt and uncle and his cousin Dursley who treat him like hes nothing  Harry starts to wonder why strange things start to happen and he can t explain it  but on his eleventh birthday things change when letters start to come with an overly large man named Hagrid  Harry finds out about his past and what really happened to his parents  He eventually goes off to Hogwarts School of WitchCraft and Wizardry where he meets countless witches  wizards  mystical creatures and so many more interesting things that he has never seen before  The suspense keeps you on the edge of your seat reading chapter after chapter  Harry meets his first year classmates and he becomes best friends with Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger and they embark on journeys throughout the book that shows how courageous the can be in the face of danger when the very same person that killed Harry s parents comes back to try and kill him What if these events happened to you  How would you feel if you were lied to all your life about your past  and then someone you don t know comes and tells you that you re a wizard  Well  imagine how Harry feels after having to leave the best friends that he s ever known and the place he d love to be more than anything go back to living with his nasty Aunt and Uncle and their even nastier son  If you re looking to read more then try reading the second book in the series were Lord Voldemort comes back again  but this is Harry still at Hogwarts to stop him  What can I say about harry potter  There are no words  It means everything to me  It s completely changed my life  It s been as big a part of who I am as anything since I read it at the age of 10  Harry potter has a kind of unique and real magic about it that exists in only 7 books in this world  You fall in love with the characters  You cry and laugh with them  You know you will stay with them whatever happens  because there is no turning back  And hopefully you will reread them over and over as long as you live  hopefully you will keep coming back  because knowing what will happen does not in any way erase the wonder of these 7 books  There is a feeling that comes along with a true love for harry potter  a feeling that you have been through all the ups and downs and victories and losses with the characters  and that their world is now yours  and mingled with the crushing sadness of the deaths and defeats  is the knowledge that however much you ve been through with these fictional yet very real characters  however many tears you ve shed  you wouldn t trade this adventure for the world  and no matter what happens  their world is yours and you could never truly leave it if you wanted to  and you will let this be part of your very soul  and you will be there until the end and forever beyond  And maybe you  like me  will know that you could be a straight A student if you spent half the time you spend studying harry potter studying your schoolwork  but you will stay up all night rereading to escape  And maybe you  like me  will believe that  just as Voldemort has traveled further then any man along the path to immortality  you yourself have traveled further then any fangirl or boy along the path labeled with the sign  those who love harry potter the most of anybody  this way   because this is so much more them fangirlism  Maybe you  like me  will commit these books books to memory  maybe you will treat these books as a bible and study these words  maybe you will win every harry potter trivia contest in existence  But merely knowing the facts isn t what matters  it s the feelings  and how most people don t understand the magic that harry potter brings into ones life  and how you must go back and repeat those journeys  and how your life will never  ever be the same  no matter how many people say that you ll grow out of it Books can truly change lives  Books aside from harry potter have changed my life  But nothing is quite like it  This has not been the first time I ve written a review of harry potter  nor the first time I ve attempted to describe what it is to me  I ve long ago come to the conclusion that no words in any language exist to accurately describe what it has done for me  These reviews  these descriptions and overviews  any that you will ever read  will barely scratch the surface of what harry potter is  There is one solution  to read the series again and again  and if you ve never read it then to do so  Read it to understand  and then  if it means this much to you  hold on to that  Don t let the magic out of your life  Ignore the  it s time to stop reading children s books   and the  you ll grow out of it   because there is no age you have to be for this  Read these books and read them to your children  and when you are too old to do so yourself  find someone to read them to you  Never let the magic out of your life as long as you live  Because there is one thing that keeps harry potter alive  that keeps the magic going  the people who love it  The people who spread the series and don t forget how much it means  Be someone who doesn t let it die  Know what it means and know that you can never describe it  Bring these books with you  wherever you might live  and read them whenever you can  Tape the pages back together when they fall apart and let your children grow up hearing about Harry  Keep these books inside you  and know that no matter where you end up in life  you will have a home inside of them  As our queen once said   Hogwarts will always be there to welcome you home    DUH ITS HARRY POTTAAAA  This book  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone  was a good book  If you read the book  you can see that the authors purpose for writing this novel is to entertain the reader  Harry Potter is the protagonist of the story and you will see him in crazy situations  like how at the beginning Harry went to the zoo and the snake started talking to him  This book is fiction about the protagonist  Harry Potter  who finds out he is a wizard and goes to a magic school known as hogwarts  This novel does a good job at keeping the story mysterious and wonderous  The theme of this book is how sometimes it is ok to rebel  Many times in the book you will see harry breaking the rules at hogwarts  When harry was growing up  he always had to live by really strict rules  For harry to break a rule is big and shows how sometimes it s ok to break the rules  This novel is a third person narration  This book is a narration because the novel tells the story through events that happen to harry in chronological order  I have not read many books in this type of format  however I did think that this novel did this format well  This was a good format for the novel because it allows the author to explain why harry had to live with his aunt and uncle in a way that it sounds good and is appealing  This format was also good for writing a novel in general  that way it isn t confusing the reader  I liked this style personally because it make it easy to read and interesting to read as well  with everything that is in this book I thought  personally  it was a great book  I did think that the beginning was a bit slow because It kept repeating the idea that there is something different about harry  but besides that I thought the book was great  I would recommend this book to anyone who likes strange stories and fiction  FANTASYHarry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone by J K  Rowling is a captivating book that takes readers on a magical journey from start to finish  Harry Potter is a young boy who has been living with his aunt and uncle  the Dursley s  for as long as he can remember  They are dreadful people who see Harry as a nuisance  One fateful day  Harry receives a letter inviting him to Hogwarts and learns all about what the Dursley s have been hiding from him all along I would read this book aloud to children in grades 3 5  leaning more towards 4th and 5th grades  Teachers should know their students  and their parents  before choosing to read this book  as some find it controversial  I can see so many fun  enriching activities spawning from reading this book  Students could write letters to the characters giving them advice or asking them questions  They could write their own short stories making up their own spell or potion and go on from there  The class could be divided into  houses   Gryffindor  Slytherin  Ravenclaw  Hufflepuff  for some kind of reward system  I think this book opens the door for a lot of awesome  advanced writing practice  I loved reading this book and I m glad I did because I feel it will help me relate to my future students  as many children have read this series  I definitely recommend reading this book  Good  After finally seeing all of the movies I decided to read the books  And doing that was the best thing I could do  Like all books the Sorcerer s Stone had so much detail and anticipation which made me love the book  and J K Rowling wrote with a sense of making the reader stay on the edge of their seats   The Sorcerer s Stone is a book about a young boy by the name of Harry Potter who  by the time he turns 11  will have his like flip upside down  When he was only a few months old Harry s parents died in a  car accident   at least that s what he was told  leaving him to live with his Aunt Petunia  Uncle Vernon  and Cousin Dudley  all of which who hated Harry  The Dursleys are a  picture perfect  family and want everyone else to think so  but they are highly ashamed of Harry and wish no one knew he lived with them because it would ruin their  image  so they hid Harry in the closet under the stairs  And after years of being rude and treating Harry like he was nothing it was a shock to them when owls began going to their house trying to give Harry a letter  Uncle Vernon who knew what the letter was for did everything he could to stop Harry from seeing the letters  Of course that fail and harry soon found out he was a wizard and his parents were killed by the strongest wizard of all Lord Voldemort  Harry also found out that Voldemort tried to kill him too  but something strange happened and Voldemorts curse backfired  leaving Harry with a legendary scar on his forehead  After learning all of this Harry soon found himself at Hogwarts  a school for witches and wizards  Being there he learned what it was like to truly be a wizard and had fun until he ran into Voldemort again  But being the famous Harry Potter he managed to defeat Voldemort again and was happy  until summer came and he had to go back to the Dursleys and wait for school to start again   Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone by J K  RowlingThis is first book in its series and is a great read for anyone who enjoys reading fantasy stories  I read the book having already seen the films which was definitely a mistake on my part  The books allow for so much more detail and understanding of the characters  I can see the excitement of reading the stories and not knowing what will happen next  It tells the story of a young boy named Harry Potter who after spending first 11 years of his life living in the cupboard under the stairs at his auntie and uncles house  finds out he is actually a wizard  It explores the journey of Harry from being bossed around by his cousin Dudley  to learning spells and becoming a brilliant wizard  There is an element of mystery to the book with Harry being a part of a big secret which relates to the scar he has on his head  The book is also quite funny and appeals to children who like to read books that have laugh out loud moments  Children can get lost in the relatable world of Harry Potter which is set in a school  Along with the fantastic magical elements  it also explores the normal day to day challenges that school brings  such as friendships  hard work and disagreements  Having read this as an adult I can see it will appeal to a wide range of people  I think it would particularly appeal to anyone aged 8   After growing up year after year watching and loving the Harry Potter movies  I thought it wise to read the books  finally  I knew the books would be different and I was right  but in my opinion it was a good different  A lot of things that were brushed off in the movies with no explanation were explained which will give me a deeper connection when I watch them again  But this is a book review so maybe I should start actually reviewing it The character development in this book is phenomenal  its quick and right on the nose  When a new character is introduced the few words they say or the way they approach a situation gets you a really good feeling for what the character is going to be like for the rest of the book  but of course there are surprises  With development done well its easy to get connected with the characters  making it intense when a character gets in a bad situation with a threat of getting caught where they re not supposed to be or   you know   death  I don t care what anybody says Peeves is the best character and him being cut from the movie is a tragedy I say   a tragedy The story is just the way I like it  easy to understand and full of mystery  We know Harry was attacked by an evil wizard but we don t how he survived  especially since he was a wee baby Potter   We know Voldemort disappeared after the Harry Potter incident  but we don t know why and how he may come back  Everybody loves a good mystery but what can really destroy a story is over complication  luckily J K  Rowling is a genius to keep it simple  even with describing the world there is enough for you to feed the imagination but not overdoing it  The trickling of puzzle pieces has a good pace  there was never a point where I was getting anxious for the next bit of important information to be found  there was no useless filling to extend the number of pages  Everything had a purpose  This is a story that could interest and entice a variety of ages it may have not been intended for  to me at least  that is a mark of a great adventure This a book I can t recommend enough  I can t wait to read the next book in the series  This book  as many people already know  is amazing  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone by J K  Rowling is a unique and indescribable story of a world where there are wizards as well as humans  The author tells the story of a young boy  Harry Potter  who finds out that he is a wizard and soon is going to attend a school for people like him  Little does he know that although he was overlooked in the human world  he is a living legend in the wizard world  This book shows Harry s experiences at Hogwarts  his new school  and in his new life  He faces many challenges and with the help of his friends  is able to find solutions  This book was very fast paced and exciting that it was a quick read but it was still a pretty long book  J K  Rowling takes the reader on an adventure and makes the reader feel as if they were in the book with the characters  I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who is looking for an amazing  fast paced read  and can handle suspense  This book is an exceptional story that will amaze the reader no matter what kind of person they are  As a child  I was in love with the Harry Potter series  In fact  I am just as in love now as I was in first grade  Rowling provides a wonderful imaginary  yet believable world full of fantastic plots and nail biting scenes  I think what I loved about this book as a child was the adventures that Harry  Ron  and Hermione had  From traveling on the Hogwarts Express for the first time to navigating their way around Fluffy the Three Headed Dog  there was never a dull moment  As I have read the story over the years  I have learned to appreciate the characters themselves and the relationships they form with each other  The close friendships Harry  Ron  and Hermione form are truly incredible and Dumbledore is the guiding mentor that I always wanted to have  Rowling makes the characters relatable and easy to understand  which is one of the stronger suits of the story  She also does a fantastic job of setting it up for the next book  but having a good ending to conclude the tale of the Sorcerer s Stone Like any book  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone has its strengths and weaknesses  The creativity of the story is definitely its strong point  The Wizarding World takes me far away from this world and I truly get to experience the magical world of Harry Potter  Rowling presents the book so clearly that I can imagine the setting and characters in detail  I can hear their voices in my head and I feel like I am a part of the story  not just reading it  The one weakness that this book has its focus on the Dursleys  While it is important to stress the importance of Harry s miserable childhood  a whole chapter did not need to be devoted to Dudley s birthday  Overall  the story is fantastic and does not deserve any less than five stars  I strongly recommend reading it  I read this series in Elementary school  Twice  I had two friends who were obsessed  and after reading this series all I would read was fantasy  which meant I ended up reading a lot of not so good ones  So when I  this past summer  had a Harry Potter movie marathon with my best friend Andrea  we only got to the third  and then decided to re read them again  I guess I was thinking that they probably weren t as great as I remember saying they were  I read them right during the hype  right  WRONG  I love these books  I love these characters  I love that the more I re read these books the more I get from them and the more I see their growth and the little things  I love that J K  Rowling s Wizarding World Hogwarts is a place I can disappear into   I can go there  even if I sadly might ve given up hope on receiving my Hogwarts letter  sigh   there s still hope I could turn into mermaid by some strange force of nature  right  There s a really sweet Buzzfeed article that I ll link below about people reading the Harry Potter series  It s different  It s exceptional  I could talk about so many tiny things in this series that are just so honestly incredible  Article  http   www buzzfeed com jenniferschaf    I have read this book several times  The opening book of the Harry Potter series is relatively simple compared to the later books but it does an excellent job of introducing readers  young and not so young  into the world of magic that is strategically hidden from us Muggles and making us want to know more about Harry and his friends The book opens by introducing the reader to Harry Potter and his family   an aunt  uncle  and similarly aged cousin  Harry s aunt and uncle were charged to care for him after his parents were murdered by an evil wizard  but they are not pleased about this and have not treated Harry particularly well while he has been in their care  As Harry approaches his eleventh birthday  letters start to arrive  welcoming him to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry  This is also where Harry first starts to learn the truth about what happened to his parents as well as his magical heritage and fame within the wizarding world As the story continues  Harry makes his way to school and begins to learn about the culture that his aunt and uncle have hidden from him his entire life  He makes what seem to be his first real friends  faces bullies  and always fights for what he believes is right  While some people are opposed to the Harry Potter books because of the presence of magic  these concerns are misplaced  These books are not about teaching kids how to do magic  they are  at their core  about being true to one s self and doing what is right when it is not easy  I would think that those lessons would be valuable to any child  wizard or not  It doesn t even need to be said that the Harry Potter series is the best children s book series of all time  I read this book when I was a child  around nine or so and have loved Harry and all his allies ever since  The story of an orphaned  mistreated boy who discovers that he possesses the gift of magic and goes to a special school for witches and wizards in order to develop his magical skills and his sense of identity has a timelessness to it that follows the traditional Bildungsroman narrative structure  Rowling is a master at creating a compelling story rooted in morality without coming on so strongly as to be preachy  Children learn the values of true friendship and standing up for what is right even in the face of great adversity through an enriching tale of a heroic child  while adults enjoy the charm and complexity of Harry s world and the struggles he faces  I would recommend this book and the entire Harry Potter series to everyone with a love for fantasy  magic and inspiring heroism a thousand times over  I absolutely loved this book  I would reccomend this book to anyone who likes a story that constantly keeps you on the edge of you seat  This is a story about a kid Harry Potter  When Harry Was a baby both of his parents were killed by a wizard called Voldemort  Hagrid and Mr  Dumbledoor left Harry on his aunt and uncles door step  They were horrible to Harry  The pushed him around bullied him under fed him and he never got one birthday card or present  They knew he was a wizard so the shut him out from society  Harry never new that he was a wizard  One day Harry got a letter in the mail  He didn t get to read it  His uncle ripped it out of his hands and forbid him from reading it  More letters were coming everyday but he could never read them  His uncle took them away from the house to get away from the letters  Hagrid found Harry and gave the letter to him  Harry opened the letter  It was from Hogwarts  a Wizard School  Harry was suprised he didn t know he was a wizard  The paper showed all of the suplies that he would need and where when and how to get there  Hagrid took Harry to the Wizard bank to take out money for school suplies  On September 1 Harry went to platform3 3 4 to take a train to school  On the train Harry met someone named Ron  they became really good friends  When the got to the school  it was time for the chooseing ceremony  You could etiher be placed in Raveclaw  Slynthrin  Gryfindor or hufflepuff  Harry gets choosen to be in Gryfinindor  During flying practice someone got hurt so the teacher had to take them inside  Someone stole something so Harry tried to get it back  The teacher came out in time to see him flying  As she brough him inside he was sure he was getting expeled  Insted she offered him a spot on the quidditch team as the seeker  Harry heard about something called the sorcerers stone  It is a stone that makes you live forever  He finds out Voledamort is after it  Will Voldemort find it and become the greated Wizard  or will someone else find it first  Re reading Hp is always therapeutic http   littlecurlyfawn blogspot com 2   Till now there s been no magic for Harry Potter  He lives with the miserable Dursleys and their abominable son  Dudley  Harry s room is a tiny closet beneath the stairs  and he hasn t had a birthday party in eleven years But then a mysterious letter arrives by owl messenger  a letter with an invitation to an incredible place called Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry  And there he finds not only friends  flying sports on broomsticks  and magic in everything from classes to meals  but a great destiny that s been waiting for him    if Harry can survive the encounter  DISCLOSURE  For years I was never allowed to even watch the Harry Potter movies  My dad  who is a huge fantasy lover  always said it was alright and that it would be a good teaching moment  but my mom was wary in letting her children watch something like that  with good reasons that I respect her for   It wasn t until I was 16 that I finally was allowed to sit down and watch the movies  and at 17 I am just now reading the books  I would only recommend this series if you are grounded in your faith and can enjoy the story without taking it to heart in an evil sense  I  personally  am able to just read it and search for the Truth of God that is in everything  and then leave it at that  If you stumble in this area  I do not advise you to pick up this series  You must be able to distinguish between reality and fiction But  if you are like me and can distinguish it  it is such a good story with so much truth  God s presence is in everything  and I mean everything   even if it was not created by a Christian  One of the things my writing instructor has said in his curriculum that covers the basics on writing fantasy is that      To avoid any stories that challenge my beliefs is tantamount to an admission that my worldview is weak  that it cannot handle reality  Furthermore  it robs me of the opportunity to see Truth assert itself over lies that are as old and as tired as civilization  T H E G O O DThis story was so innocent  with a clear definition of good and evil  J  K  Rowling is such a phenomenal writer  and honestly  my favorite part of the book was just reading the names of different people such as  Dudley   or  Flitwick   I hurt for Harry when he was with the Dursleys  and even after he came to Hogwarts and was tormented by Draco Malfoy  although I secretly am in love have a tiny crush on Tom Felton   Ron and Hermione were such a perfect bunch for Harry  although Hermione wasn t really apart of their friend group until closer towards the end of the book  I m thinking it was once Harry and Ron stopped the troll in the bathrooms    I loved their innocence  and I can definitely relate more towards Hermione than anyone  or Neville  if you want to take into account my extreme clumsiness   Overall  it s a beautifully written tale T H E B A DQuite plain and simple  it s a story about children learning witchcraft and wizardry  although it is not the type of witchcraft that is present in this world   I would advise anyone who has a harder time distinguishing between fiction and reality from reading this series One a literature standpoint  I was annoyed at how Harry could not seem to control some of his anger  or how he and Ron got into a stupid little tussle over the Mirror of Erised  but I think having flaws is what makes a hero relatable and not like a piece of cardboard  so if that was the only thing in the novel that was annoying  J  K  Rowling definitely did a good job There was one use of the word da   in the novel  near the beginning  and said by Uncle Vernon if I am correct   I don t like swear words in books at all  so I was not happy with this O V E R A L L S T A R R A T I N G 5 5 starsJ  K  Rowling is the author of the beloved  bestselling  record breaking Harry Potter series  She started writing the

s by J K  Rowling  in the last two weeks of 2014  I read this book because everyone would make fun of me not reading it and that I have to read it  It s all about the life of Harry Potter and how he finds out about him becoming a young wizard  Harry s parents are killed by a powerful evil wizard  who after he was finished killing the parents  he raised his wand and attempted to kill the baby Harry  The spell hit Harry s forehead leaving a scar shaped like a lightning bolt  and he survived  The evil wizard  Voldemort  vanished and was left with barely any energy about to die  In the middle of the night the Dursley household s doorbell rang  There was a baby that was to left in the Dursely s care Harry now lived with his Uncle and Aunt and their spoiled  fat  pig like son  Harry is basically living like a rat in a cupboard upstairs and his Aunt and Uncle hate him  After 10 years  there was suspicious mail arriving for Harry everyday  Mr  Dursely was hiding the fact that Harry

Hogwarts  Harry is now accompanied by wizards and witches just like him  Harry makes friends  but he also makes a couple enemies that try and make his life miserable  Meanwhile  Voldemort is still regaining his power and has people inside Hogwarts trying to get revenge on Harry Potter I really enjoyed the ending because it answered all of the questions I had at the beginning of the book  The book ended but I still wanted to keep reading  Rowling purposely left the readers wanting more  My favorite part in the book is when Draco Malfoy  one of Harry s enemies  steals his snow globe and the begin to pursuit in a chase on their broomsticks This book is an absolute must read for kids  It is an amazing book and a great start for what I hope to be an amazing series  I liked it so much and now I am already on the book three in the series  You should read this book if you like fantasies  Rowling always makes you want to read more by leaving you hanging and still having questions  Overall I really liked this book and I suggest it for all the kids that like fantasies  In the first book of a great series   Harry Potter and The Sorcerer s Stone  by J K Rowling  the character Harry Potter lives a new life compared to how he had lived before  He used to live with his aunt and uncle because his parents died when he was a baby  Voldemort killed his parents  Harry receives a letter which was dropped off by an owl  It was an invitation to Hogwarts  a wizard school  From then on good and bad things happen to Harry  I have a lot of favorite parts in the book  but one of them is the quidditch match and when Harry discovers the Mirror of Erised   The quidditch match is a game that goes on at the school  People fly around on brooms and try to score as many points as the can for their team by putting the balls through the hoops or catching the golden snitch  which is the most amount of points  Harry was the seeker  which means he was the only one trying to get the golden snitch  It was a rough battle and Harry was losing control of his broom and everyone thought he was going to fall  But he got back up  The seeker from the other team was going against Harry and they were pushing each other back and forth  Harry saw the snitch  stood up on his broom reached for it but then fell  Everyone gasped  Harry got up from the ground and was holding his stomach as if he was about to get sick  but then the snitch came out of his mouth  Harry said   I ve got the snitch   He held it up and everyone was cheering for him Another one of my favorite parts is when Harry discovers the Mirror of Erised  He looks into the mirror and sees his mother and father standing  and smiling at him  Dumbledore soons finds Harry staring at the mirror all alone  He asks Harry if he knows what the mirror shows us and he said no  So Dumbledore explain it to Harry and says   The happiest man on earth would be able to use the Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror and see himself exactly as he is   Then Harry says   It shows us what we want   whatever we want    This shows us that Harry looks into this mirror because he wishes his mother and father were still alive  So he looks into the mirror just to see them  This book was a great book and had many good parts in it  My favorite parts were the quidditch match and the Mirror of Erised  I really liked this book and it makes me wish that I had magic powers too   i loved the novel even more than i loved the movie  It was amazing  I guess  there s six more to go  pThe following lines are my favorite ones _ It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live _ I show not your face but your heart desire _ Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself _ What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret  so  naturally  the whole school knows The poem Enter  stranger  but take heed Of what awaits the sin of greed  For those who take  but do not earn  Must pay most dearly in their turn  So if you seek beneath our floors A treasure that was never yours  Thief  you have been warned  beware Of finding more than treasure there The song Oh  you may not think I m pretty  But don t judge on what you see  I ll eat myself if you can find A smarter hat than me  You can keep your bowlers black  Your top hats sleek and tall  For I m the Hogwarts Sorting Hat And I can cap them

title for this book is Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone  It was changed because certain countries might have thought it was about philosophy  I still stick by that title  and if you want to think of it as  sorcerers  when you read it  then that s great  but if you prefer the original  as I do  then remember  Philosopher s Okay  now for the review  Now I have to say that I was very  very young when I read this  I remember getting it second hand from my grandma and not reading it for a while  but I am so  so glad that I did  An outstanding start to the series  Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone is about a young boy  who had been mistreated and basically ignored by his aunt and uncle  his parents had died when he was a baby  so he had been sent to live with the Dursleys   getting an invite to a magical school  This  of course changing everything  This book it complete magic from start to end  With floating candles  deluminators  talking snakes  mountain trolls  flying broomsticks  golden snitches  devils snare  invisibility cloaks and so much more  it is a must read If  at first  this does not seem like an appealing book  then I urge you to read it anyway  I didn t think it would be good  but I read it nonetheless  as well as the rest of the series  and now I m proud to say that I am a huge Harry Potter fangirl  Always  Harry Potter Series has always been and will always be my favorite book series  Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone was the first proper book I read  I was 7 when I read this  and after reading HP I ve become a book addict  What makes Harry Potter this special  Of course it s originality and J K  Rowling s borderless imagination  When you finish the last book you understand that when she was writing the first book she d always known how to end the last book  She thought about everything in such a detail and created an another world In each book you feel with Harry  you enter this magical world and become a part of it  You want the Privet Drive parts to finish as quick as possible because you hate Dursleys like Harry does   In each book when Harry first arrives to Hogwarts you feel like you re finally home   You love Weasleys  they are like a family to you   You want to play Quidditch  You want to do lots of things  I don t believe Harry Potter is a book for children  I strongly disagree with that opinion  I read the first Harry Potter book when I was a child but I still love it as sama as the very first day  I think it s a general kind of book  It s okay with every age  And when you read it  you won t ever forget it   After all this time   Always   Judging on my rating you might think that I am one of those reviewers that either clicks 1 or 5 stars on everything  But  giving a book 5 stars is very rare for me  for I only rate books what they deserve  My reasons  Rather than having a jumbled pile of words  for your reading pleasure I have a list of key topics  It is engaging  It plays with your emotions   It triggers curiosity    It is original     I have read halfway through multiple books  losing attention because  for this generation  it isn t engaging  This book  however  triggers so many different points that it makes you want to know more  This book will make you a reader  whether you like it or not   By this I mean that the main character is so likable and relatable that it makes accomplishments of him feel like accomplishments to you  You really like this character and want him to succeed    This goes hand in hand with engaging  This book makes so many subtle things that it makes you want to know more  It makes you want this to exist  so you can learn about it and discover     The spells and agriculture of these wizards isn t cliche and makes these practical things up from nothing  Admitting the robes  pointed hats and wands the wizards have  everything is new  fresh  and engaging That being said  There are some  but little swear words in this book and in the rest of the series  If you don t want you or your child to have even the slightest exposure  don t read this book  There are very little  about 5 in this first book  but there are still some  I know  I m doing the books separately instead of all together  I m counting the number of books I ve read  though  so I don t want to list them as one book  I m telling you now  I m giving every HP book 5 stars  Hands down the best books I ve ever read  Ever  I m so ashamed I didn t read them when I was younger  when I d still have had hope of receiving a Hogwarts letter  I was 14 at reading them  but I should ve earlier  I know I say every book series is amazing and worth five stars  because I m not a picky reader and I genuinely enjoy most books  but this is my number one  Always will be  Harry Potter is special  and I have no doubt that everyone who s read it  which is most of this planet  would agree  I will have this message on all seven book reviews  but a summary of each below The non magical world  Muggle world  in Harry Potter slang  we know is pathetic compared to the magical one introduced in this book  The start of a 7 book saga  we are brought into the life of Harry Potter  a young wizard who changes the magical world  Of course  this world  while magical and so very desirable  isn t all good  Like the good and bad in everything  there are good wizards and bad wizard One wizard went as bad as you can go  Self named Lord Voldemort rises to power  accompanied by a group of followers known as the Death Eaters  Havic and death were widespread  even affecting the Muggles  until one boy put a stop to it  A baby  in fact  But how  That s the question  Something happened the night that Voldemort went after the Potters  something about baby Harry that rid the world of Voldemort  The book begins with 11 year old Harry  orphaned and brought into his Aunt s abusive home  He has no idea of his true identity  zero knowledge of any sort of magical world That is until he gets his letter  An acceptance letter to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry  Harry attends this school of magic  and discovers his confusing history  Harry s danger didn t end that night Voldemort failed to kill him  no  not at all  Evil has surfaced  and Harry helps put a stop to it  The Sorcerer s Stone could have brought the world back to the Dark Days of Voldemort s reign  but Harry manages to discover and destroy the stone  Awesome  Harry Potter lives with his aunt Petunia and uncle Vernin  They are the last people you would ever  ever  ever be involved in something unusual or strange  One day a letter is addressed to  Harry Potter 4 privet Drive in the cubboard  he lives in the cubboard   Right when he begins to open it  uncle Vernin snatches it out of his hand and throws it into the fire  Harry s parents really died because of the dark wizard Voldemort  A K A  you know who A K A he who must not be named  Suddenly millions of letters flooded the fireplace and house  creeping through every crack and hole  Uncle Vernin soon declared they were leaving  Dudley  aunt Petunia s son said he wanted to go somewhere with a tv  They moved into a little hotel on the outskirts of town  Letters arrived there  too     So they moved again to a little shack  on a rock  in the middle of the ocean  A while later there was a loud rap at the door  Then the door fell down and a giant of a man  with long  wild hair and beard covering his face almost completely stepped inside  If you want to find out what happens next  read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone           Harry Potter has never felt very special  his entire life he has lived under the roof of his despicable aunt and uncle  the Dursleys  and their horrid son  Dudley  However this all changed on his eleventh birthday when an owl arrived with a letter for him  A letter accepting him to Hogwarts  School of Witchcraft and Wizardry  The events that fall into place after  Harry never would have imagined  beginning with meeting a half giant named Hagrid to learning when he was just a baby a dark wizard  Lord Voldemort  killed his parents and failed his attempt at killing Harry  only leaving a strange lightning bolt scar on his forehead  The Harry Potter series is frequently challenged for occult satanism because the characters are witches and wizards  And witchcraft is forbid in the bible  however the spells which can be considered cruel and evil are all forbidden and the wizards who use them are severely punished and referred to as dark wizards  This novel however promotes great qualities such as loyalty  friendship  etc  Harry throughout the entire series stays true to his friends and values and although he is tempted to join and offered a place on the dark side he never once even considers it  throughout the entire novels he stays a beacon of light and hope  He even sacrifices himself for the greater could  In no way do these novels ever promote the worshipping of Satan or an occult  Lord Voldemort  who would be equal to Satan in the novels  is viewed negatively throughout the entire series he is not even shown as a sympathetic character  The same thing goes for his followers  the Death Eaters  who could be viewed as being occult members  This series is a classic series of good against evil and in no way promotes bad values but rather good ones   Harry Potter Just those two words have defined a generation  Even those who have never read the series  and they are few in number  but they do exist  know exactly who Harry Potter is  There is so much ink dedicated to this series already  so many blogs  articles  books  fanfictions  poetry  fanmail  and doodle y scraps in the back pages of notepads  It is one of the most popular coming of age stories of all time  and there is very little to be said that has not already been said  But I am a writer  and therefore I must wax egotistical and mildly poetic  I must imagine that there are words still left to use because otherwise I would give up on this endeavor entirely  Harry Potter  full of lively  courageous  three dimensional characters which seem to spring right off the page  Harry Potter  such a vast and expansive world that is just the same as our own  and yet so incredibly different  Harry Potter  filled with schools and places everyone wanted to visit and reside in  Properly reviewing this book from a critical standpoint is impossible for me  I grew with these books  and their characters are imprinted in my head for the rest of time  Whenever I open one of the books I am overcome with a rush of nostalgia  Suddenly I am seven again  devouring the books one right after the other  shutting out the rest of the world  because nothing could be as interesting as the pages in front of me  The series was a mountain  and we were with Harry every step of the way I could nitpick  I could say that Rowling became too absorbed in the writing towards the end  that the last two books were overly clunky and drawn out  I could claim that I became bored with Harry after a while  that I continued to read because of the surrounding cast of characters  But the only thing I could honestly claim that would detract anything from this series is the ending  Yes  The perfect  sugar clouds  double rainbow  beautiful satin ribbon tying the whole thing in a nice little bow  I hated it  This is not Harry Potter  I wanted to shout  This is not the Harry Potter I grew up with  As it became progressively darker I grew more cynical and jaded  and I wanted the messy  sloppy  angsty ending  I was eleven  I wanted the emotional scars and trauma and none of this hugging children and marriage business  As I grew older  I remained bitter towards the sappy  fluffy ending  and I hadn t returned to it until recently  Despite my feelings towards a certain couple in the book  cough HermioneandRon cough  I could appreciate it for what it was The view from the top of the mountain   Spoilers ahead if not read  It was a great book  The Dursleys should understand magic  and Harry would ve known he was a wizard if Voldemort didn t kill his parents  and he has made great friends along the way  for example  Ronald  Ron  Weasley  who comes from a large family  The Weasleys  with Bill as the first child  working for Gringotts in Egypt  while Charlie is studying dragons in Romania  while Percy is a Hogwarts prefect directing the first years  while Fred and George are twins who love being funny  and Ron is next  while in the Hogwarts Express  he tries to find a seat  but there are none     so he sat where Harry was sitting  and they became friends  and here comes Hermione Granger  and these three met at Hogwarts Express  and then  all three were sorted into Gryffindor  when Harry was being sorted  The Sorting Hat considered him to be in Slytherin  but the Sorting Hat put him in Gryffindor  which was great since people in Slytherin are evil   and about the Sorcerre s Stone I say  well  it was made by Nicholas Flamel  which was hard for the three to research  but Hermione  who always wants to go to the library finally finds it   and Harry got the Sorcerer s Stone at the end  which was a great ending  and that was the first book in my words  Harry Potter lives with his aunt and uncle because of his parents  unfortunate death when Harry was just a baby  As a result  Harry s life has been abusive  his cousin beats him up  he s never celebrated his birthday  and he sleeps in a cupboard under the stairs  All this changes when a letter from Hogwarts School arrives on Harry s 11th birthday  a letter that Harry s uncle and aunt worked extremely hard to keep secret  Soon  however  Hagrid  a friendly half giant  decides to personally hand deliver the letter to Harry  thus teaching him all about a world of magic  Surprisingly  Harry Potter finds out that he is not an outcast but rather a celebrity in this new magical world  An evil sorcerer  Lord Voldemort  killed Harry s mother and father  however  when he tried to kill Harry  the spell somehow rebounded and hit Lord Voldemort himself  causing him to lose all of his powers   and making Harry famous in the process  On the first day of school  Harry goes to King s Cross Station  where he takes a train and reaches the magical castle known as Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry  While studying unusual subjects such as potions  defense against the dark arts  and transfiguration  Harry makes new friends such as Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger but also enemies such as Draco Malfoy and the potions master  Severus Snape  He also becomes a star in Quidditch  a magical sport played on broomsticks  The crux of the book involves Harry finding out about the Sorcerer s Stone  a stone that can give someone unlimited gold and unlimited life  After discovering that Lord Voldemort was  with the help of one of the professors  going to steal the stone in order to return to full power  Harry  with the help of Ron and Hermione  sets out to stop the darkest wizard of all time from achieving his task  Having to face dangerous plants  poison  three headed dogs  and flying keys just to get to the stone itself  can Harry get past the security obstacles guarding the stone and then also manage to stop Lord Voldemort  Find out in the thrilling climax of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone  In terms of writing style  JK Rowling does an excellent job fabricating an entire new world while making it seem believable  This is because JK Rowling looks at every aspect of life  from going to school to eating to going shopping  and somehow adds a magical twist to it  By indicating that only wizards and witches can see the magical world  JK Rowling presents the possibility that there really is an alternate magical world that we just can t see  Furthermore  the balance between description and action allows the reader to slowly transition from the normal world into the magical world without being bogged down with information  at the end of the book  I realized that I learned as much new information as I would have reading a short textbook  about a fictitious world  of course   but the suspense and action made the information entertaining instead of dull  Amongst all the action and descriptions  JK Rowling also manages to embed valuable themes of friendship and love  The Sorcerer s Stone  the actual stone  not the name of the book  symbolizes evil and temptation  and Harry  along with the reader  learns to resist temptation for more important things such as happiness and goodness  With suspense  a creative new idea  and a strong message  Harry Potter is a famous and widely recognized book  There is a reason that this series has yielded 8 movies and even led to the creation of an entire Harry Potter World in Universal Orlando  Even though this book is 300 pages long  I have read it over 10 times  Each time it still has the same captivating effect that makes it one of my favorites  Aditya  Grade 11 This is a awesome start to the Harry Potter series  The starting novel in a well known and loved series  Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone discusses the story of an orphan called Harry who lives with his mentally and somehow physically abusive aunt and uncle  along with their son Dudley  On his eleventh birthday  Harry finds out that he s a wizard just like his parents were and that they were  in fact  murdered by a wizard gone bad who goes by the name of Voldemort  Harry goes to a wizarding school called Hogwarts and ends up face to face with Voldemort by the end of the year Rowling created a lot of interesting characters such as Ron  Hermione  and Snape  My personal favorites were Ron s brothers  Fred and George  Although they were not in a lot of scenes  the ones they were in were  in my opinion  the best Rowling s words have such meaning to them and she also has a beautiful way of writing even though the series is supposedly for children  She managed to turn a whole generation of video game addicts to a bunch of book loving nerds There are multiple themes in this book  some hidden behind direct and indirect characterization  and some obviously and clearly stated  I think the reason so many people are hooked on this series is that it gives them hope and an escape  Harry had a life filled with bullying and pushing around  and one day  he finds out that hes a wizard and meets two of his all time best friends  Honestly  who wouldn t want that  A major theme displayed in this book  and in the rest of the series  is that even though evil is strong and dominate at most times  good will always find a way to win  Meet Harry Potter   an eleven years old boy who was left on his aunt s doorstep when he was just a baby  Harry now lives with his burly cousin who has a knack for punching him his beefy uncle who is always unfair to him and his tall and bony aunt who almost deprived him of food   Harry is scrawny with knobbly knees wild and bushy hair that never lies flat brilliant green eyes and a lightning shaped scar in the middle of his forehead   Basically Harry is your average middle of the road kind of kid   Oh  Did I forget to mention he s a wizard  The simple and skillful writing of author J K Rowling keeps every reader flipping through the pages as they stare in awe at the wonderful and glamorous  wizarding  world   The reader is caught on the hook from the moment  Rubues Hagrid  barges through the door and announces  yer a wizard Harry   all the way until Harry hops off the Hogwarts express  Harry s parents were murdered when he was one by the most dangerous and evil wizard in the world lord Voldemort   However Harry somehow survived the wrath of he who must not be named   From thereforth   Harry was on top of the list for those enlisted to study at Hogwarts the most prestigious school of magic in the world   Over there   Harry meets his best friends   sees marvelous creatures   and eats the most wonderful food he ever tasted  It s a blessing for him   since he almost never eats   However   Harry has unimaginable dangers waiting for him   Not only does he face centaurs and three headed dogs   but he also comes face to face with the dark lord himself  J K Rowling s perfect portraition of a protagonist   and the constant suspense and endearing dangers that Harry faces keeps readers constantly on edge   However   the book has no shortage of laughs   I thouroughly enjoyed reading this masterpiece   but Harry s journey is far from over  I honestly love the Harry potter series  from when I was little  I was brought up with the movies  but always shied away from the books  I don t know why  but I did  So now that I m 16  I decided why not  And picked up the first book  Well  I can tell you this  It did not take me long to ask my mum to order the next book   I m now reading that too  I now see how naive I must have been as a child  always thought that the Harry Potter books couldn t have been better than the movies  the movies themselves were rated highly in my mind  and still are  But as I kept reading  I noticed the little things they had missed out  and whole scenes too  I was shocked  It kept me interested  and now I do hold Harry potter deeply in my heart  Loved it  and would recommend it to all of my friends  if only they read O_o  For those like me  who are deciding whether or not to read it  due to already watching the movies  I would definitely say GO FOR IT Such a thrilling read  makes me feel that I want to be there as a child again HOGWARTS  YOU ARE REAL IN MY HEART   I only have one more thing to say   nitwit  blubber  oddment  tweak  LET THE SERIES CONTINUE  ONTO THE NEXT BOOK     D Harry Potter is a series that you can read fifty times and still get tingles  When people tell me they  hate  Harry Potter  I just kind of look at them funny as if they re speaking Parseltongue  You re entitled to your own opinion of course  and you either like it or you don t  but anyone who has read Harry Potter will agree that it s not really possible to  hate  the series  Firstly  the plot is absolutely amazing and complex  It s written as though the whole storyline was planned completely before a single word was written  and that makes it all the more believable and thrilling  Every cute little grade one adventure  the fierce dark battles with Voldemort  every magical encounter and emotional experience  it all eventually leads to the grand finale  And that is  I think  what makes the series so entitled to it s top ranking  Also  you know a series is at least  good  when you can write fan fiction off of it  All of the characters and their respective ties to other characters and the plot just makes this massive boiling cauldron spilling over with ideas for other stories  and more stories branch off from other fan made ideas and ships  and    well  you can see why the series is so popular among people like me Another wonderful thing about Harry Potter is that    this is going to be hard to explain  but I ll give it a shot    Harry Potter  in the context of age boundaries  is really just like a sort of twisted Boggart  Instead of showing your greatest fear  it moves to look how you think it should look  So  to a twelve year old  Snape might be the meanest  nastiest character in the series and he should just leave Harry alone  But to a young adult reader  a k a me  Snape is just a very lonely person with a bad upbringing who is in an impossible situation  and is undoubtedly the bravest person in the whole series   Different age groups will get different meanings and emotions out of the words  In short  Harry Potter is one size fits all  it works it s own magic for each respective age group That s definitely not all I could say about my favourite series  but I ll leave it here for now  Do yourself a favour and read it  If you ve  already tried  or  already read  like  half of them and got bored   then read them again  And again  And again   M  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone by J  K  Rowling really takes the reader on an adventure  The descriptive tone and expressive atmosphere created the illusion that I was really there  From climactic encounters under a meager invisibility cloak to clumsily subduing dragons  the events in this story portray everything a reader could ever ask for in a book  For a fictitious story involving wizards and magic  the emphasis on suspense and action served the story very well  Anyone looking for exciting  entertaining  and even comical elements in a piece of literature should definitely check out this book In the beginning of the story  Harry is stuck living with a family of  Muggles  completely regular people with no skills in witchcraft  After an exponentially growing series of letters addressed to Harry becomes too much for his family to throw away  they end up staying in a small shack out at sea as a desperate attempt to avoid them  Finally  a large man by the name of Hagrid bursts through the door  explaining to Harry and his family that Harry a wizard  He then takes him to Diagon Alley  a shopping area for wizards  to buy school supplies for his upcoming year at Hogwarts  the best wizard school there is  Harry is still in disbelief at this point  but a great adventure through the wizarding world awaits him  including fighting goblins  playing  Quidditch   and even battling evil wizards  Behind all of the potion brewing  spell casting  broom flying characters and engrossing plot  there were two main themes in this book  The first is very self explanatory  true friends make sacrifices for each other  An example of this was when Ron sacrificed himself for Harry and Hermione  potentially killing himself  This action by Ron showed that he was willing to risk his life in order for Harry and Hermione to advance in their quest  The second theme is also very straightforward  life is worth taking risks  The best instance of this happening was when Harry decides to risk his entire wizarding academic career in order to save Hogwarts  These underlying themes made the story much more enjoyable for me to read because I was subconsciously being taught important values throughout it  Overall  this was an exceptional book that anyone would cherish  Whether someone enjoys plot twists  dynamic characters  or engaging fights  there is something for everyone in it  Entranced in an imaginative realm of wizardry  the realistic impression of this story made me unable to put the book down  There are several books in the Harry Potter series that follow this one  so a literature enthusiast can keep reading to see what happens in the world of magic and witchcraft  This novel in particular will satisfy any bookworm s hunger to unravel a magnificent plot  lively characters  and a powerful environment  The interesting and fascinating fantasy novel   Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone  is about three  young soon to be world changing students at Hogwarts  a wizard school  The first kid is the one and only Harry  who as had his parents killed by Voldemort  an evil but powerful wizard that is terrorizing the wizard world  Now  he is living with his aunt  Uncle  and Cousin who are treating him pretty much like rubbish  but his hope brightens up once he receives tons of letters from Hogwarts for him to attend school where he will learn to be the best wizard he can be  Along the way  he meets a young freckled boy named Ronald  or Ron Weasley  who comes from a line of poor people  but that won t stop him from being Harry s best friend  Finally  they meet up with a youthful girl named Hermione Granger  the know it all sort of person  but will help the trio very well in there life and death situations  Together  these three will be trying to find out the mysteries that have been happening in this school  To 1me  this was a great book  for all ages  from the old and wise  to the young and reckless  Although 90  of the things in the story are not true  including wizards  dragons  and flying brooms it really makes me feel like it can really happen  placing me in Harry s shoes  going through the fun and hard times in hi school  I think the characters were credible  because they were doing things that the average 11 year old would do  Following up with that  i can relate to Harry  because of the hard times he went through on his first couple days of school  however he had his friends to back him up  If I could choose one character as my favorite  it would be Harry  because he is the word of the school  and is saving lives one by one like a hero  I would recommend it to all ages  and if you liked this book  then you ll like the 6 following books to this series  If I could rate this book out of 5 stars it would be a solid 5 becAuse the author clearly knows what she s writing about and is clearly experienced  I kept thinking what s going to happen to Harry next while reading Harry Potter and Sorcerer s Stone by J K  Rowling  Harry is very intellectual for coping with being told that he s a wizard and also adapting to a different environment very quickly Harry lives with his aunt and uncle and his bratty cousin  One day Harry finds out he s a wizard and that he s famous in the wizard world  Harry goes to Hogwarts and face like a troll  quidditch  and two faced man  Will Harry overcome these conflicts or even survive  I loved the friendship in this book  At first Harry and Ron were not friends with Hermione but then they became the best of friends  I loved the part in the book when Hermione says  Oh come off it  you don t think we d let you go alone  I love this part because it shows that they wouldn t abandon a friend in need  It also shows the reader how good friends they are to Harry One literary quality is when Harry goes to the zoo and is by the boa exhibit and the glass disappears from the boas tank  This is a foreshadowing because they re are giving a clue that Harry could have powers or have magic I think that the type of reader who would like this book is a someone who would be interested in mythology  I m not a big reader of mythology but I loved this book  I give this book five stars I loved the plot it made me not want to put this book down and the inseparable friendship that made it seem they could take on the world and come out on top  knt ktfyt ny  tfrj   l flmlny lqyt n 7 rwyt Dkhm lHjmshy mt b blt kyd    wlmt b  d  msh mmt  nhyth hy lly mmt  wlrwy  rHl  msh nhy  bslmhm b yd  n llk lly

dragged into a world full of magic  wizards  trolls  and flying brooms hidden from the eyes of most normal people  You learn that you are one of the very few people who are able to wield magic and ride on a broom capable of flying  Welcome to Harry Potter s shoes  an eleven year old boy as he enters the world of Hogwarts  a special school dedicated to training kids of any age into powerful wizards  Ultimately  I found Harry Potter and The Sorcerer s Stone written by J K Rowling  to be one of the most interesting and intriguing books that I have ever read and I would also say that my reaction after reading it  is extremely positive   I found this book interesting because it was able to alter my opinion of wizards  curses  spells  and ultimately magic  Over the course of my life  I have seen numerous magic tricks  in which a magician would always claim that something has  disappeared  or has been  replaced by this     Even as a kid  I would always believe magic to be nothing more than hocus pocus and that there would always be some logic to how the tricks were done  So when I stepped into the first Harry Potter book  I was more interested in the first few chapters focusing on Harry Potter s demeaning life while living with his crude foster parents  the Dursleys  Another reason to why  I was more interested in Harry s demeaning life was because it was pretty relatable and shows how J K Rowling really does know how to bring the humanity out of her characters  After the first act  the second act primarily focused on Harry s new life in Hogwarts  While in Hogwarts  I am introduced to several fictional things including jellybeans whose flavors can vary from vomit to earwax  Other of these fictional things vary from chess pieces that are alive  to gigantic wizards  to spells that can turn you into any animal  such as a pig  I started to get intrigued by these things  people and spells within Hogwarts that I started to accept the world that I was stepping into is almost nonexistent in reality  Sure in my life  I have been introduced to several fictional things from comic books  movies  and cartoons about robots and superheroes  However  most of them had a backstory that I could easily relate to  and was balanced enough to keep me interested in the fictional aspects  With that in mind  it was great how this book was able to alter my opinion of magic and myths  despite their impossibilities as well as augment my interest towards it  Further on  I felt that if I was Harry Potter stepping into this world in real life  I would indeed believe that it can be nothing more than a dream  I would probably be more interested in reading about spells from books so that I can use and try them out  just to see if magic truly was possible  I too  like Harry Potter would find it hard to sleep and would rather explore the school just to learn more about the different and odd creatures that I laid eyes upon while attending classes  This book allows you to see Hogwarts through the eyes of a kid who has never step foot in this world  which is why I ultimately believe that almost anyone can get into this book  relate to it  and still feel intrigued by all the mysteries that linger among it  Like Harry  I would be shocked to learn that my parents too were once wizards and would want to know more about them since they had been killed  Furthermore  if I was Harry living with the Dursleys  I too would indeed be excited  if someone told me I was a wizard and needed to attend some special school for a year  The thought of not having to live in a spider infested cabinet and avoiding the Dursleys would indeed make me want to go to this school  which I would have to first see in order to believe in its existence  All in all  seeing the world in Harry s perspective would not be exciting as living in his world as he begins his first school year in Hogwarts   I found this book to be relevant in my life because I was never much of a believer in magic  secret potions or curses  or anything almost supernatural  however this book altered my overall opinion of it  Throughout this book I found it interesting how reading a simple spell from a book any using a wand can cause almost anything to happen or occur  Though magic can cause almost anything to happen  it made me realize that you do not require it to make your wishes or dreams come true in real life  All in all  I have come to believe that almost anything is possible  even though magic is still beyond the comprehension of science and is practically impossible  I feel that dreams or wishes can indeed be possible if you make it happen  I say because as seen in this book  if you want magic to occur  you have to make it happen using special spells or speaking in odd syntax  I believe that if I were to choose a genre that this book should fall into  it would be fantasy  This first book from J K Rowling s Harry Potter series is 309 pages which makes it a novel  with that in mind  I believe that the appropriate age for someone to start reading this book is at least five or six years old  This is due to the amount of subplots that linger around the storyline as well as the supporting details that help make the book make sense as well as the overall length of the book and advanced vocabulary  Ultimately Harry Potter and The Sorcerer s Stone is a great book that has made an impact on my opinions on supernatural situations as while as made me think more about the intriguing topics that lingered around in the book  BOOK SYNOPSIS Eleven year old Harry Potter think he s just an ordinary boy  but he s about to discover that he s anything but  When a giant named Hagrid turns up and reveals to him that he is a wizard  accepted into Hogwarts  school of Witchcraft and Wizardry  Harry s life will never be quite the same again MY REVIEW  It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live  Ah  what fantastic quotes the great Albus Dumbledore does produce  and you ll be seeing a lot more of them  because as you may have noticed I ve started  and will continue to begin each of my book reviews with a quote from that book  But lets get onto the actual book now Is there really much to say here  I mean  it s Harry Potter come on  Harry Potter is and will remain for the rest of my life  my favourite series  Before Harry Potter  I liked reading  I was quite young and always had a book on the go  One day  I was at the airport in Spain  ready to fly back from a family holiday  but the flight was delayed  It seemed like a pain at the time  but I am so grateful that it was  because that three hour delay changed my life  literally  I didn t have any intention of reading Harry s Potter  It sounded boring to me  but I finished the book I was reading at the time while waiting for the plane  and had nothing left to read  and no other form of entertainment  so my parents agreed to buy me a book from the airport bookshop  One of the only books in English was Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone  so I begrudgingly bought it and began to read  After the first chapter I was hooked  I read for the whole plane journey and finished the series within weeks  I couldn t put it down Harry Potter was incredibly entertaining  and I grew to love the characters and the world they live in  which seems so real to me even now  but not only that  those books taught me valuable lessons about life  and they will do any person  If you have not read these books yet  grab them as soon as you can  because you ll always remember the first time you read Harry Potter I tend to reread the series about once a year  and I decided to start it for the fourth time last week  and do a review of each one  On my review of the Deathly Hallows  I will talk about the series in general at the end  It s likely that all will get 5 stars but I may highlight my particular favourites of the series Reading this book again  it s hard not to wonder at how masterful J K  Rowling s writing and plot creation is  I know all the twists and turns by heart now  but for those who have not read this book yet  it s easy to see how unexpected the twists are  She really is very good at throwing you off the scent I m trying to find negatives  but to me  this series is as close to perfect as you can get it a book  Not a moment of boredom  and I found myself grinning from ear to ear on several occasions  when Harry first finds out he s a wizard  and when he meets the Weasleys for the first time  etc   If I was trying to pick some things out  perhaps J K  Rowling eases into her style of writing a bit more in further installments  as at this point she was just a struggling writer trying to get her work published  Later on in the series she could experiment with her material a bit more as she already had a huge fan base who would love whatever she came up with  But really  this isn t much to consider  as Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone is just simply an incredibly special book  and no matter what else I read  I ll keep coming back for more  My top recommendation for anyone  whatever age you are  if you have not read Harry Potter  you ll never know love and friendship  and I feel sorry for you   P S  That last sentence was a Harry Potter reference  incase you didn t know  Rating  5 5  What else  Follow my other book and film reviews here  http   www humblecookie org    Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone is a book about a boy who learns he is a wizard  and the experiences he has during his first year at the magical school called Hogwarts  After Harry s parents were killed by a dark wizard  he lived for 10 years with his non magical relatives who treated him really bad and wanted to make sure he never showed any magical abilities like his parents  On his 11th birthday he was told that he was a wizard and would be going to Hogwarts to learn how to use his magic  As soon as he gets to school Harry starts learning a lot about the magical world  including all about the four houses of Hogwarts  the magical sport called quidditch  the dark wizards who follow Lord Voldemort and many other things  Harry  along with his new friends Ron and Hermione  discover that there is a Sorcerer s Stone which is being protected inside Hogwarts  They also know that the stone is in danger of being stolen by the dark wizards Throughout the book Harry  Ron and Hermione   who are all in Gryffindor house   have experiences that lead them to believe that Severus Snape  the potions master and head of Slytherin house  is the one who is trying to steal the stone  After making it through some bad run ins with Draco Malfoy  also of Slytheriun house  a scary trip to the forbidden forest  a close call with a dangerous dragon and near death experience on a broomstick  Harry and his friends are the ones who can save the sorcerer s stone from being stolen  After getting past a three headed dog  devil s snare  catching a flying key  playing in a game of wizards chess  and solving a complicated riddle  Harry faces a dark wizard   but not the one he suspected  Lord Voldemort  the darkest wizard there has ever been  has been possessing the body of Professor Quirrel  and is now ready to take the stone and kill Harry  Harry holds him off long enough for Dumbledore  the Hogwarts headmaster  to arrive and save Harry and the stone  Because of Harry  Ron and Hermione s bravery  Gryffindor house wins the house cup for the first time in 7 years  In this book  good versus evil is a major theme  It shows us that there is good and evil all around us and it is a constant battle we face to stay strong  Harry s muggle family isn t necessarily evil  but they are not good  They treat Harry very badly all during his growing up years  He has to live in a cupboard under the stairs  he was always getting beat up by his cousin Dudley  he was yelled at all the time and not loved  Obviously  the dark wizards like Lord Voldemort and his followers are evil and always trying to harm or kill the good wizards in the world  Even the houses in Hogwarts have a reputation of being good or bad  Slytherin has the reputation of putting out the darkest wizards  while the other three houses were known for being brave and good  In our world today  there is obviously good and bad  and it comes in different degrees  While the Dursley s aren t anywhere near as bad as Lord Voldemort  their actions still are not good  J K  Rowling does a good job putting these different levels of good and bad in the book to show the readers that this subject is not black and white  Obvious acts of evil are easy for anyone to see  and great shows of courage are also easy to recognize  J K  Rowlings different examples of good and bad draw the reader into analyzing situations and judging them based on morals Courage is another major theme throughout the book  as it is needed by all good wizards to overcome the evil that is everywhere  We learn that courage is almost never easy to have but it makes us much better for having it  Harry needed courage to stay positive during his years at the Dursley s  It even took courage for him to go to Hogwarts since he didn t even know if it was real  It took courage for Harry  Ron and Hermione to go after the sorcerer s stone  and for Harry to face Lord Voldemort  One of the most important shows of courage was from Neville Longbottom when he stood up to his friends when he thought they were doing something that was against the rules  At the end of the book  Albus Dumbledore says   It takes a great deal of courage to stand up to your enemies  but a great deal more to stand up to your friends   This is true for everyone  It is easy to take a stand against something that is obviously wrong or bad  but really hard to let your friends or your family know that you think they are doing something wrong  J K  Rowling used Neville s character in a really smart way by having him be the one to stand up for what was right  Neville is the nerdy character that isn t as popular or successful at anything  It had to have been really hard for him to stand up to Harry  Ron and Hermione  It leaves the readers wondering if they would have the courage to stand up to their friends One of my favorite characters is Hermione Granger  There are a lot of reasons that I like Hermione  but here are just a couple  She comes from a muggle family and could have felt intimidated  saying she isn t as good as the rest of the wizards  Instead she wants to prove to them that it doesn t matter where you come from  it matters how much you want something and how hard you work to get it  She always works so hard  but then isn t too proud to help her friends who aren t as smart  Another characteristic that I like about her is that she has is loyal  When the mountain troll was loose in the castle  and Harry and Ron went to look for her  they got in a lot of trouble for not following instructions and trying to find the troll themselves  Instead of letting Harry and Ron take the blame  which she really could have since Ron had been mean to her  she said that the whole thing was her fault and Harry and Ron were trying to stop her from chasing down the troll herself  That kind of loyalty made the three of them close friends throughout all their years of school Out of all the characters in Harry Potter  Rubeus Hagrid is my absolute favorite  He has a lot of really amazing qualities  he is kind  caring  friendly  reliable  and extremely loyal  Even when he messes up  he does everything in his power to make it right  Hagrid does his best to make Harry feel comfortable in the new magical world that Harry finds himself him  When other students keep getting mail and packages  and Harry gets nothing  Hagrid sends Harry and owl with an invitation to his house for a visit and a treat  This act of kindness makes Harry happy  Hagrid is very loyal to Albus Dumbledore  and because of this loyalty Dumbledore trusts Hagrid with very important jobs  Hagrid does everything in his power to complete any task that is given to him by Dumbledore  I really like these traits that Hagrid has  His fun and friendly personality make it so that the reader naturally likes him  The one thing about the book that I didn t like was that as 11 year olds  Harry  Ron and Hermione would not have been able to figure out or do all the things that they did  One example of this is when Harry and Hermione carry a dragon inside a crate up to the top of the astronomy tower  It seems pretty unlikely that two 11 year olds would have been able to really do this  Another example is how they were able to figure out so many things at the end of the book as they were trying to get to the Sorcerer s Stone  I don t think that 11 year olds would have been able to figure out things like what kind of key would fit into a certain kind of lock  and figuring out that a winged key with a bent wing  out of hundreds of flying keys  was the exact one they were looking for  The actions of the 11 year olds in the book seem more advanced than you would expect Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone is a very well written book that quickly draws the reader in  The plot and storyline are exciting and the many characters are described so well that the reader feels like they know them  From the very beginning  the reader felt connected to Harry and disliked the Dursley family for treating him so bad  Hagrid s appearance and his fun personality made him instantly likeable  and the first time Draco Malfoy is introduced  the reader recognizes that he is a spoiled and mean boy  J K  Rowling uses the wide variety of characters to support her plot of a magical stone being sought after by dark wizards  and rescued by Harry and his friends  This exciting and well written book keeps the reader engaged in the book from start to finish  Harry Potter and the philospher s stone is the first novel in the series by J  K Rowling  The novel follows the story of a young character called Harry Potter and his journey from birth  discovering he a wizard and joining a new magical school  During his journey  Harry makes two friends  Ron Weasley and Hermoinie Granger  who are also involved in the obstacles they are faced with  The novel presents friendship  fantasy  magic  and a number of exciting themes that children can relate to  I also believe that when young Harry discovers he is a wizard  he is eleven years of age  Thus  Key Stage 2 readers can relate to the young character in his transition from home life to school life  In the same way young children make the transition from Primary to Secondary school  I enjoy the vivid imagery the author gives of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry which really captures a sense of entering a new environment which again Key Stage 2 children will love  This could also inspire ideas which can be used in other subjects  I think the novel could be read individually by upper Key Stage 2 children those who are confident readers  It could also be used possibly as a whole class book  read every week or two by the class teacher  This way  children of every ability can follow the story more efficiently without struggling with complex words and being put off  I think it is a brilliant way to introduce young children to the Harry Potter phenomena which is has been a huge success worldwide  I like that the novel is part of a series which will encourage children to eventually read all the books   I ve listened to this many times since it came out    the HP books are one of the few series I ve read multiple times    and it never gets old  I love the story and the narration  This reading was the beginning of listening to all seven of them in a few weeks   great fun My original review on 2 14 1999 Harry Potter was orphaned as a baby and sent to live with his aunt  uncle and cousin   the Dursley s   who were horrible to him  He lives in a closet under the stairs and is treated horribly  When he s old enough to go to secondary school  mysterious letters start arriving for him  by the dozens  until he finally gets to read one   it s inviting him to go to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry  Come to find out  his parents were a witch and wizard and he has inherited great powers  His relatives are finally glad to have him go  so off he goes to a great adventure  He has magic classes  hatches a dragon  becomes a quidditch star and becomes involved in his life mystery  that of the evil Voldemort  Harry and his friends eventually unravel the mystery   almost at the cost of their lives  Imaginative and fun  Genre  Adventure FantasyHarry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone is probably one of the best books I have ever read  it s engaging  funny  and totally fantastic  This book hooked me from the first page  and this is one of those books where you will want to read it over and over again  but it won t feel boring  Instead  it will feel like a new adventure every time you open the first page and read   Mr  and Mrs  Dursley  of number four Privet Drive  were proud to say that they were perfectly normal  thank you very much   It just grabs your attention  You will  after reading the first sentence  think  what is it that makes Mr  and Mrs  Dursley say that they were perfectly normal  Are they not normal  And so question after question  thought after thought  you will keep on reading  not just for your friends  sake  but because you will be hooked  You simply won t want to put the book down  Adventure after adventure is how I would describe this book  J K  Rowling does a near perfect job of describing the terrible life of Harry s  and how friend s can mean everything  brains aren t everything  bravery can be much more important  These are all great morals that Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone can teach us just within a bit more than 300 pages   Have you ever wished you could be a wizard  Well  in this book  a  normal  kid named Harry Potter experiences this  This is a fictional book  but sometimes it seems like it could happen  so I also think it could be a realistic fiction book  too  A suitable age rage for this book is anywhere from a sixth grader to a full grown adult  I loved this book and now I am reading the fifth book of the series  Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix  So far  I love the book and it is filled with action  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone is about an evil wizard who is trying to steal a very valuable stone  The thing is  Harry and his two friends interfere with the evil wizard s plans  This book met every standard that I expected from cover to cover  This was the best book  most exciting book I have ever read  I have read a lot of books like the Harry Potter books  I have the Hidden Children series and the Percy Jackson series and Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone was the best out of all of them  I only have one problem with this book  and it is that it is a cliff hanger  I have read many cliff hangers and haven t had time to read the rest of the series  but I have also read many books because of cliff hangers  That right now is the problem here  I have not read the rest of the series  Although there is this slight problem  I still loved the book  This is a book full of magic  adventure  and action  and is great for all ages ranging from a sixth grader to full grown adults  Go see if you can become a wizard  Et bien oui c est officiel  on peut avoir le niveau d anglais de Dora l exploratrice et etre capable de lire la version originale d Harry Potter a l ecole des sorciers     Bon inutile de preciser par contre que ce meme niveau d anglais ne me permet pas encore d ecrire cette chronique dans la langue de Shakespeare  On ne presente plus la saga du jeune sorcier a la cicatrice connu de tous  a moins de vivre dans une grotte ou dans la foret interdite     Jeune orphelin  Harry Potter  11 ans  vit chez sa tante et son oncle dont le passe temps favori consiste a le tyranniser mais en toute discretion car on ne voudrait surtout pas que les voisins jasent n est ce pas    Or la donne change le jour ou Harry apprend qu il est un sorcier  Et pas n importe quel sorcier    car c est lui qui  age d un an  a aneanti le terrible et diabolique Lord Voldemort  Mais bon peut etre qu apres tout ce dernier a des circonstances attenuantes  Faut se mettre a sa place quand meme   il est diabolique  n a pas de nez et son visage presente une ressemblance troublante pour ne pas dire suspecte avec celui d un serpent  Et meme chez les sorciers  il n en faut pas plus pour se sentir exclu de la societe    Bref    revenons en a Harry car etre un sorcier ca s apprend  Alors direction Hogwarts  Poudlard dans la version francaise pour ceux qui ne suivent pas  pour apprendre a developper ses capacites magiques  La bas il rencontrera de nombreuses personnalites haute en couleur comme Ron et Hermione  futurs meilleurs amis et compagnons d aventure  Dumbledore croisement improbable entre Gandalf et Merlin l enchanteur ou encore Snape  le redoutable professeur des potions dont la mission semble de pourrir la vie de notre jeune et innocent heros  il faudrait peut etre le presenter a l oncle d Harry vue la passion commune qu ils semblent partager   Seulement  nous sommes a Hogwarts et au detour d un cours de sortileges  aventures et dangers ne sont jamais loin  Lire la version originale m a tout d abord fait realiser a quel point la version francaise est remarquablement bien traduite donc bravo au traducteur francais   Car  que ce soit au niveau des expressions ou des jeux de mots  il n y a rien a redire  par exemple  Neville Longbottom devient ainsi Neville Londubat dans la version francaise   J ai pris plaisir a retrouver tous les personnages qui font partis de cette univers hors du commun et fantastique  c est le cas de le dire  d autant plus que j ai deja lu la saga en entier et que je sais l importance que chacun aura par la suite  Cela m a permis de redecouvrir l histoire sous une nouvelle perspective  ce que j ai beaucoup apprecie  J aime beaucoup le style de J K Rowling  fluide et inventif  elle transporte litteralement ses lecteurs a Poudlard  Son ecriture tres imaginative fait mouche que ce soit en anglais ou en francais  Drole  ludique et mysterieux  le monde qu a cree l auteur reste encore et toujours a part dans la litterature jeunesse  En y melant ses propres inventions et son style unique  J K  Rowling reprend a son compte les    ficelles    classiques de la litterature   un trio d amis  un prof mechant  un directeur loufoque mais plein de bons conseils  un grand mechant  vilain tout plein  qui prend plaisir a gacher la vie de notre heros  On pourrait dire que Rowling n a rien invente mais plutot tout reinvente  Personnellement  et cela n engage que moi  je pense que la litterature jeunesse n en sera pas ou elle est aujourd hui sans l oeuvre de cette auteure anglaise  Les Tara Duncan  Percy Jackson et autres Twilight auraient ils eu autant de succes ou meme auraient ils simplement etaient publies si l apprenti sorcier n avait pas vu le jour  Succes de la litterature jeunesse et meme de la litterature tout court  on a souvent entendu dire que la saga Harry Potter avait redonne le gout de la lecture aux plus jeunes  Drole  emouvant  creatif et remarquablement bien ecrit  il faut avouer que le petit sorcier a la cicatrice merite largement cet eloge Maintenant  il ne me reste plus qu a lire le deuxieme tome en anglais et a retrouver le personnage qui fait tout l interet de cette saga selon Marie   j ai nomme Dobby l elfe de maison of course     Predi mnogo godini  kogato  Khari Pot r

fourth time last week  and do a review of each one  On my review of the Deathly Hallows  I will talk about the series in general at the end  It s likely that all will get 5 stars but I may highlight my particular favourites of the series Reading this book again  it s hard not to wonder at how masterful J K  Rowling s writing and plot creation is  I know all the twists and turns by heart now  but for those who have not read this book yet  it s easy to see how unexpected the twists are  She really is very good at throwing you off the scent I m trying to find negatives  but to me  this series is as close to perfect as you can get it a book  Not a moment of boredom  and I found myself grinning from ear to ear on several occasions  when Harry first finds out he s a wizard  and when he meets the Weasleys for the first time  etc   If I was trying to pick some things out  perhaps J K  Rowling eases into her style of writing a bit more in further installments  as at this point she was just a struggling writer trying to get her work published  Later on in the series she could experiment with her material a bit more as she already had a huge fan base who would love whatever she came up with  But really  this isn t much to consider  as Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone is just simply an incredibly special book  and no matter what else I read  I ll keep coming back for more  My top recommendation for anyone  whatever age you are  if you have not read Harry Potter  you ll never know love and friendship  and I feel sorry for you   P S  That last sentence was a Harry Potter reference  incase you didn t know  Rating  5 5  What else  I was one of those mom s that jumped on the ban wagon of not allowing my child to read the Harry Potter books because of the nature of the books  I read the book then and decided that it was just too much for my son at that time  The unicorn scene was my biggest reasoning at the time Then we watched the movie and I read the complete set  I jumped off the previous ban wagon and became a Harry Potter fan along with my children I ve told mother s that asked me if their child should read them  that the age of the child reading should match the age of Harry in each book  Rowling s really does write to that age group and her writing matures with each year  I m in awe of her talent  The books are better than the movie simply because so much more detail is given  The movies vary from the books  changing the characters up  adding Ron in scenes that the book had Neville in  changing how conversations were started or who had the conversations  Little things like that  But all in all  they follow closely with the story line This was my second read of this ebook and I used the new Amazon Prime unlimited reading program  Holy Cow  this is a terrific book  i ll just add my five star rating to the multitude that have already been rewarded I fought reading this book  First  because of the unfavorable publicity the author had received  Then because she was so adamantly against ebooks  saying that she would never ever release the books in that format  For me  that meant i would never ever read them   I only read books on my Kindle any more  for a variety of reasons She relented  but keeps very tight control of distribution  I finally relented as well  and read this one as a  loaner   Prime free   The story reminded me in some ways of  The Hobbit   one of my favorite books of all time   very creative  very engaging  I enjoyed the book more than the movie  even though the movie was pretty good  as I recall  Warning   it is extremely difficult to put this book down once started  Don t plan on allowing life to interfere   So  yeah    I ll be dishing out my hard earned money for the next in the series  And  i suspect  the one after that  and the following one  etc         Obviously  this book has been out for a long time  and this isn t the first time I have read it  I just want to say that I have a feeling that Harry Potter will be with me forever  For the beginning when Harry was just 11 years old  he was destined for greatness  He has the curiosity of his father  and compassion of his mother  These two are what makes even young Harry know that he has to do something when danger is afoot If anyone has not read Harry Potter  I strongly encourage that you do  It not only is an amazing read  but it teaches valuable lessons  In this one  one of my favorite quotes is  It doesn t do to dwell on dreams and forget to live  Remember that   Dumbledore told that to Harry when he found the Mirror of Erised JK Rowling has an amazing talent for bringing her characters to life  and making them all so unique and relatable  Harry is the person that people can look up to  Ron is the one that people can use as an example to know you can always be happy and grateful no matter your family s circumstances  Hermione is the one that people can know that you don t have to be stereotypical  pure blood  to be brilliant  Words cannot express my love for Harry Potter  Well  the series  I have a special inkling towards Ronald Bilius Weasley  I think it is because I can relate to him the most  Which  if I may point out is why this series is the greatest beyond anything else  In 2014  I m rereading Harry Potter  again  for the umpteenth time  and writing about my experiences What can you say about a book that you ve read over and over again  countless times  for more than a decade I can t review the content of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone  anymore than I can review my mother s face or the back of my hand  Some things are just too personal to write about critically  So  I ll do the only thing I can do  I ll write a story My paternal grandmother passed away when I was in eighth grade  When my family found out  we took the first plane from Los Angeles to Houston  to get her affairs in order  For my parents  I m sure this was an eventful and stressful time  I  on the other hand  was completely bored  I was away from the skating rink  which meant that I suddenly had more free time than usual  I didn t have any homework to do  couldn t call my friends long distance  couldn t even practice the trumpet  After a few too many games of solitaire on my Uncle s  fancy  laptop  I asked my mom for something to do She handed me a book I d never heard of before  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone  She had heard good things about it  and there was even a sequel  Now  I was 13 going on 30  and I regularly turned up my nose at young adult novels  At this point  I was more interested in Stephen King  Ray Bradbury  and Michael Crichton  I didn t have time for that kid stuff  But I didn t have any other reading material  so I reluctantly picked up Harry Potter To say I was blown away would be an understatement  The best word to use is transported  for the first time in a long time I felt as if I were actually in another world  I worried when Harry put on the sorting cap  and wished he would end up in Gryffindor  I rooted for him during the quidditch matches  and gasped when he found the three headed dog  I was honestly shocked when  view spoiler  Snape turned out to be a good guy  This was supposed to be a children s story  right  How did that plot point get past me   hide spoiler  When we arrived in Washington D C  for my grandmother s burial at Arlington  I asked my mom to buy the second book  Instead  she started reading the first book aloud to my younger brother  who was nine at the time  I expected to be annoyed  but it turns out I was just excited  excited to be at Hogwarts again  to hear the story  to experience the magic  And so  my Harry Potter obsession began  and it defined most of my adolescence  Which is why I can t review this book  because it is who I am  in some ineffable way  All I can do is thank J K  Rowling  For everything  Upon hearing the continued hype over the Harry Potter books I was beyond skeptical  I was convinced that I would not enjoy the series  Man  was I wrong Many people  I find  are weary of the whole wizardry magic concept  I understand because I was too  However  the story telling was just wonderful  and I was in awe of the world building and characterizations  I love the fact that J  K Rowling designs her characters to have flaws   yes  even the most moral of heroes have flaws  The books were written as children s books  however  I believe they are for every age group  The underlying themes are  brilliantly portrayed  There is friendship  loyalty  and bravery  Not to mention prejudice and sexism are tackled in a manner that does not feel like the lesson is being shoved down one s throat  Instead  you find yourself rooting for the characters and caring about what happens to them  or at least I did  I am not going to try and summarize the plot because I find it hard to do without giving away spoilers  Overall  I am definitely now a Harry Potter fan through and through  and I encourage any fellow readers to read the books if you have not yet  Even if you are not an avid reader I recommend the books  My mom is not generally a reader and she thoroughly enjoyed the books Sorry if my review contains any grammatical and or spelling errors as I am typing this on an extremely small phone  Hope you enjoyed my review and I hope you enjoy Harry Potter    To anyone who has thought about reading the Harry Potter series but thought   why read seven books when I can just watch the movies   please think again  This is exactly what I thought  until the closing credits of the last film were on the screen  As a massive fan of the movies  I eventually gave in and started reading the first book   Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone   also known as  the Philosopher s Stone  in the UK   I was immediately drawn into the story line and the characters the moment I opened the book  Despite seeing all the films  the books seemed to provide so much more detail and depth to each character and story line  There are things that happen in the books which were not shown in the films  and some other little treasures and one liners that did not make it onto the screen  Just small things such as that  I personally think make the books just that little bit more enjoyable than the films  J K  Rowling is a genius for writing these books  they are so original and just so clever  I could read this series again and again I would definitely recommend the Harry Potter series to anyone who is a fan of the movies  or just enjoys fantasy novels in general   Sinopsis Este libro cuenta la historia de un nino chico llamado Harry Potter que quedo huerfano y vive en la casa de sus tios quien lo adoptan tras la muerte de sus padres y el primo Dudley  quien es super egoista y no deja hacer nada a Harry  El protagonista de esta historia se siente muy solo  hasta que un dia empieza a recibir millones de cartas que cambiaran su vida para siempre  en ella le comunican que ha sido invitado como alumno en el Colegio Hogwarts de Magia  A partir de ese momento  Harry no puede creer que de pasar a tener una vida normal y aburrida pase a ir a un colegio de magia  En esa escuela aprendera encantamientos  trucos fabulosos y contra las malas artes  Se convertira en el campeon escolar y mejor jugador de Quidditch  una especie de deporte aereo que se juega con 4 pelotas y se monta por encima de escobas  Ademas de todo esto hara un grupo de muy buenos amigos en los que se destacan Ronald y Hermione  aunque tambien algunos temibles y malos enemigos  Pero  sobre todas las cosas  conocera los secretos que le permitiran cumplir con su destino  que el mismo todavia no conoce  Pues  aunque no lo parezca a primera vista  Harry no es chico normal y corriente es uno de los mejores magos de mundo Opinion personal No soy de leer libros y menos de este estilo  pero la verdad que me encanto  Siempre me gustaron sus peliculas  es la primera vez que leo un libro de esta gran saga y me gusto muchisimo la experiencia  me atrapa la trama que tiene el libro  que te mantiene todo el tiempo con intriga de lo que va a pasar  aparte hay una gran diferencia en leer el libro  debido a que hay muchos mas detalles que en la pelicula se pierden  La historia de un chico huerfano que pasa a ser un mago importantisimo en la historia de la magia de un dia para el otro es lo que mas me gusta de esta gran historia Simplemente me parecio buenisima  si gustan de libros de ciencia y ficcion lo recomiendo All Harry wanted was to live his life with minimal pain caused by his cousin  Dudley  His life is turned upside down when he gets accepted into Hogwarts  the school of Witchcraft and Wizardry  He finally gets the chance to be away from his wretched family and take part in magical studies This is the first time I ve ever read this book  Sure I ve seen the first three movies or so  but that was a long time ago  I decided to avoid the book mainly because of the hype  I sure was wrong though  I regret not reading this when I was younger  but am so glad that I ve finally gotten around to it I think one of my first encounters with this series was when my elementary school teacher read this book aloud to us  probably the highlight of fourth grade The characters in this book are really interesting too  Rowling presents the reader with an assortment of characters that are entertaining Maybe my only complaint was that the climax wasn t as dramatic as I would have liked  but on a list of issues it s probably  01  out of no other issues  JK Rowling is a fantastic writer because the entire story flows smoothly and captivates people of various ages  This book is easy enough for children to understand  but not too simple where young adult and adult readers are bored with the events  It is so effortless to find yourself caught up in the life of Harry Potter  Okay  I read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone when I was about  what nine years old  Yeah  about nine to ten years old  and I think now is the time for me to review the very first Harry Potter book Anyway  back then I knew all my friends  older siblings had read HP  and at some point I thought to myself   Hey I should read that book   best decision in my life  I tell ya   So I went over to my schools library and lent it  This was one of the first  big books  I read as a kid  and I will honestly say that I don t know if I would be the god damn bookworm I am today if I hadn t read HP  This was what got me started  Basically this is a book about a boy   Harry Potter    who is a wizard  and honestly I think he kinda sucks at being one  but he still gets all most of the credit for saving the school  I mean damn  I love Harry and all  but he seems like he s confused most of the time  Ron is also just very confused with skin or whatever  oops  I believe that is from the films  Or is it in the book  I do not remember  oh well  you will get it later   Hermione on the other hand  damnit I love that girl  She is so smart and she is an excellent wizard  God  I love Hermione  That girl though  Anyhow  these two very confused boy and this one awesome girl does together make a great trio  And I think that is a huge part of why I love the books  The trio is just so perfect  that I can not even  I mean what is this   damnEverything about this book is just perfect   even Harry  please do not misunderstand me  I love Harry   I just think he sucks at being a wizard  Well  of course he has his moments of glory or whatever  but like you know    he just    ya you know   So yeah  I would for sure recommend this book to everyone  because this is literally perfection  AND AND the best part is you can read it no matter how old you are  It s not like those sucky vampire fantasy books that just doesn t make much sense and ugh  like I am a teenager  and even I do not really understand what happens half the time  So yeah  EVERYONE READ IT SO YOU CAN UNDERSTAND HOW PAINFULLY MUCH I LOVE THIS GOD DAMN BOOK  I started reading the first Harry Potter book in October of 2001   I came to the series a bit late  But it has been almost 13 years  This must be about the tenth time I ve read this book  in English and Afrikaans  could be more  I ve lost count   and still it entertains me  amuses me  stresses me out in the exciting bits   and there is one moment where I have to wipe tears away before I can proceed  And despite the kilometres of shelf space of books I want to read  should read  must read  I ll come back to this time and time again   On a peevish note  it won t be Claire Melinsky s covers drawing me back   I m most pleased to have the original covers on my paper books  With the ebooks one is not so much faced with the less appealing repackaging of the series  Al het ek HARRY POTTER AND THE PHILOSOPHER S STONE oor die afgelope dertien jaar verskeie kere gelees  ook die Afrikaanse vertaling van Janie Oosthuizen  vind ek dit steeds vermaaklik  snaaks  spannend en ontroerend  Ten spyte van die lang lyste boeke wat wag vir aandag  sal ek hierna terugkeer    n ou vriend wat jou gemaklik maak met  n bekende gesprek en warmte  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone is regarded by many as a fantasy book  and that it belongs to the likes of children  However  Harry Potter is much more than that  Not only does it appear to children  but it can appeal to readers of all ages  The chimerical ideas of witches and wizards may be what a child would like to indulge in while reading this book  but young adults such as I can get the feeling from not only the strong characterization of Rowling  but also the horrifying undertones presented  Many can relate to Neville  the clumsy boy who always seems to be losing things  If not Neville  then why not Harry  the character that has to constantly fight off not only his degrading aunt and uncle  but the constant threat of evil  The quirkiness of Professor Quirrell and the mysteriousness of Professor Snape are able to not only lead the reader astray  but to keep wanting more  Rowling s use of suspense to draw in reader attention is impeccable  Harry receives mysterious notes  returning him his invisibility cloak  but why  There are painful sensations that run through Harry s scar  but he does not know why  And what is that green flash of light Harry refers to constantly  This is exactly what Rowling does to us  She keeps us readers hungry for more and more as we read  The last reason  and the main reason that I wholeheartedly support you all to read this book is because of its lasting effect  The Harry Potter series has been around so long  and it is no wonder there were 7 books and 8 movies  The enjoyment  thrill  and sense of adventure you get from reading the epic tales of Harry  Ron  and Hermione are unparalleled by anything else that is out there   It s 2014  and only now I write a book review about this book I read The Philosopher s when I was 15  in year 2007  Of course  I watched the movie first when I was 10  2002   if I m not mistaken  The movie indeed was brilliant  I watched it twice in a day  marathon  My first Harry Potter book was The Prisoner of Azkaban  I read that in 2004 when I was 12  and read The Chamber of Secrets in the following year  After that  I read The Goblet of Fire  The Order of Phoenix  and The Half Blood Prince  I read the books already  yes indeed  But  there s a twist in my life with J K  Rowling  I read all of it in Malay language  I was young  it was the era when English was not my biggest forte yet  And Malay language is always be my mother tongue  To feel the excitement of Harry Potter  I read it in a language that I mostly can understand  Now  I m 22  When I told to my classmate in the university who is a Potterhead that I read HP in Malay  she was kinda angry  Sort of  she said that HP must be read in English  as that is the language that Rowling used in writing Harry Potter And now  I am re reading Harry Potter in English  And why need a review for a Harry Potter book  It is the best book that I have ever read  Matter of fact  reading it in English is better  Wonderfully Magical First off  let me begin by stating I am a mother of three now grown boys who all read the entire series of Harry Potter books when they were in grade school  At that time  I checked out brief snippets of the first book when many groups protested that the witchcraft and magic references were anti Christian  After determining they wouldn t be spiritually or emotionally scarred  I encouraged them to read more by J K  Rowling  since they clearly enjoyed the stories and they were READING  Now that they re grown  and I ve had the time to read more myself  I had to read at least the first book  After all  I d already seen the movies I am glad I did  After studying children s literature  I have a fine arts degree in creative writing   I ve come to appreciate the work that goes into creating good literature for kids  Rowling writes about children for children without preaching to them  She does not smash them over the head with lessons on morality  What she does do  however  is create a magical world where very real characters have fantastic adventures  I can imagine that any child would be able to identify with and relate to the characters I highly recommend this book  If you are looking for a good series to begin family reading time with  this is one the entire family will love   I read the book Harry Potter and the Sorcerers of Stone  In the beginning of the book Harry lives with a mortal family the Dursleys  In this family Harry feels incomplete  Until Hagrid came along and told him he was a wizard  The Dursleys knew all along but did not want to tell harry because they did not want anything to do with magic and wizards  Harry went to Hogwarts  He was very confused about all the magic he thought he was in a dream of some sort  He is very famous in the wizard word because he was attacked by one of the most powerful wizards of all time lord vordamore  At Hogwarts harry makes lots of friends that help him out with his magical studies  Through the book Harry faces many challenges and meats a lot of people some good and some bad   I would recommend this book to anyone  At first it is confusing but the more you read the more you understand  This book has a lot of action and mysteries  This is one of of the books that everyone likes when they read  It is a book you can t put down  Overall Harry potter and the Sorcerers of Stone is a good book  I am reviewing the fantasy novel Harry Potter And The Philosopher s Stone by JK Rowling which is an excellent book which I bought from Amazon  This book is the 1st book in the Harry Potter series and is a classic although not as good as some of the later books in the series  In this book he discovers his parents were accomplished wizards prior to their early demise while he was an infant  He has to live with an adopted family called the Dursley s who while very funny are the family from Hell  They have left him in ignorance about his parents  Harry is going to defeat the baddie Lord Voldemort later in the series and has been placed somewhere safe for the time being  He enrolls at Hogwarts a school for wizards  The students are streamed into different groups with the evil students being in Slytherin  The students have to play sports such as Quidditch and Harry becomes a top player  The head of Slytherin tries to sabotage a game but one of Harry s fellow students sets his trousers on fire with a spell  Harry also thinks he comes face to face with his parents although it turns out to be an illusion albet a dangerous one  Harry also has to go on a mission with his 2 closest friends that includes a game of chess where the some of the pieces have to be humans along with the danger they die for real if it goes wrong  There is also the dangers of creatures like trolls running around the school that the children are meant to avoid and leave for the staff to deal with  This is probably the best children s fantasy series ever written  The story is around 330 pages so is a reasonable length  I thoroughly enjoyed this book and would have no hesitation in recommending it  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s StoneThe first book in J K  Rowling s Harry Potter series  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone  was as interesting when I read it to my little sister as it was the first time I read it ten years ago  This book tells the magical story of Harry  whose parents have passed away  He finds out that he is a wizard  and is taken to Hogwarts  a school for young witches and wizards  This series contains seven books  which follow Harry and his friends on their journey towards adolescence and young adulthood  Groundbreaking at the time  this book revitalized young adult literature  Reading this book again as a sophomore in highschool  I understood why it has been so popular and a long lasting best seller  Every young child dreams of magic  The possibilities that Harry and his friends experience make all readers envious  The first person that Harry meets in his newfound world is Hagrid  Hagrid is the groundskeeper at Hogwarts and quickly becomes a father figure to Harry  Ron and Hermione are Harry s best friends whom he meets on the train to school  The three of them quickly become inseparable  Hermione who is from England is a  muggle   someone who is born outside of the wizarding world  Unlike Harry and Hermione  Ron is a natural born wizard  he helps the two of them navigate their unique new life  We delight in their relationships with each other  and their distance from the  muggle world   the world of regular people  At first the reader experiences Harry s first days as a wizard  experiencing everything for the first time along with him  On the first night at Hogwarts all of the new students have to put on the sorting hat to be told which house they belong in  Gryffindor  Slytherin  Hufflepuff  and Ravenclaw are the four houses to which someone can belong  Once everyone is settled into their new lives at Hogwarts Harry begins to learn more about his past and family  The descriptions and detail of the world that is created by the author is so complete that you can enter into the life at Hogwarts  For example  you can practically taste the  butterbeer  that Harry and his friends drink on their first evening out  I give this book five stars  Each time I read it I take away something different  This time  the life lesson that I learned was that it was important to branch out and leave your comfort zone  Every reader  no matter what age  will take something different away from this coming of age story  I recommend this book to people of all ages that are looking for an alluring tale of friendship and new beginnings  Harry Potter  La Piedra Filosofal es la clara razon por la cual tantas generaciones se han enamorado de esta serie de libros  Creando un mundo aparte  magico  que explica cada cosa que sucede demostrando asi  que tal vez  sea real  Impulsando a ninos de todo el mundo a verla  y a crecer junto a sus personajes desde el primer hasta el ultimo libro En esta historia conocemos a Harry Potter  un nino que vive con sus tios y  los Dursley  quienes lo viven maltratando y haciendolo sentir miserable  Pero todo esto cambia cuando Harry recibe una carta en la cual se revela que es en realidad un hechicero  y que tiene la oportunidad de asistir a la escuela Howarts de magia y hechiceria  y se entera de todo un mundo magico escondido justo al frente de sus ojos El libro en si esta bien escrito  es muy entretenido y detalladamente y sutilmente te va ensenando mas y mas acerca de ese supuesto mundo magico  Se demuestran los valores de la amistad y valentia en los 3 protagonistas durante casi todo el libro  y uno se llega hasta a encarinar con ellos y con el mundo en el que se encuentran Una lectura perfecta para todas las edades  la cual creo una historia que durante generaciones fue seguida y apreciada  Verdaderamente una obra que roza la perfeccion  a la cual solo le faltaria haber ampliado un poco mas algunos aspectos como por ejemplo la historia del innombrable  quien es solo un nombre que la gente tiene miedo a pronunciar  solo apareciendo sorpresivamente en la nuca de un profesor demente En resumen  este es una gran historia  que demostro tener el suficiente potencial como para crear una serie inolvidable  Cukup kaget juga saat melihat harga buku ini di website gramedia ternyata Rp  85 000 saat saya membelinya lebih dari 10 tahun yang lalu harganya baru Rp 25 000 tapi untuk ukuran waktu itu memang cukup mahal  Tapi saya sangat ingin membelinya meskipun saya belum tahu bahwa buku ini sangat bagus sampai mau dijadikan film Ok  lanjut ke review  dalam buku ini J K  Rowling berhasil membawa pembacanya penasaran  Mulai dari pembukaan yang misterius  keluarga Dursley yang menyebalkan sampai ke kedatangan Hagrid yang mengagetkan seluruh keluarga Dursley J K  Rowling berhasil membawa pembaca mengalir dalam alur cerita masuk ke dalam dunia sihir diantara hiruk pikuk kehidupan orang Inggris  Perjalanan Harry ke Diagon Alley adalah salah satu momen dimana saya yang saat itu masih kanak kanak merasa sangat exited membacanya  Semua kejutan dan bayangan akan item item dari dunia sihir dari buku buku  pakaian  peralatan sihir  binatang  hingga yang utama tongkat sihir benar benar diceritakan dalam detail yang mengesankan semua orang yang membacanya Perjalanan Harry untuk ke Hogwards pun sangat menyenangkan  Pertemuan dengan tokoh ron yang berdarah murni  membuatnya merasa canggung padahal Ron sendiri menggangap Harry sebagai orang hebat dan terkenal Sekolah Hogwards pun dibuat sangat menarik  lengkap dengan berbagai mata pelajaran yang sebenarnya agak mirip dengan dunia manusia seperti sejarah dan herbology yang mirip biologi kalau di Indonesia Karakter guru gurunya pun dibuat menarik  Kepala sekolah Dumbledore yang sangat memperhatikan Harry  sampai Professor Snape yang menyebalkan tapi entah kenapa sangat saya puja puja sejak awal cerita Untuk karakter Hermione yang baru dekat dengan keduanya di tengah cerita memang sangat wajar mengingat anak laki laki seusia mereka memang cukup sulit untuk berteman dengan anak perempuan  namun J K  Rowling dapat dengan mulus mempersatukan mereka bertiga Kejadian di dalam ruang rahasia tempat penyimpanan batu bertuah pun cukup menarik  J K  Rowling berhasil menggunakan semua kemapuan dari tokoh utama untuk dapat mengatasi segala rintangan di dalam ruangan tersebut sampai akhirnya Harry bertemu dengan Dark Lord untuk pertama kalinya dalam wujud yang sama sekali tidak terduga  Sampai akhirnya buku ini diselesaikan sebagai pembuka bagi buku selanjutnya yang memang sudah menjadi ciri khas J K  Rowling Mysterious and exiting story Juga dipublikasikan di blog saya http   bacareviewbuku blogspot com   I have never seen a Harry Potter movie so i decided to read the first book  Basically Harry Potter has to lead a hard life  His parents die in a car crash when he is still a baby  and he is brought to his Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia  He lives a life of being unwanted and by his eleventh birthday Harry Potter receives a mysterious letter from a certain Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry  telling him that he is chosen as one of the future students of that supposedly renowned school  Hagrid  a gigantic man brings the letter  finally introduces Harry into the real circumstances of his life  His parents were a wizard and a witch  they were killed by the evil wizard Voldemort protecting him  Harry has lightning shaped scar on his forehead from that event  Its sad how the Dursleys never told him anything about who he was  Severus Snape  seems to plot on stealing something that is guarded by a three headed dog  Since nobody would believe some first years to have found out such important thing that even would incriminate a Hogwarts teacher  they face on many obstacles to spread the truth  I would recommend this book to anyone who has a lot of time on their hands  otherwise watch the movie  I have not seen the movie because I m sure lots of things were changed  This book is about young Harry Potter as he discovers something quite strange  He is a wizard  He also finds out that he is going to be going to Hogwarts school of Witch Craft and Wizardry  where he will learn  wait for it  how to be a wizard  In this first installment of the series they did a great job at being able to stay really close to the books  They picked a perfect actor for Harry and all of the special effects in the book looked really well done  I always have loved seeing the things that I read about and then put up onto the big screen for me to enjoy I would recommend this book to everyone  If you haven t seen this movie or read this book I would like you to do one thing  Move out of the rock that you have been living under because everyone loves harry potter  This book is the book that literally taught me to read  I read every single one of these books in third grade  It is because of these books that I have such an appreciation for reading nowadays  Do yourself a favor  read this book  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone is about a boy names Harry Potter  who finds out in the beginning of the book that he is a wizard  He goes to this school called Hogwarts and becomes friends with Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley  They go on many adventures together and get into a lot of trouble together  Harry has this scar on his forhead that he got for the Dark Wizard Lord Voldemort  who kills his parents and tries to kill Harry but can t  At the end of the book  they stop Voldemort by getting the Sorcerer s Stone before he can In the book  Hagrid wakes up most of the neighbors when he drops Harry off at his aunt and uncles house because he howls with sadness  but in the movie he just cries a little  In the book  Harry meets Draco Malfoy before he gets to the school  but doesn t in the movie  Hermione doesn t fix Harry s glasses in the book like she does in the movie  Hagrid doesn t show them the baby dragon in the book like he does in the movie  they find out about it and confront him I would totally recommend this book to others  The fact that there were wizards in a world of humans and they hide themselves from the humans is very cool and interesting  I wouldn t change a thing about the book  It is awesome  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone is the first of a fantasy series for children of all ages  though the intended audience  or reading level  is about the sixth grade  This first installment introduces the reader to Harry Potter  an orphan who lives with his aunt and uncle  The reader is also introduced to the Wizarding World  and Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry  I give this book 5 stars  I love the Harry Potter series and cannot say enough good things about this book  In The Sorcerer s Stone  Harry is faced with a number of challenges  He learns he is famous and how his parents really died  and he is bombarded with a world he didn t know existed  This strange new world is the first one in which he truly feels like himself  and where he feels accepted for the first time in his life  While each installment of the series presents different themes and struggles  this one is a story of finding oneself  Harry makes good friends in this story  and learns to accept himself as well  The writing is phenomenal  There is no shortage of adventure or discovery  Though it is the title  there are so many wonderful things going on  the reader almost forgets that there will at some point be something magical called The Sorcerer s Stone  The names of the characters are chosen with care based on the meanings of their origins  The spells in the book are written the same way  with a strong Latin root  There are no pictures  save the small icons beneath the chapter names  There are no illustrations needed  The imagery with which this book is written surpasses anything that could be drawn on paper  Every detail is described in the best possible way  They are not painstaking details  but necessary and extraordinary ones  Each sentence is compelling and drives you to the next  I m sure young readers would enjoy this book  as many have already  Summary  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone by J K  Rowling is the first book in the Harry Potter series  The book begins with Harry as a normal everyday guy until abnormal things started happening to him  Harry is an orphan who lives with his Aunt and Uncle  Growing up  Harry always thought that his parents died in a car crash  It was the day of Harry s cousin Dudley s birthday and the family went to the local zoo  Harry and his second family were in the reptile center of the zoo when the glass unexpectedly broke of an anaconda cage  The snake started talking to Harry and he understood it  He was completely shocked at himself being able to understand a snake  Harry s aunt and uncle got very upset when all of this happened and immediately went home  They packed up everything and moved into a light house out in the middle of nowhere  At twelve o  clock midnight  Harry turned eleven  At the change of the minute  a door came busting down out of nowhere  In walked a giant human named Hagrid  He introduced himself and why he was there  Hagrid handed Harry a letter that told him he had been accepted into Hogwrats the School of Witch craft and Wizardry  Harry s aunt and uncle came rushing down to see what was going on  The aunt and uncle knew everything about how Harry s parents died and about magic  Harry went with Hagrid because he wanted to be free of his aunt and uncle s grasp  Hagrid explained everything to Harry about Hogwarts and about how Harry was a half blood  I half blood means that one of the parents was a muggle and the other was a pure blood  Both of Harry s parents went to Hogwarts and got married as soon as they graduated  Harry s parents were murdered by a man named Voldemort  Voldemort  he who must not be named   was a man of dark magic  He had the opportunity to kill Harry when his parents were murdered but couldn t because of the love Harry s parents showed for him  Voldemort had no love in his life  When Harry got to the world of magic  everyone knew who he was  He was the boy who lived  No one is given a second chance with  he who must not be named   Harry gets to Hogwarts with all of his school supplies  including a wand  The professors group all of the incoming students together and divide them into house  Harry is selected to go into the Gryffindor house  Everything is knew to Harry  but thankfully he has Ron Wesley to help him through the process  He befriends Ron and this other girl named Hermione Granger  They face the ups and downs of the magic life together  Harry  Ron  and Hermione discover that there is a stone that holds eternal life being hidden in Hogwarts  They also find out that Voldemort is trying to steal the stone so that he can live and haunt everyone forever  The three determined kids try to stop him from stealing it  so they try to find the stone before Voldemort does  When Harry finds the room that the stone is hidden in  he finds Professor Quirrell standing in the room in front of a mirror  This professor was Harry s Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher  Harry is completely shocked to find him there  Quirrell tells Harry that the mirror in that room shows you what you desire most in life  Harry took a look in the mirror to see that the stone is in his pocket  Quirrell asks him what he sees and Harry denies seeing the stone  There is a frightening voice that tells Quirrell that he wants to speak to Harry face to face  The Professor takes off his turban for Harry to find Voldemort  living  on the back of his head  Voldemort demands Quirrell to kill Harry but is burned by the contact of Harry  Quirrell dies and Harry saves the day  The owner of the stone decided that it was best if the rock was destroyed  With Harry s heroic act  he led his house to victory in winning the house cup  Response  I thought this book was very well written and thought out  It grabs your attention right when you start reading it and you are always wanting to know what happens next  At some points I actually felt like I was a student at Hogwarts experiencing the things that Harry  Ron  and Hermione did  Some people think that it is a devil book  but really it is a fictional book with a fantastic story plot  There is nothing said in the book about worshipping the devil  Harry Potter is most definitely not for everyone  but I do recommend this book for anyone who is looking for an adventurous book to read  I am very interested to read the rest of the books now 3 Critical Questions  All for Rowling   sorry I m a newfound Harry Potter fan 1  How did you Rowling come up with the character Harry Potter 2  How long did it take you to perfect the final draft of this novel  I never read it as a middle highschooler because I was intimidated by how thick the books are to be honest 3  When the first book was released  did people put down your ideas about a new and different series  I can only imagine the rebuttal for writing a novel about an adolescent wizard  back before the times of Stephanie Meyer s vampires and werewolves  I would speculate that Harry Potter actually paved the way for them  J K Rowling s Harry Potter and The Sorcerer s stone was a very good book  I was very enthralled by this book after reading  It all starts with Harry Potter being orphaned as a baby and is forced to move with his undesirable aunt and uncle Petunia and Vernon Dursley  whom of which have a son named Dudley who torments and bullies Harry  Later on letters are sent for Harry and Vernon is constantly trying to keep them from him  Harry eventually gets accepted to The Hogwarts School of Witchcraft   Wizardry and learns all this time Vernon has tried to keep him from knowing about his wizardry  This book was riveting and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who loves adventure and great stories   It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies  but just as much to stand up to our friends   This quote explains a lot about the book about how you have to be brave and stand up for what you believe in  Bravery  Authority  Humility and learning are all major points to this novel  I enjoyed how this novel really kept my interest  how it was written and how it was written  it just shows Harry having to overcome all these obstacles but striving and progressing  Harry is the  protagonist  and went from being an amateur weakling to a hero  Hermione is a friend he eventually makes  they become friends shortly after realizing their similar beliefs and interests but Ron was Harrys first friend at Hogwarts they become good friends  J K Rowling did an amazing job making the characters  they all coexist and well together  which create an overall compelling story  the characters are all perfect  very believable  The setting took place the majority of the time at Hogwarts  which is full of people doing preternatural things  but all of them doing the same however some more experienced than others  Harry goes to Hogwarts and learns a lot about magic and goes through a lot of humility learning but in the end shocks everyone  Harry proves himself  This compares to real life in a way  we all go through humility some points in our live but we eventually all learn  It s all about learning  This book is a 5 out of 5 it was great and kept my interest  The book proved many themes like don t judge people  you never know what they are capable of  or be brave it will most likely pay off  great book  great read   Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone is the fist book in the seven book Harry Potter series  It introduces Harry Potter  who is orphaned and is sent to live with his mean aunt and uncle  He discovers that he is a wizard and goes to a school called Hogwarts  While there he makes the friends he has always dreamed of having and has an adventure of a lifetime  I think this is an amazing book and series  It is one that I grew up reading  The plot is great for children to help and expand their imaginations  I would use this book in my classroom as a fun read rather than connecting it to a certain lesson   This book has been controversial because some religious groups feel that it is inappropriate to read about witchcraft  it is a great book to have as pleasure reading and can help students to expand their vocabulary  This book can be a little scary in some parts  especially if a young reader is reading it is the only thing that parents should think about while their children are reading this book  The Magic StoneDo like mysteries and magic  Well then you will love Harry Potter And The Sorcerers Stone by J K  Rowling  My book was published in 1997 by Scholastic Inc  Harry lives in a very small town where no one will notice him locked in a hallway closet with his snotty aunt and uncle  Then he figures out how his parents die and that he was a wizard and makes many journeys with his new friends Ron and Hermione  Harry Potter lives with his aunt and uncle and his cousin they all hate him  He has to live with them because his parents supposedly died in a car accident  One day Harry starts getting all of the letters that Hagrid one of the characters is sending him  They tell Harry that he is a wizard and he has been accepted to a magic school for witches and wizards  He goes to this school and he starts to make some serious enemies  At Hogwarts School he finds some secrets that he isn t supposed to know   I thought this book was amazing  It was one of the best books I have ever read  My favorite part was when Harry saved the day at the quidditch match and made all of the other teams jealous with his big win  I would recommend this to older kids because there is a bit of violence and death  I give this book a ten out of ten because it was amazing it was also very exciting to read   This author has seven other books to read and they are going to be a big hit  I can t wait to read these other books  To me  I thought this book was awesome it had so many surprises that you will not be ready for  I think a lot of people should buy this book and the rest of the series   Harry Potter invites children in to a whole new world of witchcraft and wizardry  This book begins with a seemingly normal boy named Harry  an orphan who now lives with his mean aunt and uncle  learning that he is actually a wizard  From this  begins the whole story of how Harry Potter became an orphan and how he is a celebrity in the world of magic  Harry Potter than moves away from his home with his aunt and uncle to Hogwarts  the school of witchcraft and wizardry  Harry quickly learns about this world that he never knew and existed and is shocked by some of the things he finds out about himself  Harry makes two best friends at school  Ron and Hermione  whom never leave his side after there friendship begins  This book is great for young kids because there are seven books and the child can essentially grow up with Harry  Ron  and Hermione  Each book gets a little more complex so it is fun for children to read the books as they grow up along with Harry  Ron  and Hermione  J K Rowling does such a great job with these books  the reader may start to believe they are a part of Hogwarts too  Primeira experiencia de leitura que tive na vida  Assim como o resto dos livros da serie  tenho a primeira edicao brasileira  Acredito que este foi o livro que inspirou minha geracao a gostar de ler  Querida pelo mundo todo  a serie que comeca com este livro foi inspirada por obras como O Senhor Dos Aneis e inspirou outras como Percy Jackson  Imaginado primeiramente em um trem  e escrito em cafes de Londres  A Pedra Filosofal nao e meu livro favorito  sequer na serie  mas e um dos mais importantes e queridos por mim O livro narra o comeco das aventuras de Harry Potter  um menino aparentemente comum que descobre ter sangue bruxo  e e convidado a estudar em uma escola para gente como ele  Hogwarts  Tendo um passado misterioso  Harry vive varias aventuras ao longo desse primeiro ano ao lado de dois grandes amigos  Ronald Weasley e Hermione Granger  que o ajudam a enfrentar a primeira personificacao de seu inimigo Voldemort  que parasita um professor para se apossar da Pedra Filosofal  que lhe garantiria vida eterna  I have lost count of exactly how many times I ve read Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Sorcerer s Stone  The second time was definitely in preparation for the final book release  The third was likely when I reread them all in British edition  There were at least of couple of rereads in anticipation of movie releases   another reread for nostalgia s sake   oh  and a couple of attempts in different languages  Despite these murky recollections of rereading  I remember exactly the first time I entered the world of young Potter   August 2005  As a sparkling fresh college grad  I declared my disgust with all things fantasy  Dragons  Ew  Witches  Ick  Wands and pointy hats and dwarves and pointy ears and imaginary languages and pointing friends who declared I absolutely had to watch The Neverending Story Labyrinth Lord of the Rings Etc  All of it grossed me out  Unless the fantastic worlds were rooted in Wonderland lore  which I viewed as imaginative not magical  I had no interest  As a child  my parents steered me away from entertainment focused on magic and the supernatural so I never developed a taste for it  Newly released movies and books set in the world of fantasy held no appeal  and I abhorred the hype of related franchises  admittedly tied to some art student snobbery   Then  I entered the real world  After graduating from undergrad  I was fortunate to land a teaching gig at a local junior high  It doesn t matter how many years have passed  middle school never becomes a place of joy and wonder  School book fairs  however  are a different story  I ve loved books since childhood and acquiring new ones has often been an obsession  Years of studying to get into schools and then to maintain high grades left me little time to read for pleasure  Then  spending all day with hormonal adolescents made me crave any source of readily available pleasure  A book fair at my school  I ll be there at lunch  And then again after school  I ll swing back by after this student finishes sharing her fairy drawings with me   Fairies  Oh  why    While I picked up several books at the sale  I only recall one  A  2 Scholastic paperback featuring a bespeckled boy on a broom  I did it for the children  While I hated that everyone was talking about Harry Potter  I had an even greater dislike for knowing less than my students about something  I thought   Well  it s only two bucks  I can read it and figure out what they keep going on about     Then  I continued to spend my evenings with friends drinking PBR from glass boots and eating overpriced vegetarian fare with great gusto  That is  of course  when I wasn t plagued by chronic strep throat  kids are germ factories   Suddenly  it was the end of the summer  I was no longer a student for the first time since the 80s  I d said au revoir to my college town and was getting ready to move abroad to teach  Bedridden and speechless from a tonsillectomy  I was gutted by the death of my thirteen year old schnauzer  Full of snot and sorrow  I picked up the boy wizard from my dwindling stack of unread books since it couldn t help but be better than what I was currently living  Shock and awe followed  Why  it s set at a school  I like schools  These subjects are fascinating  Maybe I should have studied something other than art  Oh  it s so British  I want to go back to London  maybe visit Scotland  Before I knew it  the book was done  While the story was all about a wizarding world  the fantasy lurked beneath the surface of human society  The world Rowling created existed secretly alongside normal reality with characters conscious of their magical distinction  Focusing on a boy starting a new kind of school and pursing a mystery  I found an entry point into a world of fantasy  Still bedridden  I requested my mother check out the next book from the local library  disbelief ensued   The sixth book had just been released in the States so I gorged on Harry s story  amazed as each installment not only built upon the mystery of a boy s scar but also depicted a magical society full of historical rebellions  racism  corrupt politics  and passionate educators  Soon after moving to France that fall  I attended the midnight release of the French version of The Half Blood Prince with a group of new friends and a few frogs in capes  I was hanging out with costume wearing  fantasy enthusiasts  Who had I become   My mother had been concerned that Harry Potter might be a gateway drug to the occult  In reality  she was kind of right  Rowling s series revealed to me that fantasy could be escapist  mysterious  imaginative  divertive  and fun   just like the art I enjoyed viewing and creating  Nothing Earth shattering to normal readers  but the series changed my reading habits and reignited my enthusiasm for children s literature  Now  it s almost a decade later  I m in another new country  this time in a different role  wife  unemployed for the sake of her husband s career  Cold and uninspired to get out of the house in thousands of layers  Enter  the discovery that my library offers digital downloads of audiobooks  Without question  the world of Harry Potter is a perfect place in which to disappear  As an audiobook  the story came alive in a whole new way   preserving the verbal detailing of the settings and narration while bringing distinctive voices to each character  The Hogwarts crew kept me company while cooking  folding laundry  even dusting and mopping  The drudgery of housewifery became a pleasurable time of rediscovering the joy of wizards  And that is a sentence I never would have thought I d write and a feeling I never thought I d have   Never underestimate the weak and timid  This exciting adventure begins somewhere you might not expect   4 Privet Drive England  Harry Potter  a nobody that was not even close to being popular  lives with his relatives the Dursleys  They are the worst people on earth  they make him live in the closet  One dark and stormy night  Harry was celebrating his eleventh birthday  by himself  and something happened that would change his life forever  Harry is visited by a giant named Hagrid that tells Harry he is a Wizard  Not just any Wizard  he is the Wizard that lived from an attack caused by Lord Voldemort  The King of Darkness  Hagrid explains to Harry that there is a school where wizards and witches train called Hogwarts  When he goes to Hogwarts he meets people like Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger  who befriend him  and take on the challenges with Harry and help in the cause to fight against Voldemort I would recommend this book because it has a well thought out story  There is a lot of meaning to the writing  For example  Harry goes through a transition from being a nobody to a celebrity  The Author captures an eleven year old boy s mind perfectly  I will definitely read the rest of the series   There are different ways to create a long running series  Stephen King  for example  had a rough outline for the Dark Tower when he began the first book  but the story grew and changed radically  as evidenced by the fact that the last two books include a quest to save King himself from the runaway van that hit him in real life in 1999  Then there is the X Files method of series building  which is basically to make it up as you go  occasionally throwing in big revelations now and then in the hope that someday they will all add up to something interesting and logical Then there is the JK Rowling method  As I understand it  she spent four years first outlining all seven books in intricate detail before even setting pen to paper  And then she wrote the first book in a cafe during her infant daughter s afternoon naptime  Having spent a LOT of time writing in cafes across the world  I find that image especially powerful  In the bustle of a cafe with a sleeping baby beside her  Rowling still had the imagination and presence of mind to include so many interesting nods to books that wouldn t be written for years So I thought I would look through the first chapter of Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone  or HP   the Sorcerer s Stone in the US  to see what seemingly insignificant details were actually references to large plot points in later books  Obviously  there will be spoilers  Mrs  Figg looks after Harry when the Dursleys leave town  In Book 5  Harry learns that Mrs  Figg knew he was a wizard all along  and is part of Dumbledore s network of protections that he has arranged since Harry s parents died  McGonagall can turn into a cat  In Book 1  a witch turning into an animal is a fun little magic is neat moment  but one entire book in the series is devoted to  animagi  as Rowling calls them  Dumbledore has a crooked nose  It is not until Book 7 that we learn Dumbledore s brother broke his nose in a fight at their baby sister s funeral  The put outer  Dumbledore s little cigarette lighter looking thing doesn t show up again until Book 7  when it is rechristened the  deluminator   a device that inexplicably enables Ron to follow Harry and Hermione when their group temporarily gets separated  Dumbledore has a sweet tooth  This isn t so much a plot point as a consistent character trait  Once Harry gets access to Dumbledore s office in later books  the password to enter is always a different type of candy  including the  sherbet lemon    lemon drops  in the US  candies he is eating in this chapter  The Dursleys know wizards use owls  When Vernon broaches the subject of Petunia s sister Lily  he connects a news story about owls to  their lot   meaning James and Lily Potter s community of wizards  Petunia doesn t have to ask what he means because she grew up jealously watching Lily receive owls from her friends and school  Sirius Black s motorcycle  Hagrid flies baby Harry to safety on Sirius Black s motorcycle  but it is not until Book 3 that we find out how strange it was that Sirius lent his bike to anyone  Hagrid comments that Sirius must have lent him the bike because it would be too recognizable while he was fleeing from the law  The lightning scar  While Rowling doesn t  reveal  until the end of Book 7 that Harry s scar is the last horcrux  it s pretty clear from the moment horcruxes are introduced in Book 6  However  in Book 1  Dumbledore is very interested in the scar  telling McGonagall he wouldn t heal it even if he could Rowling delivers all of this in  what  10 12 pages in the first chapter of the first book  Even more remarkable is that none of these details are delivered with a wink or any particular emphasis  They all  with the possible exception of the lemon drops  which seem to exist only to make Dumbledore seem eccentric  make sense in the context of the chapter  Now you could make the argument that these details were just that  details  when JK Rowling wrote the first book  and she chose to make them mean something later on  A good author could pull that off  But that s not what happened  Rowling knew exactly where she was going  and had the unique patience and foresight to leave readers little clues about the future of her series from the very beginning Sadly I am already behind the curve set by Ms  Rowling  When I wrote the first book in what is now the Leon Martin series  I had no idea it would be a  first  book  It was just a book  So now I have the X Files esque job of making sure that the new material fits with the old in such a way that it looks like I had the whole thing planned out from the beginning  Both methods can work  but when I look at Harry Potter and the X Files  or the Dark Tower series  as whole  single pieces of fiction  it is clear to me that Rowling s method has the better pay off  Interested in magic  Maybe the supernatural  Well then Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone is the book for you  J K  Rowlings Harry Potter and the Sorcerers stone is awesome I like the setting of the book  It is in London Europe  And the school Hogwarts  a huge castle that acts as a wizarding school  The details Rowling puts into the setting and its surroundings makes it so that just by closing my eyes I can picture the whole thing and every little detail in my mind  I like J K  Rowlings style  The way she progresses from one part of the book to another always makes me wonder what will happen next  At the end of every chapter there is always a huge cliffhanger  and I couldn t wait to turn the page to see what would happen next  Sometimes it was so good that I even had to cover up the rest of the page so I wouldn t read what happened next  My recommendation is that you should read this book  I would give it a 9 5 out of 10  But if you do read this book be prepared because you will be hooked  So go ahead and get ready to read the other books in the series after this one  I need to first explain a few things a  I read this book and the entire series in third gradeb  That takes dedication  for a series with seven books  some with 700 some pages  one with more and an eight year old to read themc  The magic of Harry Potter has stayed with me all this time So  as you can probably tell  I love Harry Potter  The Philosopher Sorcerer s Stone is probably one of my favorite books in the series  I can t exactly identify why  but I think it may have to do with the    innocence  I guess you d call it  of Harry at the time that you can t exactly identify in the last three books  I reread the series one to two times a year and the well written ness of the book still amazes me  You truly feel like Harry  discovering the magical world he has been hidden from for the first 10 years of his life  The magic is beautifully captured on the pages of the book  needless to say  I would absolutely recommend the book And yes  I have truly lost count of how many times I ve read it  6 19 0711 1 10   Obviously  I adore these books  I don t re read a lot  especially since I ve gotten older  but this is my third time on this book and I expect I ll be reading it a lot more times in the future  If you count the audiobook version  I suppose this is my fourth time through  Since I ve read this quite a few times  I m not going to talk so much about the story  I will note that I noticed the changes in the book this time that I hadn t before  The change of crumpett to muffin  bogey to booger  football to soccer  and chips to fries  Of course  there s philosopher to sorcerer  Not knowing a lot about alchemy  this change didn t bother me much  But the little ones in the books annoy the hell out of me  I had originally gotten this book in paperback  as I usually do  and then replaced it later with a hardback copy  so I thought that this was a later change  but reading the Wiki tells me that this is just an issue with the US version of the first book  I d really rather have a British copy then  Maybe I ll look for that  9 30 11   Em had previously tried to read this one on her own  While the age level of the writing and the story are perfectly fine for her level  it s quite a bit longer than what she normally reads  so she gave up after about a 1 3 of the way in  However  she LOVES these stories and the movies  so we decided I d read them to her for bedtime stories  We just finished this one last night  I loved reading it to her and I think she liked hearing it again  Her first experience with the actual book was the Jim Dale audiobook 3 15 14   Starting a series re read today  I got the new Scholastic set for Christmas  so I m eager to read them with these new covers by Kazu Kibuishi  I doubt I ll add anything for a review when I m done unless something comes to mind  Obvs I adore these books  3 16 14   Finished this one up today  Like I said not a lot to add  I was struck by some little hints for future things  For instance  Harry notes that it was like Snape could read his mind  And obviously Voldemort does in the end  I also noticed that Harry was looking up what dittany was at some point  I did remember the mention of the bezoar in the beginning  There were a few other things that I neglected to note as I was reading and can t remember now  but I enjoyed those   The Harry Potter books hold a very special place in my heart  because these masterpieces were my first literature experience that made me open my eyes to the wonderful world of books  I ll just stick shortly to what I thought about the first Potter book  It contains a wonderful mix of fun  sweetness  sadness and excitement  To a 6 year old  it was almost frightening  but I have always loved some terror so it just made the book even more golden to me  Harry is a very well developed protagonist  who will quickly work his way into the reader s heart  His backstory with his relatives does not serve to make him a tragic hero  but instead it just makes him a sympathetic character and as a reader you want it to go well for him Favorite quote   It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies  but just as much to stand up to our friends   Favorite scene  When Harry met the Weasley s at the platform  and then became best friends with Ron Nothing else to say than it is a real winner  and will most likely stand the test of time   along with Lord of the Rings and Chronicles of Narnia

words can not explain how much I enjoyed this book  Joanne is such an amazing author  the way she had a story going for 7 books and 8 movies is amazing  I have read this series maybe 6 times and watched 13 times  Harry Potter has changed my life in a way that only happens once or twice  J K  Rowling brings her seven part  sweeping story to its dramatic conclusion in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows  a tense and spellbinding narrative that moves at breakneck speed  despite its bulk  toward the inevitable final confrontation between now seventeen year old Harry and the evil wizard Voldemort  This time around Rowling deviates from the pattern that is so familiar in the others  there is no return to Hogwart s for Harry  Ron  and Hermione at the start of the school year  Voldemort and the Death Eaters now control the Ministry of Magic and the school  And so while the dwindling members of the Order of the Phoenix battle on like the resistance fighters they are  and while thousands of innocents face persecution and death  the three friends are committed to completing the task Dumbeldore set for Harry  hunting down and destroying the Horcruxes that harbor pieces of Voldemort s splintered soul  Rowling does follow the cycle of the seasons that has been so much a part of the passage of time in the previous stories  offering this comforting familiairty as she chronicles the distress in the world she s created and the three friends  dangerous  uncertain journey  And she continues to weave her spell of magic  blending an imaginative and inventive plot  teasing humor  and complex  fascinating characters into an irresistible story  As Rowling s narrative moves through fall and winter into spring  she is preparing both Harry and readers for its conclusion  which comes in a dazzling  ferocious battle involving all those they have come to either love or despise  At the center of it all is the young wizard who is willing do whatever it takes to save all that he holds in his heart  A little more explanation of one or two elements essential to understanding the final outcome may have been in order  but ultimately it s all there to be discovered and understood  Rowling has done both her story and her readers justice as she brings her smart and incredibly satisfying tale to an end   I adore these books and have ever since I was a child  I am a 25 year old adult now  I was never a good reader  in fact I was almost put in special ed classes because at 8 I was still not reading  until one day I just started to read  Amazingly within a year I was reading past a 12th grade reading level  Once I started to read I fell in love with the past time and consumed books  making my school book fairs lots of money    I was introduced to HP by my school liberian who I knew very well at age 10 and was hooked immediately  I read The Philosopher s Stone in just a few short days  I waited for each book thereafter to come out and when movies were announced my imagination came to life  I was  and still am  an extremely ill child so books were a place of refuge for me  a place to escape my physical pain and discomfort  worlds where I could fly existed enabling me to leave my bed or sofa for a couple of hours  Over the years I have been able to revisit the wonderful writing of J K  Rowling  allowing me to still feel what I once felt as a child  Each year I revisit the entire series and always look forward to doing so  The writing lets you feel as if you too are with Harry  Ron  and Hermione fighting Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters  WIth her words beautiful scenery is painted helping you picture Hogwarts Castle  the faces of your new  or old  friends inside the pages  or the kind wizend face of Professor Albus Dumbledore  Lastly  what I have learned over the years is that this series is not a child or YA series  on the contrary  In fact  this series is meant for all ages  Every time I go back to the series I learn a new lesson  something I did not know or understand at 10 or 15  When I open the pages for a 6th time I discover a new riddle or puzzle that I had not figured out before  Pieces of the story come together each time better and better  This is not to say I am not understanding the story or that it is a difficult read  no  just that in different times in my life and at different ages and stages I understand parts of the story better and certain aspects of the stories resonate with me more  This is the beauty of this series In short  this series is not to be overlooked  As Rowling s debut novel and introduction to this series  Rowling had quite a feat to accomplish in this book  First  she had to introduce all of her characters  paint her world of wizardry for her readers  and also set up the premise for the entire series  Rowling manages to accomplish all of this in this shortest of all the books in the series without sacrificing her storytelling at all  I have read the book at least 20 times and I never cease to be amazed at finding little details briefly mentioned in this book that end up being major plot points several books later in the series  It is clear from book one that Rowling had a carefully thought out plan for this series Harry Potter is my favorite series  There s a reason why Rowling is now a billionaire  and I can only dream of accomplishing half of what she has  After I finished reading Sorcerer s Stone for the first time  I put it down and thought   they re going to make a movie out of this  and it s gonna suck   Low and behold  my prediction was correct  They did make a movie  and it was horrible   However  I will give the filmmakers credit that the movies got considerably much better in the latter films   The main reason why I think the first movie was particularly horrible was because they made a big deal about the magic with extremely corny music accentuating the magic  However  in Harry Potter s world  the magic is just another part of everyday life  The filmmaker s initial gut reaction to  kid up  the story highlights what I find particularly frustrating about people who haven t given this series a chance  Those who have not actually read Harry Potter have misconceptions about this being a childish series  The first film in the series did nothing to help this reputation  Have you ever noticed people doing weird stuff  Stuff that a normal humans couldn t do  According to the book Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone  this is called wizardry  The Harry Potter series is an exciting world of wizards  witches  spells  ghosts and villains  During this book you will discover a little boy named Harry Potter  who grows up and becomes a wizard  Harry gets sent off to a wizard school called Hogwarts  where he creates new friendships and learns all the things wizards do  Although he finally achieves his goals  he runs into a lot of conflicts along the way  The main characters in this book are Harry Potter  Ron Weasley  Hermione Granger  Dumbledore  Hagrid  and Voldemort  This book is all about how Harry grows up to be a wizard  and he meets his main allies Ron and Hermione  The head president of Hogwarts is Professor Dumbledore  who is calm and very smart about the way he wants to run the school  Hagrid is the keeper of keys and grounds at the school  and also is the one who helps Harry prepare for his new wizard life  The main conflict of this book is an evil wizard named Voldemort  or he who shall not be named  He was one of the best wizards Hogwarts ever had  but then he turned into a renegade  Some motifs in this book are wizardry  confidence  friendship  and bullying  Wizardry is a motif because it occurs all throughout the book since Harry and his friends go to wizard school  Confidence is seen as a motif because Harry has many difficult situations that he has to deal with that shows he went beyond his boundaries to complete  When Harry meets a boy named Ron  their friendship begins  and this motif shows the relationship they have throughout the book  Bullying  on the other hand  wasn t very helpful to Harry  From beginning to end  Malfoy was against Harry and didn t accept his kindness  The book Harry Potter falls into the fantasy genre  It s a fantasy book because fantasy books are made up  and can t happen  Being a wizard and ghosts flying around is not something that could happen in the future  One symbol that I realized is the scar on Harry s forehead  This represents his connection with his family and with Voldemort  Moreover  I realized that each group house that the wizards have represents something  The houses are Gryffindor  Hufflepuff  Ravenclaw  Slytherin  Gryffindor symbolizes bravery and chivalry  Hufflepuff shows loyalty and patience  Ravenclaw represents wizards who are wise and witty  Lastly  Slytherin symbolizes clever and creative wizards  During my time reading this book I thought the author  J  K  Rowling  did great with explaining her ideas  She did a lot of showing and not telling  which helped me with my reading comprehension  Additionally  she put great thought into her writing  She created a story that is so inspiring and creative  I really enjoyed the writing style in this book  The author made every scene in the book very detailed and descriptive  She was so clear about her writing  she basically made me feel like I was in their world  In this text  I really enjoyed the characters and loved learning about their personalities and lifestyles  These characters  especially Harry  interested me and caught my attention  due to the way they grow up and become wizards  I love the genre  fantasy  I love learning about things like ghosts  wizards  witches  vampires  etc  From reading this book  I learned to never give up to achieve a goal  and to always have confidence in myself  Harry achieved his goal by working hard and getting the Sorcerers Stone before Voldemort did  He had confidence in himself because he was going all out to catch the golden stitch in his Quidditch game  If you are the kind of reader that likes reading fantasy books and learning about wizards  then you will like this book  Personally  I m not the fastest reader but this book really got my attention and made me want to read more  It is a bit challenging since some of the characters have accents and there are challenging words  Overall  I would rate this book a 9 10   Well  this will always be one of my favorites and a must read for everyone  no matter how young or old  Lots of laughs as this nowhere near perfect hero blunders through his first year at Hogwarts  Obviously intended for younger audiences so don t read it if you re looking to be intellectually challenged  I ve seen adult reviews that say something like  it s so simplistic and has no original thought provoking ideas   I want to ask them then why are you reading a children s book and why are you comparing it to thousand page classics  Anyways  I suppose I could write a long review about how wonderful this book is  but I assume anything I could say here has already been said thousands of times  Oh well  I ll write a long review anyway  One thing I didn t like about the book is how stupid the children are   Ouch  That sounded harsh     Harry blindly rushes into situations that he usually regrets  He doesn t think about the consequences of his idiotic actions  His overblown ideas of honor  bravery  loyalty  etc   which I have no idea where they came from  He had zero role models and was mistreated 24 7  So where did he learn to be such a wonderful person   often get him punished  Also  Harry assumes that Snape must be working with Voldemort just because he s mean and he punishes Harry  which seems rather unfair to Snape  Annoying people aren t automatically Death Eaters  I guess he s a kid and it s ok for him to make mistaken assumptions  but you don t have to tell people about it and make a huge mess and try to stop people who don t need to be stopped  Of course  I m being a hypocrite and judging this book on an adult scale  As a book for kids  it s phenomenal  I like how Harry is definitely not perfect  which creates a feeling of empathy within the reader and creates a character that kids can relate to  It s especially nice to see a character that although slightly behind in school excels in sports  which is realistic and many kids can relate to  Despite all of the book s  faults   it never fails to make me laugh  It s a new book every time you read it   Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone is the thrilling first installment of the series where all of the  magic  began  The novel begins at the small  quiet house on Number Four Privet Drive  Little Whinging  Surrey where the book s eleven year old protagonist  Harry Potter  lives in the cupboard under the stairs  He was orphaned at a young age after his parents were killed in a tragic accident and was sent to live with the Dursleys  Aunt Petunia  Uncle Vernon  and their son  Dudley  His only living relatives treat him poorly  making Harry s childhood miserable Harry s unhappy demeanor is replaced by one of elation when he receives a letter inviting him to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry  the finest school for witches and wizards in all of Britain  As the novel unfolds  Harry begins his first year at Hogwarts where he is introduced to the wizarding world  befriends other students  and comes face to face with adversity  The twists and turns  mounting suspense  and thrilling perils that Harry encounters render this book life changning and unforgettable Rowling has a rare talent for creating believable  realistic characters that gradually change as the story progresses  These characters  as some people would say  possess a certain amount of depth  Their unique personalities and traits distinguish them from the characters in similar novels  Harry embodies all of the characteristics of a true hero  courage  tenacity  and an inclination to protect others  Harry is willing to sacrifice everything  including his own life  to ensure the safety of others  Rowling accurately captures his desire to protect those he loves  whatever the cost  Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone is the one story in literature that almost everyone has read  I believe that it is a great book to get children reading when they are ready to read a book without pictures  I believe that a child in KS2 can start reading this book on their own or as a great book for parents to read their children before they go to bed  The first book also covers a number of key topics that can be discussed with pupils  bullying  making friends  coping with change  adapting to change in person circumstance  This book cover a number of sensitive topics that can be used to help pupils overcome personal issues  The book start with owls flying around in the middle of the day  This is what caught my imagination and I could not put the book down after that  I have not focused on what the book is about  I have focused on how the book can be used and why it is a good book to help talk about sensitive issues  This book will help children build their imagination and practice reading without it feeling like they are learning and to me that is very important in a child s education  Overall this is a book that has changed the world and I will not be surprised if it becomes a book pupils will read in the national curriculum very soon  I was late to the Harry Potter party  A coworker asked me if I d read it and I d never even heard of it  When my bookclub was looking for a fun light read we chose it and from that point I was hooked Lively and fun  the author not only has a story to tell  but she tells it well  The writing style is well done   not overly lyrical or flowery  This is a plot driven story with good character development and it reads well With fantasy  sci fi  and other genres that draw from a different reality  authors have a tough job   they have to build a world and make us believe in it  Some can do it and some cannot  Rowling did it well with the Harry Potter series  She made a world that was so completely fantastical how could we possibly buy into it for the story  And yet we did  At least I did  and gathering from the fantastic popularity and success of the series  I m guessing many many people did  The book has messages but it doesn t clobber you over the head with them  well  maybe a little light clobbering  but I didn t even mind really   The characters   all of them  including secondary ones   are compelling  The story was well put together  The world and setting are very well done The writing style is fun and lively  An easy read for an adult  but not dumbed down too much for a younger person   It s funny to realize that this 1st book of Harry Potter is the last book i read  You can say that i am reading Harry Potter series backwards Lol  But it doesnt matter though  This book is really gotten into me  Finished it less than a day because    God  it is the mighty HARRY POTTER  The Dursleys are even more bad than in the movies  Well  it is safe to say that i hate them  _  I honestly dont know what am i supposed to sy except I LOVE THESE SERIES TILL DEATH  Job well done  mrs Rowling    Amazing book  Award winning author J K  Rowling truly engages kids in the life of Harry Potter  When Harry was a baby  both mother and father were murdered  He was sent to live with his uncle and aunt  the Dursley s  Little did he know his true identity was a WIZARD    When Harry turns 11 years old  he sets off to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry  But dangers await Harry in Hogwarts  What s on the 3rd floor  Who s Lord Voldemort  What is the headmaster trying to hide  Read to find out    After listening to friends and family raving about this series  I finally started to read  I must say I was impressed  and amazed  Rowling appeals to all audiences with her intelligent and amusing storytelling abilities When I told a friend I was reading this series  she told disgustedly me to  try reading something for adults   Too bad she ll never enjoy this book as much as I had  Everyone  young or old  should forget what they think they know about childrens  books  and read this series  It was good to finally go back and re read this book  I had forgotten so much of the story and revisit characters that are so important to the story in later books  I had forgotten all about Peeves and wish that his character had of made it into the movies  I m looking forward to reading the rest of the series this year with some of the book bloggers I follow  The author s purpose in writing this book was to entertain her audience  J K  wrote Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone to make her audience experience an action packed and magical story of a legendary boy  Harry Potter  the protagonist and an orphan  is selected to go to a wizardry school called Hogwarts  Rowling writes about the journeys of Harry and his friends  Ron Weasley  and Hermione Granger  These characters made up by Rowling entertain her audience  and make them feel like they are experiencing the events in person  Harry and his friends practiced flying on broomsticks  mixing magical potions  and using wands to cast spells at the wizardry academy  These fictional  distinct practices hook the audience  and they keep them entertained and reading  On Halloween night a teacher yelled   Troll in the dungeons  Thought you ought to know   Rowling 178   This quote stated by the teacher proves that anything could happen at the academy  and it supports Rowling s purpose of to entertain  Harry and his friends encountered a three headed dog  and J K  described it as   They were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog  a dog which filled the whole space between the ceiling and floor  It had three heads  Three pairs of rolling  mad eyes  three noses  twitching and quivering in their direction  three drooling mouths  saliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs   Rowling 119   These detailed events define her purpose in writing this book  so we know she is entertaining her audience with fictional and creative events in a young boy s life  Therefore  Rowling s purpose in writing this book was to entertain because she attaches readers to the novel with her unique ideas The theme is this novel is everything has a purpose no matter where it comes from  J K  wrote about a young orphan boy named Harry  who is treated terribly by his aunt and uncle  Harry might have thought he was a nobody  but what he did not know was that people say he is destined to be the greatest and most historic wizard that has ever lived  This myth supports the theme of this novel because Harry was just a bullied child  but his potential and his future is far more valuable than his past  Hermione Granger  who comes from a family without magical powers  was a snotty girl who followed the rules  When she met Harry and Ron  she turned into a loyal  intelligent friend  and she accompanied Harry to fulfill his legend and destiny  Hermione supports the theme of everything has a purpose because she was unlikely to be chosen to become a wizard  but she got to experience helping the most famous and greatest wizards of all time  Ron Weasley came from a large and poor family of wizards  and he was shy yet sneaky at times  After his first year at Hogwarts with Harry  he grew to be a determined friend  and he would risk his own life for Harry like when he took on the huge chess queen  Ron also supports this theme of everything has a purpose no matter where it comes from because he started out as a poor  normal child  but then he became a brave and generous friend to complete Harry s destiny  J K  wrote about many unusual and different students  and how they had a bigger impact on the future of Hogwarts and Harry s destiny than normal students  Students like Neville Longbottom are bullied for their appearances and are shunned upon  but their actions and loyalty separate them from the average students because they make a difference at the school with their courage and integrity  Smaller characters like Neville are the most unlikely people to have an impact on the academy  but Rowling makes them support the theme of everything has a purpose by involving them in Harry s adventures  and making them do courageous acts  The theme of this novel is everything has a purpose no matter where it s from because characters with the worst  unusual pasts end up serving a greater purpose in the future at the school or for Harry s legend The style of this book is a narration because Rowling tells a story through a series of chronological events  The author s style in this novel is a narration because J K  wrote about events in chronological order like when she said   They seized a broomstick each and kicked off into the air  soaring in the midst of the cloud keys  They grabbed and snatched but the bewitched keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to catch one   Rowling 203   This quote proves that the style is a narration because Rowling stated how they did these actions in chronological order  Her style of a narration is very effective because she was able to describe events abundantly  and she made her audience visualize the events very clearly  A quote that proves she used great detail and shows the effectiveness of a narration says   Then  out of the shadows  a hooded figure came crawling across the ground like some stalking beast  Harry  Malfoy  and Fang stood transfixed  The cloaked figure reached the unicorn  it lowered its head over the wound on the animal s side  and began to drink its blood   Rowling 187   This quote shows the effectiveness of the narration because it gives a clear  vivid image in the reader s mind  and it hooks the audience to keep reading  Another quote that shows the effectiveness of her narration is   They just looked at him  smiling  And slowly  Harry looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror and saw other pairs of green eyes like his  other noses like his  even a little old man who looked as though he had Harry s knobbly knees   Harry was looking at his family  for the first time in his life   Rowling 151   This quote also shows that the style of a narration is very effective because she used great detail to describe Harry s parents  and she made the situation seem emotional to Harry and the readers which kept the audience reading  Lastly  her style of a narration is effective because she describe many events in great detail  and she kept her audience reading with interesting topics Overall  I thought this novel was very exciting and unique because it included awesome fictional events  I liked how the author made the smaller characters do the most unexpected and courageous acts because it can relate to many readers of the audience  and influence them that anything can happen  I also liked how she used creative ideas to write about  and express them with great detail  I disliked how Harry was only famous for his past and how people viewed him when they first saw him  I would change how Harry s parents died because it doesn t give a lot of background information of Harry s family  and it would have been cooler if his parents were able to help him in his journey  This book is similar to The Hunger Games because they both include different societies and fictional occasions  Finally  I thought this book was very interesting  and I would encourage other readers and myself to continue reading this series   Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone by J K  Rowling Harry Potter was not a normal boy  Left on his Aunt and Uncle s stoop as a baby  He is raised in a cupboard  With no memory s of his early life except for a flash of green life and a cackling laugh  Though  this is not the reason for his abnormality  Nor is the fact that he has no friends  No  Harry Potter is a wizard  Harry is a small boy  Short and scrawny for his age  He doesn t think much of his appearance  green eyes  and black hair  except for a thin scar  shaped as a lightning bolt from  the car crash that killed your parents  and don t ask questions  according to his aunt Petunia  Harry is headstrong and Steadfast  always sticking to goals  And brave for a first year at Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry  Personally Harry Potter is one of my favorite books  Though the charterers aren t perfect  that is part of the magic of of the book  Join Harry  and his friends Ron Weasly  and Hermione Granger  on there journey through there chaotic  Crazy first year  HP is awesome  It gets better each time I read it  And the illustrations are amazing  I began reading the Harry Potter series in the third grade  Honestly  if I could  I would have started to read them WAY before that  When I read Harry Potter  I felt like I was running down the corridors of Hogwarts with Harry  Ron  and Hermione  These books were such an unforgettable experience for me  My parents will poke fun at how I know just about everything there is to know about The Wizarding World of Harry Potter  Currently  I ve probably read the series in its entirety around six or seven times  Each time I read it  I pick up something new from it  and learn to love it even more  Yes  some people still ask me  But isn t Harry Potter for kids    The way I answer to these people is  Yes  The Harry Potter Series was originally geared towards children  but as you read through the books  you realize that the characters are so complex and the plot and story line twist and turn  I ve never become bored with these books  They mean so much to me Originally  this was going to be a review of the recently released illustrated version of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone  I had received the book for Christmas recently  and I ve attempted to read it to my younger sister and parents  but they aren t interested  I love the book though  Its wonderfully colored and the pictures of the castle are completely breath taking  I would recommenced Harry Potter to anyone that will listen  There is so much I could say about this series  but I d like to keep this review as short as possible  As a huge Harry Potter fan  I was nothing short of busting a nut when thinking about reading the new illustrated version of HP and The Sorcerer s Stone  I am a visual person and I could not wait for a new and enhanced experience of reading a favorite book  However  I did have some small doubt because the last time I read this particular novel I was still in my teenage years  Now that I am 26 years old  I was apprehensive because I did not know how I would feel reading a story about an 11 year old wizard  During the first half of the novel  my worst nightmares as a Potter fan had become a reality  I was not enjoying the book as I had so many times during my youth  The story felt very juvenile and on top of that  the illustrations  although beautiful  were not adding anything new to my reading experience That was until I began to read the chapter The Mirror of Erised  In this chapter there is a full page illustration of Harry looking into the mirror and I am not going to lie   it was absolutely heartbreaking  I do not get emotional very much when reading novels  but this stirred something inside of me to the point that tears began to well into my eyes  I even became emotional talking about it in my video review   https   youtu be cdcP_fIFbcMAfter that point  my worries faded and the story blossomed from an 11 year old wizard s rags to riches story to a tale of triumph  maturity  and friendship  I never thought that I could love Harry Potter more  but after reading the novel  an illustrated one at that   again as an adult has only strengthened my adoration and love for J K  Rowling and her Harry Potter novels   J K Rowling has done a amazing job on her Harry Potter series  but Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s stone is what started it all  In the first book she gets it so you are in the book and that you are really apart the world of Harry potter  Her doing this makes you want to still be apart of it  so you read the rest of the books  I have never read a book or series with so much creativity  Everything that happens in the book and throughout the series is so creative that I wonder how she thought of that  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s stone started the series and explains the amazing base of the story so in later books she can become even more creative with her writing I have always loved the Harry Potter series  from when I watched the movie as a little kid  to now when I am reading all the books  Harry Potter and the sorcerer s stone though is the book that starts this amazing series and that is why I like it so much  During this first book there is a lot of bravery and confidence  from when Ron and Hermione think that he has to go on and save the sorcerer s stone   to when Harry confronts the guy who is trying to take the stone  Reading the last few pages of this book made me think of the amazing things that Harry and his friends will accomplish in future books I strongly recommend this to people that love long book series and good guy vs bad guy books  If you love creative books and fiction books you will love this book and also this series  The whole time you read this book everything is unpredictable and surprising  At the end there is a red herring that surprises it and makes the book so enjoyable  This is my favorite part of the book also because I love the red herring and it makes the book so much more enjoyable  I loved it  Just what I needed  Harry Potter  an ordinary 11 year old boy serving as a sort of slave for his aunt and uncle who learns that he is actually a wizard and has been invited to attend the Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry  Harry is snatched away from his mundane existence by Hagrid  the grounds keeper for Hogwarts  and quickly thrown into a world completely foreign to both him and the viewer  Famous for an incident that happened at his birth  Harry makes friends easily at his new school  He soon finds  however  that the wizarding world is far more dangerous for him than he would have imagined  and he quickly learns that not all wizards are ones to be trusted  I really enjoyed this book but I would not recommend it to elementary students under 4th grade because I find the text to be pretty complex  The names in the books will definitely be difficult to pronounce if readers are not mature enough  As for using this book in a class  I would not use this book at all because it has nothing to do with any curriculum I intend teaching to students one day  This would be a great book to read for fun on the side   All right  after a whole day reading four Harry Potter books  I have come to a conclusion  perhaps you should trust the popularity of something more sometimes  Because at first  I thought people were being over wild about this novel series  and I usually see popular stuff are the bad stuff  But my friends talked about so much so I had decided to buy Harry Potter and the Philosopher Stone to have a try  and so glad that I did  Because the novel is BRILLIANT   The characters are charmming  likeable  and real  They have flaws  even BIG flaws but that is so true  Harry is one the few protagonists that like the best in a series  And his friends too  oh aren t they loveable  Professor Albus Dumbledore is such a great character as well  man  there are just so many great characters in this series   He doesn t have so much appearance  but his wise and wisdom self just cannot get out of my head  The story has a nice speed  not too slow or too fast  it s gripping and breath taking and at the same time  slow down for character developements and heart moments  It is very funny too  there were times when I almost dropped the books  because I was laughing like insane  That comedy balances so well with intense parts  kept me being hooked  The revealation at the end was so surprising  I was like   No way  It s HIM all along    Just so sweet that the author tricked us just like that  she s so awesome  The world of Harry Potter was drawn from from multiple mythology and folk tales  but it doesn t feel like being unoriginal  in fact  it is new but at the same time familiar world with us  The great aerial sport  imaginative creations  who wouldn t love this world  Oh  and did I mention that the novel is very deep  full of messages here and there After finishing HP 1   which was only a half day ago   I immediately became a Potterhead  and wasted all of my pocket money for 2 months to buy as much more HP as I could get  3 books  2 4 only  I know  I m poor right   They are great too  And there is a surge going on at the end of The Goblet of Fire  I just can t wait for book 5   I have to wait until January       Ok  so my doubt about this novel series is gone  and is my favorite series now  Amazing how things could change for the last 13 hours  All right  thank you for reading my review  I m not a good reviewer  In fact  this is my very first review  also  I m not from an English speaking country so there might be grammar mistakes  so forgive me if my review annoys you  Anyway  HP rules   This book was really good in my opinion  When I tried to read this book in about 3rd grade I thought   I ll just watch the movies   Seriously though  I really was frustrated by the excellent vocabulary and lengthy descriptions of J K  Rowling  Hermione reminds me of one of my friends because they  like Hermione are a total know it all  When I read this book  I really do feel as if I either am Harry or am watching Harry and his friends  and enemies   The character that I dislike the most is Voldemort  After all  he is the most evil of the lot  I am glad that I re read this book because know I actually have connections with it and I wasn t so utterly bored reading it s extensive descriptions and details  I actually already had the 2nd book for some reason so  I ll start reading that soon  What s so grabbing about Harry Potter  is that it is something understandable in a world unknown  We all know what it feels like to be a 12 year old  unless you re under eleven  but Hogwarts is hiding surprises at every corner  The reason I picked up this book from the library  as after watching the movie  it made that wizard world look really magical The reason why I watched the movie really late  as my thoughts was influenced by someone  He said that  Harry Potter is lame   After believing him for a couple of years  I suddenly found myself watching the movies I found that it is AMAZING  Although I did not watch the full series  the few movies I watched was enough to win me over  and read the book On a side note  the reason I did not watch the complete series of the Harry Potter  as the DVDs were borrowed from the Library  and some of the DVDs were not working  So  when I was halfway reading this first Harry Potter book  I was wondering   Is it worth my time to read this Even when I know what is going to happen   However  it was definitely not a waste of time  By reading the book  there were very detailed descriptions on how the character felt  that the movie cannot depict  It makes you sympathise with the characters more during their hard times  I cannot say it  as it might be considered a spoiler   and it makes you rejoice with the characters during their celebratory times  nope  can t say it   spoiler   I am sure there are some who would love to have another  Harry Potter Movie Marathon   Just by reading the book  it s as if a movie is being played in your mind  The language is really simple and Rowling have made the characters to be soo lovable  The way she describes Hogwarts  makes you want to be a part of it  I wouldn t be surprised that some readers Harry Potter fanatics would be waiting for their letter to go to Hogwarts The books have many plot twist  and it makes the reader feels excited to see how Hermione  Ron  and Harry are going to solve this mystery  This book  to me  have fresh plots  and the adventures are just extra ordinary Who should read this book  Well  anyone young or old who loves a book with genres such as  fiction  friendship  family  suspense  mystery  adventure and many more   I wish you could see my 5yo s face while I read HP to him each night at bedtime  Wide eyes  Sly smile  Hanging on every word  begging for  just 2 more pages   at the end of each chapter  The story never loses its sparkle  And it s so darn fun to read aloud  I often hear my older son stop what he s doing to listen from the other room  it s at least his 3rd time hopping on the Hogwarts Express with the Harry and the first years  yet he s engrossed too  We re on to The Chamber of Secrets now   An unforgettable book with an amazing plotline filled with mystery  a real thriller  a book that will be hard to put down once you start to read it  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone was filled with such fiction that it brought the book to life and made me feel like I was there watching Harry  Ron  and Hermione throughout the whole story  The story itself was filled with something I wish was real  the magic  the brooms  the books  the teachers  All of that not only do I but my guesses are everyone who reads this book would really wish we could do magic  This book to me is a piece of art that no other book can bring alive  This book was so well written and the author had a clear idea of what she wanted to write about  The purpose of this book is not very clear since it s a fiction book filled with many unreal events  but the author made an amazing job in showing a good fiction book with an amazing plotline  I first watched the movie before reading the book  but I loved the book more because many details were showed and I understood better reading the book than watching a movie which has much less details explained  I recommend this book to anyone who wishes to have a little magic  fun  or is looking for a novel with an interesting plotline and amazing characters  The author brought to life the world of Harry Potter and I am forever grateful I read such a piece of literature  Pues que voy a decir  Genial  y ya   Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone by J K Rowling is only the beginning the most amazing books in the world   Harry thought his life would be normal or as normal his life could be with the Dursley s treating him like a personal slave but he doesn t do anything about it and the only reason he is staying with them is because you know who or Lord Voldemort murdered them is the killing curse  avada kadara  and Harry Potter was only a baby when it happened and he watched his mom die in front of him Voldemort killed James Potter on the stairs  Harry Potter stared death in the face because Voldemort also tried killing Harry but couldn t because his mom protected him with love and a whole lot of power  Now keep in mind that when this happened Lord Voldemort was the greatest wizard in the wizarding world and Harry Potter was only a baby when this happened so the real question is  how could a baby survive the killing curse and only be left with a scar shaped like a lightning bolt on his forehead and make Voldemort powerless for 14 years  You ll have to read the rest of the books to find out because guess what    I M NOT TELLING YOU   BYEEEE     Harry Potter has only just found out that he is indeed a wizard  But the thing is  he is not just any old wizard  He is the most famous one in the whole of the wizarding world   the famous Harry Potter When Harry first goes to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry  it is his first time when he nearly gets expelled  but after his heroic challenge to save the Philosopher s Stone from someone else s reach  he is awarded many points to Gryffindor  his school house   Who s house will win the House Cup   and will Harry Potter win any triumph This book is absolutely great  for even adults read it s glory  J K Rowling has a brilliant sense of funny humour  and on every page there is always some kind of witty joke  The three Hogwarts friends  Harry  Hermione and Ron  have their own characters  Hermione s brilliant mind  Harry s always in touch with somebody else s serious business acts and Ron s funny ways that nobody ever seems to be able to take him seriously with  Harry Potter has been living a disconsolate life with his aunt  uncle  and their diabolical son  Dudley  for nearly ten years now  He lives in a dark  tiny cupboard under the stairs  Dudley bullies him every chance he gets  and he hasn t had a birthday party in eleven years  Little does Harry know that all of that is about to change when a peculiar letter is brought to him by a messenger owl  a letter containing an invitation to an incredible and unforgettable place  This place is where Harry will find friends  a sport that he s good at  and magic everywhere he turns  Harry will also discover his destiny  if he can survive the hostile confrontation  This book is a real page turner because the author goes into explicit detail  making you feel like you re actually there  Harry s experiences are relatable and this book makes you believe that magic is actually real This is a great book for anyone interested in magical and imaginative adventures J K  RowlingJ K  Rowling   Excelente libro  de las mejores lecturas que he hecho la verdad  los lugares las cosas y sus caracteristicas son impresionantes  me identifico con la casa de Hufflepuff es impresionante  ahora debo seguir con esto   Yer a wizard  Harry   Harry Potter  you are the best   This book deserves these 5 flipping stars  To call this  book ok just isn t right  It not only surpasses my expectations  but was exactly what I need to read  I question why I never read this series before  POTTER FOR THE WIN   It is a sure thing that I am going to read the rest of the series  The Harry Potter should be the thing every child should read at least once  It releases your imagination  J K Rowling brings us in Potter s life in best way possible  Page by page I went on  I never wanted to stop  This book was extremely hard to put down  Since I hadn t watched the movies in while  I had forgotten the little details that mean everything and maybe that Gryffindor wins the House Cup  Oops  I learned never to trust a man in a turban and that  When reading  we don t fall in love with the characters  appearance  We fall in love with their words  their thoughts  and their hearts  We fall in love with their souls   This book reminds us of the magic  literally  of reading  I love love love this book more than I could ever explain  I have no idea why it took me so long to start this series book but I am happy I did  I get so happy when I am reading it and even thinking about reading it makes me happy  I love each character so much already and I can t wait to see where the story takes them  This book made me happy  made me laugh  and even tear up a bit at the end  This book is incredible beyond words and will forever be one of my favorite books of all time  3 I give this book a unanimous 5 out of 5  That s because it opened me up to a world of reading where I could imagine to be whatever I wanted  I could put myself easily in Harry s shoes  I had dark hair like his  and while I lacked glasses  green eyes  I got bossed around quite a bit by my siblings  so Harry was easy to relate to  The most important thing to a story is having a protagonist that the readers can relate to  or learn to relate to  This leads them to care about them more  and have higher emotional stakes in them when their lives are put in jeopardy  The book itself is well written  the evil characters are given time to develop  Specifically Rowling spends a whole chapter telling us about Vernon Dursley  and his drill company  as well as his magic phobia  This puts us as the reader on the side of anyone who infuriates Vernon  and some of my favorite parts are when Uncle Vernon gets mad  and hollers at Harry with all his might and anger  Rowling also makes Hagrid  who would seem scary and intimidating to me at eleven  a person Harry can joke around  share stories and memories with  and still be serious with  Dumbledore became more important than I thought he was going to be in the sequels  and I m glad Rowling made it his job to be talked of as a living legend  and also share some valuable insight about the Mirror of Erised  This helped me tell that Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore would become a key in Harry s journey  Ron and Hermione s dialog is perhaps one of the best parts  too  The way they bickered back and forth reminded me of my older brother and younger sister  who really should ve been twins  arguing back and forth about trivial things  The villain  though  became way unclear  Rowling did have Harry kill off Voldemort Quirrell  but part of me was sad  It was over  The last page  and OH WAIT  THERE ARE SEQUELS  I was so overjoyed to hear there were more  Mind you I was in First grade  so I needed more escapes from my world of McVey Now  in retrospect  Harry Potter was a jumping point for me  It became a way for me to escape from my boring world  and helped me in so many ways  Much witchcraft  Much wow   Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone  is the first novel in the Harry Potter series  The story is about a young boy  Harry Potter  He discovers his magical heritage and attends a wizarding school  Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry  He makes close friends with Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger  but he also makes a few enemies including Draco Malfoy In his first year at Hogwarts he experiences a lot of adventures and with the help of his friends he faces an attempted comeback by Lord Voldemort  the dark wizard who killed Harry s parents This is J K  Rowling s first novel and in my opinion it s an amazing book  I ve read all the Harry Potter books  but I can t pick the best one  They re all just amazing  I really love fantasy books with all kinds of magical elements  dragons  wizards ect J K  Rowling s writing style is not difficult to understand and very interesting to read  The Harry Potter books will always have a special place on my bookshelve  Hi  my name is Esther and I think I just joined the fandom  I ve never felt a need to read the Harry Potter series  I would only watch the series at random  i e  3 1 6 2 4 7pt2 7pt1   You might not have understood what I meant by the parentheses so just to clarify  that was the order in which I watched the Harry Potter movies  in fact I probably might have skipped over a movie oops  Anyways  moving on  it never occured to me that I should try to read the Harry Potter series because after all  I didn t really get into the whole wizardry fantasy thing and I thought that the writing would be impossibly boring  However  I couldn t have been any more wrong about that   Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone  was an extremely easy read  it went by fast and was wonderful to read  Rowling did a wonderful job in creating this fantasy world filled with fictional characters that swallow up readers into the book world  The magic was amazing and I fell in love with it at once  I was never bored by reading this book and I never tired of it  As I read  the pages thinned quickly and I think that I can safely say that I would love to be in the Hogwarts world and et cetera  All the characters were well developed by the author and I especially loved how Ron  Harry  and Hermione s friendship came to be  Hermione s smarts  Ron s great friendship skills  and Harry s bravery and talent are all traits that help lead up to the plot  The plot and the whole business with Snape and the sorcerer s stone was very unpredictable  while I had thought that I knew what was going on  I enjoyed this book very much and I cannot wait to get my hands on the rest of the series  Although the book was a light read compared to all the other books I am currently reading  it was very induldging and interesting  Readers who enjoy fantasy  mystery  and the whole wizards and witches business will love what Rowling has in store for them in  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone   I can assure that they will fit right in with what the Hogwarts mysteries have to offer them  This is a good book because it is very well written  it keeps you in suspense  it makes you want to keep reading and makes you come back for more  10 year old Harry Potter lives with his aunt Petunia Dursley and uncle Vernon Dursley in their house on No  4 Privet Drive in London  Harry was told his parents died in a car crash but he soon finds out that that is not true  Letters from an unknown person soon start coming into their house by unknown means  The Dursley s and Harry start moving to escape the letters from flying into their but to no avail  A person named Hagrid bursts into their current hiding place  a lighthouse on an island  to wish Harry a happy 11th Birthday and to deliver the letter the Dursley s were desperately trying to escape  Hagrid came to tell Harry the truth about him being a wizard and that his parent did not die in a car crash but were murdered by the dark wizard Lord Voldemort and he was the only of the family to survive  The letter said that Harry was eligible to go to the wizarding school Hogwarts and that he would go their for seven years to learn about magic I recommend this for anyone with a liking for magic and fantasy books  This book won t let you down  A deeper meaning to this book is that courage can be found in the most unlikely of people like Neville for example A literary element used incessantly throughout this book is hyperboles  Snape and Ron use these the most  Snape uses them to exaggerate Harry s fame in the wizarding world  Ron uses it to exaggerate Hermione s intelligence This book is great  Once you start  get comfortable because you will be sitting where you are for a while and while you are at it take the second book with you if you would like  It s  Philosopher s Stone   stoopid Americans Right  I love the Harry Potter books  but each one has a few nitpicks which always bother me  aside from none of these kids acts like any kid I went to school with  But  Hogwarts is a posh  private school  so maybe that explains it   1  Harry s scar is supposedly a result of survivng Voldemort s death curse  But  as Harry is the only person to have ever survived the Avada Kedavra  it s complete supposition to claim that this scar is what you get if you do 1b  And what s with that  Are wizards so selfish that in the entirety of their history only 1 person  Lily Potter  has ever thrown themselves in front of a loved one 2  Why doesn t Hagrid take Norbert up the Astronomy Tower  He doesn t have a curfew  If anyone asks he can just say  Caught this bloke with an illegal dragon  I took it away from him and have made arrangements to have it sent to a sanctuary in Romania   Leaving it up to Harry and Hermione seems impractical and really selfish for an adult to expect 2 11 year olds to tidy up his mess 3  Am I the only one who finds it odd that the punishment for being caught out of bed after lights out is to be kept out of bed after lights out  All this does is reinforce the notion that the rules are arbitrary if you consider your reasons good enough Finally  if Dumbledore is so wise  why didn t he call a staff meeting between books 1   2 and tell all the other teachers saying  Look  these 3 kids nearly got killed because no one would listen to them all year when they kept trying to tell us stuff  This is Hogwarts  not CTU  Something comes up next year  keep an eye on them and offer whatever assistance you can  They saved the school and made us all look like dicks  Oh  and Severus  I don t give a damn about your history with Harry s parents  stop being so openly hostile you douche  He nearly got killed because he doesn t trust you  These are just small quibbles and mainly come from sour grapes  I m 38 now  and still feel sad every summer when I don t get my letter from Hogwarts  Loved it    Swim away between the books  there are often one or two the famous big win my appreciation  but when I touched it in a book  Harry Porter and the Sorcerer s stone   for which I have  as it moved  it saw a thousand times  remember the heart  To read a spell  it will come to mind  a long time can not be dispersed       Picked up the wand  read out the familiar mantra  it appears  is with me A boy named Harry Potter not an ordinary child  born with a bad guy fight with Voldemort s logo  a lightning shaped scar  It was a death curse marks  because her mother s sacrifice of his death into the scar  He was Uncle adopted a very wronged childhood  cousin Dudley always fight with big bully him  so after 11 years  On his 11 birthday  had an extraordinary things  changed his life  A surface terrorist actually very gentle guards Hager sent a letter to his magic school admission letter  to prove that he is born from one of a wizard s fate  He was very happy to learn  know the world wizard Diagon Alley and a series of things  The school also met two friends  one is stupid stupid brain Ron  there is a similar to Harry when the child s mother  A Hermione is excellent in character and learning  there are two ordinary Muggle parents   non magical people  they work together to save the Sorcerer s stone  tenacious struggle with Voldemort  finally destroyed Voldemort dreams  won the respect of everyone Gustave Flaubert once said  the tragic fate of the complaint  the more painful the more  want to escape  the more feel fear  let s face it  against it  overcome it  so all the pain and defeat  made brilliant flowers blooming in the hard work of land  Harry Porter is such  he does not lower the head in the face of difficulties  but raised his head  chest and brave enough to face and conquer it  The classmates  the mountains no straight road  however  bending  have strong  there are beautiful  there are ups and downs  only the waves  as streams of block  rough  have a song  Our path is not flat  there is ups and downs  bumpy  but we can not bow to difficulties  to learn from Harry Potter  do an honest  justice  courage to face the difficulties and contempt of difficult people  Victory always belongs to the people of tough postscript  Let us all work together The magic  the wizard has been old theme many writers wrote  But Rowling is undoubtedly the best written  The magic circle to write so real  numerous details woven into a magical net  In the book  the most attractive is that full of suspense story  each time ending let you Yiyouweijin  lovely  The book is full of foreshadowing  who can imagine the surprise ending hidden in many details  It is such a fascinating story  let a person fondle admiringly  Harry the little boy image is engraved on my mind  his loyalty  courage  the pursuit of justice and truth  and the kind of indomitable spirit  without clearly echoed in my mind  May have thought that a teenage boy  to assume the responsibility to save the world  to the face of death  to endure great pain and grievance  whether I myself can do  Children have been considered synonymous with childish  but Harry told them  you may also like Harry to assume responsibility  This is probably the  Harry Porter  my biggest inspiration  I might throw away a lot of books  but there is always a set of shelves in the  Harry Porter   I will buy a lot of books  but also will have a shelf space  Every now and then  I reread the Harry Potter series as an implicit tribute and thank you to J K  Rowling  the woman who single handedly inspired in me a joy for reading when I was 8 or 9 years old  It s been 15 16 years since I first picked up this book and spent a week struggling through it  and much has changed in the interval  I ve read hundreds of very different and more complex books  I ve graduated from college with a degree focused on reading and writing  and I ve started my own mission to inspire a similar love for reading in my own students  to varying degrees of success  of course  but books like this remind me of the vital importance of my mission   Throughout my education and professional career  professors  mentors  friends  and colleagues alike have told me my love for this series is juvenile and needs to be replaced with more highbrow literature  Naysayers be damned  Harry Potter transformed my life in a fundamental  earth shattering way I still feel to this day  It s a cliche  but I earnestly believe these books saved my life and molded me into the person I am today  But I digress  For my actual review  HP 1 isn t nearly as intricate and detailed as its successors  but it needn t be  It s an introduction to a classic tale of heroes and villains  good and evil  and adolescent adventure  It s magical but not gaudy  It s funny but not silly  Its characters are brilliant  flawed  and round   making them worthy of reading about again and again  It has a fairytale ending  but who cares  Sad endings abound in the world of literature  Believe me  as an English major  I d know  So enjoy the lighthearted fantasy while it lasts  because the series darkens as Harry gets older  I can t wait to read this to my children someday   At first  I thought Harry Potter was not a really that good book  I read other  more girlish and juvenile books  like Rainbow Magic by Daisy Meadows   I m still under 12    Then my best friend recommended me the book and said it was very nice and that I should start the series  She told me all about it  I misheard and thought Voldemort was called  Mouldy mort   Gradually  I grew interested and started reading the Harry Potter series This first instalment of the Harry Potter series is a masterpiece  It s all very surprising when Harry gets invited to Hogwarts and gets told he s famous for defeating Voldemort  And Ron and Hermione are such well developed characters  and when characters are well developed  you start loving and liking them  Hagrid is a very strange person  because he likes all the dangerous things classified as  Known Wizard Killer  in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them   Draco Malfoy and his cronies Crabbe and Goyle are so like bullies  Everything is made so realistic  Rescued from the outrageous neglect of his aunt and uncle  a young boy with a great destiny proves his worth while attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry Okay  this book   this book was Magical   Yes  that pun was intended  Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone is definitely a must read  I mean  I personally think the entire series of Harry Potter should be a required reading series for all my fellow book nerds out there  Almost everyone I know has read it and loved it and if you have not   well I m judging you  Anyways  JK Rowling has done an amazing job at writing this book  it made me stay up at night very late just reading her books  As for characters  Harry Potter  obviously the protagonist  was definitely a perfect model for a main character  Harry is portrayed as a brave boy who would give his life to Voldemort for any of his friends or family  I think its safe to say that Harry Potter taught all of the readers out there that you should never lose sight of what can happen in the future  He taught me that anything is possible with some bravery  Then there are his two best friends ever  Hermoine and Ron  Hermoine has successfully taught me that knowledge and wisdom comes in handy and means so much in life  Ron   well wonderful Ron has taught me that everyone has feelings and that sometimes all you need is a friend and you can do pretty much anything  Okay  there are so many more people such as  Dumbledore  Dudley  Vernon  Petunia  Minerva  Snape  Malfoy  or Luna  God  Harry Potter is just filled with characters and i dont really have time to go through what they all taught me   but what i can say is that they are all important  Like gosh  I think Rowling has made us all go through every emotion  I don t know much more to say  because honestly  I have a belief that most of you have read this series   and if not  I really suggest you do   Listened to the audio for this one    3 4 or so read by Jim Dale  and then I switched to Stephen Fry when I couldn t take Jim s reading any more  Jim Dale is just too over the top for me  and I don t like his reading style  Stephen Fry is more natural  and that s so much better for me  Anyway  I m not doing a full review of these this time around  because I just read and reviewed them about 4 months ago  LOL I highly recommend the Stephen Fry audio versions  They are great so far     very harry poterry  i remember scenes from the movie  I am very disappointed and embarrassed with my former self for the reasons following   I didn t capitalize anything  I spelled Potter wrong  I watched the movie before I read the book    in Miranda Sings voice   that s not okay  So I read the first Harry Potter book for the second time  obviously   and I absolutely lived it  I love the characters  the setting and the plot  I m personally glad Harry defeated his enemy of the book   I think I love this series even more each time I read it  I ve only reread the first three before getting distracted and never getting back to it but this time I m determined to reread them all  It s crazy how intricate and involved these stories really are  I notice something new each time I read them  It seriously blows my mind how the little details in the FIRST book have so much to do with the rest of the series  all the way to the last book  Seriously mind blowing  I love this series  I waited until now to read this series because I thought it would be too young or fantastical  etc   but I wish I hadn t wait so long because I absolutely LOVED it  I tore through it in three days  and I can t wait to read the next  The book seamlessly combined so many elements   humor  adventure  suspense  the other worldly  etc  etc     words can t describe how much I loved it  I m literally running out the door to get the second book right now  and I can t wait to watch the first movie  too  The graphic version is entertaining and creative  Re read for the second time in three years as part of my personal challenge   it took while to get through it this time   not because it was boring  but I had so much to do  and other shiny booms to distract me  Switched from the paperback I have to the audiobook and finished it much more quickly since I could listen to it in the car and while I worked  Still amazing as ever  one my favorite books in my favorite series of all time  and this book will again get a solid five stars  God I forgot how much I love this universe  I also forgot how many scenes Neville was in because in the movies all your really see him is when he is losing finding his toad  when he get spelled by Hermione and when he wins 10 points for Gryffindor  I wish he was in the movie more  Also  I m incredibly sad that they didn t include Snape s potion test in the movie because I loved that part of the book  But  can t wait to continue my reread of the series  It s gonna be so much fun  Can t believe I never read this in my childhood  Such a fun read     Reading this book is like being wrapped in a warm blanket of comfort and nostalgia  The first Harry Potter book  and movie  has always been my absolute favorite  It brings me back to a time when this entire world was new and exciting  When life was simpler and I was completely ready to believe there was a magic school waiting for me  I first read this book was I was six years old  alternating off chapters with my mother to help make my reading skills even better  Reading it completely on my own now I felt as if I was still transported back nearly fifteen years ago curled up in a rocking chair with my mom discovering the wizarding world for the very first time  Something completely bittersweet for me anyways  Harry Potter remains just what it has always been  a story of comfort  familiarity  wonder  and magic  Still giving me chills when Harry receives his wand  and heartache when he sees his mother and father in the mirror  How absolutely timeless  and what a great first read of the year   I m not sure if it was the enhancements to the book that made me like re reading the philosopher s stone  but I felt that  this read through Harry Potter was much more interesting  This book was really good in my opinion  When I tried to read this book in the 3rd grade and after about the 5th book  I thought   I ll just watch the movies   Seriously though  I really was frustrated by the excellent vocabulary and lengthy descriptions of J K  Rowling  Hermione reminds me of one of my neighbors because they  like Hermione are a total know it all  When I read this book  I really do feel as if I either am Harry or am watching Harry and his friends  and enemies   The character that I dislike the most is Voldemort  After all  he is the most evil of the lot  I am glad that I re read this book because know I actually have connections with it and I wasn t so utterly bored reading it s extensive descriptions and details  This book  even if you have seen the movie  will intrigue you because much detail was left out in the movie  such as the big deal about Nicholas Flamel   I actually already had the 2nd enhanced book for some reason so  I ll start re reading that soon  Overall  I rate this book 5 out of 5  J K  Rowling is a genius and Jim Dale s voice acting is fantastic  Re listening to the Harry Potter audiobooks never gets old  I m going to rewind to when I was 10  16 years back  to the memory in which I first received this book  It was part of my Christmas presents from my aunt on my father s side  and I remember thinking how funny the title sounded  I only assumed that Harry Potter was the boy on the cover of the novel  on the broomstick  arm extended upwards whilst in a cape  catching a golden ball  Knowing me at that age  I probably pushed the book aside  actually  I definitely did  If anyone would have told me at that moment  on that Christmas morning  that this book would impact my life so deeply  I would have enjoyed that comment more than the book itself Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone was my introduction to fantasy  magic  mysticism and lore of all shapes in a novel  It was this book that introduced me to my love for wizards  I was a young boy  reading about a young boy who was mistreated by his family  later to find on his 11th birthday that he is the only son of two powerful wizards  as well as the only survivor of a particular dark wizard s bloodlust  The story resonated so deeply within me  and although my imagination took me for a spin  this book igniting in me a love for fantasy that never died It was J K Rowling that sparked my love for Tolkien   that had me read the Hobbit  and the Lord of the Rings trilogy  The Silmarillion  and The Children of Hurin  The wizarding world of Harry Potter did to my love for magic what Star Wars did for my love of science fiction and space opera  My father was a man of Tolkien  so I grew up curious  but I owe it all to Rowling and the Harry Potter books for truly setting that curiosity wild  The last time I read this book I was still in school  just before Deathly Hallows was released  so it s been a long time since I ve read any Harry Potter  I ve picked this book up several times in the last eight and a half years and never made it through the first chapter  because it just wasn t the right time  It s even been a few years since I ve seen any of the films   I know  I know  bad fan   I ve been through a lot in that time  I ve changed so much  and I never knew that finally revisiting Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone would be such an emotional and nostalgic experience  And revisiting this story through this illustrated edition just made it have that much more impact on me  I literally didn t want to put this down  and I m very tired from staying up so late reading  which rarely happens I don t feel like there s much to say about the story itself  we all know it  I d forgotten that this series started out for children  The writing is great  the story is fun  the characters are my favourites  I was so surprised to see how many little bits of foreshadowing are in the very first book  how organised is J K  Rowling  please  Talk about good planing Let s just take a moment to admire Jim Kay s beautiful illustrations  I want big prints of the pictures of Hagrid  the Quidditch pitch and pretty much all of the other pictures to frame and hang around my house  And this book is such good quality I could cry  There wasn t a blank page underneath the writing  The paper quality  praise the Lord  It even almost felt as though the illustrations had been painted straight onto the page rather than being printed on I m so pleased with this edition  and I m so happy that I ve finally come back to this world  I appreciated reading this so much more as an adult than I ever did as a child  I was going to wait for the illustrated editions to come out and reread each book as they were rereleased but I m not sure I ll be able to wait that long  Harry Potter lives with his aunt and uncle  In reality  he lives under the stairs and is treated like garbage  One day  strange things start to happen around the Dursley s house  Owls start hanging around outside  and one day  Harry gets a piece of mail  The Dursleys do all they can to keep Harry from reading the mail  but he eventually reads it  Harry is a wizard  and he is invited to attend Hogwarts School of Magic and Wizardry  As soon as he gets on the Hogwarts Express from platform 9 and 3 4  he is in a different world  Harry goes from being a bug under the stairs to almost a celebrity  His lightning shaped scar on his forhead tells everyone that he was the child that survived an attack by Lord Voldemort  During his first year at Hogwarts  Harry has to learn what the whole Wizard business entails  and has to solve his own private problems as well Harry Potter will always be a favorite of mine  JK Rowling is a great story teller  and her character development is  in my opinion  what made everyone fall in love with her books  They are relatable  they grow up  and they deal with situations that everyone deals with  They might be wizards  but they are still humans  I would recommend these books to anyone who is the same age as Harry  and on up  A whole new way of experiencing the magic that is Harry Potter The first book about   the boy who lived   is just as wonderful as always but made even more so through Jim Kay s many colorful and brilliant illustrations  Recommended for anyone wanting to get into the books and a must read for every Potterhead out there   After his parents  fateful death when he was just a baby  Harry Potter grows up living a rather bleak life with his aunt  uncle  and cousin  He is given his cousins old hand me downs  is bullied daily  and sleeps in the cupboard under the stairs  All of this changes however  when he finds out that there is a secret world of magic and not only is he a part of it  but he s famous for causing the downfall of the dark wizard Voldemort  After his twelfth birthday  Harry leaves for  Hogwarts  School of Witchcraft and Wizardry  to be taught how to use this magic among his peers  As Harry is introduced into a world of seemingly impossible feats  he begins to find his place among his magic peers and unknowingly prepares to again face Voldemort  With the help of his friends and mentors  Harry is victorious once again over the dark wizard  I thought that J K  Rowling did an excellent job of writing this novel  The descriptions she used of magical objects and even the comparisons to everyday items made it easy for me to imagine this magical world  I appreciated the contrast between Harry s mundane and unassuming lifestyle with his extended family and his famous notoriety within the wizarding world  For me  he was a character who was easy to like and was someone that I wanted to succeed from the very beginning   A lovely book       Book Response 5This is the first book in the Harry Potter series and it introduces the reader into a secret magical world  This is a story of a young boy who seemingly leads a mundane life with his aunt  uncle and cousin  On his twelfth birthday he receives a strange letter inviting him to enroll at Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry  After this moment  his life becomes all but mundane as he tries to figure out how to grow up in this strange new world and defeat the very evil who murdered his parents  I have absolutely loved this story since I was a child  I loved reading before this series and I this only enhanced my love for reading  Although I typically shy away from stories such as this  I could not put it down  In fact  this is the only series that I have read multiple times because I typically hate rereading books  I would definitely recommend this book to students and adults alike  This is a nice escape from the  muggle  world without becoming too science fiction and strange  J K  Rowling does this by creating characters and a world that readers can connect with while also giving them a magical quality that keeps readers turning the pages  I honestly do not know anyone who dislikes this series and I believe it would be a challenge to find someone in this world that dislikes it  This would be an excellent book to recommend to a student who struggles finishing a book   Always  This book was reviewed on 1Mom2DaughtersbookblogThis book is fantastic  If you have watched the movie the books are way better and different  Don t start reading it until you have some time  because you won t want to stop  I recommend this book to everyone  Talk to you later    Katie age 9This remains my second favorite book in one of my favorite series  Whenever we are looking for a gift for one of Katie s friends or even one of mine  this is one of the first books we think of  Be warned if this is your first time reading Harry Potter you will probably be a bit obsessed  If it comes to the point that you feel the urge to have a Harry Potter party send us a message  We had one last year and can share some ideas that worked for us  Also I need to do a shout out for the audiobook read by Jim Dale  It is fantastic  Happy Reading   Amanda Awesome    I loved this book because its full of adventure and it is awesome  Harry Potter starts out just as a normal kid not really though he lives with his uncle  aunt and cousin the Dursleys and they don t treat the poor boy like a family should  Why you must ask they know a secret a sneaky little secret Harry is a wizard and no one has even told him until around his eleventh birthday when letter started showing up at the Dursleys door addressed to Harry but the family did not want him to know about it so they took off but wherever they went the letters followed and that is when something big and by big I mean big happened  A giant appeared at the door named Hargid and someone finally told Harry he was a wizard and that he would be able to expand his knowledge by attending school at Hogwarts a school for magic  At first Harry is very confused but soon enough wanted to go learn about the wizarding world so off him and Hagrid went to get him all settled up for school  On their round abouts Harry finds out that he is famous for somehow defeating the one who shall not be named when he was only a baby  He soon finds some new friends Hermoine Granger and Ron Weasley but with every good story there must be some enemies and Harry get Draco Malfoy  Will Harry figure out this whole magic thing  will he get to play quidditch  will he die  find out in Harry Potter and the Philosophers StoneI picked up this book mostly because of Emma s presentation I  English class she has compelled me to read it I finished the book because it was very page turning and I couldn t put it down I would recommend this book to Claudia because I know she is always looking for something new to read and this is the start of a good series Nitwit  Blubber  Oddment  Tweak  says Albus Dumbledore  the headmaster of Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry  Harry Potter and the philosopher s stone is an amazing book for all ages  filled with laughs  excitement  adventure and magic  This book is about a boy named Harry Potter  he finds out that he is a wizard and is sent off to a school of witchcraft and wizardry  There he meets his two best friends Ronald Weasley  Ron  and Hermione Granger  With his two best friends he encounters tonnes of danger and adventures at his new school but  he also has good times and learns magic   Overall this is a great book but their are still things I don t get about it  It is that why would someone trust an eight foot tall giant that came barging into your house with a pink umbrella that can shoot lasers and make a kid grow a pigs tail  How could trust someone like that  I certainly would not  Another thing I do not understand is that how can a stone taken from a goat s stomach save you from poisons  Somethings in Harry Potter are just very very bizarre If you read Harry Potter you will be surprised  It is completely different from what you would think a stereotypical wizard or witch will look or do  You will not expect kids flying on broomsticks and playing sports fifty feet up into the air  You might expect witches to cackle and making potions in a great  big  black pot  Harry Potter does not do that at all  he only plays talking chess with his best friends and eating legit chocolate frogs  It will break down stereotypical witches and wizards a lot  As I have said before this is an amazing funny book  You may also learn a lot from this book  You might be inspired by Harry potter and his friends for they all do a lot of magnificent and brave things  My favourite quote in the book is this   But from that moment on  Hermione Granger became their friend  There are somethings you can t share without ending up liking each other  and knocking out a twelve foot mountain troll is one of them   It shows that if you do something good for another they owe you and you will become good friends  that is why I would definitely recommend this book to young elementary students  This book is one of the best books I have ever read in my life  It beats all other magical stories that I have read  Ivan  i still love these children a lot ok Always 2015 Reading Challenge  A book with magic I don t know why I haven t started the Harry Potter series a lot sooner  It has taken me 18 years to finally pick up the first book  I have definitely missed out  5 out of 5 stars  Cannot wait to continue the world of Hogwarts  Good job J K Rowling   If there is one thing Voldemort cannot understand  it is love  He didn t realize that love as powerful as your mother s for you leaves it s own mark  Not a scar  no visible sign   to have been loved so deeply  even though the person who loved us is gone  will give us some protection forever     Dumbledore  Such a good start to a series  No matter how many times I read it  I will always find myself glued to the book  I envy the person who reads these books for the first time   It s Harry Potter  Obviously was a nice time   Wonderful I almost wish that this was the first time that I ve read this book  as perhaps I could give a completely honest review  As it is  I ve likely read Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone about seven times or so  but it hasn t changed my opinion of it at all As this is the first book in the series  we are introduced to Harry Potter  an eleven year old boy living with the world s most horrible aunt  uncle  and cousin  It isn t long before his entire life is changed for the better  as he discovers that he s a wizard  and has been accepted into Hogwarts  school of witchcraft and wizardry  And our story begins There are so many good things about this first book  The immediate friendship between Harry and Ron  followed by the eventual addition to Hermione into that pocket as well  The world that J K  Rowling constructed  the ideas of such fantastical things existing just beyond the reach of every normal person  The side characters  particularly Draco Malfoy  and Severus Snape just to name a couple How could someone possibly read through this book  at any age  and not possibly wonder why they didn t receive an acceptance letter to Hogwarts Even to this day  at twenty four years old  it is impossible for me to finish this book without wishing I could receive mine Pick up this book  it s truly the start of a life changing adventure  I kinda finished this a week ago but forgot to update it on goodreads  But yeah  It was good timez again Harry s parents are dead  He is the  slave  of his uncle Vernon  aunt Petunia  and bratty cousin Dudley  And he s about to go to a horrible school    In gray rags    But then he goes to a academy for wizards called Hogwarts  He takes delightful classes like charms  And not so great ones like potions  But all too soon he discovers a threat to his life  Someone s trying to steal the legendary sorcerer s stone  And with a powerful thing like that who knows what he might do next  This book is one of my favorites along with Percy Jackson and The Olympians and A Series of Unfortunate Events I like Ron because he s funny  I also think Hermione is smart  But which one  Pick a person any person   My favorite part is when they go after the  bad guy     The part with Fluffy and the potions  Boy I would ve never figured that one out   I read it over and over again  You might too Each book is darker than the last so after The Prisoner of Askaban you might want to wait a while  Impossible to be critical or even objective about these  I love them too much   It is everytime great and beautifull  The way of writing is fantastic and I like it so much  It just doesn t get bored to re read it Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone  by J K Rowling  is a unique inspirational novel that is truly amazing  Its a story that tells about a young boy entering into a new world of people like him  It talks about bravery  curiosity  and friendship  This is a novel for all ages The story tells us about a eleven year old boy named Harry Potter  He was impacted at a very young age and taken from the world he was born into  but this story tells of him re entering that world he was born into  The wizarding world  As you immerse yourself deeper into the story  you meet two other very prominent characters  Hermione and Ron  They all attend the wizarding school Hogwarts in England  and without this setting the story would have been drastically different  From there on the story tells of bravery  courage  and most importantly friendship  You begin to become a part of the story and feel a real bond with the characters  They also grow and bond with each other as well as experience and discover the untold secrets of their time  How for the first time in Harry s life he feels at home and fits in  in this new world  He learns about his past but also learns that you must not dwell on it  The story centers around the idea of discovery and curiosity  Also  it talks about how Harry s past is one of great mystery  that leads him down new and unexpected roads faced with a new and complex challenges  Through Harry s past connects him with the problems he must face in the present and future  This is a heartwarming tale  and is the first book of a long journey through Harry s acceptance and life in the wizarding world  and through his seven years of wizard training at Hogwarts  This story in some ways is a challenging read  for some of the vocabulary and ideas are more complex and you need more deeper thoughts to understand and group parts of the story together  You must be able to see some of the patterns and to dig past parts of the story to uncover the true tale  However this is a story that everyone can understand and relate to  for a lot of the things the characters experience are what any school kid could identify with  The author writes from a very realistic point of view making the story realistic to believe  She talks about everyday problems such as to much homework  and balancing school and sports  The author also elaborates on many small details that you want to hear  making it even more interesting and interactive  To anyone who wants to escape real life  or who wants to hear a new and exciting story of three kids growing up and dealing with their exciting journey  I give this book the biggest recommendation  This book is appropriate for mature nine or ten year olds  and anyone above  But  truly this book is appropriate for anyone who wants to read and experience the wonderful journey of Harry Potter  Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone is the first book in the Harry Potter series by the brilliant J K  Rowling  The story begins introducing the main protagonist  Harry Potter  who has been adopted by a couple of rude  unintelligent  neglectful muggles  His life takes an unexpected turn when he is offered the opportunity to student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry where he will learn how to control  develop and understand how to use his new found magical abilities  He also finds out one very important secret explaining the death of his parents  the scar on his head and how his life will be changed forever  This is a great book to be introduced for children that have excelled reading chapter books and need a challenge  This book can be used as a creative writing activity  After completing the book the students can each create a brief paper with their own story for what is going to happen to Harry or their favorite character  next  Rowling  J   1998   Harry Potter and the sorcerer s stone  New York  A A  Levine Books  I enjoyed Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone very much  This book is about a boy named Harry  who finds out that he is a wizard  He is invited to a wizard school called Hogwarts  where he learns many magic spells and makes new friends  That is where he learns about the Sorcerer s Stone  a highly guarded possession at his school  until he realizes that someone is after it  I enjoyed this book because of the interesting story line  which was both serious  like when Harry is trying to protect the Sorcerer s Stone  and humorous  whenever the students messed up in trying to perform spells  I loved how the story changed throughout the book  with Harry going from living with his very mistreating aunt and uncle  to being the most popular wizard at Hogwarts  I loved all the fantasy elements  like when the students used magic to transform things or to move things  I would recommend this book to anyone who likes fantasy and mystery books  This book is definitely worth a read   5 STARS When I was a child  I d always avoid this book  I d say  Harry Potter is stupid and boring  But now  I regret that  Lesson learned  Never judge a book by it s cover  I LOVE THIS BOOK    It s so awesome   It s fantastic  magical  and just damn gorgeous It s just so amazing  The cover is amazing  The writing is amazing  The characters are amazing  The story is amazing   Harry Potter is amazing  Harry is just kick ass  Hands down   Harry potter is no ordinary boy  After his parents death Harry is forced to live with his horrible aunt and uncle and their evil son  Dudley  who does everything to make Harry s life miserable  Harry is forced to live under the stairs at his aunt and uncles house and living in a small room under the stairs isn t exactly pleasant  Harry has never celebrated a birthday and gets made fun of at school  He thought his life couldn t get worse when he gets a letter  The letter is from a wizarding school  called Hogwarts  Harry discovers he is a wizard and not only that but he is famous among them  But Hogwarts isn t all fun and games when Harry arrives  With his new friends Ron and Hermione  Harry finds out about his past  and has to save the school from the sorcerers stone  Harry Potter is an amazing fantasy book written by J K Rowling  I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone who likes fantasy and magic  I also think this is a book everyone should try to read  because even if your not a big fantasy fan  it is a really great book  that even people who don t enjoy fantasy can enjoy this book  I give the book five stars   This first one remains my favorite of the series  the joy of discovering the wizarding world alongside Harry  before things turn dark and I m left with my grief over those that were lost  I ve been waiting seven years to share this journey with my son  and it was such a gift to be able to watch him meet this story  these characters for the first time  I lament that I ll never have another first time with Harry     So many late nights devouring the latest book in the series  Sigh  I really enjoyed this book  I am a Harry Potter nerd  I think the book was a lot better than the movie  There was a lot of similarities between the book and the movie  but there was also a lot of big differences  I think it would be crazy to wake up one day and find out your whole childhood has been a lie  It would be pretty sweet to be a wizard  I would recommend this book to children and adults  I feel like it s an easy read so younger kids would enjoy it just as much as adults   I know I have read this book very late but whenever I saw Harry Potter Books and it s size when I was younger  I used to feel like fainting  p But since now I m reading books  i thought I will read this one also  I have seen the movie so I already know the story  but reading the book was one the best thing have done It is really a good book and love all of the characters in it  I wish i was in hogwart too  It would be a dream come true  Looking forward to reading the next book    Introduced my 6 year old to Harry Potter via this book  I think I officially have a mini Potterhead on my hands now   I love this book  This is not an understatement  As I was reading  I felt the wizarding world come to life off of the page The book is way more detailed and interesting than the movie  I feel the overall theme is that no matter where you came from  you can change your future  but it s only up to you  You can t let your circumstances limit you from becoming greater  I would recommend this book to anyone who can read or hear audiobook  no matter what age  Harry Potter will make you feel involuntarily as a child again  or believing in magic  My favorite part is when Dumbledore said at the very end  It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies  but just as much to stand up to our friends   He was referring to Neville  which is someone that despite his shy early beginning and bad circumstance being seen as a shy weakling  didn t stop him from trying to stop his friends from breaking the rules  which would eventually cost their house of many points  Loved the book Fantastic  It s impossible to offer an objective review of something that was this important to my childhood and adolescence  but I will say that when I first read this at 12  I did so because I d been sneering at this  stupid  fad for months  Then I got a change of heart  I felt I shouldn t unfairly judge a  children s  book  and if I wanted to continue criticizing the Harry Potter craze  I needed to do it with full information  I was  after all  a fully grown 12 year old    not an 11 year old child I opened the book from the school library at noon and literally couldn t put it down  I read it behind my text books in class  on the walk home from school  and then ran to my room and read it underneath the covers until well after midnight  I ve never been a fast reader  I had always loved books  but this was something different    it felt more personal and more wonderful than anything I d ever encountered  I hope it always will PS  Snape sucks  Hufflepuff forever  Every time I read these books  I m reminded of details I ve forgotten  The world building in this book is so superb  I wish I could crawl into J K  Rowling s imagination and have a look around   I consider myself very privileged to be part of the generation that got to grow up with this series  In fact one of my earliest memories is four year old me sat in a shopping trolley while my mum tried to tell me not to start reading it until she d paid for it I simply can t give one of my usual reviews to this book or series because I am incredibly biased  This world didn t just make my childhood  it was my childhood  No other book will ever be as beloved to me or elicit so much emotion  or mild insanity  as these ones do Some people may call me a crazy fangirl but this has been as much a part of my everyday life for as long as I can remember as my family and home have been  I would have to be a sociopath to not develop a strong emotional attachment to it It is my strong belief that anyone who hasn t read it is doing something wrong with their life  If you ve read it and don t like it  so be it  But if you haven t even tried reading it there s no excuse  Geweldig om dit boek voor de zoveelste keer te lezen  Ik vind de Nederlandse vertaling echt tof  Volgende keer lees ik  m weer in het Engels    Misschien dat ik me ook ooit aan het Duits of Frans waag     Story  5Audio  5Audible with Pottermore has recently remastered and released the Harry Potter books for their UK European market Having only seen the film series until now  I wasn t sure what to expect  But before Stephen Fry had the chance to hum  Chapter Two   I knew I was in for a delightful treat Rowling has an incredible ability to conjure wonder and amazement in her writing  and I thoroughly enjoyed getting to know the Potterverse places and character much deeper  through their backgrounds  scenes and sequences that are naturally lost in the shorter medium of a two hour motion picture I knew listening to Stephen would be good  but I never expected him to be this brilliant  Nailing accents and mannerisms to set each character apart  he truly helps bringing Rowling s universe to life  and lets me drift into her world effortlessly Knowing how intense the series eventually turn  I look forward to hearing the rest of Harry s complete story  It s always good to revisit the world of Harry Potter     This time the two things that struck me were 1  Snape isn t such a bad guy  Yes  he s a jerk  but when push comes to shove  he always chooses to do the right thing  2  I understand the Centaurs much better now   view spoiler  pg  260  Harry talking   Firenze saved me  but he shouldn t have done so    Bane was furious    he was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going to happen    They must show that Voldemort s coming back    Bane thinks Firenze should have let Voldemort kill me    I suppose that s written in the stars as well   Yes it is  Harry    Just you wait      hide spoiler  My goal  we ll see if I achieve it  is to reread the whole series  I m ashamed to say I ve never done that  I reread the first three books while I waited for the 4th  but beyond that  I ve read most of the books only once  although I did read the 6th one twice   and as a result  I d forget important details by the time I read the next book  I want to read all 7 in rapid succession so I can get the full effect  I don t know that I really have time for that and I ll likely get distracted by other books  but that s what I m thinking at the moment  At first I was really reluctant to read this one because the book sounded really intimidating  add the fact what the other people are saying about a boy who defeated someone who is really powerful but doesn t really knows how it happened  spells  wands  flying brooms  and a highly magical school  It sounded nonsense to me so I declined my english teachers offers to read it But my oh my  I had to change my unpopular opinion about Harry Potter because it was actually great The writing s really good and smooth flowing  you can read this is you have nothing else to read or just simply bored  Time will surely pass in great droplets And everything is so vividly imagined I can t even  Everything is in my head  I m imagining magical things that s impossible to exist but here they are  in my brain  so vivid  so surreal Just one thing  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone is surely a gold This story is one of those kinds that will always be remembered  So much better than the movie  5 Harry Potter spent the first eleven years of his life thinking he was a normal and unfortunate boy who lost his parents in a car accident and ended up living with his unloving family  the Dursleys  Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia  The arrival of a series of mysterious letters reveals to Harry that he is not a normal boy  In fact  he is a wizard and he has been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry  the best of them all  But this is not the only thing that makes Harry special  From the Keeper of the Keys at Hogwarts  Rubeus Hagrid  Harry discovers that he is not only a wizard but he is famous in the wizarding world for having survived the attack that killed his parents  the attack of the most dangerous wizard of all times  Lord Voldemort This novel takes readers in a  dare I say it   magical journey through the streets of Diagon Alley where Harry does his school shopping stoping at Gringotts  the bank for wizards and witches  and Ollivander s where young wizards are selected by their magic wand  We follow Harry as he boards the Hogwarts Express and meets Ronald Weasley  is selected for Gryffindor by the Sorting Hat  goes to his classes  did you notice they don t care much about grammar and math  and yet Potions need precise measurements and logic    and even fights a troll  which turns out to be the setting of the beginning of his friendship with Hermione Granger  All of these adventures precede the greatest adventure  Harry s first encounter with Lord Voldemort I still love this book  It not only has sentimental value  being the first book I ve ever read  but I love the world it introduces  Of course  as an adult  I begin to see the flaws with the franchise in general and the narrative style in particular  but this book  the one that starts it all  is pretty perfect as it is  I enjoyed J K  Rowling s narrative that takes us from one event to the next  but I lost the love for it reading the following books  as it really becomes tiring and repetitive Having read the complete series before  I still have some unanswered questions  Most of these questions arise from the fact that Rowling does not properly set up the boundaries of the world she has created It is a wonderful world  But Rowling  much like Harry  was discovering her own world as she wrote Harry s story  So many things changed over time and so many things were never explained And yet  I cannot write a review about this book without praising Rowling for her creativity  She really did come up with something amazing  And the best part is that  although unfinished  this world is inspiring  Look at all the fan fiction that exists as proof  we the readers get to re imagine the different stories  get to answer some of the unanswered questions  and we just don t want to let this world go  after seeing all the movies since my 3th  i decided to finally discover the wizarding world in form of books  my mom already had all the books in her own bookshelf  so i could easily steal them from her this book was just amazing  the writing is just simply perfect for young and old  even accents are written well  also the plot is just outstanding  i just can t say anything more about it  it s just an enjoyable book also  the trio s friendship is cute as heck    A really fun read  I just wish I hadn t memorised the movie first   Completed reading the  long  overdue first book it the Harry Potter series  It was incredible  Wished i read it earlier  better late than never  A boy  wizard  who has a battered second family but rich ancestory   a girl  muggle witch  with remarkable intelligence   a boy  born wizard  who is overshadowed by his five brothers  with an awesome sense of humour   an adorable and authoritative headmaster   a loving giant   a villianous professor   lousy Dursleys   wonderful Weaslys   magical Hogwarts   flinching nocturnal watchman   with all this and a lot more   there is no way you cannot find the book interesting  Remarkbly well written by J K Rowlling which tugs our imagination strings at various points while nudging the forgotten childishness hidden in us Though i shouldnt be comparing the book and the movie   its hard not to draw a comparision between the two  I do respect the Harry Potter movie franchise  but i still will go for the book  It made me laugh more than the movie   it gave me a liberty to expand my imagination   not limit it with whatever is presented  The book s target audience were obviously children which was blown into a series of seven books  Even after a gap of so many years i suprisingly liked the book  A bunch of students poking there nose in the deep secrets of their school   which kid will not be interested in that and to my amazing suprise an adult too cannot be blamed for an inclination towards it  Sorcerer s Stone   Review    The Dursleys  Hagrid  Dumbledore  the Weasleys  Hermione  Diagon Alley  Ollivander  the sorting hat  Draco Malfoy  Neville  Professor Snape  Quidditch  Fluffy  the Forbidden Forest  Professor Quirrell  Voldemort and of course  Harry Potter  These are among the many reasons to read  or re read  this amazing book  I can t say much about this book or J K  Rowling or the series itself that hasn t already been said  Suffice it to say that this is a must read for nearly everyone  I remember reading it the first time and never wanting it to end  Then waiting  waiting     for the next book in the series  Lucky you who can read it now for the first time  and if it takes a part of your soul  are able to read them all at your own pace  I only wish I could read it again for the first time  But  even having read it  twice already   and seen the movies  I was still enthralled by the characters  the amazing settings  and the story  LOVE LOVE LOVE this book    Recommended to Everyone who likes magic  fantasy  amazing characters or stories where someone small achieves something huge against overwhelming odds with the help of his friends  I will say that Voldemort can be frightening and when I read this to my daughter in second grade  she was a little scared of him  We waited a year to move on to the next one   Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone was a very good book  It was very exciting and fun to read  Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone is about a boy named Harry Potter who lives with his aunt and uncle the Dursleys  When he starts getting letters from owls to go to Hogwarts a wizard school  Harry realizes he s a wizard  On the train he meets Ron Weasley who becomes his best friend and Hermoine Granger who becomes one of his friends too  While learning magic at Hogwarts Harry and his friends finds a trap door guarded by 3 headed dogs  They then learn someone is trying to steal whatever is beneath the trap door  So they go down in the trapdoor and face challenges to get to the sorcerers stone  Harry finds a professor in the room of the sorcerers stone and the professor reveals voldermolt is in his body and Harry and voldermolt fight and Harry won and saved the sorcerers stone  When the school year ended he went back to the Dursleys and waited for his second year at Hogwarts  I recommend this book to anyone who likes fantasy or adventurous books   I just finished reading this book for the first time ever and I am really very impressed and totally taken with the Potter universe  I actually watched all eight movies before starting the books and I am glad I decided to do this  The first thing that struck me about this series was how creative it is  The world that J K  Rowling has created is so incredibly imaginative and fun  It really draws you in  Harry Potter  who is around eleven years old  is living with relatives who really don t like him or want him around  His parents died when he was a baby and he does not know anything about them other than that they supposedly died in a car crash  His life changes when he gets a letter from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry  He has been accepted into this school even though he has no idea that he possesses any kind of special powers  Other than a few  coincidental  odd things happening to his adopted family  he has not shown much of magical ability  Off he goes to Hogwarts  where he encounters an entire world which he did not know existed  At first he is afraid he will be behind all the other students  but when he begins classes and training he finds his place and begins to show many talents  This book is not as  dark  as some of the later books  which is nice  The characters are so lovable and the book is a very quick and easy read  Fantastic story  I will likely not be able to help measuring future fantasy sci fi books that I read up against this because it is just so incredible   I started reading Harry Potter in 1999  when the second book came out  and loved it  Over time I have grown nervous that I was overrating  But reading it to my children was very exciting  Although it was even clearer how much of it is derivative of other work  they themselves spotted multiple thefts from Roald Dahl   the combination of the characters and the plot was perfectly pitched  especially for them  That said  they will probably need to read the next six themselves    When Harry was one  he some how survived the curse of the greatest dark wizard  Voldemort who all the wizards were afraid to even say his name  Harry s parents died in the attack  but Harry escaped with his lightning scar and nobody understood why Voldemort s power had been destroyed when he tried to kill Harry So he was brought by his mother s sister and his husband  the horrible Dursleys  They told Harry that he got his scar and his parents died in a car accident  Then  after ten years  he received a letter to be sent at Hogwart and the whole story came out  He went to the wizard school and realized he was famous  He learned to play Quidditch and he was selected the Gryffindor   his house   s team  He made friends  Ron and Hermione  The found out that the Philosopher s Stone was in danger from Voldemort and they saved it  Harry encountered Voldemort again  but escaped and survived with the help of his friends and Professor Dumbledore  I love this book  It is very addicting and you can t put the book down   Just     wow      Hard Work and Pain are the best teachers to human beings   The message I inferred from J K  Rowling via this novel After completing this novel I can say that this novel is even more strange and exciting than the wild rumors  I felt so happy as though a large balloon was swelling inside me  At some point I was thinking of having eight brains to understand things at once In the beginning I was amazed to experience Dumbledore s Watch which had twelve hands but no numbers  instead  little planets were moving around the edge  The journey from platform nice and three quarters from King s Cross  Witch and Wizards cards from chocolate frogs were just amazing things to experience in the text  Quidditch  a game easy to understand  even if it s not too easy to play  I predicted that Harry must have found it interesting with  Nimbus Two Thousand Broomstick   My prediction became the reality at the end of this novel  Invisibility Cloak from Harry s father which works even on cats in reference to Mrs  Norris and the mirror of Erised where Harry saw his past and Ron saw his future   There is no good and evil  there is only power   You must know whom I am referring to  Yes  the one whose name must not be taken  In the final sentence  I would say that the precise presentation of the  Forbidden Forest  in keyword rich and content light has presented me with a better experience than what I had watching the movie  I absolutely adore Harry Potter  the whole world is so brilliant and enchanting but also has that very dark element  At 17 years old  after watching all of the films at the times they were released  I finally got round to reading the books  The first book in the series is an excellent way to introduce the characters and the character s ways and personalities really shine through  You instantly feel a strong dislike towards The Dursley s  You almost feel like a wizard  by which I mean you find it dreadfully funny because The Dursley s don t understand the wizarding world  they are merely muggles  Each main character had their own time in the spotlight  They got to show what they could do independently  I thought that aspect was a smart move from J K  I also felt really sympathetic towards Hagrid and got quite emotional when he did  The impression you are left with is that he may look frightening but he s the kindest man you will ever meet and is very sensitive  However  that being said  he isn t afraid to protect people he cares about and assert his authority  I cannot stress how much adoration I have for the highly detailed description which produces the most exquisite imagery in my mind  You often feel as confused as Harry at times  constantly trying to figure out which teacher s aren t who they make out to be  There is also a lot of humorous lines which make this journey a really fun ride  also scary and exciting but fun  There is also a lot of mystery surrounding the dark lord or he who must not be named which is brilliant for making the reader want to carry on in to the series I conclude that this is an excellent fantasy novel  the first in a seven part series of which I shall be continuing  I recommend this series to anybody   Its a great book suprisingly the movie stayed true to the book The book has a great plot harry poter ron hermione are charectors that you want to root for and if you dont you must be a or part of a voldemort follower   Rereading times        A note to self  to see how many times will I reread this book in my life     1st to 7th   around 2000   2008  Indonesian edition   8th   Aug 2014  UK edition   After all  to the well organised mind  death is but the next great adventure     Albus Dumbledore  I missed you so much  Dumbledore    T___T Beli buku ini via BookDepository akhir Juli kmrn  Tapi krn kebentur libur panjang  baru nyampe di tangan awal Agustus ini  Saking disayang sayangnya ini buku  baca bukunya aja sampe 1 chapter hari  Dan buka bukunya pun sampe bersudut 90 derajat tepat  guys   supaya lembaran buku ga lepas dari lemnya  tangan juga dicuci bersih supaya tdk ada noda hitam yg menempel di kertas  Jaket dilepaskan dulu tiap kali mulai membaca  Rencananya mau disampul plastik tebal lagi  Berlebihan bgt yak  Tapi beginilah fans fanatik itu   p Lagian bukunya kan mahal  hahaha  Tapi seorang fans fanatik pun melanggar aturannya sendiri ketika mulai tenggelam dlm dunia buku favoritnya itu  Dari 1 chapter hari jadi 2 chapter hari  3 chapter hari dstnya  Dan dari sudut 90 derajat pun jadi 150 derajat waktu sampe pertengahan buku  yah wajarlah  kalo udah seru bacanya  mana sanggup pertahankan 90 derajat di pertengahan buku  Alasan  Haha   P Wew  sudah berselang 6 tahun sejak terakhir kali baca ulang seri ini  Memang selama selang waktu itu sudah berkali kali terbersit niat utk baca ulang  tapi sayangnya buku versi terjemahan Indonesia nya sudah diwariskan ke adik saya yg di luar pulau Jawa  Sebenarnya pewarisan tsb hanyalah sebuah alasan utk membeli ulang box set yg baru  dlm bntk hardback  bknnya paperback  Koleksi paperback ku terutama buku 1 4 juga sudah menguning dan jamuran  sampai aku yg termasuk OCD ini jadi ngeri membuka bukunya  Walaupun ngomongnya rindu HP  tapi sampai saat ini masih ga dibeli2 box set yg versi terjemahan itu krn lagi nunggu diskon 30  Gramed all item  yg setiap kali sale itu kejadian  aku malah beli novel2 lain yg masuk wish list yg total harganya ga kalah dari total harga box set HP  so bayangin aja kenapa biarpun Gramed berkali2 diskon 30  tetap saja aku blm beli box set nya sampe sekarang  p  Tapi untungnya  aku blm beli box set versi terjemahannya  Dan malah berbalik beli yg original  terbitan penerbit Inggris Bloomsbury  Secara sebagai salah satu fans sejati HP  imo blm sah namanya kalo blm baca yg versi Inggris  bukan Amrik loh   asli tulisan tangan J K  Rowling sendiri  Walaupun kuakui  setelah baca versi Inggris nya ini  versi terjemahan yg Indonesia juga punya kualitasnya tersendiri    Melihat gaya bahasa yg digunakan  aku jadi seperti melihat 1 karya dibuat oleh 2 org yg berbeda  imho  Aku jadi pgn beli box set yg versi terjemahan juga  kalau duit mencukupi dan kalau aku sudah berhasil melengkapi yg versi Inggris ini   Dasarnya fans fanatik   p Niat beli versi Inggris ini makin kuat waktu aku melihat grand opening nya The Wizarding World of Harry Potter   Diagon Alley  Wow  just noticed how I missed Harry Potter SO SO MUCH    Jaman2 kuliahan itu aku sempat nyobain baca e book nya yg versi Inggris tapi yg versi dummy alias fanfic yg ngaku2 asli  saking ga tahannya nunggu buku 7 keluar   Tapi baru baca bbrp paragraf saja aku udah angkat tangan  masalahnya waktu itu kemampuan bhs Inggris ku itu masi kelas TK  jadi bayangkan seberapa  asyiknya  baca e book jika utk baca tiap barisnya kamu harus buka kamus  Memang waktu itu aku pakainya software kamus di PC  tapi sayangnya kamusnya ga lengkap kosakatanya  apalagi kosakata British    Jadilah dari bad experience itu selain nyerah baca versi dummy nya  nyerah baca e book  dan juga nyerah baca yg versi Inggris  Tapi kecintaanku pada komik waktu masa kuliahan itu membuatku belajar utk membaca scanlation komik dlm bhs Inggris secara online  yg kulakukan secara intensif  terus dan terus baca scanlation versi Inggris itu selama bertahun tahun hingga sekarang  sudah 12 tahun berlalu  O___O Yg membuatku akhirnya lumayan pede buat baca e book bhs Inggris awal 2014 ini  Dan memang  dari pengalamanku baca e book bhs Inggris dari awal 2014 hingga bln ini  aku hanya perlu buka kamus elektronik sesekali  kadang malah tdk buka kamus sama sekali  Sebuah kemajuan besar buatku  Tapi imo  kadang itu tergantung dari novelnya sendiri juga  apakah pengarang menggunakan kata2 yg umum atau yg jarang digunakan Jadi  back to HP setelah ngelantur cukup jauh  Baca yg versi Inggris ini membuatku kembali semangat 45 utk menuntaskan seri ini hingga buku terakhirnya lagi  Tapi sayangnya  krn ini versi asli yg cukup mahal  box set setelah diskon yg diberikan BookDepository com  BD  sekitar 2 JUTA   O__O  aku mesti nyicil beli bukunya satu satu atau dua dua  tdk bisa sekaligus  Dan baru saja aku mau mesen buku 2 nya  eh bukunya OOS di BD    huks huks    T___T Tinggal yg paperback  padahal aku koleksi yg hardback    T___T Padahal abis kelarin buku 1 ini aku sudah kebelet pgn baca lanjutannya    memang ada sih yg versi e book  tapi kan baca buku fisik itu beda rasanya dgn baca e book  apalagi wangi kertas hardback nya ini ga bisa dibandingin dgn kertas buku terbitan Indo  yg kebanyakan kaya kertas koran gitu    Kalo disuruh beli cover lain yg hardback juga aku ga mau  secara dari semua cover HP yg ada di pasaran sedari 1997 hingga 2014  sudah 17 tahun  guys      aku paling suka ilustrasi versi yg satu ini     Jadi  mungkin kalo sudah tdk tahan lagi nunggu kabar dari BD buat ngabarin kapan restock buku 2  maka aku baca e book nya duluan  sambil mesen buku 3 5 awal September ini  ngakalin tagihan kartu kredit supaya ga berat di kantong  hahaha   Biar nanti kalo udah dapat buku fisiknya yg no 2  baru deh buku fisik no 2 dibaca ulang      Reader Response  I loved loved loved Harry Potter  My family has always told me to pick these books up and start reading them because it will help me get more involved in reading  however I didn t read these books until college  Once I picked up the first book I was hooked all the way to the last book  This is one of my favorite book series of all time  I would find it very hard for a person to hate this book and these series  Teacher Response  I would love to use this book into my class just because I think it will hook my students into reading  If I did use it I would use it as a start of school opener  since it is a fiction book and then lead into the heavier side of nonfiction  A fun way I think to use this book would be having student go through and write a scene that is from another characters point of view  We would then come back together as a class and discuss how different two writings can be that have the same events taking place    Currently on a Spring 2014 mission to re read all the Harry Potter books because it s been too long  I m envisioning five stars for the whole series  I love everything about this book and reading it almost 15 years later  I m able to understand some of the finer points of Rowling s craft  Her humour  plotting and planning are superb  Hoping to rekindle my love for Harry Potter while picking up some hints and tips on how to be a magical author of fine literature   I am speechless at how amazing this book is  I knew they were good from other people  but now that I have experienced it  I wanna keep reading the series    THIS IS JUST SOOOOO GREAT     I don t regret one bit of reading this book  Just absolutely fantastic   side note  I m going as Hermione Granger for Halloween cuz she s awesome and she s my favorite  C  Chamber of Secrets  HERE I COME     STEP ASIDE  MAXIMUM RIDE   Don t worry  Percy Jackson  I still luv yaahh     I loved this book  It was so cool  This is the first and only Harry Potter book I ve read so far  and I want to read the 2nd one  Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets  The story was so intruiging  and I want to know what happens in the sequel at Harry s second year at Hogwarts  I definitely liked the book better than the movie  I actually read the UK edition of this book  I read this book when I was about 8 years old and I loved it  We don t have that many awesome books out there  I remember the good old days of anticipation for the next book  This story transports you to another world of mystical castles  magic  mischief  mystery  friendship  villains and much more  You feel bad for Harry and want so bad for him to prove himself  Rowling is a brilliant writer with a gift for story telling  I LOVED THIS BOOK  It was way way way better than the movie  It includes more of a back story than the movie had provided in my opinion  It tells more about the Dursleys and what kind of people they are before Harry came along  It also includes more detail throughout the whole entire book  This is a really good fantasy book for someone who likes fantasies  If you even liked the movies it will be an amazing book for you  I highly recommend this book to everyone though  I grew up reading this book and I believe that younger people will read this too  In the story  Dumbledore  head master of Hogwarts  leaves the only person to survive a deadly vigilante s attack to their non magic uncle and aunt  His name is Harry Potter  After 11 years  he finds out that he is a wizard and then attends Hogwarts to be the ultimate wizard  He makes a lot of friends and starts to make enemies  I would recommend this book to people of all ages  Go Harry      Are they all available in the illustrated editions    My daughter wants to read them with me  and this looks perfect  I just don t want to start in the illustrated and then have to wait a couple years for the next one  No se porque tarde tanto en leerlo  lo ame   3 Beloved   This is a story about a boy who lives with his aunt and uncle  who do not like him  because his parents died  He always felt like he was different  but he never really knew why  That is  until his thirteenth birthday when he found out that he is a wizard  He received a letter from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry explaining to him that he was a wizard and he had been accepted into this school  He also discovers that his parents were wizards as well  which is why his aunt and uncle did not like any of them  They hated anything out of the ordinary   and that they had been killed by an evil  powerful wizard named Lord Voldemort  But Harry had lived  He was the only person that survived an attack by Voldemort  This story begins a series of Harry s adventures in which he makes friends  learns about wizardry  learns more about his parents  and most importantly attempts to defeat Voldemort to avenge his parents  This is one of my favorite books  It enchanted me as a child and it still captures me as an adult  I believe that everyone can enjoy this book and connect to it on some level  It has very strong characters and it shows the power of love between friends and family  This would be excellent for children to read to help them extend their vocabulary and use their imagination   I just adore this book  An absolute treasure for all ages  To me it has always been a cross between a brilliant fantasy and an Enid Blyton  my most beloved and favourite childhood author   There s just something so warm and familiar about the style of writing that always takes me back to where I first started becoming such an avid bookworm and the story of the boy that lived  so well known by so many now and such an instant classic just never gets old for me  I finally read this book  It was really good  I wonder if it will become popular  It would make a good movie  8  This is an incredibly gorgeous illustrated edition of Harry Potter  I highly recommend it  The drawings are breathtakingly beautiful  full of studious details and fresh interpretations of Rowling s rich descriptions  The way Jim Kay depicts Harry  Ron  Hermione  Neville  and Malfoy all strikes me as much more realistic than the good looking kids that were cast to star in the movies  All in all  definitely worth checking out this new edition  It s lovely and moving  Di sicuro altra gente ha scritto recensioni migliori di quanto possa essere la mia su Harry Potter  quindi parlero solo dell edizione illustrata di Jim Kay  In poche parole  e strabiliante  Le illustrazioni ad acquerello riempiono quasi tutte le pagine  sono ben poche quelle in cui non c e neanche un piccolo disegno come complemento al testo  Dove non ci sono  comunque  le pagine non sono completamente bianche  c e sempre qualche macchia di colore a ravvivare il bianco  Il testo e diviso in due colonne  ma e leggibile con facilita  Le illustrazioni variano di dimensioni  alcune grosse come una banconota da 5 euro  altre riempiono la pagina o addirittura due  e rappresentano luoghi  oggetti e personaggi con un tocco sempre piuttosto eccentrico  a volte fiabesco e a volte piu dark  piu dark di quanto mi aspettassi  per essere il primo libro  ma tale e lo spirito inglese   L autore ha dato lineamenti specifici  non generici  a tutti i personaggi senza farsi influenzare dagli attori del film  e anche ai luoghi e riuscito quasi sempre a dare una propria interpretazione che rimane consistente dall inizio alla fine  Per esempio  la torre da cui Harry e Hermione consegnano Norberto e trapassata dal collo di un drago  e la scala per arrivarci e costituita dal corpo dello stesso  Questa torre e visibile nei dettagli nel capitolo corrispondente  e da lontano  perfettamente identica  nelle illustrazioni che ritraggono Hogwarts dal lago o dalla Foresta Proibita  Forse solo per qualche parte del castello ho avuto la sensazione che i film possano avere influenzato la visione dell artista  ma mi sembra inevitabile  e in parte giustificato dal fatto che i vari registi non hanno svolto affatto un cattivo lavoro Mi e piaciuto tantissimo  comunque  poter immaginare di nuovo il mondo di Harry Potter come l avevo fatto da bambina  senza vedere il volto di Daniel Radcliffe al posto del  mio  Harry  e scoprire che Jim Kay ha catturato cosi bene la visione che mi ispirava il libro  Sono pochissime le scene per cui avrei voluto un illustrazione e non c era  i centauri  il professor Vitious Flitwick  e poco altro  Infine  questo libro contiene la nuova traduzione  per cui mi sembra giusto spendere due parole anche su questo  Migliora tantissimo l esperienza  su questo non ho dubbi  ricordo che da piccola non avevo capito alcune frasi  e rileggendole adesso  modificate  mi sono diventate chiare  Un esempio  approssimativo perche non ho voglia di cercare sui libri le parole esatte   Ron quando dice  Entro martedi tutto sara risolto   che non aveva alcun senso logico  ed e adesso stato reso con  Non resistera fino a martedi prossimo    Tuttavia rimangono ancora alcuni pezzi che ho dovuto rileggere due volte per capire bene  o ancora peggio  altri che proprio non ho capito  e adesso che non ho piu 8 anni  so per certo che la colpa non e mia   Quindi la traduzione va migliorata ancora  Per quanto riguarda il controverso ritorno ai nomi originali dei personaggi    mi sembra controverso per buone ragioni  Insomma  in alcune circostanze e un bene  Thor e diventato Zanna  e per fortuna  dato che il nome originale e Fang e la traduzione non aveva senso  Per altri nomi il ritorno all originale ha fatto perdere loro quel sapore  quell istintivo riconoscimento che i nomi inglesi  a un lettore  per di piu bambino  italiano  non potranno mai dare  McGrannitt lasciava intendere che la donna sarebbe stata severe  McGonagall non dice niente di niente  Bene invece l aver lasciato la traduzione Piton  Perche piuttosto non cambiare la traduzione di Silente  quando la Rowling stessa l ha disapprovata  Non puo essere perche il fandom e affezionato a questo nome  quando i traduttori hanno deciso di eliminare Tassorosso in favore di Tassofrasso  che mi sembra piu appropriato  anche se cosi si perde il gioco con i colori  che comunque non e presente nei nomi originale delle Case   In conclusione  la traduzione nuova sembra un lavoro fatto male  a meta  Le illustrazioni  invece  le ho amate e mi hanno aiutato a completare il mio immaginario personale senza imporsi su di esso  soltanto arricchendolo  Consiglierei questa edizione a tutti gli amanti di Harry Potter e ai bambini che si avvicinano per la prima volta a questa serie  perche potranno usufruire di una traduzione migliore di quella originale e di illustrazioni meravigliose  mentre per gli adulti questa versione del libro potrebbe risultare troppo infantile   Although I may be biased because I ve read this book so many times  I just want to let whoever is reading this    In my opinion  this series is the best series I ve ever read  This was my 4th time reading this book and to me  it never gets old  The plot for whoever is weird enough to have not read this book by now  is about a boy named Harry Potter  He starts out a normal life after his parents die in a car accident  Harry lives under the stairs with his cousin  aunt and uncle  They all treat him like a servant though  what Harry doesn t know is that his lightning scar is from surviving the wizard battle with the most terrible villain that people call him  He Who Must Not Be Named   Harry Potter when Harry turns ten her starts getting mysterious letters delivered from owls  This book makes me feel for each one of the characters  especially when we meet  He Who Must Not Be Named   This book counted of 310 pages ended up with a whole 7 book series   How do you review a modern classic in a way that hasn t been done millions of times before  Well  time to try The first topic that must be discussed is the Americanisation of the title  Rowling has stated she wishes she had fought harder to keep the original title  and the one used almost everywhere else in the English speaking world   The Philosophers Stone  when it went to print in America  Publishers advised against this  as it might confuse Americans who traditionally see philosophers simply as scholars  and lack the more  european  background knowledge relating to the study of alchemy  Personally  I m with Rowling  I cant help but feel something was lost in translation  that it was somehow  dumbed down   You re asking people to believe in magic  dragons  and an entire hidden world  is it so much further a stretch to hope people would make the leap from the newer understanding of  philosopher   to the old In the mind of this reviewer  much of the success of The Sorcerer s Stone  and the entire franchise  is rooted in how accessible the book is  Rowling could easily have attempted to make us all feel a little dumb  and written high fiction in the style of Tolkien  Intricately described scenes  using the sort of language that requires a thesaurus to be close to hand throughout  Yet instead  Rowling embraces her audience  using broad brush strokes to describe most scenes allowing each reader to fill in the details  It is this initial magic that captures the imagination of readers  allowing each of us  even those who watched the films first  to create a slightly different universe in our mind s eye  Even when describing characters  the strokes are broad  None of us see Dumbledore the same way  sure  the clothes are there  the colors  the build  but the finer features are all our own creation  In this way  Rowling allows us all to identify with characters throughout the series  we all have our own Harry s  Ron s  Snape s    and even our own Dudley s The need to suspend disbelief is sometimes an arduous procedure when beginning a new series  You re asked to buy into certain definites that then are expanded to build a world  Hobbit s  then Hobbiton  then The Shire  then Elves etc    In the case of Harry Potter  you have them slipped in slowly  The world is too normal  too painfully bland  that we are left to hope for something more  By the time Harry arrives on the doorstep of Number 4  Privet Drive  the world he was born into  although only glimpsed  feels more  normal  than the one his aunt and uncle exist in  And ultimately  if it was not for the knowledge that this form of normality was hopelessly abnormal  I doubt many of us could have lasted through the abuse our hero suffers in the first few pages Harry suffers  Love him or hate him by the end of the Hallows  no one can claim Harry comes from a happy home  Or rather  that he grew up in one  As mentioned in the chapter reviews  Harry suffers merciless mental and physical abuse throughout his early years  This formative period could have turned Harry into a dark  dangerous child  Always looking to strike before being struck  always looking for the ulterior motive in those who he interacts with  unable to trust kindness or generosity  You see it in dogs all the time  Good dogs  who want nothing more than a home and someone to love  beaten and beaten until they know nothing else  and react with teeth to even the gentlest touch Yet Rowling decided to take things a different way  Instead of breaking Harry  this abuse brought out strength and resilience we can all admire and empathise with  It made the famous  rich  naturally talented jock  that Harry ultimately is  softer  more approachable  loveable even  We all hope to have a little Harry within us  The strength to endure  yet flourish  The ability to grow while under pressure  The will to win  even when it would be easier just to lie down and give up  The great magic of Harry Potter is not the existence of magic  but rather the way Rowling allowed us all to believe in ourselves by reading about a young boy succeeding when he could have just given up The story has holes  There are more questions created about the finer points of this magical world than Rowling could hope to answer in a million interviews and a hundred more books  But that doesn t matter  From the casual first time reader  to the diehard Potterhead on their 100th read through  Rowling s deliberately broad brush strokes mean that the universe we create will be different to that of our closest friends  But that allows for the creation of some wonderful AU s  some magnificent fanfics  and endless debate  In short  it makes the series timeless  it makes it magical Is this the best series out there  No  Is it even the best series involving magic I ve come across  Nope  But is it one of the most engaging  Without doubt  Does it spark an interest in reading  creativity  and imagination in a way that other authors would kill to do  Absolutely  Is it better than the film  REDACTED DUE TO CONTROVERSIAL NATURE OF SUBJECT MATTER A very long story short  Harry Potter And The Sorcerer s Stone is a magical read  It sets up a world that features characters we care about  places we want to know more about  and mysteries we want answered  It is a novel that provides a helpful  leg up  to many other YA and High Fantasy series   and a book that lets us all feel like even at it s worst  life is worth living so that we can live to see our own magical awakening  The only struggle I will ever experience with this book  and series  is how to keep my children from spoilers  so that they re able to experience the magic for themselves  in their own way  when the time is right  Finally that day comes when I read Harry Potter  Of course I ve been obsessed with the movies since I was a child  but never got the chance to actually read them  I loved it and enjoyed it a lot     I can t wait to start the next one very soon  D  shkran llmtrjm  sHr jbr mHmwd  ltrjm  ljmyl     Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone by J K Rowling is an extraordinary book featuring magic  adventure  and excitement  In the book  young Harry is a boy who finds no comfort in life  his aunt and uncle having always hated him and having given him severe punishments  while their son  Dudley Dursley  beat him up all day  He had never even thought about being a wizard  or thought about anyone being a wizard  but could destiny bring him to the light  The strengths and weaknesses of this book are that it has many amazing ideas and the characters are all very courageous which might make the readers want to be more courageous The weaknesses of this book are that it promotes witchcraft in students or children when the kids in the book get to do do so many things that we cannot do here in the real world They might try to do many things that could end terribly  It is a suitable book for elementary schools because it has very good imagination and the story is extremely interesting Children might right better and with more detail after reading this book because they will understand what some good details will do to help the story  Overall this book is amazing and I think that everyone should get a chance to read it  4 5 Stars  Young Harry Potter is an English boy who has lived with his aunt and uncle for his entire life since his parents were killed when he was a baby  Harry  who lives his life feeling like a bother to his family soon learns a big secret  he is a wizard  Harry is soon invited to leave his aunt and uncles house and join Hogwarts  the school for witchcraft and wizardry where he meets his two best friends  and also begins to understand the prophecy which his parents left him  being some of the best wizards known in history  This book uses great language and the dialect in the story connects with the reader so the person reading the story feels as if they are in the story  The plot is so good it has been made famous internationally  and the whole story is overall intriguing and awesome  This book could be good for individual reading  This book could also be good to use in a small group  where the group would read a paragraph and then reflect with each other what was happening in the book  This book could also be used for a creative writing lesson and the students could create their own spells which have their own appropriate meanings Rowling  J  K     GrandPre  M   1998   Harry Potter and the sorcerer s stone  New York  NY  A A  Levine Books   Ok let me start off by saying that as a 21 years old guy I have never watched nor read the Harry Potter movies books  and I m glad I had the opportunity of reading the first installment of this series now I might be baised here because I ve meant to read these book before but I loved it  Is a children book but it shows a character arc so good and consistent that makes the story more appealing  it teaches important values and the importance of friendship and how the endless fight for power and money can ruin us This books covers the story of Harry Potter  you don t say  where he comes from  his family  friends  and how he s been living with his muggle family that dislikes him so much  A consisten story at the right pace and well developed scenes  a huge background on Harry s life and the teaches and all this magical world altogether  A deep story indeed with a huge amount of little butnimportant details  Great narrative  more than perfect POV  three dimensional characters  This book is a 5 stars hands down on that  I ll start with  Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets  tonight because I m just hooked and I want to know how this story continues  Harry Potter is absolutley timeless  It is a classic that will forever be remembered because of the intricate  all too real world J K  Rowling created   3 No need to individually review each novel  as they are all worth the five stars and wonderful  So I will simply copy and paste this into all my reviews for HP  The most wonderful series  Ever  Content  PG   Violence  just fantasy magic   kissing throughout the books but pretty rare  mild rarely used language
