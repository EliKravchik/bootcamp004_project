This book was great it is about a family that lives in a community  They are used to doinig the same thing every day and they have a plain community  Jonas is a boy that lives in the community  He previously is named or titled  The Reciever   So he is working with  The Giver   They come together and decide to help the community have the memories he has recieved  They do this so they can all have a different community and not be so plaine and they can expierence real life situations  As Jonas has also found out that release actually means  killing  and the one that does it is his dad  So when he finds out his brother might be released he takes him along with him  They expierience alot of the memories and they fond there destiniation  The book ends there  Read it and im sure you will love it  Especially the ending  The Giver takes place in an uber futuristic world  in a community that  in an effort to minimize difficulty and pain  has eliminated things like weather  hills  and personal choice  There is no sunlight  There is no rain  The people have lost the ability to see color  Adults apply for a spouse and one is assigned to them  Spouses apply for children and they are assigned to them  one boy  one girl  no more  no less  not ever At the annual ceremony where infants to children of 11  turning 12  receive the items  responsibilities  age  and hairstyles of the next year  The 11 year olds that are turning 12 are given the job assignments they will have for the rest of their lives  and the story centers on one of these 11 to 12 year olds  Jonas At the ceremony  Jonas is named the next Reciever of Memory  The community only has one  one man that holds the memories of generations past and feels all the pain and love that the rest of the community never gets to experience  In order for him to retire he needs to transfer the memories to Jonas Jonas then begins to see the problems in his community  The literal and metaphorical lack of color  The reason why they are so serious about precision of language  parents don t love their children  they enjoy and take pride in them  You re not starving  you re hungry   no one in the community is starving  or ever will be  Etc   Jonas decides after gaining so much experience from the memories  that things need to change One of the things I love most about this book is the amount of detail Lowry packs into such a short book  The way she has the community set up is watertight  no element of life in the community is left out  You aren t distracted halfway through going   Wait  how do they      because it s covered In fantasy criticism there s a rule that s been repeated so often it s cliche  the book or movie needs to establish a set of rules of what is and is not possible in the world being worked in  Chandler and I say this all the time on Movie Gaga  It s this seemingly small rule that  not followed  can destroy a fantasy work  The Giver stays well within its own bounds  More than that  it just barely goes outside the bounds of the natural world  The only magic that actually occurs is in the transfer of and the ability to almost enter the world of the memory This book is also the perfect introduction to dystopian stories  Too young for Fahrenheit 451  1984  Brave New World  but old enough to begin questioning authority and the world around them  There isn t another book for tweens young adults that shows how dangerous mind control can be There are layers of symbolism and allegory that can be analyzed all on their own  as well  which is what makes this book something you can return to over and over again for years  even as an adult  I love it 5 stars out of 5This and more at Blauthor  Blauthor  This is one of those young adult short novels that I really like  It seems that writing for young adults is either complete wacky and fantastic or pared down to the bare bones  This book falls into the latter category The story is set in an undetermined alternate universe in which life is strictly regulated  when you have children  what your career path will be  even the ages at which children experience milestones  e g  when they have to give up their stuffed animals   The protagonist is Jonas  who is directed to pursue his career as the replacement for The Giver  the only person in the whole civilization who knows all of the truths about that society  As Jonas learns more and more truths  he becomes more dissatisfied with his life  I suppose that this story could be seen as an allegory  one that mirrors our own society and its tendency to enjoy wearing blinders to the reality that happens all around us  And Jonas could be the seer who literally begins to see past the blinders But I never really read it that way  I just enjoyed the story for its story  a boy grows up and learns that life isn t what he thought I haven t read the sequel to this book  and I should  but I loved how the book ended ambiguously  so I m hesitant to seek out the sequel  The Giver written by Lois Lowry is an extremely good dystopian book  Initially the book is just telling the story of Jonas a twelve year old boy adjusting to his new role in his society  but as the book continues Lowry shows the importance of individuality and the power of one being able to make their own choices  She also shows what happens if the two do not exist and what the world would be like with complete sameness  I gave The Giver five stars because of the way the author quickly drew me into the book with how she fascinatingly connects her novel to our world as she compares the two  Also the way she describes every scene so well especially the memories Jonas receives as it is the first time he had ever come in contact which things such as the cold and snow  I became so interested in this book that I read the entire book in one day  I recommend this book to all teens and adults because even though it is a very easy and quick read with a very simplistic word choice  The Giver holds a very deep meaning as while reading it the reader is forced to examine just how important being an individual and being able to make your own choices is   The Giver is one of my favorite books of all time  but I didn t realize it until I was much older  This book is all about a futuristic society in which people are told exactly how to live  and they have no freedoms all the way up until the day they die  One other thing  they live in a world of black and white  Until one child  through the power of free will  powerful thought  concentration and insight  is able to start to see in color  An obvious metaphor for better understanding through knowledge  a very powerful message to young readers in an excellent book which provides incredible insight into government intervention in our day to day lives at a basic enough level for elementary school readers to understand  I would absolutely include this on my classroom reading list and have plenty of copies for everyone who wants one  I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a good read   This book is short and yet very moving  Jonas lives in a community where there is Sameness  Marriages are arranged  Each couple can apply for two children  a boy and a girl who are given to them at a Naming Ceremony when the child is one  There are rules that govern the Community such as apologies must be given and then immediately accepted  Those who break the rules are Released or sent to Elsewhere  Every morning dreams must be discussed and at night feelings talked about although they ve no idea what feelings really are  When a child turns 12 they are assigned a career based on careful observation by the Elders and when they are grown their parents go to live with the Childless Adults and they don t see each other anymore Jonas is selected to be The Receiver  a very rare and honored thing  As he is given memories he learns about and experiences color  snow  sunshine  joy and eventually pain and realizes that all those things make life beautiful and meaningful  yet he has no one to share them with because he cannot talk about his training with anyone other than The Giver and the people in the Community wouldn t understand anyway  He begins to see that while the way the Community lives is comfortable and safe  it is not really living  One of the most touching parts for me was when Jonas asks his parents if they love him and they have no idea what the word love is or means I went out on my deck last night and saw the most amazing firefly display and couldn t help but be grateful that we don t live in a world of Sameness  We experience life to its fullest with all of its changes  all of its colors and seasons  We appreciate the good because we can experience the bad  I would recommend this book to anyone  I really loved the Giver because it was very unique  The author told us a world that was meant to be perfect and I have read no other book that does or explain this very nicely as Lois Lowry  the author did  Lois did a great job because he actually wrote a perfect world and it is hard to do this because if one person finds a flaw in the book  the whole story line could be broken  He also has written a great story structure with amazing conflicts that kept the book alive and eventful  Okay  so I am hooked on reading newberry s because they are on an adult level  just shorter and more clear  I would say  This is social commentary    definately Orwellian  and THX 1138 ish  Thought provoking  5 out of 5 Stars  I am so sad that I finished this book because I don t have the other three books to complete the series yet  But I will definitely be buying the rest  so that I can fall even more in love with this amazing series  I read the Giver when I was younger  Grade 7  and I never truly understood it that well until now  Now as i am older  I have a better perspective of it  I honestly love this book so much  I just started it yesterday and finished it this morning lol  Now that I have completed the book  I can go and watch the movie later on today  Honestly  to anyone who hasn t read this book or picked it up  you should do that ASAP  This book is incredible  It s definitely out of the ordinary  which is what made this book so amazing    The Giver  up until recently  has not been a book that I ve heard spoken about all that much  It was recommended to me about a year ago by a fellow bookseller from across the pond  who is also a BookTuber I don t quite understand why it doesn t seem to be as well known   it was originally published in 1993 and has even been published as an essential modern classic in the UK   it s also seriously epic  Only since it was released as a movie has it really seemed to come into the common consciousness  and even then it s not mentioned nearly as much as other book adaptations like The Hunger Games or Divergent  It certainly deserves to be The Giver is set in an idealistic community of  sameness    there is no colour  no class system  no one goes hungry and everyone is assigned a job that best fits them and the needs of the community as a whole  And it works  There is no war  no hunger  no apparent disease  Everyone gets on well and their society is ordered and peaceful But it is also sadly lacking  Lacking in proper feeling  real joy  love and appreciation  Yes  they appear to want for nothing  but does that make them truly happy  And then there are the darker secrets that lie buried beneath the shiny facade    Jonas  our protagonist  is chosen on his twelfth birthday to be the next Receiver of Memory   the member of the community who is granted the  honour  of containing within themselves all the memories of the past  It is their sole responsibility to retain these memories and put them to use when advising the other members of the community  I was immediately suspicious of the  honour  that this would really give  and it soon became clear that not everything was as  perfect  as it might appear in Jonas s world I really enjoyed The Giver  The narrative immediately sucked me in and the story moves forward at such a pace that I never lost interest for a moment  I was constantly wondering what would be around the next corner  what memory Jonas would receive next  and what the consequences would be  I m even more intrigued now  having finished the book  about what is going to happen next I also loved the characters   they breathed life into every page and  despite Jonas s world being so different from the world we know  it made everything feel all the more real  As the story went on  I felt more sympathetic towards the members of the community  gradually realising what they were missing and just how ignorant they were  I m really looking forward to seeing what Jonas is going to do in order to save them If you ve not yet read The Giver  I seriously suggest that you pick it up right away  This is a book that certainly deserves the title of  modern classic  and one that I can see being enjoyed by many more generations to come  A seriously awesome read Review originally posted on my blog  Pen to Paper  I am in love with this book  I am sure that almost everyone has already read it  but I just now got around to it  It is such an awesome story that says so much without being too preachy The Giver is a well written  cautionary tale about a place where rules and sameness are valued above really living  When Jonas comes to realize that life should be full of colors  wonders and love  how can he continue to live in a place where life is always regulated and individuals have no real value Lois Lowry does an exceptional job in painting the black and white existence lived by Jonas  his family and friends  everyone  Jonas finally begins to realize that there is a world filled with color  individuality and beauty  He develops emotions and understands that each life is meant to be valued  He learns what it feels like to love The Giver is a reminder that a life of value  a life well lived  is one filled with the good  the bad  and everything in between  Love means caring for someone else more than you care about yourself  What a wonderful book  This was written ten years ago so many know what it s about already and wont say much  This stirred in my heart and thoughts of the power of love and family  My daughter and I read this together and it was amazing to experience together  This book shows a dystopian society that sees itself as being Utopian  Though  these people would not understand the concept of such things  They do not feel true pain  starvation  war  or sadness  No one dies  instead they are simply released into the Elsewhere  They are not individual  but a society in which every person tends to each other  They must share their dreams and feeling together every day  No one marries for love or bares their own children  They apologize and do not understand why they are doing it anymore  It has become a mere habit to rid the world of confrontation  They are not even allowed to pick out their own jobs because it only creates stress and a sense of superiority and inferiority The things that people see as being ordinary and every day for us would be horrible for them  They do not struggle with dating  instead they are assigned a spouse  after they apply for one   They do not have to worry about accidental pregnancies or not being able to feed themselves or others  They do not have our driving forces  They have the order of the Community and that is all that seems to matter to them  It is what could happen to humanity if we took away the individual  If we were to assign everyone their family and job  they would become an orderly but passionless world  So  the debate of the book is whether the order is worth the humanity that is sacrificed for it  I have always felt that adults can learn a lot by reading children s books  This book is certainly no exception  I can understand why it won the Newbery Award  This is a story about a faceless community who idolized Sameness  It even had no color except what could be found in Memories  that only the Receiver had access to and would pass on to a new Receiver  In this story Jonas was to be the new Receiver  It was a job that had a great deal of pain but also rewards in its Memories  He was doing okay with it until he found out what Release meant to the community   even his own father  This is soon to become a movie  that is one reason I read the book  I loved this book just as much as I did when I read it in school  So great  I read this book several months ago  Lois Lowry gives us much to ponder  I am still haunted by the thoughts that this kind of society could exist in the future  Many elements of this fictious world are  in some forms  already playing out in some cultures today  For example  the weak in society are discarded  as easily as one would throw away an old newspaper  The death of the old  sickly  and disobedient in this story was kept a secret to the main population  Instead  they were told these people were being transferred out of their town  No one dared to question this for fear of being taken away themselves  In their minds ignorance is bliss  The correlation between this fantasy world and the reality of our world today is frightening  I am not a student  but a retired teacher  This book is the type of story that will bring much discussion to the classroom   I really like the book  This book is very interesting about which way you interpret it  To summarize  Jonas is a kid who lives in a perfect community where all people at a certain age is picked for a job which everyone does and picked for each person  When Jonas receives his job  he is chosen as The Receiver  This job is very important  as he receives memories from the one called the Giver  a man with the power to transfer memories  Though at the price the man loses the memory and the receiver feels all the emotions of the memory This is when it gets interesting Spoilers The ending can be interpreted in many ways  First off  the receiver before him was released from the town never to be seen again into the harsh snowy like blizzard  The Giver also recalls that she was hearing music as she left  With that said  Jonas finds a video of a private ceremony of his father s newborn twins  He weighs one of them  and the smaller one is injected with a unknown fluid  The baby twitches  then dies  Seeing this  Jonas decides that he needs to save his brother Gabriel from the same fate So he runs off and escapes the community with his brother  He then sees the same memory of the snowy hill and music starts to echo  And that s all  What makes this book amazing is the fact that you determined what happened to them  Did they die  Did they live elsewhere  Its up to you and all and all makes an excellent book that keeps you guessing  Wow  this is one of my favorite books  I would suggest this to everyone  This book is about a controlled society that controlled almost everything about their community  Everyone has a job that s picked for them  Jonas the main character  becomes the giver  this means he gets memories from the past  good or bad and this upsets him a lot  Sometimes he wants to give up and not be the giver anymore  This community controls population as well and want to kill his brother Gabriel  to prevent this  Jonas runs away with Gabriel and finds a place hes never seen before  it ends with him riding down a hill on a sled looking at a house celebrating Christmas   Madre mia ME ENCANTAN LAS DISTOPIAS ANTIGUAS  son mas crueles  mas reveladoras  y tienen esas esencia que carece la mayoria de las actuales  Culpare a la moda  esa esencia Poco dire  Hace pensar  y aunque el final es poco concluido  decir que este libro es reencontrar  Vivir  Sentir  Pero sobretodo  valorar  Valorar lo pasado  y pensar que el peso de nuestros recuerdos es mas importante de lo que parece Lois make me think    How the society can live their perfect lives  and no ask anything  How the color is important  The past  The music  Give all the things to other people is too important to the Giver I really like too  I think this book was really well written and had great detail  I really felt like I was in Jonas s society  I also think this book is great for teenagers  The main character  Jonas s  lives in a perfect community  that ends up not being so perfect  This book also has some points were you are on the edge of your seat  I believe this book is for older students and not elementary students  This book is not long at all and you really have different thought in your mind when you read this book  After you finish this book  you would have a different way to think  In the beginning the book starts of boring  but after the part the book would be perfect  I really liked this book and I thought it was the best book I ever read  I hope you like and read this book as well   The Giver  11 year old Jonas lives in a  perfect society  where everything goes the way people want it to  The people of the society agree that if they are given the freedom that has been taking away that people will do the wrong things  Lois Lowry describes this town very well  She describes it as a trap  The society makes the people take these pills every morning to make the people not have feelings or see color  The society believes that feelings and color would ruin the society so they take it away This books genre is Sci Fi  I enjoyed reading it because its mixed with things that also could happen in real life  Lois Lowry really made this book well  She kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time and there were no boring parts of this book  I recommend this book to people who enjoy books like The Hunger Games and The Percy Jackson Series I enjoyed the author s writing style in this book  She used a lot of imagery  I could imagine pretty much half the scenes in the book  She described everything so well and made it clear to visualize  Also it gave you more sense of what was going on  This book was great and I highly recommend it  Thomas9 6 15The Giver by Lois LowryJonas a young 11 year old boy is assigned a special job in his community as the new receiver of memory  The giver is an elder in the community who has a big part in sameness  He is the one who holds all of the good and bad memory s  He also is the the one training Jonas by transferring memories to himThe book starts in a place called sameness  this is like no other place  Sameness is the community that Jonas lives in his dwelling with his family unit  Every year all kids in the community will have a ceremony that take place every January  The ceremony is what brings groups up all the way from a 1 all the way to a 12  In this ceremony Jonas along with the other soon to be twelves will be assigned a position in the community  Jonas gets assigned as the new receiver of memory unlike any other position he must go through a training like no other  His training starts him off by the giver transferring memories to him  Memories that were not always good and all memories were only known by the giver and Jonas  Jonas had a long year of training ahead of him Sameness is a place with no color  a place where love is a word  so antiquated that it no longer has any application  sameness has no climate change  there are no seasons  there are no hills  there is no ocean  Most importantly there is no memory of fun  happiness  but there is also no memory of war  of starvation  and death and there are no emotions and feelings  This is what make sameness bad at the same time because what the elders did was make it so that there was way  a solution  It was where disorder became harmony and with the freedom to choose you could have chose wrong  Jonas starts to put together puzzle pieces trying to figure out how to fix everything wrong with sameness  By making everyone know exactly what he knows without the elders in charge finding out  So that that way sameness would be better I thought this book was a very well written book with a very good plot  This book is one of my favorites and I would recommend this book to read  I decided to read this because its been on my to read list fot awhile now  plus all the praise and awards it had received  And I loved it  Its now on my top 25 favorite books of all time list  This book starts out with Jonas a eleven year old who s almost twelve now  There is a ceremony each year until you re twelve years old  Each year you receive something new  at the ceremony of twelve  you re life job is assigned to you  Only Jonas doesn t get assigned to any job  he is selected to be the next receiver of memory  This is a great honor  Memory of the past is given to Jonas by the past receiver  The Giver  During this Jonas learns that the world wasn t always so bland  and colorless  and he feel real pain  and learns the world isn t as great as it seems to be At first the community Jonas lives in doesn t seem all that bad  But as the book progressed we learn it isn t as much a utopian society  but more dystopian  We hear people talk about a thing call a  Releasing   Once we learn what it truly means the dystopian aspect kick in  There are no choice you make yourself in this world  You get assigned a job  a spouse  children  etc  But the craziest part is it works  Everyone s assigned a job  no jobless   a spouse  no spouseless   even thought they don t have sex  children are assigned to the nurturers  But to have such a peaceful world they must give up all memory of war and pain  But while giving up all the pain  they must give up all the pleasurful memories like  snow  sun and love  Leaving the world colorless  But the receiver of memory must keep these memories to prevent future mistakes in the world  they can also see color This book was truly AMAZING  It deserves the five out of five stars I m giving it  When I was informed it was part of a series I nearly peed myself  Can t wait to read the rest  I loved this book  It s short but sweet   I think everyone should read this book   It starts out in a  normal  community    or so the reader thinks  There s a school  you get a job when you re older    But soon you realize Jonas s community is far from normal  Citizens can t choose their clothing  their jobs or even their spouses    They need to have two children  one girl and one boy  no choice  And you may never ever talk about release Suddenly  we realize that Jonas is different from everyone else in the community and he wants change  He doesn t like that every is the same    and with some help from  the Giver  he     READ ON  My review may be viewed here  Wow  it s been a long time since I read a book so quickly  I first attempted reading the giver when I was 11 years old and  if you ve read the book you ll know what I m talking about  I was far too young to understand what the book was presenting  It shows us this dystopia where everyone is the same and choices are made for them  The reader is basically asked if people should be allowed to make decisions for themselves  It really got me thinking about this  I actually had a little bit of an existential crisis for a couple of days  Overall  it was a great book and I highly recommend it  Lois Lowry s  The Giver  is a novel set in a future American society  People follow strict rules that cover everything down to the clothes that they wear  Citizens are kept as equal as possible  jobs are chosen for them by the government  and people are so controlled that love and family are almost completely forgotten  Jonas  the main character of the story  finds himself at age twelve  the year that he is to be given his job  At the nerve racking ceremony  Jonas finds out that he is given the position of  the giver   a job that is only given out once in a generation  As he begins his training with the current giver  he begins to question his life  family  and community  How will he react  This is a science fiction novel that I rated five out of five stars  It is one of my favorite books of all time  The society that the author creates is clearly not real  but the way she writes and describes it makes it seem very real and possible  By following Jonas through this tough time in his life  I really connected with him and wanted to read as much as possible to see how everything turned out  I would recommend this book to everyone  but it is definitely more geared toward someone that likes fantasy and science fiction   I ve loved Lowry since I was a kid  and one thing I love about her is her ability to write about such diverse topics  This is a dark book  but not too dark for me  and is a great one for discussion  Very popular among 5th graders  and well deserving of its Newbery medal  I just spent a bunch of time re reading this with my sons while we re snowed in  and without power some of the time  Feb 2010   It fit the mood well  but my 4th grader was probably a little young to fully appreciate it  although he did listen to the whole thing  Amazing book that makes you think deeply and startling theme areas  This author packed a whole lot of wisdom and questions to ponder in a relatively short book  Seriously  I just finished it and now I won t be able to stop thinking about it for much longer than it took me to read it  THIS is going to be an amazing book club meeting with Faith and her friends  Wow   This is one of my favorite books  It s original and it really makes you think  I found the whole concept of the book incredibly interesting  I also think that Jonas was a really interesting character to read about   This was my favorite book when I was a kid    Behind him  across vast distances of space and time  from the place he had left  he thought he heard music too  But perhaps it was only an echo   The Giver was a nice  short read  Jonas was very admirable  I hope I could ever be as courageous as he is  He has enough courage to go against everything he has learned for eleven years to follow what it is he thinks is right This novel also somehow showed to me the beauty and the brilliance of the things we have around us and which we fail to realize and appreciate everyday  We want too many  too much  that we fail to enjoy the little things that matter the most  At the same time  we also fail to realize that there is too much pain and violence around us nowadays that we have been accustomed to them already   And this is really sad  And also  I would like to mention the scene where Jonas told Lily that the elephant was real  and Lily only answered him   yeah  sure  Jonas    Or something like that   It kind of made me realize that even now  in our society  there are many people like Lily and the rest of the community  Their community actually mirrors our society  People are frequently held back by predetermined and preconceived beliefs that we do not make room for the  supernatural   as The Giver reminded me   And the word  supernatural  is a very subjective term that relies much on perspective  and we also frequently forget this  It is ironic how in the end  novels about utopian societies manage to make them seem ultimately dystopian after all  as was the case here in The Giver  And I mentioned this because it s my first time reading a utopian novel  4 75I really loved this book  and the only reason I docked it a  25 is because I watched the movie before hand  so it lost a lot of its suspense  But still  a great book     Such important lessons are in this book   It was a outstanding book that you couldn t compare to your world because there no color and right over in our world is wrong in theirs which made it different and complicated  Creepy  thought provoking dystopian fiction  This one proves that you don t have to write a tome in order to create fully fleshed out characters and a fully realized world  or to have a devastating effect  Baca ini gara gara filmnya mau tayang dan di grup whatsapp rame dibahas  Bingung juga ngreviewnya  Di awal diceritakan bahwa Jonas  tokoh utama di novel ini  hidup di dunia yang utopia  segalanya serba sama  diatur  ditakar  dan terkontrol  Nggak ada sakit  nggak ada pertengkaran  nggak ada perang  Keputusan siapa yang dinikahi  siapa yang menjadi anak suatu keluarga  apa pekerjaan seseorang  semuanya diputuskan oleh para Elder  Kalau berbuat salah  anggota komunitas langsung minta maaf dan dimaafkan  Komunitas utopia ini disingkap bab per bab  namun tetap menyisakan misteri yang disembunyikan Komunitas ini kemudian dijelaskan wujud aslinya ketika Jonas dipilih untuk mendapat pekerjaan menjadi Receiver of Memory pada usianya yang kedua belas  Receiver of Memory adalah penerima memori masa lalu dari komunitas  Receiver mendapat memori dari Giver  penerima memori dari generasi sebelumnya  Dalam komunitas ini  semua orang dibuat lupa ingatan akan masa lalu  sehingga bisa dibuat komunitas yang anggotanya  seragam   Kemudian dipilihlah satu orang yang menyimpan memori masa lalu  agar ketika komunitas menghadapi masalah yang belum pernah dialami  Receiver of Memory bisa memberikan nasihat kepada mereka Melalui latihan latihannya dengan Giver  Jonas mengetahui bahwa komunitas yang dianggapnya sempurna  ternyata tidak sesempurna yang dikiranya  Giver memberinya memori memori tentang perang masa lalu dan tentang rasa sakit  Namun Giver juga memberinya memori memori indah yang membuatnya berpikir apakah dunia yang  seragam  itu memang dunia yang sempurna atau dunia yang sebenarnya palsu Ini salah satu buku yang bikin merenung  halah   dan membayangkan  namun tetap ringan dibaca  3 4 buku ini berhasil saya selesaikan di perjalanan 3 jam di atas KRL dan saya nggak ragu buat kasih 5 bintang buat ide cerita dan eksekusinya  Buat yang penasaran endingnya  yang sabar yaa   endingnya itu dibahas lanjutannya lagi di buku 3  katanya wiki      Anw  saya sudah nonton filmnya dan ternyata kurang begitu  wah  dibanding bukunya  Apa ya  penjelasan dunia utopianya berasa terburu buru dan konfliknya pun nggak begitu berasa  wah   Mungkin kalau dibikin format tv series ala Under the Dome  penjelasan dunianya  penggambaran  keseragaman  komunitasnya  dan pengungkapan misterinya bisa lebih oke  tapi kalau dibikin tv series  kayaknya bakal perlu perubahan di cerita aslinya biar konflik konfliknya tetap seru ditonton   In The Giver  a young boy Jonas  living in a dystopian society comes to find that there is more to life than the one he is living  Jonas is the adventurous protagonist that realizes that the life he is living  is not the way real life works  With the helping hand of the fellow Giver  Jonas realizes that life is about emotions  danger and being free  In The Giver Jonas lives a restricted monotonous life and is not able to experience free will   Overall i did enjoy this book very much the characters to me were believable  One character in particular was the Giver  the Giver is a  bit of a paradox  He looks ancient but is not old at all  Like someone who has experienced many things over the years  he is very wise and is world weary  he is traumatized by his memories of pain and suffering which is really similar to those in real life   In the beginning of book it started off dull but gradually started to become more eventful as the book went on  Around mid book is where it started to shift into some excitement  Jonas becomes the receiver and his life and the others around him are affected drastically  As it reaches the end of the book it becomes more interesting  Jonas s ambitions and life is much different from when it was in the beginning of the book which makes it much more exciting   Altogether i thought this was a really good book and i definitely recommend it to others who are intrigued and would give the time to read a dystopian novel like the one at hand    The Giver is a science fiction book intended for advanced aged children  The Giver is a Newbery Medal book  an  ALA Notable Children s Book  and an  ALA Best Book for Young Adults  It is about a young man named Jonas who lives in colorless world where everyone is assigned a job that benefits the community  Jonas is assigned to be a Receiver of Memories and is faced with the memories of the past and whether or not he should release to the rest of the community  I rated The Giver as a perfect book because the imagery used is marvelous  You can picture the setting  The theme of the book would be nothing is as it may seem  The plot is effective because the opening is about a pilot training who was kicked out of the community and how it is the worst punishment ever  The irony would be the closing of the novel because Jonas leaves the community with baby Gabriel  I believe young readers would find the Giver appealing because the plot is intriguing  As a teacher I would have students identify irony found in the novel  I would also ask the children to compare their world to Jonas s world and discuss the pros and cons of both  I did another re read of this tonight after seeing the terrible adaptation of the movie  and I fell in love with it all over again  Allow me to be sappy for a moment  but the more I discuss this book with people  the more I realize the impact it had on me as a child and how it continues to shape the way I view the world today  I read a lot  A LOT  of books every year  but very  very few have touched me in the way this did all those years ago  and tonight s re read reminded me that it s not just childhood nostalgia that makes me adore this book  it s its near perfection  Thank you  Lois Lowry  for this beautiful  heartbreaking  eye opening jewel of a novel  I read this a few years ago  and it was a very profound book  As the story unfolded  I found myself getting sucked into it more and more with each turn of the page  Towards the end there is a scene so profound and yet disturbing that I had to walk away from it for a day  No  nothing graphic or bad in that sense  but effective all the same  You won t be the same after you read this book  I think this is a must read for young and old alike  The main character  Jonas lives in a world where there are lots of rules and no one thinks for themselves  In his community  there is no music  color  pain  no emotions or feelings  Jonas is assigned the job of Receiver of Memory  which is a big deal  He goes to see the Giver and begins to learn all about the way things used to be  like the way our world is now  There is a mix of good and bad  but nothing is the same  The more Jonas learns about having choices and the bad things that happen in his world  the more he wants to escape  Finally  with the help of the Giver  Jonas leaves  taking his little brother  Gabe  with him  It s been years since I ve read this book and I was awed by how current it still is  This book was published 21 years ago and is STILL the shit  It s perfect for fans of dystopian novels like  The Hunger Games    Divergent   or  Animal Farm   I can t wait to see the movie adaptation of this  the casting looks phenomenal  If you re soo behind that you don t even know what the premise is  let me give you a little breakdown  Everything is the same  There is no color  or choice  or ill will  Everyone is polite  well fed  and has a purpose  At the age of twelve all children are assigned a job  Some get to become engineers  birth mothers  laborers  caretakers of the old  But for one young boy  Jonas  he is about to be given the most most honored job of all  the receiver  In order for sameness to exist one lone person must carry the memories of the past  of pain  of love  of confusion  It is a burden no one else gets to bear  As the giver places the memories of generations back into Jonas they both start to wonder  Is it worth trading memories for relative safety and sameness  Was it enough Friggin  phenomenal read  There are three other books in The Giver quartet   An instant classic since the first time opening this book and smelling it During the first half of this book  I had no idea where this book was heading  in a good way  This had what a book should have in the first half of a book  Introductions to characters  settings  etc  setup for the main plot  some slight foreshadowing  symbols  or any story detailThis book  near the end was almost reminiscent to Fahrenheit 451 and how Jonas escaping and how the society where he lived in ACTUALLY worked because I would not want to live in this society  and yet  we could be leaning towards this direction The characters were amazing to follow with  The book  as short as it is  seems to be just the only gripe that I have with this book  however  it never really bothers me  Th length seemed perfect  I mean I want more of Jonas  story and I know that there are 3 more books  The setting and the environment was really eerie at times  with some light and less omnipresence You can t help but root for Jonas and Gabe at the end and hope that they have a good future for them   unless those planes return   O_O  The Giver  written by Lois Lowry  was a very surprising read for me  not what I expected  I really enjoyed it from the start  and I found it hard to put the book down  until I finished it   The Giver  is a story that happens in an utopian society  in which people are taken away their memories and their feelings  They live their lives in a sort of robotic way  without realising that they are robbed of their right to feel and to think  On the surface  it looks like they live in a perfect world  without pain  wars or even changes in the weather  They have their place in the society  jobs and responsibilities  given to them by the committee  It is a very controlled life  full of rules and responsibilities  Their memories of basic feelings like happiness  sadness  love  grief are removed from their conciseness  In this way  this perfect world is far from being perfect  There are secrets and many reasons for sadness and rebellion  The protagonist of this book is Jonas  a twelve year old  who gets an honour to become a  receiver  of memories  It looks like a great position to get in the society  but Jonas soon realises that it s hardly an honour  He will be given a training by an old receiver  of having memories transmitted to him  To start it seems like an interesting process  when the pleasant memories are given to Jonas  Soon he gets the memories of pain  death  injustice  This makes Jonas want to rebel  With help of the  Giver   the old receiver  he comes up with a plan to escape  I won t say more about the plot  apart from that it has an open ending  I really recommend this book  It definitely makes me want to read more books by Lois Lowry   The Giver is about a dystopia where everything controlled by a small group of people making all the rules  In the book when a child reaches the age of twelve they are assigned a job by the elders   the people who control everything  based on where the child spent their time during volunteer hours and how well they do on specific subjects in school  The main character Jonas is assigned the job of Receiver of Memory and that where his adventure to reveal the truth about his community begins  The Giver is a very fast read  it s short but enjoyed the book very much  The author of the book only explained things about the world that we would consider abnormal when the main character Jonas found out those things weren t normal  This is very engaging because then the reader gets to discover the truth about the world just as the main character does  In the book the town Jonas lives in or as it s called in the book  the community  is controlled by the elders who make all the decisions without question  Today there are governments who adopt this type of governing like the Chinese government and the North Korean government  This is an issue because people living in these places don t have the power to influence change for the better  In the book Jonas finds out things about his world and how the government has done some things he thinks they should have never done but he doesn t have the power to change the government and he has to watch as his friends and family stay oblivious  I think this book explores how having this type of government is terrible for society in this world  WHILE I WOULD NOT CONSIDER THIS TO SPOIL THE BOOK S PLOT IN ANY WAY I WILL STILL WARN YOU THAT I WILL BE DISCUSSING THE ENDING OF THE BOOK IF YOU DON T WANT TO KNOW ANYTHING WHATSOEVER ABOUT THE END OF THE BOOK SKIP UNTIL THE NEXT PIECE OF TEXT IN THIS FORMAT  While I did enjoy this book the end felt abrupt  The is no climax to the story really  while the book was never boring there no part where I couldn t put it down because there was no clear enemy in the story or conflict  After the book ended the story felt like something was missing from the story and while there are other books in the series as the first book it didn t get my interest enough at the end for me to go out and read the second book DISCUSSION OF THE END OF THE BOOK IS OVER YOU CAN COME BACK NOW  Overall I would recommend this book to people who enjoyed books like Ender s Game  I read this book when I was in elementary school and decided that I would read it again to really get a better understanding of what this book was all about  At first all I really remembered was that it was about a utopian society and that Jonas the main character was assigned to be the next  Giver  and what that is  the person who alone holds the memories of the true pain and pleasure of life  Now that I have read this book once again and now that I have more background knowledge of what exactly a utopian society is  all I really see is a government that hides there people from everything the outside world may do  it s all about secrets  It s like a parent who has hidden their child and locked them up inside a house and only telling them what they want them to know and not letting the outside world have any influence on what they do  see  or hear  Jonas is really seeing things from a whole new perspective and is really kinda flipping out  does nt know what to do  and at the end notices that he can t let people grow up in that society and that s why he does what he does at the end  but you will have to read the book to find out  A detailed description of a vividly imagined post apocalyptic world  Fascinating  And the best part  Minimal mention of any technology  It was all papers and bicycles  no gadgets what so ever  The author created a future without automation  LOVE it    Long before Katniss Everdeen entered the Hunger Games and Tris Pryor chose Dauntless  Lois Lowry introduced my generation to dystopia  The last time I read this book was in 4th grade  just a year after it was published  I recently saw the movie  so I thought I would re read it to remember the book to film differences  I was amazed at how much I had forgotten and realized things I m sure I didn t understand when I was 9  I m impressed with Lowry s ability to pack so much into 180 pages  These days  it seems authors add way too much detail and have quotas to meet with their publishers  leading to long  drawn out novels that could be 50 100 pages shorter  Lowry paces the book well while still evoking emotion and wonder  I do think it ends a bit abruptly  and I wish there were a true sequel rather than  companion novels   That aside  this book is proof in my mind that Newbery award winners were a lot better 20 years ago   utopia  dystopia  i read this cover to cover and my heart broke at times  worth the read and the questions that arise  According to the back cover  The Giver is a Boston Globe Horn Book Honor Book  an American Library Association Best Book for Young Adults  an American Library Association Notable Book for Children  a winner of the Regina Medal  a Booklist Editors Choice  a School Library Journal Best Book of the Year  and it won the John Newbery Award  With all of that  do you really need me to tell you that The Giver is a really good book  Probably not  but I m going to anyway  The Giver is a really good book and one of my all time favorites  If you haven t read it  stop what you re doing and read it now The focus of The Giver is the people living in The Community  a perfect society  There are echoes of Brave New World and 1984  but The Giver is only a dystopian novel depending on how you look at it  The Community is a utopia  It s perhaps a little rough around the edges  true  but it s a mostly perfect place and it has to be  or the main thesis of the novel would fall short  I m getting a bit ahead of myself  but just remember that for this book to work  life in The Community has to be a life worth considering or there is no dilemma for our characters or the reader Imagine no possessions  I wonder if you can  No need for greed or hunger  a brotherhood of man  Imagine all the people sharing all the world    You may say Lois Lowry is a dreamer  but this is the world of The Community  There is almost no pain  no sickness  no poverty  no religion  no racism  no one is left wanting for anything  and what they might want  they ve never known   and almost no one is ever lonely  I know what you re thinking  Esteemed reader  What s the catch  Well there is one and we ll get to it  but first consider life in The Community The people of The Community are healthy because for the first year of their life they are in the care of nurturers  who ensure every baby is the perfect weight and well taken care of by experienced professionals  There are no unwanted children in The Community and that right there is something to consider  Every child growing up in The Community is given everything they ll ever need and cared for all the way into their old age True  the members of The Community do have to give up some things  but that s not all bad either  At twelve years of age  a committee decides a person s occupation and they go into training and there they ll work for the rest of their lives  so job stability is never an issue  If a person requests one  a mate will be assigned to them  A mate carefully chosen by committee to ensure they are a perfect match for their spouse and later the couple can apply for two children  a girl and a boy  When the children have grown  they ll live with their friends  Mom and Dad will live with their friends  and no one is lonely or rejected Again  I know what you re thinking  how could anyone live with all of their decisions made by others and no freedom  Well  if I may play devil s advocate  I might ask  what s so great about freedom   And temporarily suspend your patriotic programming as an American and really consider it  I m fortunate that God put the perfect woman on earth just for me and I found her and married her  but Lord knows I found a few who weren t her beforehand  There were others I could have married that might just have wrecked my life and made wretched my destiny  There was no committee to help me out and I might just have made the wrong choice  Anybody reading ever know anyone who made the wrong choice in a mate And what about career choice  Sure  I ve found the perfect job for me and I couldn t be happier now  but I spent a lot of years in wrong jobs I chose  And what about the folks we all know who just plain make the wrong choices all around  Their wrong choices don t affect just them  we all suffer  A person making the choice to lose themselves in drugs or other indulgences may claim it s only themselves they are hurting  but this is a lie as transparent as Charlie Sheen s recent claim that he is only going to smoke crack socially  a funnier line than anything on his show  My favorite thing about The Community is how they treat their old  When folks in The Community get old  they are moved to The House for the Old where they are cared for like the children  They never experience dementia or other horrifying sickness  No one is kept in a hospital bed for years suffering alone  When it s time  the old person is surrounded by their friends and their life is celebrated  They tell the story of the person s life and then he or she says one last goodbye and is  released into Elseworld   Is that a euphemism that means what you think it means  There are no spoilers on this blog  but even if it does mean that  is that really so bad  I can think of much worse ways to go  So what s the catch  already  I know it s our anniversary and all  but this review is running a little long  The catch is that The Community has no memory  no passion  and no sense of its past  They have no hate  but they also have no love  There s a wonderful freedom in this as well  but is it worth it  I m not going to tell you and one of my most favorite things about The Giver is that Lois Lowry doesn t tell you either  The best books provoke the reader s imagination and leave readers to ponder these questions for themselves and draw their own conclusions  Lowry implies some things  perhaps  but for the most part she is simply asking the question  Nor is there a lot of explanation about the scientific workings that make The Community possible  Lowry wrote two sequels and I recommend them both and you can check them out if you want more details  but the details are sort of beside the point  There probably isn t a one hundred percent plausible explanation for everything  but so what  Lowry wisely leaves much of these details to the imagination  For example  genetic engineering is never mentioned  but it s certainly implied  And whether The Community is achieved through science  recovered UFO technology  or the wave of a wand  it makes little difference and a lesser writer going on and on about the explanation would be a waste of our time  We know The Community isn t possible  but Lowry need only provide a few details to provoke us to consider the implications of such a world if it were possible  And The Community is very real for the characters in this story  which is was ultimately matters Instead  Lowry focuses on the story  When our hero  Jonas  turns twelve he is selected for the most unusual occupation of Receiver  Only one is picked every so many generations and no one really knows what he or she does  only that they need the Receiver and that it is the most important position in The Community  As Receiver  Jonas is separated from the rest of The Community  He is allowed to lie  something no one else is allowed to do  although how can he really know  He is also allowed to ask anyone anything and he is the only person who will know all that there is to know about The Community Jonas is sent to the old Receiver  who becomes The Giver  and what he s giving are memories  I ve said that The Community has no memory or sense of past  This is because the Receiver holds the memories for them in his head and when he grows old he transmits them to the new Receiver  The Giver transmits memories such as snow and sunburn to Jonas  which he has never experienced living in the climate controlled world of The Community  The Giver also transmits memories of war  poverty  suffering  disease  and all the rest of it to Jonas  But also colors and love  neither of which the people of The Community have ever known because they re colorblind  literally   In order to achieve Utopia  these people have given up everything that might create passion in their lives  even music and  gasp  choke  books  What the heck would I blog about in such a world  This is the most weighty of concerns  I know   I wondered if the people of The Community ever engaged in  ahem  adult relationships  As this is a book for younger readers  I didn t think Lowry would cover it  but she does  After Jonas has an inappropriate dream about his sister and a bath  not his biological sister   his mother tells him he must take a pill each day to remove such  stirrings   I guess I sort of read over that part as a kid and didn t catch it until now  But in our world we have Viagra  and in Lowry s world there are pills that do the exact opposite  I won t spend a lot of time on this  but I would imagine you adult readers enjoy the capacity to have such relationships  On the other hand  that same capacity has brought about plenty of suffering  so I ask again  Is The Community really that bad True  there is no color  no music  no art  no    um  kissing  no passion of any kind  and no books  We who love books might balk at the prospect  but that s because we know about them  The people in The Community have never had these things and don t know what they re missing  Most of them don t even know about death  and just think how much stress would be relieved if you didn t know you were going to die one day  spoiler  I know   But now Jonas does know and the question is what s he going to do now that he knows  Could it be that something traumatic has happened to The Giver that will make this giving and receiving of memories different than any such giving and receiving that has come in generations past  Of course it could  or this novel will be episodic and there would be no story worth telling that makes this time in The Community s history more notable than any of the others Lowry could have chosen  But I have promised no spoilers and even though a few probably slipped through  here we ll leave it  I haven t touched much on craft and I m afraid I m not going to this week  Lowry does everything right from start to finish  Like a work of Mozart  the misplacing of a single note could mean diminishment  but Lowry absolutely nails every aspect of craft and delivers what may just be a perfect book  Her prose is clear and crisp and never a distraction  In fact  I was so completely drawn into the story upon reading this book  I forgot to take that many notes even though I already knew the ending  The Giver sucks its reader in and I read the whole thing in a single sitting because it became physically impossible for me to put the book down  Fair warning  there are some extremely disturbing scenes in the later part of the book that would make Stephen King say   Dude  that s messed up   I m not going to spoil them either  Still  sensitive readers should be aware that you may be most unpleasantly shocked  But remember  it s good to be shocked every so often  Be sure to be here on Thursday when none other than Lois Lowry will be here to face the 7 Questions and check back on Saturday as God willing  we ll have a literary agent here on Saturday as well  By the way  I mentioned God several times in this review  but I also listed  no religion  as a quality of utopia  That is sort of perplexing  isn t it  I never do quite reveal my full thoughts on religion or even most political issues do I  Thanks for a great year of giving and receiving on this blog everybody  And now  because I see I have not included a single passage from the text in this entire longwinded review  I ll leave you with some of my favorite bits from The Giver It was almost December  and Jonas was beginning to be frightened   a great opening line if I ever read one  MGN But her father had already gone to the shelf and taken down the stuffed elephant which was kept there  Many of the comfort objects  like Lily s  were soft  stuffed  imaginary creatures  Jonas s had been called a bear  There s administrative work  and the dietary rules  and punishment for disobedience  did you know that they use a discipline wand on the Old  the same as for small children   Definitely not safe   Jonas said with certainty   What if they were allowed to choose their own mate  And chose wrong  Or what if   he went on  almost laughing at the absurdity   they chose their own jobs  Frightening  isn t it   The Giver said  Jonas chuckled   Very frightening  I can t even imagine it  We really have to protect people from wrong choices    It s bye bye to you  Gabe  in the morning   Father had said  in his sweet  sing song voice   really only effective if read in context  but if you ve read the book  you know the impact of this line  MGN After countless tries  the net yielded two flopping silvery fish  Methodically  Jonas hacked them to pieces with a sharp rock and fed the raw shreds to himself and to     spoiler    MGN  For an interview with author Lois Lowry as well as interviews with other writers and literary agents  check out my blog at www middlegradeninja blogspot com I thought this was a very good book  It shows how a society can be so boring and dehumanizing without the freedom of emotion  knowledge  or way of life  I think this book is important because it shows what life would be like living under a controlling society s demands  If we as humans let how people think of us and the desire to be  normal  take over  the community depicted in The Giver is similar to how things could end up  In conclusion  this was an enjoyable  easy read  and it has a great message  The giver is a beautifully written book that displays the thoughts and emotions of a boy who rebels against his communities  rules  I think that the concept of communities and the need for order is really interesting to read and learn about  Although the book takes a while to get started  when Jonas starts running  the mood really escalates  Over all  this is a very good book  May 25  It s so difficult to describe how wonderful this book was is  Definite must read for the beautiful lessons taught about love and living   The whole giver series makes you think about life in a deeper  more meaningful way  Every word of these books has a purpose  1  I think this is the third time I ve read The Giver  Each time I have more questions and a deeper understanding  2  The big question that everyone asks  Are Jonas and Gabriel dead or did they really make it out  I think they made it out  Son came out and I knew I wouldn t remember enough details so I had to re read all of the series  3  If there is a road leading out of the community  why haven t foreigners come to them  4  How is climate  color  and sameness controlled when they don t live in a bubble  5  Sameness has to be controlled biologically when they are in the Nurturing Center I would assume  6  I know the grandparents go to the Center for the Old and are forgotten by their children  but how can brothers and sisters be so easily forgotten  7  Age 12 is so young to be entering the adult world  especially the women who give birth 8  The Stirrings and the pills for those freak me out  What s the point of a family unit without love  9  Lots of dystopian novels have these ceremonies with children  The Giver  City of Ember  The Hunger Games  10  The twin scenario broke my heart  I cried 11  I wonder what the community is like now the Jonas is gone  12  This isn t a review  More of just brain diarrhea  Sobrevivieron  Solo alucinaba porque se estaba muriendo Jonas o si  oia mas  172 paginas fueron suficientes para plantear un mundo utopico y sus reglas de igualdad y monotonia  Roth deberia leer este libro  o tal vez yo deberia de terminar de leer los libros de Roth  I had read this book when I was in elementary school and didn t remember a lot of the story  When I read it again  I was able to understand this book better and I was able to comprehend what was happening  I thought this book is really good because it gives us a taste of what it would be like without something that we have and we take for granted  I thought this book is well written and that it could open a lot of people s eyes  I know it did for me  now that I try to appreciate the small and simple things of life  In the book The Giver by Lois Lowry  the message is to be yourself and do what you want to do  This book took place in a community where everyone is controlled and told what to do  The main character Jonas is chosen as the receiver  the most important job in the community  He is shown true life by a man called the giver  No one else can see color or hear music like Jonas and he tries to share it but he can t cause everyone else is controlled by the community  The community doesn t know anything about true life like war  music  color but Jonas and the giver do  Will they show everyone true life I liked this book because it was very exciting and kept the reader engaged  Here s an example   Jonas has not been assigned  she informed the crowd  and his heart sank  Then she went on Jonas has been selected    60   This makes the reader more engaged because they want to find out what selected means  Jonas and I both have something in common  if we really want to do something we are determined  Although I m not showing a blank community true life  I am still determined to do stuff if I really want to  This book shows that you shouldn t always do what others are  if you want to make change don t give up be determined like Jonas  I would recommend this book to anyone because it shows courage  One of the best  You find something new every time you read it  So I decided that I needed to read more  after a few hectic years  and thought that The Giver would be a good place to start  since the movie is coming out soon  It was an interesting experience since I had read it in the fifth grade  but now reading it as an adult  it seems so much more meaningful  Technically  this is more of a  response  than a  review  since I haven t finished yet  I m on page 123 and I wanted to respond to the first two paragraphs  which touched me and made me feel particularly introspective  Here they are  In one ecstatic memory he had ridden a gleaming brown horse across a field that smelled of damp grass  and dismounted beside a small stream from which both he and the horse drank cold  clear water  Now he understood about animals  and in the moment that the horse turned from the stream and nudged Jonas s shoulder affectionately with its head  he perceived the bonds between animal and human He had walked through woods  and sat at night beside a campfire  Although he had through the memories learned about the pain of loss and loneliness  now he gained  too  an understanding of solitude and its joy  At this point in the book I m struck by a few things  First  it occurs to me that the quality and detail of Lowry s descriptions of the memories reflect the intensity with which Jonas is now experiencing them  as opposed to before when the apple was just red  now the blood on the battle field is  crimson   She s also using a lot more contrasting descriptions  like  ragged flesh and splintery bone   I thought those were particularly skillful writing choices  I also want to address Jonas s experience of solitude  At first when he had begun receiving the memories  he was disturbed by the sense of loneliness that he was experiencing  He felt separate from his community  but at this point in the book he s experiencing the dual nature of that  separateness   A few pages before the war passage  he describes the memory of having a birthday  and being singled out and celebrated as a unique individual  I find the dichotomy of solitude really interesting  I feel like it s central to the theme of maturation  This book is obviously a bildungsroman  and I expect that the Giver will die at the end after he s passed all of the memories on to Jonas  It broke my heart a little when Jonas was describing wanting his childhood back  I feel like the experiences of loss  and loneliness  and pain that Jonas is describing are what define the human condition  I also think that the conceit of this book  the community that has forced  sameness  on its citizens really works well to juxtapose Jonas s carefree life with the Giver s painful memories that will eventually be Jonas s Also  the experience of reading this book really reminds me of a few others  particularly  the loneliness and struggle in Hemingway s The Old Man and the Sea  and the contrast of carefree youth with grown up pain in Blake s Songs of Innocence and Songs of Experience  In undergrad I had a professor who taught us that the reason we read is to make us more sensitive  Books are supposed to break our hearts  because it reminds us what it is to be alive  it reminds us of our shared humanity  I think that particularly relevant to Jonas s journey of maturation  She also taught us that books are how we see through other people s eyes and embrace otherness   Again  really relevant to what Jonas is experiencing  since he can literally see through other people s eyes   I feel like those two lessons really stuck with me and made me a much more open minded and accepting adult  The other idea I picked up somewhere in undergrad was the concept of the collective conscious or the zeitgeist  What I love about the collective conscious is that no matter how alone  or different  or  separate  we feel  there is not one emotion that we can have that has not been experienced before by another human being  so in that way  we are all connected by the collective conscious and by the human experience  which is what I think Jonas is experiencing  And that s also the really cool thing about books  whatever you re going through or struggling with or experiencing  you can open up a book and find another person going through the same thing Those are my thoughts for right now    This thought provoking masterpiece truly demands readers think of society and the rules and restrictions that help keep us free  and the rights and freedoms that may captivate us  but mainly the balance between  The freedom to make our own decisions  choose what we do with our lives  how we spend our time  the ability to feel and to love  Do we take these things for granite  Do they truly hold us back from our fullest potential as a society as a whole to function most efficiently  All of these questions must be pondered and answered individually  Jonas is given the power to choose  the ability to see beyond  to feel true feelings  to learn and use words that are forgotten or unknown by everyone else  He learns pain and learns death  But in the process finds out about love and true joy   The Giver has been one of my favorites for five years now  and now that I ve reread it I can confirm that it still is  The simplicity of the writing style of this novel  when paired with the importance of its themes and implications  is exceptionally powerful  Looking back on this now I have realized how much this book has influenced me in my thoughts and opinions on the world in general since I first read it in the 8th grade  A wonderful story  one that I will surely repeatedly visit  and one that has taught me so much  This is a very understated  cleverly written book  Lois Lowery writes in a note that she had no idea it would be as widely read or profoundly moving to so many people  in both directions  when she was writing it  I think that if she was consciously aware of aiming for that  she might not have achieved the level of subtle genius she has  Strongly recommended  My 10 year old son and I both read it  Very good and a very quick read  I read it in 1 day  Reminded me a lot of Brave New World  the ideas of a perfect society which don t seem so perfect once the truth is revealed  I enjoyed being able to discuss the book with him and seeing how he grasped the concepts of the book as he read it  It also opened up some opportunities for us to discuss some of our beliefs in God  in freedom and liberty  in making mistakes  I look forward to when he s old enough to read Brave New World and to discuss those ideas again when he s older   This was actually a 3rd reread for me  I first read The Giver in my 7th grade English class and I really enjoyed it  I read it a second time 4 or 5 years ago and thought it was a completely different experience reading the book as an adult compared to as a young teenager  My 3rd reread was because I only recently found out that there are two more books going along with The Giver  I was so excited to discover that and also felt kind of out of the loop that I didn t know it before  So  the fact that I ve read this book 3 times shows that I really like it  In fact  I think it is amazing  It really shows that a  perfect life  may not be all it s cracked up to be  For every positive you gain  you are losing something in return  It s hard to imagine that the way of life could ever become that but then if you think about things that have happened in history  the holocaust for example  and even the way some cultures still live to this day  it doesn t seem so hard to imagine anymore   When I was in 7th grade  I believe  I was given this book as required reading  At 12 13  I truly did not understand the themes and ideas of this wonderful book  Seeing it on the shelf again in my early 20 s  I decided to pick it up and try it again  And this time  I can truly say that it has become my absolute favorite book The Giver by Lois Lowry is about a Utopian society in which the children are giving jobs throughout the community when they come of age  Jonas  who s journey we follow  is given the special job of Receiver  His instructor  The Giver  holds all the memories for the community so they do not have to endure the hardships of emotions and feelings  good or bad  The Giver transfers these memories to Jonas  opening his eyes to just exactly what lengths it takes to have the  perfect world  The reason why I give this book such a good score is because there are some many things about Jonas that I see in myself  The loneliness  the desperation for the truth no matter the cost  the wish that people would just open their eyes and sees whats really going on Truth be told  this is a fairly simple book  seeing as it s target audience is younger children  But I feel that because it is so simplistic and has such an amazing message  it comes pretty close to being the perfect book The read will only take you a few days at the most  but you will want to reread it for many years to come  And just a side note  having nothing to do with the book  the author is such a sweet and amazing lady  She answers her emails personally and is so nice  Such a wonderful person with a wonderful message to share  I thought The Giver was a spectacular book because of all the suspense and details it made me just want to keep going  The Giver gave of so many things to think about as you kept reading  It described a world that was so different from ours and gave amazing details about it  The writing was powerful  beautiful  and effective  It had some parts that you could really feel as you read  For example the definition of release or the burdens of Jonas s job  A strength of of the book is its differences with are world  It was so interesting on how their society worked  I don t think I noticed any weaknesses of the book  Apart from the ending it was a perfect book  I think I ll continue to read the series if they re as good as this one  This would be a great book for anybody to read  but I suggest that people under 12 shouldn t read this book   My favorite book from my childhood  This was a completely new take on a futuristic society for me  I loved every part of this book  I am so glad I know it is a series  because I could not imagine reading that last sentence and thinking that was the end  The idea of a society of sameness where no one is rude  everyone and everything the same  your life orderly and content for the most part  no hurt feelings  no war  no hate  no crime  everything tidy  a purpose for all   seems idyllic  yes  What if the only price you had to pay for sameness was choice  The price of free will  The choice of color  feelings and emotions  Would you still want sameness  or would want to go Elsewhere and hear the music  Read The Giver and find out what Jonas knows  I can t wait to find out what happens next  This book equals perfection  It was waaaay better than Divergent  The Hunger Games or any other dystopian novels I ve read lately  Lois Lowry is a gifted writer and it was a real privilege to read such a simple  yet thought provoking novel   The Giver is one of my most favorite books of all time  The book The Giver by Loius Lawry is a book set in the future  in which the main focus is to keep their past or our present away from the memories of their society  They have also decided to eliminate pain  feelings and even color vision  This book is one in which people in the society are assigned their jobs in the special ceremony of twelve which would be for us like graduation  They are given these jobs based on their talents or abilities that they show throughout their years of schooling  Jonas  the main character in this book  has a special talent and is confronted with the outstanding task of becoming the receiver of memories  in which The Giver would pass down to him and he would hold him only by himself until he is ready to retire and pass them down to the next receiver  Shortly after this assignation his father takes home a twin from the nursery  when he sees the baby might have to be released  removed killed  from the society he starts to pass on the soothing memories to him  This would be the greatest mistake to the eyes of his society  When nothing can be done and it is decided that the twin will be released he decides to run away with the child in an effort to save his life leaving back all the memories to float around and his society to receive them allowing them to feel love  sadness and even the pains of war  I would definitely recommend this book because it allows readers to see the consequences of having a complete control of society  Even though  they try to avoid all painful memories from the current society  it is not always possible to have a complete control because a certain aspect of humanity will always remain  Very often in our society things seemed to try to be controlled or aspects of humanity seemed to want to be replaced with technology  however in the long run this might back fire on us and turn more harmful than beneficial  It is often important to considered this genre of books because it is critical that we understand that there are things aspects of humanity that should remain the same  for the sake of our society In conclusion  many times we don t consider the consequences of trying to change our society  It is critical that we understand that a complete control of things does not always mean that you will have complete happiness  I loved this one  Sad that I waited so long to read it  In a world where everything is exactly the same people have forgotten how to see colour  are forbidden to feel pleasure  because it is not predictable   and they don t know what snow or sunshine are  because they control the weather for the sake of sameness   Jobs are assigned based on character traits  so everyone always does exactly what they are good at  Nothing is left up to chance or choice  It is all decided for them  Everything is always perfect  there are no mistakes  Jonas becomes a receiver  the only one in the community  As the receiver he receives the memories from the past  He learns what life was like before sameness and realizes what he is missing  What life is like with choices and feelings  So thought provoking  Definitely recommended  This  Book  Is  Amazing    When someone told me I should read it I wasn t too sure  The cover was strange  the book looked strange   Everything  about it looked strange but never judge a book by its cover This story  is unlike many  this one is    touching  It tells the a tale of  view spoiler   a boy  and his family  he goes to school  rides a bike and has fun but his world is different  There is no color  no emotions  They have strict rules    Like  You can only get a bicycle when you turn nine  Gosh  I had one when I was five  With training wheels of course  They have to give up what they call  their comfort object  which is actually  their stuffy  imagine  giving it up at eight years old Jonas is special  he is the boy I m talking about  he has the power to see  beyond  which means he  with some training  can see colors    hide spoiler  Anyway  this book  seems  normal but isn t  It s a wonderful story well worth reading  It s enjoyable and fun in every kind of way   So I first read this book in 5th grade  I believe it was what we read together as a class  I immediately loved it  Through the years I think I ve read this book between 8 10 times  and it never gets old The story is amazing  and that way Lowry tells it is so captivating  at least to me   that I can t put it down and usually read it all in one  or maybe two  go es   This book  and the first Harry Potter are what really started getting me into reading as a child  adn I can never thank these books enough for opening up my eyes to the wonderful worlds books can bring you to  Simply Fantastic  An amazing way to start off the story  Some parts you may fin affable some may be tragic I think the giver is a really great book I hated the ending because the book doesnt tell what happens to Gabe and Jonas after they ecasped the community Jonas is chosen to be giver of the community  His job is to hold all of the memories of the community  His and the Giver plan is to escape the community so the community can feel what Jonas was feeling and the memories he got  as he leaves the memories will get weaker and weaker  His community has a lot of rules that you have to follow or you will be released from the community  Realesed is when they give you a shot not with a gun but with needles and you jerk for a little while then you die People who got release were only the Old   people who broke the rules  Identical Twins the smaller one  and babies that didnt grow correctly  Gabe is a litte kid his father brought home The strange thing about this story is that there are 50 kids in each age group  and you apply for marriage and children I hope our school gets to read the second book before school is over this is a really good book  Ithink every one would love this book  I recommend buy and reading this book very strongly I hear the second book is about a community but the tottally different or oppisite of Jonas community  I read this book when I was in the 4th grade I did not realize this was unusual until I was in 6th grade and my friend in the 8th grade mentioned she was reading it as a class assignment  It made me rethink what I thought I understood from it  A lot of people who feel the way I feel about this book  awed  puzzled  delighted  in some weird way humbled  might say that I probably didn t understand this book as I should have since I was so young I disagree No  not because I want to stick my tongue out and say  Did so     I really think that I understood and appreciated this book as much as I would now  going into the 9th grade Now  I noticed some people saying  oh  this book was just so disturbing and confusing and that ending   view spoiler   With Jonas and the baby at the end  Did they make it and the ending is Jonas seeing the lights or did he imagine it and they died     hide spoiler       People  That is the whole reason why the book is so incredible   BECAUSE it s confusing and it makes you think  BECAUSE it s disturbing and makes you wonder about your own life and the world we live in with our point of view  and BECAUSE of that memorable ending  I remember when I finished that book I said   Well this is the kind of ending that makes you think   but it s so much more than that  It s the kind of ending that makes you think for  weeks   And then whenever you hear the title The Giver  you think about the ending all over again  And best of all  there s no wrong answer to how the book ends  Whatever you think happened is probably a perfectly acceptable and probable ending  so when I found out she came out with a sequel  I was SO MASSIVELY disappointed  And I refused to read it  It seemed   wrong    if that makes sense   Giving this book 5 stars  makes me wonder how any other book can have the same rating as this  Except for other classics  Yes  I deem this book a classic  Recommended for anyone who likes to think long and hard even after they close a book and put on a shelf  The Giver is a really good example of  perfection  not being everything that it once was thought to be  In this book it clearly shows that having too many rules and structure can only have a negative outcome due to the lack of freedom  In this book it shows Jonas and his community and its setup   everything from who they choose to marry to choosing and making decisions about their own life s are not determined by themselves  This book at which I disagreed with some rules such as  being  RELEASED    I thought this was very unreasonable and not necessary  However This book shows a great example of nothing is perfect and nothing will ever be perfect  no matter how hard we try nothing will ever be perfect and the harder we try the more negative outcomes will occur   One of the best young adult books that I ve ever read  http   blogmyumyu blogspot com es 201    Whoa I was assigned this book for school reading  It was supposed to be a couple of chapters a day  I read through it in one sitting  I had to  Some books  it feels like I will ruin my life if I put them down  It was so with The Giver I m not going to go into the utopian dystopian setting or the political messages  What struck me about the book was memories  The people of Jonas s community had no memories other than here and now  the Sameness  It was safe  and they were all content because they did not know any other way  It sort of blew me away when I realized that no one in the book had any concept of hills or color  because those were outside the realm of their experience  Things I take for granted  And none of them had experienced love  which I have also lived with my entire life The Giver and the Receiver were the only people who knew suffering  hunger  poverty  agony  war  or terror  They were alone in their pain  But they were also the only ones who knew true joy  love  and courage  They needed the good memories of many generations   back and back and back   to face the pain that brought wisdom  Someone needed to bear all those memories  They alone had the strength Basically  anyone who has traumatic memories  this book will be an engrossing and hard read  It brought to mind a lot of stuff for me  Some pages it was mostly memories of the joy of love  Other pages it was the pain of loneliness  But after reading this book  it s like I m armed with the confidence  that even when the bad memories threaten to overtake me  when it hurts just to breath  I have the strength and wisdom to use all my memories to keep others safe  Jonas lives in a perfect society  There is no pain  poverty  divorce  delinquency  etc  One s life s work is chosen by the Elders  At the Ceremony of 12  Jonas is shocked to learn that he has been awarded the most prestigious honor  His assignment will be that of Receiver of Memories  He studies with  the Giver   a man he comes to love  Within time he learns the horrifying secrets of his community and must make a decision that will test his courage  intelligence  and stamina  This is a stunning  provocative science fiction story that will inspire discussion This award winner is compelling  thought provoking  and rich with discussion material  The Giver is a kind and supportive mentor who regrets the need to cause Jonas any pain  As memories are transmitted  Jonas begins to question the world around him and whether eliminating the freedom to make choices is such a good thing  Among the choices controlled by the community are career  clothing  spouse  children  they are conceived outside of the family and assigned   and even the ability to see in color  All residents are given daily medication to eliminate  stirrings  at the onset of sexual thoughts or feelings  It may be interesting to discuss the dangers of too much conformity in society and what it would be like to have choices made for you  Some of the memories transmitted to Jonas are disturbing  In one scene  two men kill an elephant by cutting off its tusks  and Jonas finds himself in the middle of a war zone in another  Jonas also learns that the custom of  release  which is used frequently in the community    with the elderly  rule breakers  and newborns who are less than ideal    actually means that the person is euthanized by lethal injection  This realization is almost unbearable for Jonas as his father has  released  many newborns in his job as  Nurturer   Jonas also discovers that the last Receiver of Memory in training  the Giver s daughter  chose to be released by injecting herself after learning the truth about the community  I always thought of Lois Lowry s The Giver as the little book that could  Written almost like a parable  it s deceptively simple story delivers some heavy  reverberating hits  I consider this little book to be a significant contribution to the genre  ranked right up there with such dystopian classics as Brave New World  The Handmaid s Tale  Fahrenheit 451  1984  and Soylent Green  I love it because of its simplicity and accessibility  it s the perfect way to introduce younger readers  especially reluctant younger readers  to some pretty powerful themes  It s a book that can only generate discussion and debate amongst the young and young at heart on the importance of personal choice  You fight for it  You don t ever let it be taken from you  Sameness  calmness  serenity    these may sound like lofty goals  comforting words  but they should never come at the cost of the individual s right to explore  question  challenge  choose  Some readers may be left unsatisfied by the ambiguous ending  I have to admit  first time reading it I was a little frustrated  But like any good parable  the ending is probably the best launching off point to a passionate debate of  what ifs   maybes  and  for sures   Other readers might be put off by Lowry s lack of detailed world building  this is a teensy book   a long short story really   and with such a small canvas there really isn t room for answers  mostly questions  There is a lot we don t know   the how and why this community came to be  But the mystery inspires some addictive speculation  especially in the context of other dystopian tales which surely influenced Lowry here The Giver is a chilling bedtime story  as good at warning us and teaching us a lesson  as it is at entertaining us  That s a magnificent book that can do those things all at once   A fantastic book with a powerful message  the Giver deserves the high honors it has been awarded Lowery perfectly describes a utopian world with no hunger  pain  anger  or conflict  but masterfully raises questions about the inner workings of such a society  hinting at something nefarious without being predictable  As Jonas begins to unravel the mystery of his community  he learns of incredible beauty his community is missing out on  but also why they chose to give it up  In the end  he must confront the deep question of whether the needs of the many truly do outweigh the needs of the few  Jonah has grown up in what seems to be a perfect society  Everything is decided for each individual  what career they will have  how much time will be spent in recreation vs  volunteering  who they will be  matched  with  how many children they will have  even what they will wear  There are rules  procedures  and consequences for everything and it s all based on meticulous research  Questions  rudeness  or bragging are unacceptable and the people seem content with their life style  Typical to the custom  Jonah is to receive his assignment in the community in his twelfth year ceremony  However he is shocked to be selected as the next receiver  an honor given only to one and very infrequently  When he begins his training with  the Giver   Jonah is introduced to a new world of color  sound  love  and pain   the world that we experience everyday  He recognizes that although everything runs smoothly in the community  all is not moral and right  He and the Giver come up with a plan for Jonah to escape the community and finally make a change for the better  I loved this novel  To me personally  it had a strong message of goodness and hope  I think that there are ideas and symbols that could apply to most if not all who choose to read it  One of the things that really stood out to me was the way that both Jonah and the Giver helped each other to see reality more clearly and gave each other hope for a better future  They made choices based not on what was easy or traditional  but on what was right  Choosing the right thing is rarely easy  but as shown in this novel it rings true in the end   I don t know why I put off reading this for so long    I decided to buy it at Barnes   Noble because of the movie coming out  but even after I bought it  it took me a couple of weeks to even open the cover  Once I did start it  I couldn t stop  I very rarely read books in one day  but I did with The Giver  The metaphors and themes throughout this book are very meaningful  The book was published 21 years ago and is still powerful and relevant  That sums up just how much of a masterpiece this book is  in it s entirety  A definite recommend to anyone who hasn t read it  I m going to go find Gathering Blie now   Stunning  There are many books  now  that do something similar to Lois Lowry s  The Giver   and since she wrote her novel  YA dystopia has become a  thing   But I feel like Lowry does something different in her novel Something important She shows us the life of one boy who makes a decision  Often  dystopian novels show us the society as it undergoes sweeping change  the fall of persons in power  and vengeance  Lowry  instead  shows us the life of the person that initiates great and necessary change   his courage  endurance and salvation  Jonas has light eyes  can see the color red and notices something is very wrong with his society  He has many friends and goes to school  This all seems normal to us  however  Jonas lives in a place called  Sameness  where everything and everyone is identical  This means the people see in black and white  people are assigned jobs  they are assigned spouses  apply for children  they can only have two each  and a committee of elders watches your every move  Children must apologize for using imprecise language and take pills to stifle their feelings  especially towards the opposite sex  There are no parties or birthdays  in fact they go to a yearly  graduation  ceremony to the next age where a child can receive a new privilege  like hair ribbons for girls  When Jonas goes to his ceremony of 12  something goes very wrong  He does not get an assignment  which scares everyone  especially him  He is approached later and is notified that he will be The Receive of Memories  This job is not for the faint of heart as the last receiver took her own life  Through this journey  Jonas meets the Giver and his life is forever changed  His entire belief system is rocked to the core and he cannot trust anyone or share this information either  His own parents  who have been deceiving him from the beginning make him sick to his stomach  Jonas realizes no one is safe unless you meet the criteria of the elders or the society  Armed with his new knowledge  he makes a plan to flee and save himself with the help of his only friend the Giver  This is an incredible novel to teach in middle school  The kids LOVE it and so do I  The depth of discussions that develop from the plot line are enriching and valuable  When we get to the climax of the novel and Jonas realizes what really happens during a release of an infant  my students are outraged  It evokes such an emotional response and generates such a heated discussion  With this unit  I teach my students about genetic engineering  designer babies and utopian societies  I also teach them euphemisms so they better understand  release   Then we also discuss eugenics  Through the life of Jonas they realize that every life is precious  to value our individuality and be thankful to live in a place where we get a choice   This is one of my favorite books  It introduced me to  or rather sparked my interest in things paranormal  I loved the book  It was somewhat dark  sad at times  Jonas is alone in how he sees things  but once he starts to get training from the giver  he is especially alone  even so to the point of being alienated from his family  and those who would normally be his friends  I thoroughly enjoyed this book  and was rooting for Jonas to somehow best the society tat he lived in  and find a way to escape  I have read this book many times  and I can t help but go back to it  Something that a lot of people don t know is that this is only the first book in a series  The books are all totally different  but they tie together in the end  and it would be beneficial to anyone who read this book and liked it to read the others   Twelve year old Jonas lives in seemingly ideal dystopian society  where there is no pain  war or hunger  Families discuss their feelings behind the dinner table  Nobody argues  Bliss  Everybody has certain roles  people don t have to make choices  however  every individual gets the perfect role for life Jonas is eagerly awaiting his new role to be announced  His life will be upside down when he is announced as a future Receiver of Memory  Due to his training with the Giver he starts to realize that deceptively perfect life  as he had known it before  comes with great cost  The Giver has several underlying themes in it  The story is about memories  feelings and ability to make choices  that makes us what we are   human  We are different  This book is about choices  but also about responsibility and pain that goes along with our ability to feel and own memories  After I had read this book I understood why the old man on the book cover has deeply sad expression on his face  I couldn t put this book down  I am unhappy that I don t know now what will happen next with Jonas and his little friend  But as soon as I can  I will read the next book  Highly recommended  if you haven t read this book yet  Perfect for reread  This book gives you a lot to chew on  You don t get to read a lot of books like that nowadays I m awed  in a sad way  by the world Jonas lives in  so my curiosity pushed me to read on  The Giver  always so kind  gentle  yet always suffering  has earned a place in my heart too  The ending was very vague and very unsatisfying though  I know it has a sequel but still it should ve been a tad clearer GREAT BOOK 5th 6th grades on upLowry gives readers a compelling and thought provoking story of a world where everything isn t what it seems  There is clearly more text here page to page  and the type is a bit smaller  but that should not stop young readers from going through the story pretty quickly  The content is very engrossing  and this would serve as quality independent reading material  The story itself reveals more and more layers from chapter to chapter  and although this is a fictional story  it contains a level of realism that will hit home with a number of students  This story would be an excellent one to use in the classroom  for reading and discussion History Language ArtsLesson Ex  I would have the students think about their vision of a  perfect world  and have them write about it  Then  I d have them break up into groups and share with others their ideas  At the end  I d have each student give me a component s  that would comprise to be their perfect society  and explain to me their reasons why why not  This book is phenomenal  Originally reading it in my seventh year of schooling  hating it dearly   rereading was very eye opening  As a thirteen year old  the topics were completely above my understandings  I didn t grasped the intensity of what  releasing  someone meant or the depth of what it was like to have your memories erased from you or your strong emotions hindered by medication  So when it came to rereading it  I was a bit taken aback the school districts thought it was a wonderful idea to allow a bunch of students read this  Despite the dark themes  the book incredibly captivating and abstract  Jonah is so beautifully written and his thoughts and emotions were so tangible  I found myself thinking about it all late at night  This is a must read  Although it s fantasy and unlikely  it s interesting to imagine if our own government headed into the same direction  especially considering it s current state   This is a science fiction novel  This is one of my favorite novels  I have read it four times and I have seen the movie  I first read this book in the sixth grade and have read it again this summer  This book really delves into what creates inequalities  In the book  emotions and even the ability to see color have been removed from the society  Family is destroyed and so has friendship  In order for people not to have envy or preference  the sense of love and beauty was eliminated from society  This makes big statements about our fight in the real world against war and oppression  The book says that the only way for that to be accomplished is for our humanity to be taken away   Este libro se describe con una sola expresion   wow  Una de mis mejores lecturas en este ano y creo que uno de mis libros favoritos  Un libro corto  pero muy profundo y emotivo  Unos personajes maravillosos  una historia genial y una narracion perfecta   Super recomendado  Muy pronto resena completa en mi blog     In the Giver by Lois Lowry everything in the world of 12 year old Jonas is perfect  Everyone lives a life that is orderly  predicable and painless  In the community of Sameness  every individual has a specific role to embody and execute  There are many rules and regulations to follow in this community  The spouse is chosen for you  your job is also chosen and you cannot have more than two children  If so the third will be killed  When Jonas turns twelve he obtains the role of Receiver  The receiver oddly enough receives all of the memories from the Giver  In this town no one has any emotion or memories  The committee requires one person to hold all the memories so no one can make their own opinion about anything  As Jonas receives more and more memories he soon realizes that the Committee is too controlling  Not only is the committee keeping secrets from the people  but they are also controlling their people like puppets the whole time  If Jonas were to leave the town by some odd ball shot then everyone in the town would receive all the truth  pain  happiness  and anger that the memories posses  Through this action packed book I believe Lois was trying to teach us  I think she was trying to say how a bigger force can easily control everyone and everything so we should do our best to prevent it  This is one of my favorite books and easily a 5 out of 5 star rating  Word Count 254 Loveeeed this book  It was really interesting and I can t wait to read the second one  which is told it isn t as good as this one but still I read a lot of Lois Lowry as I was growing up  but I somehow must have missed reading  The Giver   My newest cousin in law  Jennie  recommended that I read  The Giver   and when I realized I hadn t already read the book  it shot up to the top of my list  The Giver  was a fabulous read about a seemingly utopian society where the people in the society are spared from any discomfort  such as hunger  war  even pain from a scraped knee Each year  as children are groomed to perfection  the Ceremony concludes with the Twelves receiving their assignments  which are similar to careers they will have for the rest of their adult lives  Jonas is unsure of what assignment he will be given  and the entire community is shocked to find out that Jonas has a special task  with the Giver  The last Twelve to be assigned to the Giver had a disastrous outcome  Will Jonas be able to survive his assignment with the Giver  The Giver  reminds me  in a way  of the movie  Pleasantville   where the townspeople lived in a perfect society  but also a society that lacked uniqueness  real love  and color  While  The Giver  has some darker undertones  it seems that the movie may have had some inspiration from the book  The Giver  was a quick read  a Newberry Award Winner  and a book to add to your Must Read list  if you haven t already read it If you lived in a utopian society  such as in the beginning of  The Giver  and  Pleasantville   what memories would you be able to live without What memories would you be devastated to lose  or to never experience Go to my blog post and respond  I want to hear what you think  Thanks for reading Rebecca Uma das melhores distopias de sempre  Adorei o mundo  adorei as personagens  principalmente o Jonas   adorei o fim  Tenho que continuar a ler o resto da serie xD LOVE THIS BOOK        The first time I read The Giver  I was too young  Not just because I was younger than the author intended her audience to be  Too young because I hadn t experienced enough in life to truly understand the gravity held in every word In a way  I suppose  I was like the children in the book  I hadn t grown up in sameness  or been punished for accuracy of speech  but I was naive and innocent  I understood that bad things happened  but couldn t relate them to the world I lived in I don t have that problem now  Reading The Giver now  I can see how our society would reach the same conclusions    the same outcome  And that thought is terrifying  The Giver has always been and always will be one of my favourite books  While it might be labelled a mid grade book  it holds a warning in it s pages many in the world could do to read This book is terrifying  dynamic and eerily representative of a future that is entirely possible  Everyone needs to read this book  These are lessons that need to be learned  I think this book was very intriguing and creative  it was difficult for me to put it down at the page we had to stop at  Although i overall liked this book  there were a few questions and opinions I had  One thing I loved and thought was super interesting about this book is how people cannot understand things like death if they have no memories  The people just think that they are sending them somewhere else  they can t comprehend that they are physically dying and how cruel that is  One thing that kind of bugged me in the story was the ending because you never know if he actually makes it to elsewhere or he just can t go on any longer  My main question about the book was the ending because  since i finished it  I have been wanting to know what ended up happening to Jonas  I have also wanted to know if the memories were released and what happened to his old community  I read this book in elementary school and remembered liking it  I just completed reading it again today and realized I love it  The details I remembered from my 10 year old pursuit were fuzzy  I remembered a couple of the given memories  some of the details of Jonas  selection  and a very short version of the ending  Now I remember it in all its brilliance Lois Lowry s version of an Utopian Dystopian society is brilliantly simple in execution and yet complex in the realm of her thought process behind each and every element  It s amazing how simplifying a civilization can actually cause complex paradoxes and tricky snags to tiptoe around or just ignore  Sure it s fictional  but I believe that in a real life Utopia such as this would be shockingly similar  Nothing is ever perfect I won t go into detail because I don t want to spoil the book  I just want to encourage everyone to read this novel  If you ve read it before  read it again  It will cause you to self examine your own life and the lives around you  wondering how you d act in Jonas  situation and whether or not you d be brave enough to follow in his footsteps  Written for children  this Newberry Award winning book intrigues adults as well and is a fantastic  quick read for anyone  Seriously  I read it in about three hours  and I m not the fastest reader  My roommate read The Giver on a whim and then dropped the book in my lap  saying   Read this right now   I did so reluctantly at first  unsure about what I would think of a book of twelve year old children  I was pleasantly surprised  Lois Lowry paints a world far more fascinating than most dystopian novels I ve read  I love how the use of simplification to help the reader see the underlying cruelty of the city s government more than if it was described in great detail  This is a book I will recommend to children for a long time   beautifully written  so many ideas to ponder gently or argue aggressively  respects the capacity of young readers to question why things are still the way they were back and back and back  The Giver is the first in the quartet by Lois Lowry  It is a thrilling story about an ordinary boy in a world of Sameness  regulated by the Committee of Elders  Jonas and his peers are preparing to get their assigned professions that were carefully selected by the Committee when an unexpected decision makes the ceremony an unusually special one  and in a world of sameness  it caused quite a stir This book was excellently written  It is structured simply making it easy for children to read  but it deals with a difficult concept  Jonas is given all of the memories of the world  passed from each giver to the next  he experiences color and joy and warmth and all of his senses are heightened  but he also feels pain and suffering and agony  Jonas has to decide whether letting everyone feeling the suffering was worth them feeling the joy and seeing colors  This is very symbolic and easily transferable to life  which is why this book is good for the whole child   WOW  This is truly a masterpiece  They often say that one will never realize the value of something until it s gone  Lowry has creatively and wittily made up a world without memories  love  freedom  and pain  basically things that make people alive  And I must say that it made me want to put my arms around my life now  everything in it  people around me  my feelings and emotions  pains and disappointments  freedom to make my own decision  memories of the past  things in the present  and dreams of the future  and keep it close to my heart forever  I suddenly want to treasure them  yes  even and most especially  pain  after seeing what life could be without them  Given the enough courage  I probably would have done what Jonas did  I d embrace a life of unpredictability than a dead one with security  I suddenly found myself thanking God for giving us everything we have  from life to freedom of choice to capability to love  Now that s true love  This book made me think a lot   A wonderful book  I am looking forward to read more by this author   Ma ora Jonas sapeva cosa fosse la vera tristezza Aveva provato il dolore  E sapeva che  per quelle emozioni  non esi steva conforto immediato  Bello  Leggendo mi e venuto in mente 1984 ma per qualche strana ragione anche il film Equilibrium  Avrei preferito che il finale fosse meno ambiguo  Jonas sente la musica veramente o e solo il rumore del vento  Ha raggiunto la slitta del ricordo  quindi anche la casa dove festeggiavano il Natale  Lui e Gabriel alla fine si salveranno o moriranno veramente di fame  Io sono incline a pensare che se la caveranno  altrimenti l insegnamento sarebbe lo stesso della societa  meglio non scegliere che scegliere male  Unfortunately I was a victim of a poor  sheletered  and legalistic christian school education  That being said I had never read this book  It is one of my wife s favorite books and it is the favorite book of a few people I know  I finally read the book at my wife s urging and now it is one of my favorite books  I loved it  I ll definitely look for the sequels    I liked it  I actually originally read the book because it was required for school  But it s really cool  It s about this boy named Jonas and he lives in this future community where there isn t color  You don t see color  Then one day  he sees the color of an apple  and that s part of his ability as the future Receiver of Memories  Apparently in this futuristic community  everyone is polite to each other and there is no sadness or anger or stuff  Each person has his her own responsibility and job  Like the people don t have babies  there are these woman whose jobs are to have children  That s kinda weird  but sure why not Then there is the giver  According to the picture on the cover  he looks like Dumbledore  lol Anyway  he has these memories from the past of things like snow  sledding and other sadder things  Like hunger and pain It s a really good book  For the ending you can interpret it different ways Recommend for those who like Dystopian  well  this society is more of a utopia  but there are problems to it  or just futuristic books  La vida en la Comunidad es demasiado  demasiado perfecta  Sin dolor  sin problemas  sin decisiones equivocadas  Ahora bien  para que no haya dolor  no existe el placer  para que no haya problemas  no existen los secretos  y para que no haya decisiones equivocadas  no existen las decisiones en absoluto Jonas es un chico que vivio en esta Comunidad por aproximadamente doce anos  en diciembre va a pasar a ser un Doce  junto con el resto de los chicos que nacieron en el mismo ano  y le van a asignar una profesion para el resto de su vida  El tema es que a Jonas le asignan la funcion mas importante para la Comunidad  ser el Receptor   Que tiene que recibir  Recuerdos  Recuerdos sobre todo lo que existia antes de que la vida se organizara de la forma en la que se organiza  Recuerdos del mundo anterior  Y todo eso  para poder aconsejar al conjunto de Ancianos que coordina la Comunidad Este libro es super interesante  La manera en la que el autor describe la vida de Jonas en la Comunidad sin dejar detalles de lado ni cabos sueltos  desde la perspectiva de un chico de 12 anos  y  todo en unas 120 paginas  Increible  Sinceramente  creo que lo que mas me sorprendio fue eso  No esperaba tanto del libro por su longitud  pero siento que no falto absolutamente nada  y eso es una hazana  para tratar un tema tan profundo Me hizo sentir mil cosas mientras lo leia  y cuando lo termine  me dejo reflexionando  Lo recomiendo muchisimo  I loved this book  Not only was it enjoyable to read as Jonas gradually gained those beautiful memories that we get to experience everyday but also so meaningful  important and beautiful  We seldom feel grateful for those little things in our everyday lives such as the warmth of the sun on our skin and the beautiful feeling of love between family  friends and partners  This book teaches you to appreciate that  As Jonas was seeing the memories  so was I  and I was feeling them the way Jonas would have for the first time  It was beauitful  Despite the few changes in the movie  I am still looking forward to watching it and I m glad i read the book first  I am also looking forward to the next novels in the series  Despite the books criticism to a point where it or the author was labelled  the antichrist    those people are crazy      this book was just beautiful and I hope that more people can see that  WOW  This story blew me away How could a YA novel handle so many heavy issues  Total government control  the idea of free choice  euthanasia  the true meaning of love    All of these major themes were quickly introduced in The Giver  Instead of shying away these thematic points  Lowry faces them head on  She does not glamorize any goings on of the supposed utopia  but instead reveals the cruelty of the governments s total disregard of basic human rights  life  liberty  and the pursuit of happiness I applaud Lowry for finding a way to introduce these issues to adolescents in a way that is interesting to them  By bringing real world issues as heavy as these into a fictional work  young adults are able to form opinions on the problems in our world before they are exposed to them in their own lives  This ensures that we have free thinking  well educated adults who are capable of handling and working through the complex issues of their world Not only does Lowry inform adolescents  she sparks in them a love for reading  If students are anything like me  they will be so fascinated by this book that they can t help but read the three companion books that follow  each of which deals with its own new themes  all the while delving into the themes of love  sacrifice  and the importance of free choice Lois Lowry  I wish that I had discovered your books when I was in middle school  The Giver is everything a YA book should be  5 stars all the way  Great for readers who love utopian dystopian fiction  Also read  Gathering Blue  and  Messenger   in that order   after  The Giver  to see all three novels come full circle Although I have read this book many  many times  I still find that I am amazed at how talented Lois Lowry is with her ability to construct such a deeply complex society out of simple prose and literary construction  This book was the first novel I read that was considered  dystopian  fiction  and because of it  I have come to love the genre more than any other  When I first read it as a seventh grader  I was excited at the prospect of a novel evoking so many strong feelings and opinions in me in ways no other book had ever done  Other dystopian novels for young adults  like The House of the Scorpion by Nancy Farmer  and The Silenced by James DeVita are amazing novels in and of themselves  but cannot hold the special place on my bookshelf and in my heart that The Giver has  It is one of my absolute favorites March 1  2007 I assigned this book to my middle school students  So far  about half have written saying they love it and half  the ones who just can t seem to enjoy reading no matter the story  responded with a grunt  Personally  I love it  I wish I had read it when I was their age  The story revolves around an understanding that pain and hardship are necessary components of living a fulfilling  true existence  Without them  we re robots that move through time effortlessly and therefore without a real sense of self I ve met many people throughout my life who have difficulty believing in any type of higher power because   if there is one  and it s still active  why would it allow such pain and cruelty to exist   Although it doesn t have any clear religious spiritual theme  this book can easily be interpreted to respond with   Human beings aren t fulfilled otherwise  We can t feel alive without struggle  We can t recognize love if we ve never felt betrayal  We can t feel for others if we ve never been alone  Pain  for those who understand  creates compassion  For those who don t  it creates cruelty  which catalyzes a new cycle of love  inner strength  and deep  necessary  soul searching   A great story for younger kids whose minds are just beginning to ponder these questions  Also a fun read for adults  although there are many other books for us which circle around similar ideas   When I finished this book  I thought NO    I did not want it to end  I was completely engaged in Jonas s character Jonas lives in a community of Sameness  The trees are not green  The flowers do not have any color  Each person in this community is told what they must wear  what job they will have  who they will marry  and how many children they can have As Jonas starts his training as The Receiver  he soon finds out that he has been missing out on all the beautiful colors of our world I love these types of scenarios  They help me to appreciate the many colors that God has created  and the freedom to chose and seek the will of God in my life  I hope that I will remember to not take for granted the world that God has created and the life that He has given me As I was reading If You Will Ask by Oswald Chambers this morning  I read a poem that I want to share Heaven above is brighter blue Earth around is sweeter green Something lives in every hueChristless eyes have never seen Birds with gladder songs o erflow Flowers with deeper beauties shine  Since I know  as now I know I am His  and He is mine  Jonas is finally a Twelve and the Ceremony to give him his Assignment is upon him  However  through all the apprehension he had never considered that he d be chosen to be the next Receiver of Memory  He  and the previous Reciever  are the ones who keep store of the memories of the world  But as the knowledge and memories begin pouring in  they open his eyes to the realities of the once comfy world around him  and soon he realizes that he might have to make choices that will change his world forever This book is a classic for a reason  Once you understand the premise the character becomes so fascinating and the story engrossing  It makes you reflect on your own perception of the world  and also makes you wonder if the world could ever become like the one portrayed   The Giver is a fantastic novel well deserving of the Newberry Award  It is the story of a post apocalyptic world that on the surface is perfect  Everyone has a job and a meaningful purpose  there is no crime  no poverty  no hunger  All of the problems of our current world are no more  But things aren t as perfect they seem  In this world you are given your job assigned to you by the Elders during the ceremony of twelves  It is during this ceremony that Jonas is given the job of the Receiver  the most honoured job in the community  Being given memories of a much different world by the Giver  Jonas begins to question the perfection of the community and it is here that the story begins to unfold  Angered and confused by his imperfect and very intriguing past  Jonas must save himself and his community from the fantasy life that has been thrust upon them  I love this book for the simple fact that it poses questions that we never think about  What freedoms would give up if to have a perfect society  How important is individualism  What is the most valuable gift in life  Once I started reading this book I couldn t put it down  I kept reading to find out what Jonas was going to do but I won t spoil the ending for you  You ll just have to read to find out  If you re into wizards or galactic star fights this isn t the book for you  But if you enjoy a thought provoking book full of profound questions then this is the novel for you  Absolutely one of my favorite books  I have never read the other Giver books and though I probably should given my love for this one  I enjoy that if you read just this book alone the ending can be up to your interpretation  Jonas s first memory given to him by the Giver  is one of the snow  sled and the house filled with people on what seems to be Christmas  At the end of the novel Jonas reaches this memory and that s what saves him and Gabe but you can leave it up to your own interpretation  Jonas made it and they are Safe  or they didn t  I will eventually read the other Giver books but as a child after I read it in school I was hooked and I highly recommend this book to anyone  This was my all time favorite book growing up  The giver is in the future where a society is formed and all the people in it have to follow a lot rules  Every year people are given jobs based on how the act but a boy named Jonas the main character  When he is picked he picked as the next giver who gets memories of all the past life on earth  But finding out people are not living life to the fullest he goes whit his brother the give people all the memories that they don t have about the world  The main character looks like a tall lanky boy who is really brave  Over all I liked this book   The Giver is a book set on a society that may or may not be real in this time and day  There is no war  no pain or fear  Everyone is assigned a role career that they will do for the rest of there lives  All the children are assigned these roles when they are twelve  But Jonas  a twelve year old boy is assigned to be the next receiver of memories  A very rare role  He is now taught by the Giver and he begins to learn more about the real world and what the society they live in is about  Jonas realizes that there is another world out there  that the society he lives in is very messed up  He learns the truth  I loved this book and I love the author  Lois Lowry makes the society very mysterious  She does not tell the reader where the society actually is and she makes you wonder  This book is amazing and the thing I loved the most is the passing of memories  The way Jonas began to see beyond  He began to see a change in his friend Fiona s hair  He began to see the color red  This society gave me a whole new look at the world  To live in a society and not know the simplest things such as colors and the feel of snow  It is amazing how Lowry describes the way Jonas feels when he experiences these things   In every single chapter I was wondering what happend next  It was such a great read  And that ending  Beautiful  surprising  breath taking  Great                    Jonas lives in an ideal world  Everything and everyone is the same  There is no conflict  poverty  hunger  divorce  or pain  Equality reigns and agency is non existence  Until one day Jonas becomes the receiver  The knowledge he gains will change society forever The themes in The Giver cause introspection and an analysis of society  As I read this book  I found myself considering the power of memories and the importance of agency  I think often times in society  those things are taken for granted  which is so unfortunate because  as we see in The Giver  memories and agency underpin society Content warning  none  The Giver is a dystopian novel written by the well known young adult children s author  Lois Lowry  This is the first book of four in the fast paced and eye opening series  In the book  Lowry opens a window into the newly vexing life of a 12 year old boy named Jonas who undergoes troubling situations after being told that there was much more to life than the colorless  lifeless  and crass environment that their community has become used to living in for generations  Jonas  the protagonist  experiences conflicts  both internal and external  After his newly obtained knowledge about the way things used to be in his community  he struggles to figure out how to react  and later decides to run away for a new society with his companion  an infant named Gabriel who was before  on the verge of death by their community The message that the author conveys in the novel is very important  It makes us think deeper about our society and makes us question whether or not our own government has too much control over our lives  Because Jonas thinks differently than everyone else and feels trapped he is afraid to speak out to others about what he knows I personally enjoyed the book because the main character Jonas  is similar to me in a way  We are both pretty bold and outgoing  This was shown when he decided to run away  Other than this  I also enjoyed the pace  While still being descriptive  Lowry was able to circulate from event to event  which keeps most readers hooked because it seems that there is rarely a boring part  Lastly  in the book I felt that the authors use of certain descriptive words helped me to gain a deeper understanding of the character s feelings  From the first page to the end of the book  you feel as though you re a part of this compelling novel and are feeling the pain  agony  and joy that these terrific characters bring to the table  On the other hand  the ending could ve been better  Although the author didn t write a clear ending  she most likely did that to make us come up with our own ending  One other dislike that I have is that the secondary characters  such as the Mom  Dad Lily  Asher  and Fiona weren t talked about as much as I would have liked  Because the book also took place outside the community and with The Giver  the second half of the book barely touched on them  I would recommend this book to many people and different types of readers  I would recommend this book to teens and children because it refers to some topics that may be going on in their lives at that point in time  I would additionally recommend it to people who don t usually enjoy the books that they read and are looking for a shorter and faster paced book  like this  This is how I feel about Lois Lowry s  The Giver  I know this is technically a young adults book  but I still feel that it can impact a person of any age  Absolutely wonderful  This book made me realize how much I should be grateful for  down to the colors we see  Really great  The book The Giver was an amazing book  Living in a community where nobody is different and there are no memories of the past  Jonas is excited to become a Twelve  As a Twelve he will get his Assignment or job which he will do until he goes as an elder to Elsewhere  He lives in his family unit with his mother  father  and sister Lily  His father is a nurturer and works with young babies before they are assigned their family unit  His mother has the job of social worker  On the ceremony of the Twelve  Jonas is assigned the most honored job of all  Receiver of Memory  He receives memories  good ones and bad ones  After receiving many happy and sad memories  Jonas wants people to realize that there is more to life than what they are living  This book is a great book with morals and a great story behind it    Would you like to live in a society where everyone is the same and everyone has the same exact stuff In this story people are all the same and everyone has equal stuff  The society is plan nothing interesting happens  This story was truly amazing and interesting  it was a thrilling read and had the most interesting plot The theme in this story shows how the importance of Being yourself is  In this society everyone is the same the only things that makes them different is that they have different jobs  Everyone has a mom and dad who have two kids  Everyone has the same house and goes to the same school  they also all have the same bikes which they get at the same age They also don t get to make there own choices in life  The theme i think is be yourself don t be like everyone else Lowry s style is Thrilling  The whole story you keep asking questions but you don t get answers to them until later into the book which kinda sucks  I highly enjoyed how she worried and described things  The imagery is really amazing  I would read this book twice just because how much i enjoy the writing style The author gives hardly and background on most of the characters in this book until later into the story  the characters besides jonas and his teacher are really bland and are kinda all the same  Since in this society everyone is the same besides Jonas which you find out The setting is amazing and interesting  What s cool is all of the houses are exactly the same no one is different everyone has the same stuff as the other person  what s weird is people in this society have can t see color and no one has ever heard music before in their life  The society is super strict and weird which leads to a great setting and environment  The Giver is about an eleven year old boy named Jonas who lives in a society without violence  happiness sadness and the right to have choices  Jonas is getting closer to being a twelve year old where he and his fellow  11  s will be given a job that they will have to do for the rest of their life until they have to retire because of their age  Once they stop working they will have to live for a few years in the houses they call the  House of Olds  until they are  released   This story has the best story idea plot that have read in along time  I highly recommend this book to almost every single person  The book has amazing writing and great characters  All the books by this author are amazing as well   I thought the author took the idea of  government take over of agency  in interesting directions  If a government decided it was going to run our lives completely  had the technology to do so  and started with at least some initially benevolent ideals  how would this turn out  This is the premise of The Giver  Read about the events that lead a community from utopia to dystopia in 23 suspenseful chapters  In a community without the freedom of choice and memory  The Giver tells the story about a perfect utopian society where just one boy is chosen to receive memory  Lois Lowry creates a society that is exactly opposite from our society  Within the first few pages  Lois Lowry makes it clear who the protagonist is in her story  This makes the book easy to understand and quickly draws in the reader  In chapter 1  Lowry begins by writing about Jonas and describes his feelings of fear when an unidentified aircraft flies overhead  The reader learns a lot about who Jonas is by his words and actions  On page 3  Lowry states that   Jonas was careful about language   and on page 4  Jonas told the reader he is   apprehensive  that s what I am   Jonas does not like to attract attention to himself  The book is full of suspense  thoughts  and events that make the reader think throughout each page  which adds excitement to the story  it is hard to put the book down  On page 71  Jonas talks about his thoughts on lying  Jonas is told to lie  and then realizes that if he asks his father if he lied   he would have no way of knowing if the answer he received was true   Although The Giver is an amazing read  it has a few  glitches   The book is broken up  and in some places does not flow easily  The chapters jump from one character to another and from one setting to another  This causes confusion and makes some of the story hard to understand  Often the book does not detail enough of the memories that Jonas receives  For instance when Jonas receives the memory of a rainbow  it is hard to understand his feelings about this  On page 96  The Giver says to Jonas   close your eyes and be still  now  I m going to give you the memory of a rainbow   On page 97  Lowry explains that Jonas can now see and name the colors of the rainbow in ordinary life  but Jonas gives no exciting thoughts about his new memory  The reader is left hanging without knowing whether or not Jonas is really excited about this   Fiction and fantasy at it s best  The Giver includes foreshadowing which gives the reader a feeling of excitement from chapter to chapter  The story twists and turns  which makes the reader really think about what might happen next  The Giver is an easy read for middle school readers because the language is not difficult to understand  yet it is suspenseful and advanced enough not to bore high school readers  I would highly recommend this book to a friend because even though it is short  it contains a lot of excitement  suspense  and entertainment  It is a unique and likeable book  and definitely a page turner  I give The Giver 5 5 stars  If you like the feeling of excitement and fantasy  then you will love the book The Twenty One Balloons as much as The Giver  Although the plot is completely different  it has the same feeling of intensity and of wondering what will happen next  Once you finish The Giver  don t give up  Continue on and read The Twenty One Balloons  Lois Lowry s Newberry award winning book The Giver is a very powerful and very controversial book about a family in a utopian community and a young boys becoming consciously aware of what kind of controlled environment he is in  and wants to make a change  He needs to make a very important decision to decide if having free choice  opinion and feelings is worth the risk  The main character in the book is Jonas  He is currently preparing for the ceremony of 12 when he is given his new assignment  He lives with his Mother  Father  and sister in a very controlled environment  He and his family live in a society where everyone is the same  and life is governed by strong rigid rules that resist change and having any sort of opinion is forbidden  The Community where Jonas lives in controls every aspect of their life  The society controls every word they say  and are required to share dreams and feelings each evening at family dinner meals  When everyone reaches the age of 12  they are given a ceremony and given a new assignment and this is when they turn into adulthood according to their society  When it is finally time for Jonas ceremony  he is assigned to become the receiver of memory  The receiver holds all the memories of the community  As an older receiver begins teaching young Jonas about all the responsibilities and what it means to be a receiver  Jonas begins to wake up and experience new feelings  and begins to realize that perhaps the community where he lives in is not as  perfect  as it is suppose to be  As Jonas and his teacher become closer and get to know each other more  they decide perhaps its better if they meet somewhere private  where no one can hear or see them talking  It is here where they can freely talk and discuss their own opinions  what freedom means  and individuality  Once Jonas fully understands the community he lives in is makes a dangerous realization that perhaps the community he lives in is not the best place  He wants to be free  be able to make choices  and most importantly be able to make his own decisions  At the end of the book  Jonas and his teacher the giver make a choice to leave the community and start a new life of their own   The Giver by Lois Lowry was a great book that is set in the future  In this book  the world is very bland  with no colors or feelings  The protagonist  Jonas  was picked to be the apprentice of the Giver and realizes  by ways of memories from the past  the flaw in his world  To try to make a difference Jonas goes through great extent and tries to make his world the way it was  This book was a fabulous book  because I thought that it was interesting how the author made a whole new world and a sophisticated plot that followed it  It was intriguing and made it a page turner because this book was a whole new concept for me  and I thought that it was fantastic  Although this book wasn t an adventure book  it seemed like an adventure of the mind  facing new challenges  and solutions to over come it  The plot of the Giver was definitely interesting and it was creative the way Lois Lowry wrote it because the passages seemed to absorb my mind bit by bit  This was the first book that really touched my mind because the overall plot seemed to teach me a lesson  However  the ending of the Giver was a bit disappointing  It was a cliff hanger and I was a bit disappointed  I will recommend this book to anybody  for this book didn t have a specific genre  I give this book a rating of 5 stars    It s just that I don t know your name  I thought you were The Receiver  but you say the now I m The Receiver  So I don t know what to call you        Call me The Giver   he told Jonas   Lowry  87   The Giver by Lois Lowry is a young adult fiction book that tells a compelling story set in the future  It s based in a community of sameness where every person is practically the same  The story s main focus is on an eleven year old boy named Jonas  The Receiver who becomes the Giver  and the baby Gabe  In the community turning twelve is a big step  It s the last year where age really matters and it s the year the elevens receive their assignment  Their assignments are their new jobs in the community  At the ceremony Jonas was given the assignment of Receiver  also known as Receiver of Memory  The Receiver is a highly honored job and a very respected figure  Since Jonas is the new Receiver  the old Receiver becomes the Giver  Training begins immediately and Jonas finds out his duties  He will be given all of the memories of the past  Memories the community no longer has and hasn t had for a very long time in order to have the sameness  Memories such as pain  colors  love  and much more  Throughout the year of his training Jonas receives many memories  many that are pleasurable and happy  but also those that test his ability  He s given memories of war  death and dark events that occur  Through the memories Jonas is enlightened to feelings and emotions  Soon after he becomes discontent with how life is in the community  He becomes angry that not everyone can see the way he sees or feel the way he feels and how things are handled  Surrounding the community is Elsewhere  That is where the old  unfit newborns  and repeat offenders are released to  In Elsewhere is a boundary line  If Jonas were to pass the boundary line all of the memories given to him would be released back to the community and would be given to the community members  Knowing what he needs to do Jonas and the Giver map out of plan for Jonas to leave and make it passed that line  Due to unforeseen circumstances  Jonas and Gabe have to flee without getting the rest of the training from the Giver  They now go on the journey to Elsewhere to attempt the pass the boundary  However  they are faced with never before seen creatures and places along with being searched for by the community You have to read for yourself if you want to find out if they made it  I would highly recommend this book  It is one of my personal favorites  I love the story and have read it about five times  This book would be good for anyone  I love reading about the inner conflicts Jonas has and reading the change he goes through while he is receiving these memories   This is not a light book  despite its YA categorization  The setting is too believable    a future society that has figured out how to eliminate all of the discomfort and mess of being human  We re taken on a mental journey along with the main character  who is not the title character    which is a little baffling to me  as he realizes that this  utopia  of sameness and regulated tranquility is  in fact  organized cruelty  The story is simultaneously disturbing and uplifting  ending with a celebration of sacrificial love    the same theme woven throughout its three sequels  Highly recommended  La prima cosa che ho pensato e  devo creare uno scaffale per i libri che vanno oltre le 5 stelle  Ma di libri cosi ne leggero forse meno di dieci in una vita intera  quindi mi fermo a cinque stelle The Giver non e un romanzo YA  Coloro che lo classificano come YA deve scomparire dalle librerie ed essere condannati a guardare la televisione con programmazione estiva  rete generalista  per il resto della vita The Giver non e un libro per tutti Ovvero  tutti coloro che amano le storie distopiche con protagonisti improbabili che attraversano deserti sopra macchine metalliche  beh  devo essere avvertiti  The Giver e a un livello molto piu alto The Giver non e un romanzo d avventura  o fantasy o cos altro diavolo vi viene in mente  Ah  non e neanche propriamente un romanzo per ragazzi  Ma qui si puo discutere Detto questo  la mia recensione  questo libro e cosi bello che dovrebbero distribuirlo nelle scuole  farlo leggere a tutti e organizzare discussioni in classe  La storia di Jonas e narrata con una delicatezza e una perfezione di linguaggio che raramente mi e capitato di incontrare  Non si puo anticipare nulla del libro  dovete leggerlo  Non perche ci siano magistrali twist narrativi  no  Solo perche la Comunita in cui Jonas vive  la societa ideale dove non accade nulla che non sia previsto e accettato  tutto quel mondo mi e entrato sotto pelle piano piano e ancora fatica ad uscirne  E non si puo riassumere  e li per essere letto Avrei voluto leggerlo da giovane  perche ho avvertito un tumulto  un turbine nelle viscere che mi ha richiamato alla mente gli anni delle rivoluzioni  del pensiero   quando tutto ti sembra liquido  plasmabile  E  un libro che fa venire voglia di vivere  e di urlare  Fa venire voglia di abbracciare quel ragazzo   i need more  i need clearer end   I find it virtually impossible to rate this novel below what it deserves for its assortment of beauty  5 5   It has also become relevant that this novel boasted of a profound message that becomes prominent throughout the novel  This novel  in its original state  absolutely needs no significant repairs    it solely is remarkable  marvelous  and incomprehensibly great  There are no other words in the English language to describe how truly great this message composed  not finite story this novel has to gasconade  I wish to not dare tell you the story in its entirety  It s  quite simply  a story that needs not explanation  but simply a story that deserves much praise and a simple read  Whatever message you perceive by this novel    is yours  I must say  unlike other novels  this truly is special and deserves an enthusiastic  absolute 5 5 stars Also   must I presume to mention   the novel was quite easy to read  I absolutely commend Lois Lowry s ability to create such an easy to read novel filled with a profound message that can be reached by anyone    as I said  this novel is truly special    The Giver is about a perfect community with no feeling  love  pain or color  Everything is planned and no decisions are personally made  Jonas turns twelve and his world turns around  Everything changes before his eyes and for the first time he experiences agony through the memories which were unknown to the human race  He is trained by The Giver to be The Receiver of Memory  which is an occupation that comes with great honor and respect  His family unit is like all others  one boy  one girl  a mother and a father  His parents were unable to choose their own mates or to bear their own children  Jonas is mixed up in a pile of emotions  of feelings he had never experienced before  Will he escape the great pain of his misfortune or suffer the constant anguish in the memories he must endure  Jonas s main internal conflict was dealing with the misery of his position  In the course of reading this book I made a text to world connection  In a communist country the government controls everything like in Jonas s community where the town committee watched everything its citizens did  When residents know nothing they begin to act like machines  their emotions leek out of them and question nothing in fear of loosing their life  Russia was once a communist country where the government was entirely in control  In both these worlds the people knew nothing  felt nothing and become an illusion to even themselves  I would certainly give The Giver 5 stars  This was an outstanding work of fiction presented by Lois Lowry  She showed how life would be in a community such as the one Jonas lived in  The story went beyond its boundaries to deliver such an original plot  The Giver takes you into a world of unimaginable suspense   Recommended on this site  by Lisa  Sarah  Matt   Keely  Nobel prize winner   Found it at our local used bookstore media store  Bookman s   Bought it both on tape AND paperback    PLOT THEMES  FROM WIKIPEDIA   The critical reception of Lowry s work has been polarized  On the one hand  one finds critics like Anita Silvey  whose 100 Best Books for Children calls The Giver one of the 1990s  greatest science fiction novels for children and young adults  2  3  A review in the Christian Science Monitor says   Lowry s powerful book  simply and directly written  offers an inspiring defense of freedom  Both adventurous and skillfully plotted  this book is recommended for young readers 8 and up   4  The Giver has become something of a canonical work among educators who believe that young adult audiences respond best to contemporary literature  These teachers postulate that  teenagers need a separate body of literature written to speak directly to the adolescent experience       and plots that revolve around realistic  contemporary topics    Of course  Lowry s futuristic setting means that this particular young adult book can only address  contemporary topics  in an allegorical fashion  a point which raises questions of its own   In this view  a  classics only  curriculum can stunt a developing reader s appetite for words  there are naturally teachers who argue the opposite side of the argument  and press to keep older works on the reading lists  5 Lowry s most celebrated and controversial novel has also found a home in  City Reads  programs  library sponsored reading clubs on city wide or larger scales  Waukesha County  Wisconsin and Milwaukee County  Wisconsin chose to read The Giver  for example  as did Middletown  Connecticut  Bloomington  Illinois  Valparaiso  Indiana  Rochester  Minnesota  Central Valley  New York  Centre County  Pennsylvania  Montgomery County  Maryland and others  6  7 Some adult reviewers writing for adults have commented that the story is not likely to stand up to the sort of probing literary criticism used in  serious  circles  For instance  50 children are born each year by the group of  birthmothers  who each have 3 children    therefore 17 new  birthmothers  are required each year  even though this profession is looked down upon in the book  Karen Ray  writing in the New York Times  detects  occasional logical lapses   but quickly adds that the book  is sure to keep older children reading  And thinking   8  In a similar vein  Natalie Babbitt of the Washington Post calls Lowry s work  a warning in narrative form   saying The story has been told before in a variety of forms  Ray Bradbury s Fahrenheit 451 comes to mind  but not  to my knowledge  for children  It s well worth telling  especially by a writer of Lowry s great skill  If it is exceedingly fragile  if  in other words  some situations don t survive that well known suspension of disbelief  well  so be it  The Giver has things to say that can t be said too often  and I hope there will be many  many young people who will be willing to listen  9 Another recurrent theme was the very fragile balance between utopia and dystopia  At the beginning of the book Jonas has entire trust in his community  But then a change provoked by his new come knowledge made him see how very deprived the Community and its members were of all  real  life  Throughout the book the reader is led to wondering whether an actual utopia exists      While reading The Giver by  Lois Lowry one learns that one has to do what is right  The book takes place in the future when twelve year old Jonas lives in a perfect world where everyone is the same  In his community everyone lives in a house that is identical to all the others  everyone wears the same clothes  everyone eats the same food  everyone is the same  When the Ceremony of Twelve arrives Jonas worries  The Ceremony of Twelve is when you get assigned what job you will have for the rest of your life  The jobs are chosen based on what their skills and their likes are  Jonas is chosen to be the Receiver  The Receiver of memory is a rarely given job  Jonas starts his job the very next day where he meets the old receiver now known as the Giver  He learns that the Receiver receives memories from the Giver  An example is sledding down a hill  being at the beach with warm blue water  and sugary sand which do not exist in his current world  He sees things that he has never experienced before  Jonas learns that the elders will do anything to keep their community the same even if it hurts people    In The Giver I enjoyed the concept of receiving memories from the past  For example  Jonas saw a boat floating on clear water  I also like how their is no color in their world  an example from the test is   something changed with the apple I don t know what happened   I thought it was a interesting part in the story  However  I didn t like how the elders were so obsessed with making the community perfect  An example is that they kill infants if he she is a twin  I think this book is a lot like Divergent by  Veronica Roth  I think this because they are both about rebels trying to change the way of life  Also both of the main characters are  different  from the rest of the people in their word  An example is the main character in Divergent is divergent which is not good  In The Giver Jonas is the one person in ten years to be the new receiver  You would really like this book if you like books that are kind of scientific and have logic but still fantasy  Amazing  The world reminded me of a happy District Twelve  but you couldn t make me live there for the world  No color  no music    the truth about a  perfect community   Loved this one  but never could get started on Gathering Blue  All of the memories that Jonas receives are of our time  the stuff we do  Made me realize the good we have  I love me a young adult aimed dystopian  ei  Hunger Games  1984  Brave New World  and this one was beautifully written in a way that makes you feel like you can SEE the story  Highly recommended  I recently finished The Giver by  Lois Lowry  This book is science fiction and takes place in the future  The Giver is about a boy named Jonas who just turned 12 and was chosen to have the job of receiver for the rest of his life  At first he was okay with his job  but then he had second thoughts about his job  For example  the Giver made his work harder by making him receive more memories then he could handle  Jonas tries to leave his job  but decides to stick with it and has a fun time  My favorite part is when they announce the assignments and they talk about Jonas s best friend Asher and the mistake that he made of saying  can I have my smack  instead of  can I have my snack   I would recommend this book to people who like reading about the future and science fiction  I never had to read this book in school  I wish I had  It is easy to see why it s studied in schools and why it s considered a classic  There is so much to discuss This is not the type of book you can review  it s the type you need to discuss in detail  This was a quick read  but is best taken slowly so you can absorb everything that is going on I loved how Jonas is a unique child in a world of Sameness  Everything seems normal at first glance  but as Jonas slowly receives memories  you learn that his world is devoid of so much that we take for granted This is an amazing book that a review cannot do justice for  I might need to visit a high school just so I can take part in discussion about it  This is absolutely my favorite book since I ve read it when I was 11  I like the author style  although is quite simple  too much sometimes  but it s in this simplicity that the reader could understand the precariousness of Jonas s community  the absence of free will and of emotions are well descripted and  reading more times this book  the reader could understand it better and catch new aspects  Since I read it for the first time  it s impossible not to cry during the killing of the twin  One of the best utopia  easy to read but full of significant and it makes you to reflect upon yourself and your society as well  As the movie is coming out in a few months  and being as it is somewhat of a classic  I decided to give The Giver a try   That being said  I started the book at noon and finished it at three that same day  It was a very interesting and moving read  The characters were beautifully written in accordance to the plot  The Giver and Jonas being very deep and complex with a plentiful amount of raw emotion while  in stark contrast  the other members of their community are flat and two dimensional just as they should be  I think there is an underlying question throughout the whole story  it s one I repeatedly asked myself anyway  the question being   Is having all these emotions and feelings  Love  joy  and countless others  worth the horrors that associate with them  For you cannot feel loss without having loved something first  This story is incredible in that it makes you think about what is most important and what you d be willing to sacrifice for it  Jonas and the Giver find that feeling  in every sense  through pain and affliction  sheer joy and love is so worth being somewhat shunned from others  They understand that emotions in their entirety are a beautiful privilege and very much worth fighting for   Man  I can t believe it took me so long to read this book As a fan of post apocalyptic and dystopian literature  Lowry s award winning book is right up my alley  but despite many recommendations I never seemed to get around to picking it up  I think the title may have thrown me  For a long time  I didn t realize that it was dystopian  I think the title  while perfect for the book once you ve begun reading it  doesn t clue in the unfamiliar with the books subject matter  That s my story and I m sticking to it And boy  how about that ending  huh  I won t spoil it  as that would be needlessly cruel and rob the reader of an incredibly controversial  yet undeniably powerful set of ending images that opens up all manner of discussion  I found the ending to be powerful  satisfying  even if it went against my expectations  It s possible that the flirting with and ultimate denial of expectations in a way that can lead the reader to believe that expectations may have been fulfilled is what makes it so powerful  If you can follow my mangled logic in that sentence The society that Lowry creates is fascinating  and kept me engaged even as the reality of it began to cause my flesh to creep  The implications of Lowry s world stayed with me long after I d finished the book Good stuff  and highly recommended  It was actually pretty dark in a sense  I loved the description of color  Jonah had no idea how to describe it  which is what I would describe color as  indescribable  In my opinion this describes human nature and suppressing it  The ending does leave you hanging  SPOILER UP AHEAD BE WARNED WTF HAPPENED   Is he dead  did he really make it that unknown place idk  ___  i wish i knewgreat book though  D  I really liked this book The post is made up  but the character s seem real  The main characters are the giver and the receiver  Jonas  They both seem real because the way they talk and act are real ways  I really liked this book I hope you will read this and write a review on it  so I can see if you liked it  I think this book will be interesting not only for boys also for girls  I like it so much  The main characters are very mysterious  but exciting at the same time  When you re reading  you can t stop  because it becomes more and more absorbing  There is a BIG message  so I suggest you to read this book  loved it   Reread 1   Review to come   This was my first read of Lois Lowry s Newbery medal winning novel  The Giver  This young adult novel takes on many intriguing and thought provoking topics that are  often at times  very disturbing  Lowry seems to hit you with a ton of bricks as she questions rules order  how choices are made  the relationship between past and future  isolation  and awareness  The world she creates in The Giver begs the question   is a utopia freedom   The main character  Jonas  and the Giver are the only ones different from the exhausted  sameness  in this utopia without fear  pain  or war  They have a special privileged to see the hidden absence of love  choice  and individualism  By repressing the memories of the past  the community seeks to control the future of human kind and prevent the blunders and pain of the past  The Giver provides social commentary on the debate between freedom or safety  Do we  as a society  want to promote individualization or sacrifice that for the greater universal good  Lowry s novel also suggests that our society may be a bit hyper sensitive on many subjects nowadays consistently changing aspects so that nobody feels offended  The novel has a history of being banned in many schools but as a future educator  I see the value that The Giver brings to the lives of young adolescents  The novel challenges the notion that there is not always a black or white answer for every situation in life and that majority of the answers will be within the gray area  A Utopian society without individualization  love  or choice is no utopia at all  Parts of The Giver may make you laugh and others with shock and appall you  but regardless  Lowry will make you question just how far we are able to take our freedom in our society without causing too much trouble  I absolutely just loved this book  I read it already because I read her book  Number the Stars  when I was in 5th grade  This book made me think and realize how our society could become like Jonas s  I can t spoil all the story so I ll give you a brief information about this book  this is a story about a perfect society where you are assigned jobs and families to live with  This is all I ll tell but I truly recommend it to Young Adults  Have fun enjoying  but it might be bad because it does not have a clear ending  Son read this last year in school  Even now he will mention something from the book  I  mom  need to reread it so we can talk about it  I haven t read it since I was in school years ago  A classic   Jonas lives with his father  mother  and sister in the future in a community of  sameness  where there are no feelings  colors  diversity  conflict  choices  independence  At 12 you are assigned to your job  But Jonas is instead selected to be the next Giver  a person who has the lost memories of love  fear  courage  pain  grief  joy  etc  In the year of his training  Jonas realizes how meaningless life is without these feelings and he realizes that when people are  released  to Elsewhere  that it is all a lie  There are parallels of the Giver to Jesus but I doubt that that is discussed with the intended young adult reader  The ending is vague implying that Jonas and the newchild he takes with him may or may not have a future  That is probably the best ending and would lead to a lot of discussion about what is human life  how does it differ from other life  why do we have memories  why is it important to suffer as well as have pleasure and happiness  what is the meaning of the end  This would be a great book for any book club and for any age reader  Can t wait to see the new movie coming out   OMG this book is amazing     This book is definitely a have to read  If you love dystopian books then this is for you  This book is one of the most interesting books I have ever read  It was definitely different than the books I like  but I really enjoyed it  The main character is a boy named Jonas  He lives a very perfect life  Everything is exactly how it should be  Everyone is assigned their role in the community and everyone follows all the rules  When Jonas finally turns twelve years old he is awarded his role of the community  which leaves him singled out and alone  His training and new life from twelve and beyond is all private  no one can know much about his life as The Receiver of Memory  The Giver  an older man  that beholds all the memories from true pain to all pleasure of life shares his knowledge with Jonas  Jonas learns as much as he can and it all comes down to the truth  The only question is  can Jonas handle it without backing down  I recommend this book to any teenager or young adult  mainly because the story can be kind of hard to understand  the plot and theme is hard to identify because it is not very realistic  You really have to be able to put yourself in the image it gives  I do not recommend this book to any young children  I think the reading level could be too difficult  Overall it was a very good book  I am very happy that I read it   Wow I m not sure why I didn t reread this sooner  it really is perfect Let me blabber about how good this book is It s short and sweet The ending is ambiguous  which is a trait I didn t catch until the second time around   view spoiler   When Jonas reaches the hill with the sled on it  it is very possible that he was dreaming  for the sled was a memory   hide spoiler  The people who made this dystopian world dystopian aren t simply sociopaths like in The Hunger Games  Lowry writes in a certain way that explains that there are no real villains  per se  just people who mistook lack of freedom for safety  You can see why they did what they did  it s even   dare I say it   understandable The writing style is INCREDIBLE  Lowry makes you see what she wants you too  her vision is given too you on a silver platter that you have no choice but to absorb as a whole The plot is so efficient  there s no info dumps  there s no clear romantic sub plot  It gives the necessary information when it is needed to benefit the story  no sooner or later  making the story healthy and vibrant in a way This book is simply wonderful  if I had to think of a flaw  it would be that I had to read it twice to fully understand the ambiguous ness of it all  but maybe that s how Lowry wanted readers to ride out the experience Read it  please  just read it  I got the ebook for this last night after seeing the trailer for the movie and not remembering some of the strange things that had been in the trailer  Based on the trailer I can see some of the changes they did from the book  which I had read in a matter of two hours  I remember this book taking longer to read when I was in school as a kid It is a great book and tells an interesting story about how life could be if everyone was the same  I couldn t put it down and couldn t believe I had finished it so quickly  I was slightly disappointed by the ending of the book because it left so many questions unanswered  but I read earlier that the fourth book in the quartet is supposed to revisit Jonas and Gabe so I will have to get that book now to read With years between readings in reflection I am slightly surprised at this book having been a required book for me in school  While it is great for discussion there are many facets of the book that a middle school child usually won t grasp  but only because they require life experience to understand  Genre  Modern Fantasy Science FictionLexile  760Age  Middle SchoolThe Giver is written from the point of view of Jonas  a 12 year old boy in a futuristic society that has managed to get rid of pain  dispair  color  hate  etc  Everyone is the same and has all decisions made for them  At the age of 12  children receive their job assignment from the community Elders  Jonas is assigned the title of Receiver of Memory  a very highly regarded assignment  He works as somewhat of an apprentice under the current Receiver that asks Jonas to call him  The Giver   Jonas soon begins to realize the rich  meaningful life he has missed out on and devises a plan along with the Giver to open the eyes of his community members and save one of the less fortunate members who  because he is different  is going to be  released  I highly recommend this book to students  It is a great opportunity to have students begin to think about the pros and cons of government and also to feel responsible to stand up for what they feel is right  I found myself completely entranced with the alternate reality within The Giver  The Giver is a great tool to teach children to question the norms of society   This was the most heartbreaking  moving book i ve ever read in my life  I m usually never a movie book crier  but in this one tears did sting  however brief  The ending was horrifying  but perfect  and yet i type this with a sigh    This book was truly amazing and interesting  It was different than what I read in books  In some places it made me feel like I was in the book  The moments were touching and important to recognize  If you read this book and you do not feel touched  you might feel this book to be just another book  This book is truly touching and a little bland in the beginning  But this reason is for the author just telling us what the main characters world is going through at this point of time  This book is very very touching  I read this childrens young adult science fiction book for the first time as an adult  and I think it can be enjoyed by everyone 9 and up  It s a very thought provoking  character driven science fiction book  I think it s a perfect book for discussion because it touches on so many deep issues  It reminds me a little of Madeleine L Engle s masterpiece A Wrinkle in Time in its exploration of the worth of depth of feelings vs  numbness  individuality vs  sameness  community vs  isolation  control vs  freedom I cared about the Jonas and his life  and was emotionally invested in some of the other characters too   The alternate future society shown is fascinating and disturbing  and a little too believable for comfort Some readers complain about the open ended ending in this book but I like how the author leaves some things up to the readers  imaginations  I have an ending in my mind and other readers will have different interpretations  On a reread a decade and a half after my first reading  I found I wanted more detail in the middle  not the end  of the book  However  I think perhaps it s written just right for the middle school audience  it doesn t go into as much depth as some adult novels but it s not inferior in the slightest in my opinion  It s a wonderful introductory dystopian fiction novel On my reread I did notice one thing that I d love to ask Lois Lowry about  Jonas seems to know one word that perhaps he would not know and I m curious about that    Memories need to be shared   is what Jonas was told by his mentor in The Giver by Lois Lowry  Jonas  the main character  has the most important job in society because he deals with memories from the past  The Giver transfers these recollections to him  claiming it is not the pain of remembrance which makes memories despondent  but the loneliness of them  Jonas has the burden of carrying these memories until the time is right to use them  Every member in this dystopian community is assigned a specific job  varying from Nurturer to Birthmother  etc  Jonas is given the new job of being the Receiver of Memories  The Giver passes down recollections to him from generations past experienced from multiple points of views  Jovial memories and heart wrenching reminisces Jonas is forced to cope with firsthand  He is the only one in the community who can see in color and who has felt true love  despair  starvation  and happiness  The Giver referred to their society as Sameness  These new feelings and emotions almost take Jonas to the breaking point  but at the same time he cherishes them and pities everyone who lives without them  Jonas is a strong  independent person who is capable of fulfilling his duty as the new Giver  Once Jonas is acclimated to the memories  he and the Giver devise a plan for him to escape to Elsewhere so they can be released on the people  which is necessary in order for them to be changed  He escapes with Gabe  the child who his father had been nurturing and planning on Releasing in one day  The ending of The Giver is left for the reader to decide  which makes it a beautiful novel  One of the important themes of this book is that everyone sees things from their own unique perspectives  Jonas and Gabe are traveling downhill on a sled from Jonas s first memory he received  According to Lowry   For the first time  he heard something he knew to be music     Behind him  across vast distances of space and time  from the place he had left  he thought he heard music too  But perhaps  it was only an echo   A person can interpret it either way  Jonas could die because Lowry says       the wind whipped at his face as they sped in a straight line through an incision that seemed to lead to the final destination  the place that he always felt was waiting  the Elsewhere that held their future and their past   This could mean another dimension like heaven  or it could also be a precognitive memory  Either way  Jonas reaches the unknown Elsewhere  There are dominating themes and morals to this story  An important one seems to be acceptance  Although feeling emotions is always painful  it is worth having fond and bad memories when love can be found amongst them  It is quite similar to the saying    Tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all   The majority of the people in the community in this book are bland  apathetic characters who have not known anything but Sameness  They have chosen this path because not only is it the only one seemingly available to them  but also because they would rather feel nothing than sadness  A lot of people are like this today  trying to avoid what is bad  but also not realizing they are taking all of the good with it  The Giver has thousands of important messages written in the black printed words of its pages  but the most important one seems to be that memories are perpetual  At first  Jonas is terrified to receive the variations of memories when their burden is inflicted upon him  Eventually  the time was right and they were released to everyone when he disappeared  Whatever happened to Jonas  the memories will always survive as long as someone has them  When someone dies  their heart  or memory is still eternal  As the Giver says   If you were to be lost in the river  Jonas  your memories would not be lost with you  Memories are forever    Very well written  The imaginary world and the rules that the world follows are well brought before the eyes of the readers  I have it as audio book  This is one of my favourites  Annotation This science fiction chapter book takes place sometime in the future  in a supposedly utopian community that s part of a larger utopian society  The protagonist main character  Jonas  is assigned the job of the Receiver at the Ceremony of Twelve  The story is told by an unknown third person narrator whose point of view is restricted to what Jonas thinks and observes  Jonas  society has been stripped of their memory of the past  so the people do not feel love  pain  loss  or grief  The engineered society is controlled by a select few who decide the career paths  spouses  and children that are given to the community members  The characters include  Jonas  his best friend Asher  his sister  mother  father  baby Gabe  and the Giver The problem occurs when Jonas starts receiving memories from the Giver  He realizes how great it is to see color and feel emotions like love  passion  and joy  He understands the meaning of family and the importance of memory and individuality  He begins to question what is really important in order to remain human  He realizes that although the community is free of hardship  they are also free from choices and individuality  This shows the negative implications of social planning and the importance of individuality  Jonas realizes that one cannot have pleasure and hope without pain and loss  When he learns the meaning of death  which has been shielded from the community  he realizes that there needs to be a change in the community  He and the Giver then conspire to give Jonas  memories to the whole community to share  and Jonas runs away with baby Gabe  who was going to be killed if he stayed in the community  Jonas  memories would be lost and given to the community if he ever left  The theme of courage can be seen when Jonas and baby Gabe almost die trying to escape  and the story ends ambiguously with Jonas and Gabe possibly finally arriving at another community nearby  Response I gave this book five stars  because I truly loved it  The writing was rich and descriptive  and the story was consistent  The book embodied quality  because the plot was convincing  and the characters were believable  The story causes the reader to wonder and think about values  stretching their imagination  The themes of the importance of memory  individuality  courage  and hope are seen in the story  but they are not too obvious  This made for a really enjoyable read What I noticed most about the book was how I could not put it down  The writing was rich  and the story flowed really well  I always wanted to see what would happen next  I think the science fiction genre really allows the reader to use their imagination and broaden their values  The story was exciting and kept me interested throughout the entire book  The writing gets even better at the end  when Lowry leaves the reader with an unclear ending  This lets the reader interpret the ending how they see fit  Although it was a frustrating end to the story  I like how the reader is forced to really think about what could have possibly happened  Classroom Connections One activity would be to have the students write and then discuss their own ideas of a utopian society  This would allow them to practice their writing as well as compare their ideas with others  It would allow them to develop a deeper understanding of the story and realize the importance of individuality and having choices  They could also create pictures that depict their understanding of the ending of the story  This would also allow them to develop and deeper understanding of the story and stretch their imagination  After drawing their pictures  they could discuss their ideas with the class Text Complexity The Lexile for this book is 760  and its Guided Reading Level is Y  It would be interesting as a read aloud for students in grades 3 6  and a sixth grade student would be able to read the text independently  The book The Giver by Lois Lowry is in interesting story about a young boy named Jonas who lives in a Utopian society free of danger and sorrow  In the book  when you turn 12  children are assigned jobs that they train for and continue to do for the rest of their lives  Elements of your life are chosen for you such as your parents  spouse  and friends  Jonas is different from everyone because he is given the job of being the new receiver  Society has been kept free of all negativity but one person known as the receiver is told about all good and bad in the society  It may not be as beneficial to the rest of the society because they are not given the full knowledge of the world  I thoroughly enjoyed this book because the story line is complex and it caught my attention  liked how Jonas was able to grow from being portrayed as a regular boy to someone willing to risk his life to save the community   This book was a literary representation of how we develop from shying away from new found responsibilities to wanting to break away from childhood  Overall I enjoyed book because I found it very fascinating and recommend it to everyone  Waouw   Dire que j ai failli passer a cote de cette magnifique dystopie    Jonas grew up the same as everyone else  but recently he has been seeing things differently  He is becoming more nervous as they approach the ceremony of the 12  Jonas is selected as the communities next Receiver of knowledge  and is learning all about the memories from  back and back and back   He learns happiness and pain  love and fear  and many other feelings and emotions  But he wants the whole community to be able to feel these as well I loved this book  I thought it was very well written and showed a lot of emotion  That was a very powerful part of the book  was Jonas learning all the different emotions from the memories  I like how as he learned the memories  he started to care even more about the people around him There is a memory about war that has mention of blood  there is also the ceremony of release which talks about injecting them to kill them  The Giver by Lois Lowry follows the life of twelve year old Jonas  who lives in an extremely controlled dystopian society ran by  the elders   During a ceremony Jonas is chosen as The Receiver of Memory and begins his training by receiving the memories of the ex receiver of memory who is now known as The Giver  As the memories of the past begin flowing in Jonas feels very overwhelmed and a plan is devised to release the memories to the public  this will change society forever  However  Jonas encounters an obstacle that will change his life forever  This book is absolutely amazing  it is very thought provoking and is written beautifully  Lowry does a great job being rich in detail allowing the reader to understand Jonas s hectic and interesting life  For middle school aged children this book is very thought provoking and can be useful in facilitating classroom discussion about humanity and structure in society  Another fun idea would be to have the students write their own creative ending to the book because there is no true ending  This would allow the students to stretch their imaginations and allow their creativity to shine through  Lowry  Lois   1993   The Giver  Boston  Houghton Mifflin  Print  I have probably read this book 10 times  I love the way it makes me think about the small joys in life  the things I take for granite every day I just finished reading this book to Connor  It was so interesting to take a book I have read so many times and see it anew through my intelligent child s eyes  He had so much more insight than I did through the first reading and figured things out a lot faster than I ever did  o  Step aside  I have found one of my favourite books The Giver was absolutely fantastic and brought a whole new appreciation for the life how we lead it  In this dystopian future  people live in the Sameness  which basically is a world lacking everything we like about this world I mean  it s the things we take for granted  like emotions  colours  music  And I noticed how I took them for granted when reading the book and being puzzled when being told they aren t there Jonas  the protagonist  experiencing these things for the first time brought me real joy  It s been ages since I experienced my first snow or listened to music for the first time or being told and feeling loved  I know these things are wonderful but they sort of got normality  so seeing someone not being used to them brought back some of the magic I also was suprised how easy the read was  From the blurb I knew Jonas  age  and the last time I read something from the POV of someone younger than me I had trouble getting into the character  I didn t have any troubles with that The book was amazingly written and full of suprises and i m honestly so glad I finally got to read it  I remember reading this book before but I wasn t sure if it was for a class or not  If it was for a class I know for sure that I didn t finish it because I don t think that I ve ever finished reading a book that was for class  Anyway  the movie is already out for this book and I remember some of the faces that they had so I sort of just imagined what it would be like  I m interested in seeing the movie now  While reading  I thought of  Divergent  and  The Hunger Games   I also thought about another book    Uhhh     It was  Possession   Something like that  It was the whole society must be kept in a certain way so that individualism wouldn t wreck havoc on our carefully  calculated region  It s all interesting  So there are three more books and  hopefully  I ll get my hands on those  too  because the ending of  The Giver  seemed to move very abruptly  If I hadn t known that there was more to this story I probably would ve roared because it was such a huge cliff hanger  I m pretty sure that the movie is going to be this way  too  We ll see    SOOOO GOOD  I don t know why I waited so long to read this  I must read the rest of the series   The Giver by Lois Lowry is a book that continues to amaze many readers  I highly recommend The Giver because of the overall message it can convey  To me the book has a unique dystopian perspective that ultimately still relates to the way society is today  Many readers are able to relate to the main character Jonas and the feelings he has toward society  Jonas like many others crave experiences  sometimes these experiences can change a person s perspective  Ultimately Jonas is robbed of his youth on his journey and it causes him to see the true madness of society  In today s society the madness is portrayed by how the youth are so addicted to social media  Social media determines the many thoughts the youth believe in and causes them to be apart of mainstream society  The two societies are very alike in this way that many people adopt society s way of thinking and do not question it  Throughout the book the reader joins Jonas on his journey and is able to discover a new perspective on society  The Giver continues to be a relevant book for many readers in the way it represents the pain that is ignored within society  It will continue to be one of my favorite books   The worst part of holding the memories is not the pain  It s the loneliness of it  Memories need to be shared   I ve always loved this book  I was surprised when I read it again this year that I still loved it  It s the kind of book you hope somebody else has just recently read because you ll want to talk about it   Remembering Lois Lowry s The GiverI was nervous when I picked up Lois Lowry s The Giver recently  I didn t want my memory to fail me   I had built up the book so much in my head over the years  remembering a gorgeously imagined  heartbreakingly plausible book about the freedom of choice and the importance of memory  I was worried that what had seemed profound and poetic as a child would become trite and lack depth as an adult  Luckily  the book  and my memory  did not disappoint The Giver imagines a  utopian  world of the future in which people live in communities where every aspect of their lives is regulated in order to promote a peaceful  stable  and efficient society  On the surface  all the laws of the society seem to have purpose and meaning  and one can t fault the logic behind quickly administered pain medication  or job assignments that take the personality and history of a person into account Jonas is excited  because he is about to turn twelve years old  and he s about to receive his job assignment and enter into adulthood  But things don t go as planned for the unusually blue eyed Jonas  He s selected for a special role   that of  Receiver of Memories   Jonas has no idea what this role entails until he starts his training with the current Receiver  who asks Jonas to call him The Giver  It turns out  in regulating and optimizing the lives of community members  many memories of the past have been wiped from the collective conscious  It s the Receiver s job  gift  and curse to hold onto all those memories for the entire community   of the entire world  Some of these memories are wonderful relics of the past  colors  for example  which have been eliminated in the community  or the concept of love  Others  however  are a burden  countless memories of war  death  decay  and pain Read the full review here  http   bit ly yqXa6E 4 5 stars   I thought the ending came on sort of quickly rushed  where it could have been better developed  It left me with some questions  not necessarily a bad thing   The overall concept and story were really good  I loved learning about Sameness and what this future society was like  I feel like it would have been tempting to write characters in this setting as more  robotic  or one dimensional  like Stepford Wives   so I was impressed with how the author developed their humanity  especialy the father character as a Nurturer   There were a lot of memorable ideas   the nightly sharing of feelings  the telling of dreams  what it meant when Jonas noticed things  changing   the assignment of careers  the development of newchildren  etc   definitely a worthwhile read  Had I read it back when it was first written  I think I would have appreciated it even more  but after reading so many books with that dystopian theme in recent years  I m a little burned out on the topic    even still  this book definitely kept my interest    I could not put this book down  The whole concept of a utopia dystopia is pretty common in literature  1984  A Brave New World  and more recently The Hunger Games   but the way Lowry tells it  it feels very original  The story is told through the perspective of Jonah  who like all children is given his life long occupation at the age of twelve  Except Jonah isn t told he will be a teacher  laborer  doctor  or any other standard occupation like his classmates  he s been selected to be the next Receiver for his community  Without giving away critical plot devices  this essentially means he is the only person in the community who has knowledge of the past  with the exception of his teacher  The Giver   What follows is a very interesting and page turning story of Jonah losing his ignorance  and understanding the world around him  This book is written so a child can read it and enjoy it  although the significance of some concepts might be lost on all but the brightest young readers  Adults will likely enjoy it much more  and find the concepts interesting and relevant  The state of North Korea comes to mind when some aspects of Jonah s society are presented   Highly recommend this book to everyone  its a fast read and worth it   I think this book started out to have less information than most books and it was a little bland  I think that is started to be boring  I didn t enjoy the book at first but when I got to  somewhat  the middle of the book  it was kind of more interesting  Lois Lowry had a good reason for starting the book bland and boring  There was something about the age groups that made it a little bit confusing for me  For example  the age group that is turning 12 would get their first assignment  job  and they would have to stick with that assignment until they dies or until they got  released   Also when you turned 9  you would get your very first bicycle  When Jonas found out that he got a rare assignment  which was Receiver of Memory  he was a bit shocked  When he got the assignment  he found out that he would feel pain that nobody ever felt before  This book was absolutely stunning   I remember immediately falling in love with The Giver when I first read it back in sixth grade and now as I return to the pages of this provocative yet compelling novel as a student in college  I find myself enjoying it and admiring it just as much  if not more  as I did when I was younger  Here lies a story that revolves around a boy  Jonah  who seems to be living in the ideal  perfect world  His world has no pain nor fear  Each day when he awakes he knows what is to be expected  for each day is meticulously planned out  Each day is in many ways identical to the last and will continue to be the same tomorrow and the next day  Louis Lowry s creation of a community that thrives on sameness was extremely appealing to me  and I found myself reading beyond the chapters that I was assigned to stop at  It was a quick and easy read  but also a read that contains many deeper issues that I had not yet recognized the first time I read this story in sixth grade  Lowry incorporates challenging topics such as euthanasia  government control  and limitation on one s sex drive  but she writes them so well and with such simplicity that I find this novel to be more than appropriate for middle school students  And though many may argue that they did not like the ambiguity of the ending  I feel the complete opposite  I like that the reader is able to make their own assumptions about what happened to Jonah and the rest of his once seemingly perfect world  With that being said  I thoroughly enjoyed this book  and I am looking forward to the opportunity when I will be able to teach it to my classroom one day   I think of this book as a light alternative to  The Handmaid s Tale   I can t believe It has taken me this long to finally pick up this book and read  I absolutely love this book  I found it extremely hard to put down and I usually will just read a chapter or two from books and come back to them later  It is an easy fast read  I recommend this book to everyone and anyone  It really causes you to think and will led to wonderful discussions with students or your own children  I also like the ambiguous ending  Even though it made a little crazy wondering what happen  I think I m going to have to watch the film now   Totally one of the best books ever  In the beginning I was a little wary because I thought it was going to be a dusty musty book  But this book is truly an example of don t judge a book by its cover  I love the way the plot is developed through out the story and the tiny little details that show how Jona changes  Just reread this book for probably the 10th time in preparation to read the 2nd book in the series  which I didn t even know existed until a few months ago  I was gifted this book about 10 years ago and it blew my mind   it was still a pleasure to reread it  there is something new that sticks out to me each time  I eagerly anticipate reading the rest of the books and hope that they can live up to my expectations   I am nervous and not entirely prepared to accept it if they do not   I really liked this book because it was very vivid and detailed  I recommend this book to anyone who likes sci fi books or anyone who likes books that are timed in the future  This book is all about this boy named Jonas who lives in a world where there is no color  music  or animals  and there are so many specific rules  No one even knows that there was a time where everything was normal   except The Giver   Jonas get assigned the job of Receiver  and he finds out that the world wasn t always like this  Now Jonas wants to stop it with the help of The Giver   The Giver by Lois Lowry  is a great book to read to with grade school children but also a short  easy read for the rest of us  It opens a door to talk about what it would be like to take all choices away  no pain  no regrets but at what cost  Listening to kids express what they think it would be like to never feel love  peace  excitement  happiness  anticipation  is quite interesting and eye opening  Reading about the struggles that Jonas has as he learns that there are opposites in the  real  world  Life is hard but satisfying  How he handles this new knowledge is very satisfying for the reader    Lois Lowry s book The Giver is an extraordinary  and engaging book that will keep readers reading for hours  Jonas is a child that lives in a society in which everyone is the same  A precise world without conflict  inequality  divorce  injustice  or choices  On his ceremony of 12 he is declared as the next Receiver  The Receiver of the community is the only keeper of the community s memories which they have abandoned such as pain  war  and emotions  The Receiver must keep the memories so that the community can avoid the mistakes of the past  Many of his friends and his parents were really surprised  Due to the fact of how the author describes him  you could easily tell that Jonas is different because he has a great mind On the first day of his lessons he feels lost  Jonas did not know what it actually meant to be the Receiver  Ever since he received memories from the Receiver he discovers truths that the community has hidden for many years  To be a Receiver you need to be strong  brave  have courage  and responsible  He learned that being the Receiver is not easy  you need to be strong for the community who are relying in keeping so many harsh memories Mind blowing and intriguing The Giver shows a whole new world  where not just secrets  but deaths are also hidden  In a pursuit of freedom and justice for the community and loved ones he needs to sacrifice so many things  Learn about the world Jonas lives in and the problems he faces to help his community  Young readers feel like they are in book  in the same world  and having the same problems that Jonas is having  Jonas experiences something new that many young teenagers may have experienced  Jonas experiences something called Stirrings  The community call these  Stirrings  as signs of adolescence and feelings of love  Jonas felt embarrassed and strange when he told his dream that he experienced to his parents about love for one of his friends  People in the community express their feelings to each other and they try to help each other while doing this  On page 10  it states  It was one of the rituals  the evening telling of feelings   Many young teenagers can connect with him because of the feelings that they start to experience in life  This is a great book for young readers because they could easily connect with Jonas and his feelings  Who knows what it would be if the entire world was the SAME  With no color  love  betrayal  and hurt  We wouldn t be able to learn what joy  fear  sadness  and anger would feel like  No ideas or creativity but The Giver give great examples of what the world would be if everything was the SAME   My favorite book of all time  Hard to believe  but I ll admit it  I ve been a middle school librarian for 13 years and I had never read The Giver  Now  I deserve a little break  because when it came out in 1993  I was a science teacher  I m pretty sure I hadn t heard of it for quite some time Now that the movie is coming out  and I was at ALA at the session with Barbara Stripling  Lois Lowry  and Jeff Bridges  I decided it was time  If I want to have conversations with my students around the time of the movie release  kids come back July 28   I better have read the book I have to say  this book is near perfection  The careful plotting  the wonderful language and exquisitely constructed sentences   It made me wonder if there were other dystopian books before this  Several of them pale in comparison  I think there are several Newbery books that pale in comparison I listened to the audio version by Ron Rifkin  He did an amazing job  There were some places where music was inserted that was a bit jarring at times  but then certainly made more sense at the end And  yes  I plan on reading listening to the other three books   I don t know how you can t love this book  It is engaging and vivid and desperate and hopeful  I love re reading and would love the opportunity to teach it to a class   could not put it down  read in a day This has been one of my favorite books since my 4th grade teacher read it to the class  And every time I re read it  I learn something new  I love how this book is written on a level that kids can understand at least that something is amiss in the Community  but as they grow older and read it again  they come to know what and why things were so wrong To me  this story illustrates what can happen when we allow others to make our choices for us because it s the easy way out   we d rather people in authority make tough decisions about our lives  but then we become mindless sheep and just accept whatever our authority figures tell us is correct   just like nobody in the Community questions why inadequate newborns  lawbreakers and the Old are  released   killed   But then Jonas is given the ability to think for himself and  as it turns out  makes a huge difference in his and Gabriel s lives I also love how Lowry trusts children with this sort of heavy material and doesn t coddle them  but she does it in an age appropriate way  I didn t realize this story talked about some of the things its talks about until I was older and understood it more   There are so many levels of depth   it s not just exclusive to one age group  which makes this one of my favorites This is a short book consisting of a mediocre level of vocabulary  I chose to read this book because everyone I knew said that they had read this book in middle school and thought it was good  I never had the same teacher  so I also never had the chance to read this book as they did  After reading through  I generally agreed that it was a good book  It was quite short with not much action and suspense  but all in all  it still interested me to the end  My favorite part was when Jonas was chosen as the next Keeper of Memories  My least favorite part was the ending as it was vague and confusing until I found out that there were sequels to it The story is set in the future  Everyone gets assigned a job on there 13th birthday  When Jonas becomes 13  they surprisingly skip him  At the end of the ceremony  they announce that Jonas will be the Keeper of Memories  Jonas starts training with an old man who is the current Keeper  The man gives Jonas memories of the past  Jonas then wants to give the memories and change the place  so he devises a plan to do this  To do this  he runs away from home along with his brother who was about to be  sent off   The story ends with him imagining or maybe it was real sledding down a snowing mountain  eye opening and scary but an incredible masterpeice   when people have the freedom to choose   they choose wrong  I rarely paid much attention to the luxury of choices that we possess  books like the giver remind me that it is a big deal     just imaging the possibility of having none is terrifying I liked this book     very much   but I had no idea of what it was or the story line beforehand here is what I thought   minor spoiler alert first 10 pages   ok this is messed up  another 20 pages   this is still messed up reached the 50 s   this is so messed up talking about family units   comfort objects   the ceremony of giving children to their assigned family units that should always consist of husband  wife  one boy and one girls and the endless rules that contribute to  sameness  one word    Utopiaor that what they thought    I don t know what you mean when you say  the whole world  or  generations before him   I thought there was only us  I thought there was only now  the giver takes Jonas on a life changing journey  through all the memories of the past    the memories that no one have but the giver himself  There s much more  There s all that goes beyond  all that is Elsewhere  and all that goes back  and back  and back one doesn t simply go back from there and he doesn t       Lois Lowry s  The Giver  captivated me with a reasonably realistic view of what the near future of humanity could hold  It tells about the struggles and trials of a young boy who was chosen to receive and hold all of the memories in a community until he is replaced  What I think Lois Lowry was trying to get across was the lack of a perfect society no matter what humans do  She puts her book in a setting where humans have just survived a major nuclear war and have to start all over again  The survivors make it to where everybody in the community is equal  They give different people different jobs to function in the community which is a very strict one  There are no cars  no wars  no love  and no emotion  The main character realises he is different from everyone else and is chosen to receive memories from the giver  The more and more he learns of humanities past  the more and more he separates from his family and friends  In the end  he has to choose between family and friends  or what he feels right  I like the way the author wrote this book because the way she describes everything makes me feel like I am actually there while all of this is happening  The author is very vivid and descriptive but concise at the same time and the book is never boring  She describes the setting very descriptively in certain parts of the story that complete it  For example when she writes on page 30  He pressed the button on a nearby empty tub and watched as the warm water flowed through the many small opening on the sides  illustrates her descriptive style of writing  This story relates to and warns humans of what could be in store in the future  This book was an entertaining read and I would recommend it to anybody who likes gripping books about alternate realities and possibilities  In her groundbreaking novel  The Giver  Lois Lowry crafts a profound story filled with philosophical inquiry and important lessons about the nature of reality  Woven together with impressive yet accessible writing  The Giver serves as a deep work of literature with the potential to cultivate meaningful discussion between both children and adults  alike  In a utopian world  where every aspect of life is sculpted and predetermined  each child is provided with a societal role  a duty they must accept and carry out in the Community  When twelve year old Jonas becomes the Receiver of Memories  he is confronted by a seemingly new world  one filled with feelings and truths never before encountered  As he struggles to understand his new position and the confusing emotions that rise to the surface  Jonas undergoes a thoughtful transformation that threatens the stability and uniformity of the entire social order  Having been awarded the Newberry Medal  I had high hopes for The Giver  Lois Lowry has a reputation for being a phenomenal writer  so I was initially very excited to start this book  As I turned each page  I felt less like I was reading simple fiction and more like I was absorbing something real and important  The Giver quickly became one of those books that I found myself having an inner dialogue with  questioning each little detail in an attempt to relate it to the overarching theme  In the end I was reminded of some of the classics I had encountered in high school  Similar in the scope and message of Aldous Huxley s Brave New World and George Orwell s 1984 and drawing upon such core philosophical truths such as Plato s  Allegory of the Cave   Lois Lowry appears to create a foundation from which student s can grow and develop as readers and learn to confront the major questions of other pieces of literature  I heartily recommend The Giver  It is a rare treasure  full of heart and hope  This is definitely a book for the whole family  Yes  the plot might seem complex and cold  but I caution readers to really look deeper and find the underlying voice within the text  Though The Giver might leave you with more questions that answers  it is in those questions and the inevitable thought  that true meaning is discovered and wholly appreciated   Estoy tan  tan  tan feliz por haber leido este libro  Es corto  200 paginas  pero al mismo tiempo atrapante  interesante  original y uno de los libros que mas me hicieron reflexionar este ano  Es una distopia completisima  un mundo que no podria ser mas diferente del actual  un mundo sin hambre  sin desigualdad  sin dolor  sin sufrimiento    pero tambien sin color  sin sentimientos  sin elecciones  sin libertad  Y lo mejor de todo es que por mundo no me refiero al concepto de mundo que nosotros tenemos  sino al mundo de Jonas  el protagonista  que se limita a ser una comunidad  Esta comunidad es el unico  mundo  que conoce el protagonista  pero ni el ni el lector pueden olvidar en ningun momento que existe Otro Lugar  Si  en mayusculas Este  mundo  esta planeado para evitar todo lo malo que el nuestro tiene y para  aparentemente  asegurar la maxima calidad de vida para la comunidad  Pero  como Jonas descubre mientras la historia avanza  una buena vida no esta determinada unicamente por el trabajo apropiado  la pareja que complementa perfectamente y la cantidad justa de hijos  ni por tener un plato de comida sobre la mesa todos los dias  Este otro mundo tambien es cruel a su manera y son todas estas apreciaciones las que me hicieron disfrutar del libro  mas alla de que Lois Lowry creo un excelente mundo distopico Estoy pensando seriamente en convertirlo en mi lectura favorita de este ano 5 merecidisimas estrellas y muy recomendado  mbhr  I remember how this book first unfolded to me as vividly as Jonas remembered the apple changing color  When I first read it as a fourth grader  I was shocked each time I read a sentence that gave me another piece of their alternative reality  Each aspect of control and sameness the assigning of comfort objects  the required responses to apologies  the mysterious release  the masking of color had a very jarring effect on me  As I encounter more adult literature that addresses control of the masses  like Orwell s 1984  I find myself bringing the framework of Lois Lowry s book to those more adult works  and not the other way around  I will never forget what it felt like to read about a dystopian society through the eyes of a child  Why didn t I read this book sooner      This is one of those books that should be on a required reading list for schools  It was a quick and enjoyable read  Looking forward to reading the rest of the series  Fantastic book  This book is RICH with themes and insights that are crucially tied to the human experience  It speaks profoundly to those wantings within each of us that wish life didn t deal such painful experiences  Lowry does a masterful job not downplaying the pain that we feel  on the contrary she shows with sheer brilliance that pain is integral to an overall life that is both meaningful and beautiful  The book is compelling in its content and vastly enjoyable as you turn each page  I m glad that I didn t skip over this book because it is commonly considered a young readers  book  because there is so much that she has to offer with each chapter that speak profoundly to both young and old  I read this book quite fast and I would consider at an easy read  not because it doesn t offer much food for thought  but rather because the presentation is simple and the content  as I said  is truly compelling  Lowry does a good job of developing her characters  especially the main role of Jonas  The plot builds slowly  yet intricately  and really takes off late in the book  There s a part of me that wishes it resolved more in the end and we d be able to know what happened with the community and with Jonas and Gabriel  However  I do appreciate Lowry s withholding of resolution as it allows the reader to finish the story themselves  However you think that Jonas and Gabriel would be received and more importantly what would happen with the community would be truly telling of your worldview  This book deserves the honors that it has received  if you haven t read it  read it   This book is just beautifully written  Lois Lowry is a fantastic writer  you sympathize with the character  Jonas  He doesn t understand what he feels until someone shows him  The character  the giver was great  he has a lot of pain going through him which I understand and which he must hold onto until he can train his successor  For Jonas to leave a safe community is a difficult thing but it s about survival and finding things that you never thought existed  In conclusion  a great book to read  I recently re read The Giver for a high school English IV assignment  and it has not lost an ounce of its magic  In fact  it was an even more enjoyable experience reading it a second time  All the elements of the story are well developed and harmonize with one another  The tone really sets the scene  while also helping to deliver the underlying satire that is prevalent throughout the book  The characterization of Jones and The Giver are flawless  Lowry really puts you in the mind of Jonas  making you a part of the story  The development of Jonas as a character is flawless and is a catalyst for the plot and theme of oppression and conformity  The dialogue helps bring out the deep rooted conformity that has been embedded in Jonas since his youth  This is best exemplified when Jonas speaks of precise language  saying  He had been trained since earliest childhood  since his earliest learning of language  never to lie  It was an integral part of the learning of precise speech   Lowry 70   All of these elements are wrapped up very neatly in a truly moving and unforgettable plot  As for the plot itself  it is gripping and insightful  and has its fair share of exciting twists  Of all the books I have read for school  The Giver is one of the two that I would read outside of the classroom  the other being To Kill a Mockingbird  Needless to say  I would lean more towards The Giver in that scenario  I would highly recommend this book to anyone  Even if you have already read it  it is definitely worth the re read   I didn t wake up one morning and decide I wanted to be a librarian  Things just don t happen that way  Instead  you make small choices along the way that eventually lead you to some job in some city  Imagine  though  a place where it wasn t that way  A place where you didn t get to decide what you were going to do with your life  Instead  someone decided that for you and they decided it when you were twelve years old   Well that is the bad part  here is the good part  No hunger  No crime  No violence  No abuse  No disagreements  Bliss    everyone gets along with everyone  Maybe for all of that  having your job picked out for you at age 12 isn t that bad  When it is Jonas  turn at the ceremony of 12s where jobs are assigned  the Elder says   Your job is special  Your job      Jonas swallows hard  waits and hears   Your job is to be                The worst part of holding the memories is not the pain  It s the loneliness of it  Memories need to be shared   I have read The Giver several times  first as a requirement when I was in the 7th or 8th grade and then several times since as I have begun teaching it to my 7th and 8th grade students  Needless to say  I absolutely love this novel  Every time I read it  I experience something new  The quote above is one that stood out to me when I recently read the novel for what feels like the 100th time  Memories are important to us  yet in The Giver  they only exist in the minds of The Receiver of Memory  What would we do without our memories and feelings  The Giver follows Jonas  a new twelve  in a society that lives in what they call Sameness  Everything the members in the society do is almost entirely decided for them by a set of society rules  They experience no pain  no real feelings  no music  no color  no birthdays  and much more  Each family unit is allowed two children  one boy and one girl  both which must be applied for by the parental unit  Every year a celebration is held to honor the growth of the children into a new year of life until the final year at the age of twelve  Each year the children receive the next  honor  of growing up  For example  at the age of nine  children receive their bicycles and begin their volunteer hours at the various work places  At the age of twelve  children receive their job assignments and begin training  Most children have an idea of what their assignment will be do to where they spent the majority of their training  Jonas  however  enters the ceremony of his twelfth year unaware of what is in store for him  Jonas has not been assigned a job  rather he has been selected as the new Receiver of Memory  Jonas begins his training with The Giver who transmits various memories of what was  before  Sameness  Jonas endures joy  pain  and even love  Throughout his training with the Giver  Jonas feels as though the memories and experiences he has encountered should no longer be hidden from his community  The Giver and Jonas develop a plan to leave the memories behind  The story ends leaving the reader to decide the fate of the developed plan and the rest of society   Memories need to be shared     Feb 2014  Wow  I can t believe I had never read this one before  I can see why it s such a classic  It really reminded me of Pleasantville and now I want to watch that movie  But back to the book       there is some really heavy stuff to process and I m surprised and glad that this is a book that students often read in school  It raises a lot of really important questions  That is obviously one of the biggest values of reading this one   is it gets you to thinking  Could our society ever get to that point  Are we trying to with all of our pills and medicines for everything  Would a life without color and taste and emotion be better simply because it s easier  I m really looking forward to watching the movie that they are making for this  and also am looking forward to reading this again and again over the years  It s a really good reminder that even though life has it s ups and downs  at least we GET to have the ups and downs  i think the book The Giver is an amazing book because of the excellent setup  Jonas which is the main character lived in a Utopian community where every thing was perfect which i like their society because it is like a perfect life  Jonas just turned 12 and was selected to be the receiver of memory i think that in their society they should have a receiver in their society so they can have a perfect society  Jonas and the old receiver of memory make a plan i didn t agree with the plan that they made because in their society they have strict rules which i do not agree with  I do have to say the book started of very dull and slow  The character development in this book was very good just the way that Jonas changed and learned new things  Overall this book was a very interesting and amazing book  It is kind of hard for me to review this book because it is one of my all time favorites and I have read it several times since I first picked it up in 3rd grade  I think this should be required reading for everyone ever  The writing is simple and beautiful  The story is incredible  perfectly realized and essentially created the YA Dystopian genre  I love this book so much  Jonas lives in a perfect world where everything is regulated and there is no diversity and everybody is happy  BUT he is asked to be the receiver of memories  the one person who has an understanding of what life was like before sameness  He begins to receive memories of generations past from the Giver  It is beautiful to hear Jonas experience snow for the first time  and heartbreaking for him to understand first hand what war was like  Simply beautiful I consider The Giver to be the best book ever written for young adults  It is not condescending nor does it water down the heavy ideas presented  It is mature enough to be enjoyed by adults as well  There are so few books out there that I would call perfect  but I think The Giver would make the list  Please do yourself a favor and read this right now  I have read this book in just two days  I couldn t simply put it down  While reading this book  I lived through the main character s life  I felt his feelings as if I was him  I was sad when I came at the last page  I didn t wanted it to end  This story is one of the most beautiful stories that I have ever read  I would recommend it to everyone that I know  The is a must read book The character  Jonas  started out as a simple and innocent boy who becomes at the end of the book a provider for human feelings  I almost cry while reading the last few chapters  I was encouraging the character to fight for survival  In the end  I knew he would be okay  Best book that I have read in a long time  Fascinating   Thoroughly impressed by  The Giver   a two decade old gem in a genre that always leaves me wanting more  No  this is concise and has all the basic elements of a dystopian horror tale  The sketchy subjects of individuality and color  in that pleasant Pleasantville way  and community are handled incredibly  yes   Hunger Games  is a rip off of this and Shirley Jackson s  The Lottery  and William Golding s  Lord of the Flies     the subject of infanticide just gives this classic YA the push to make it epic and essential  Because we were on the topic of the Holocaust  we were given to read  Number the Stars   also exemplary  so I never got to experience this  Perhaps I would have become a bigger fan of sci fi  or YA novels into adulthood   I can see  without a doubt  why this book is so celebrated  It s an amazing story of the anti Arcadia disguised as the ultimate Arcadia  bringing to mind the believability and foreboding of Orwell s  1984   I can honestly say I m at a loss for words because I don t think I have the capacity to do this book justice  It s very well written and explores more facets of the human plight than I could list on this review  My advice is to read it  it is a book that has the capacity to allow every different reader to develop their own conclusions as to what the novel means to them and each point of view is as valid as the next  A book that rare should not be overlooked   Goodreads SummaryJonas s world is perfect  Everything is under control  There is no war  fear or pain  There are no choices  Every person is assigned a role in the Community  When Jonas turns twelve  he is singled out to receive special training from The Giver  The Giver alone holds the memories of the true pain and pleasure of life  Now  it is time for Jonas to receive the truth  There is no turning back What I liked Before I really get into my likes  I feel like I should point out that this book was really hard for me to review  It took me almost 2 weeks to try to find the words to express how I feel about this book and I still don t feel like my review is adequate  This was a required read for me back in school and it is the only one that I absolutely loved  This is the book that introduced me to Dystopian societies and it s the reason why Dystopian is one of my favorite genres  This is such a good story  The world is uncomplicated and I think that this makes this a fast and easy read  it s a short book too  ending after only 180 pages   Every person in this colony is given a job at the age of twelve  They have no say in the matter  their jobs are chosen for them by the skills that they have  Each person works their job until they are old and then the move into a retirement type home   view spoiler  Once the elderly are ready  they are scheduled for their  release   Children who don t develop properly  people who break the rules 3 times  and people who ask to be are also  released     hide spoiler   There is no money  All food is proportioned and provided for each member of the community  All babies are born through Birthmothers  who are basically just baby machines  and given to a family who has applied for a child  No family has more than two children  Jonas is a very easy character to identify with  even though his life is so different than ours  He s young  so his thoughts are less complex than those of an adult  but I really think that it adds to the story  At the Ceremony of Twelve  there is a ceremony where all children advance to the next age  Jonas is given the job of The Receiver  It s a great honor  but it means Jonas will lead a lonely life because he s not allowed to share anything about his job with others  And his job  Well  that s just to receive all of the memories of the world before the colony from a person called The Giver  Imagine a world where things like snow and love are completely unknown  Watching someone  experience  these things for the first time gave me an indescribable feeling  and I think that the impact was greater for me because I felt it through a child What I didn t likeMy only complaint is that things felt a little unfinished with The Giver   view spoiler  I wish there would have been some sort of goodbye between them   hide spoiler  Brief thoughtsThis is the first book that ever had a big impact on me and that s one of the reasons why I ve read this book many times and I know I will read it again  I don t even think you need to like Dystopian novels to enjoy this story  It s the kind of book that makes you think about the world around you and how different our lives would be if we lost all of our freedoms  There s a reason why it s won so many awards  I would recommend it to anybody  Deftly written and highly polished  The Giver is a book that transcends its genre and transports the reader into an outwardly civil world  However  when scratching beneath the surface  you realize that there is much more to be lost by adopting Sameness  than living with our present conditions Lowry crafts a utopian society free from hardship  pain  and peril  Life is pre scripted from the very beginning and every person fits neatly into a near perfect model of structural functionalism  You almost feel like Emile Durkheim is the head engineer of the place  Families are turned into family units comprising only of two heterosexual adults and two children  one male and one female  People do not marry for love but rather apply to receive a mate  The same goes for children  with the limit of two children per household  Sex seems to be prohibited as well as there is a pill that is taken once people feel  Stirrings   Grandparents are a thing of the past  Once people are no longer rearing children  they go to live in a section of the society for childless adults  They live there until it is time to go to the place where the elderly are cared for  Yet  though as near perfect as this society seems  there is the distinct sensation from the very beginning  that there is something brewing beneath Our protagonist  a young man named Jonah  becomes aware of the history of the society  when he is selected to work in the role of Receiver  Without wanting to give too much away  Jonah embarks on a journey that he never could have imagined  When he becomes increasingly exposed to the life fro the time that was back and back and back  he grows uneasy of the perfection that surrounds him Though written as a young adult novel  The Giver should be required reading for everyone  in my humble opinion  Harkening back to  Anthem  by Ayn Rand or even  A Handmaids Tale  by Margaret Atwood  this book carries a similar message of warning  Even though we ache for a perfect reality  there is a large price to pay    our individuality  A quick read for most adults at a sparse 179 pages  I highly recommend The Giver  There is lots of hype around about The Giver now that it is being made into a movie  But that is not why I decided to revisit and reread this classic novel about a utopian society by Lois Lowry  No  indeed  I reread it because tonight is World Book Night 2014 and tonight I am a Giver   a book giver  that is  In fact  tonight  all over the world  thousands of people will become givers just like me and will be handing out free books people who can and who want to read them  This is a very different world than the one in Lowry s book  where only The Giver may read books  or possess memory  or see color  or have feelings The climate controlled society that 11 year old Jonas lives in had chosen to live in a state of sameness long ago  Now  all pain and suffering  all feeling has be eliminated  There may be no more wars  but neither is there any of the good things about life   loving families  emotions  memories  the warmth of the summer sun  the cold of the first snowfall  The world is colored in varying shades of gray and black  and a stilted politeness rules the day  All children have the same December birthday  no matter when they are born  and on that day  each year  they go to the Ceremony where they are promoted to the next year  For Jonas  this year is his Ceremony of Twelve where he will be assigned his life s career Jonas is the last to called because his life assignment is very different from the others  Jonas is to be the new Receiver of Memory  After his training  Jonas will replace the old Receiver of Memory  now called the Giver  of Memory   Not only does the Receiver hold the collective memory of the whole community  he may also read all the books that no one else can see  and he must use his wisdom to advise the Committee of Elders when they require it Everyday after school  Jonas goes to see the Giver and receives more and more memories each day  Soon  he knows things like pain of sunburn  the joy of sleigh riding  and  because the memories are becoming more and more painful for the Giver  Jonas learns about things like pain  starvation  war  Once the Giver transfers memory to Jonas  they are lost to him  so his pain is relieved even as Jonas s increases At the same time that this is happening  Jonas  father begins brings home a newchild at the end of his workday to try and help it learn to sleep through the night  He is given a year to do this or the child will be released  No one really knows what being released means  but they all believe it means going to a wonderful place  Jonas volunteers to have the baby  called Gabriel  sleep in his room and when the baby fusses  Jonas soothes it with some of the pleasant memories he has been given The more utopian a society seems to be  the more dystopian it really is  Sure enough  the more memories Jonas acquires  the more unfair he sees the kind of life the community has chosen  When he expresses his feelings to the Giver  he discovers that the Giver feels the same way  He also tells Jonas that ff the Receiver of Memory leaves the community  he tells Jonas  the memories will all revert back to the community  Little by little  a plan is hatched  but things suddenly change when Jonas witnesses his father releasing a new born twin baby  because twins are not allowed in the community  and learns that Gabriel  the baby he has become attached to  will also be released Jonas must make a big decision now The Giver is such a thought provoking novel about this community living in a state of sameness  At first  life feels pleasant and serene  everything is orderly  done on schedule  and there are no sudden ups and downs  no disappointments  no pain  It does feel utopian  And  it takes a while before you realize that you don t know last names  nor place names   that would point to too much individuality  not enough sameness  And it begins to not feel so wonderful anymore  Jonas learns about life  about pleasure and pain through memory  and because he is an intelligent  thoughtful boy  he quickly sees that the community has been cheated out of these things  When I read The Giver to my 4th grade class in the Bronx  they were stunned by the sameness of the community and it sparked lots of interesting dialogue in the classroom  I also detected that there was some palpable rooting for Jonas as we read until we finished the book and even heard some kids taking about it and Jonas in the schoolyard  which didn t even happen when we read Harry Potter  The Giver  which won the Newbery in 1994  is also a favorite Banned Book each year somewhere in the country  which in a country that values freedom of speech  seems to be the height of irony This book is recommended for readers age 10 This book was purchased for my personal libraryThis review was originally posted at Randomly Reading I must confess that unlike several other people  I had neither heard nor read this book until recently  Before this genre became popular  YA Dystopian   this book nailed it  I appreciate the depth with which the author takes you into the world  and the brokenness she dives in to  A wonderful storyteller  Lowry causes you to love Jonas and The Giver  and say something not so subtle about the world and culture they are from The book is not long  and well worth the read   even if you re not a fan of YA Dystopian books  Esta obra es sencillamente preciosa  Posee un protagonista adorable  un mundo perfecto  y a la vez perturbador   y una esencia llena de misticismo y melancolia  No se si considerar esta novela como utopica o distopica  aunque yo optaria por la primera opcion  ya que  aunque hay muchas cosas oscuras  el sistema funciona perfecto para todos  incluso para Jonas  quien solo se ve inquieto una vez que empieza su labor como Receptor  de lo contrario todo hubiera seguido siendo  perfecto   SPOILER No se si este pensandolo demasiado  pero no puedo evitar ver a El Dador como una personificacion o proyeccion del dios cristiano  quien supuestamente conoce y siente todo  Asi como el Dador posee todos los recuerdos del pasado y guarda dentro de si una gran cantidad de felicidad y dolor  Asi  Jonas seria una especie de Cristo o Avatar  que tiene la  responsabilidad  de salvar a la Humanidad  La Comunidad  aun a costa de su propio bienestar  Esta novela es perfecta para reflexionar acerca de lo que entendemos por Amor  y no lo que decimos entender o creemos saber  Aqui Jonas demuestra un amor infinito por Asher  su mejor amigo  por Fiona  su amiga  por Gabi  su  hermanito   y por el Dador  su mentor  Nunca se desvia a lo que vulgarmente se conoce como  amor   es decir lo sexual  incluso cuando mencionan el tema de los  Ardores   este tema se vuelve casi terciario  Es por eso que me ha gustado tanto  porque si logras interiorizar esta obra  te amplia la vision y te hace en serio pensar lo que es amar a alguien  Y entender que  lastimosamente  existe gente que no conoce el amor de verdad  y que no sabe amar  no porque sean malas personas  sino porque no son capaces de hacerlo  como Asher y Fiona   Muchos pueden pensar que el final es algo flojo o extrano  pero a mi me parecio perfecto  o muy cercano de serlo   creo que el haber llegado a ese nuevo sitio es un simbolismo para mostrar que Jonas llego a un lugar con gente como el  con personas capaces de amar de verdad  con seres  quiza  mas evolucionados que los que vivian en La Comunidad  Por otro lado  el hecho de haber escuchado un  eco  del lado de donde el provenia indicaria que El Dador habria logrado reformar a La Comunidad o  en el peor de los casos  era el desesperado deseo de Jonas porque se lograra aquello  El deseo de que la Humanidad sienta  oiga y vea  mas alla  de lo que es capaz  En definitiva  creo que esta historia va mas alla de lo futurista  la critica social o la fantasia  si lo analizas posee mucho misticismo y carga espiritual The Giver I se ha sumado a mis novelas favoritas  3  3  3 Very simple and powerful  I can t decide whether the simplicity was brilliant  like Lowry s other work  Gossamer  or whether it needed to go deeper and farther   but I will always love works like this for the power of the storytelling    The worst part of holding the memories is not the pain  It s the loneliness of it  Memories need to be shared    The GiverThis book shares the setting of a community in the future like other popular utopian books but knowing that this was published in the 90s  you could conclude that this is not influenced by what s popular right now  Forgive me for reading this book just now     It s a short novel  You could finish it within a few hours The book was strange  Or you could say weird  It s just different  It gives you an eerie  uncomfortable feeling  It s also somewhat philosophical  It lets you reflect the simple things in life that we often take for granted  You would come to think that the people here are mindless drones or zombies  Haha  The way they live their lives would really stir your curiosity  They follow rules strictly and their whole lives are governed by these rules  You could say that they live in a perfect society  But truth is  there is no perfect society  We are imperfect  Imperfection makes us human  The Giver tells us about a world where people didn t want to face their pain anymore  so they created a way that they would never have to deal with that pain again  This way is to focus all of their memories  even those stretching far back into the past  into one person  the receiver  The receiver bears all of these memories for the community  and whenever there is a problem he gives advice based on experience  Jonas  the new receiver  is faced with this and realizes that this leaves the community emotionless  and empty of feelings  and now he must decide if this is really what is best for the future It s an interesting idea because we ve all felt pain in different ways  and it can be hard to deal with  but this pain helps to make us strong  The book does a great job in showing how in order to remove the bad  you have to remove the good too  In their quest for peace and a painless life  they come to just being complacent and content over happy  and they decide that s good enough  In my opinion I loved this book  I could not put it down  I thought the whole color concept was not familiar to all except a select few  was very creative  One of my all time favorite parts of the book was when Jonah was the last one left without his occupation  but when he received the job of Receiver of Memory he knew that it would be a difficult job  Then shortly after he felt different from his friends and family  He knew that he could brake one of the most important rules thanks to his requirements  I feel like that drew me in more to the story  Overall I would recommend this book to anyone   The Giver is a beautiful and thought provoking novel for young readers and adults alike  The main character  Jonas  lives in a town that is at first glance a utopian society  It is a place where there is no real pain yet as the story continues the reader begins to realize that because of the lack of feeling within the society many other things that we take for granted in our lives are missing within Jonas  world  At a young age  Jonas is given a special position within the society as a Receiver of Memory  Through this he begins to grasp a greater understanding of what was given up to become a  perfect society   And then needs to decide if it was really worth it I first read this book in grade school and to this day is still my favorite  Lowry writes with a simplicity that a child could understand and yet there is depth to the ideas contained within  It continually reminds me to be thankful for many of the simple things in life  I m reading this one at my daughter s insistence  She was right to be insistent  This is a good book  I love the ambiguous ending  My daughter saw it ending one way and I saw it another   Honestly  I really don t have care with this book before but until one of my friends recommended me this book  With this Lowry s writing  I got so amazed with the other dimensions that she thought with this book  It s not actually a Fiction Sci Fic  It s more on history for me  Because the worlds in this book are likely the same with the happenings today  Every turn of the pages is such a goosebumps  I wonder if Jonas won t accept the challenge of being the receiver    what will happened to the giver      The Ending is to misterious for me  actually I read it several times  Yet the whole book is such a MASTER PIECE  I LOVE LOVE LOVE The Giver  I read it for the first time in elementary school  and was blown away  It opened my mind and made me feel like I could understand the depth of what Lois Lowry was trying to talk about  It was simple enough language for me to truly grasp  but didn t underestimate my ability to entertain complex issues  But this book isn t only for children  I have re read it many times over the years  and every time I see it a little differently  So by all means  parent  teenager  or child  READ IT CONTENT WARNING  Sexual awakening  violence  infant death  social isolation I had forgotten how enjoyable reading well written young adult books can be  Thanks to my daughter  who teaches high school  I ve been introduced to John Green s The Fault in Our Stars and Lois Lowry s The Giver  The Giver is a thoughtful book that creates a world of sameness  which is revealed page by page  Although the inhabitants are happy  you see how barren their lives truly are through the eyes of Jonas  Not willing to give much away  since it is a short book  just remember to cherish your memories  savor the small things in life  listen to music you love  and learn as much as you can  well  fantastic  for one  ambiguous as well  but in the sense that so many different meanings can be taken from it  it s set so far in the future there is no way to tell the extent of this new society or the lengths to which humanity has gone to modify itself  so instead the reader must focus on the story itself and take the plot at face value  simplistic style lent to the bare bones narrative  serving the purpose of the theme well  poignant  moving  and brief  would have preferred a more concrete ending  but in some ways it worked excellently   The Giver is honestly the best book I ve ever read  This book paved the way for the Dystopian books we enjoy today  The characters are so well written  in fact Jonas was my first fictional crush lol   The story itself is captivating and just overall beyond amazing  The story gets you thinking in ways no other book ever could  I absolutely love this book  Best Book Ever Jonas has a life just like everyone else he s ever known  He lives in a community where they live under the law of  sameness   This is the only thing anyone has ever known  No two people look alike  but there is no race  no true family  no agency  Career s are chosen for you  and Jonas is given the highest honor of all  he is chosen to be the  receiver of memory   As the receiver of memory Jonas will receive all of the memories from the past and uncover why they decided to start the community of  sameness   After Jonas receives memories of death  sadness  and also joy and love  he decided that it s not fair that everyone can experience this  so he s going to do something about it  Read to find out more I LOVED this movie and was so excited to read this book  It was a very great and fast read  I liked the relationship development of Jonas and the giver  I think this book has a lot of meaning to it  and what I took away is that sometimes we have to be confident enough to stand up for what we truly believe even if everyone else is against you  The Giver is set in a sterile world  children are well behaved and mannerable  adults are given the right job  children are required to complete hours of service   and they don t complain  The community is so safe that Jonas can only recall one person meeting misfortune When Jonas turns 12 his view of the world changes  In December all of the children born in the same year move to their next year  In a ceremony akin to graduation  Jonas and the other  Elevens  are given their assignments that will form their adult destiny  Jonas isn t given a traditional job  He is bestowed with the honor of receiving the memories and history of the community from a man known as The Giver Once Jonas begins his training  he learns that his flat and colorless world is not the peaceful and easy going existence he has always believed it to be  As he experiences new and sometimes painful events  he sees that his whole life is a lie  With each memory  he receives  whether painful or one of joy  Jonas cannot tolerate the ignorance of his family and friends After receiving a memory of a family celebrating Christmas  Jonas asks his parents if they love him  His parents laugh at his question and tell him that he is using a meaningless  almost obsolete word  Love can be cruel at times  but it is never meaningless  This makes him think about a place beyond the community  Elsewhere  When people are released  they go Elsewhere  Elsewhere is a place no one has ever visited or seen  but take for granted it exists How many times have I groaned at the thought of more snow rather than enjoy the option of having a change in weather  Or what about my grumbles at the cats tearing up my house as they play instead of enjoying the antics of kittens exploring  this may be amended if they don t stay out of my yarn   How many days have passed that I didn t appreciate what I do have rather than covet what I don t  These and other questions were things I thought as I read The Giver Even though the community was free from crime and mundane chores like dish washing and laundry  there is nothing peaceful about a life that doesn t include love  Do you ever wonder what will happen when one day our destructive and consuming ways destroy the workings of the world as we know it  It is inevitable that someday we will have to reform into a more sustainable society  one which is far more organized and regulated  But what will this society be like  and will it be better  The novel The Giver by Lois Lowry gives a possible example of how our society could function  Set in the future  this novel portrays an uneventful and mundane world in which humans live  having learned from the strife of the past  This world is so regulated that you do not choose your own career  what you eat  or who you marry  In fact  those who wish to have a family apply for a spouse and children who are then given to them  There are no motorized vehicles  animals  or even hills in the physical landscape because those who rule are so against differentiation  You have no choices  Everyone is equal  Nobody rebels  Even physical colour  which may individualize a person or object  has been obliterated  Everyone moves through their prosaic lives with no idea of how the world truly is outside of their regulated city  Everyone  that is  with the exception of the Giver  The Giver is the only member of society with the ability to see colour  to feel pain  despair  or happiness  He is given the burden of remembering everything of the past world  of war  sunlight  dancing  and music  And when the Giver grows old and these precious memories are threatened to be lost  a new Giver is chosen  He must be shown the ways of the past  and entrusted with the burden of having these memories while living in the emotionless society in which he exists and never uttering them to a soul  This suspenseful and enticing science fiction novel will leave one utterly bemused and perplexed with the world created by Lois Lowry  The main characters of this novel are mostly of a younger generation and the context of the novel does not necessarily need to be read by one with an exceptionally mature mind  making me think that this book is best suited for a young adult  It is truly enticing  though  and I therefore believe that it could be enjoyed by a person of any age  Lois Lowry is an amazing author  and this exceptional book even received the John Newbery Gold Medal  It is by far my favourite book and I see it as nothing less than truly extraordinary   Neu de nhan xet duoc het nhung diem hay cua cuon sach chac phai mat ca ngay mat  nhung toi se chi ra nhung gi ma

fictional utopian society  Everything in this community is organized so that there is no choice  no pain  and no real creativity  It is set up so certain jobs are assigned to certain people based on their interests and accomplishments as adolescents  The story centers around a young boy named Jonas who lives in this society  Jonas is a unique individual in a culture that is completely uniform  His differences lead to him assuming the highly honored role The Receiver of Memory  The task for The Receiver of Memory is to hold the collective memories of the community both joyful and sad  Jonas is appalled at the way he is living and how it lacks the newly learned beauty of life and death  Because of his feelings  Jonas and his mentor the previous Receiver of Memories The Giver  devise a plan to change the ways of the civilization and escape  The Giver has an intriguing  interesting  and emotional story that conveys a strong message  The message is that complete conformity is a dreary and lackluster life compared to unique individualism and that it is better to have sadness and joy than to have a designed life with neither of these  The combination of its award winning story and the important philosophical message make The Giver by Lois Lowry a must read   The Giver  is an interesting book based on the belief of a future of peculiarity  This book gives you a perspective of how the future would be like to us  which makes the writing effective  The strength of this book is it s view of ethics  The new thoughts may challenge a new reader s views making it intriguing  I would recommend this book for a classmate because it has become a wonderful phenomenon of the reading and is a must read for it s new perspectives  This book is a part of a series  so I would read it   The GistJonas is a twelve year old boy who lives in a place that is perfect  When he is given the job of The Receiver  from his first meeting with his instructor he learns some of the dark secrets behind his so called  perfect  community What We ThinkReviewed by The North StarLast year I had to read The Giver as a required book for Language Arts and I really enjoyed it  This book was like none other that I have ever read before  The plot line was crazy  Lois Lory gives you a town that is perfect in every way shape and form  Every night the kids come home and the whole family has dinner together and talks about there day  Everyone likes each other and there are no problems  that is until Jonas gets the job of The Receiver of Memories and now he learns crazy things about his town  Who could think of this stuff  Jonas was a really great character because he isn t a wimp in most books and he handles things great and when he has something on his mind he is sticking to it no matter what  I feel bad for a lot of the characters in this book because they have no idea what is going on in there society and they are basically living in the dark  That may be for the better though because if people knew some of the things that Jonas finds out panic would ensue all over the town  Besides that if you have to read this book in school then don t worry because I m sure that you will for the most part love it  If you don t have to read this book for school then you should read it anyways because I really enjoyed it and a lot of the people in my class loved it too Real Teen Rating  A    Read it      Wow  I ve been meaning to read The Giver for years  but I never got around to it  With the movie coming out  I knew I needed to get my hands on a copy ASAP  Most people would wonder why I needed to read it if I m going to see it  but truth is that I m that kind of person that can t watch the movie without reading the book  And after reading this  I m mentally yelling at myself for not having picked this up sooner  Set in a futuristic society where everything is controlled  Jonah is about to become 12 and will finally get his placement in society  Big deal  right  Well  his task as the Receiver isn t really as easy as it sounds like  Jonah must learn about the memories of the past and the effect on the fate of the future while learning to accept these new feelings and knowings about the truth of the world  It seems perfect from the outside  but aren t there always hidden secrets everywhere  Jonah was quite mature for his age  He learned quickly and he was accepting  The Giver was a better role model than almost everyone else  And the past  well it s not always pretty  There s always a little part that s jaded  Overall  I wonder why I didn t pick this up earlier and why those of you who haven t read it haven t picked it up yet either  The Giver was an amazing read showing the true colors of a seemingly perfect society with a character who actually matured  Awesome quick read    Whether intentional or not  Lowry tackles such topics of Socialism  Collectivism  and Eugenics in terms that young children can understand and contemplate  The book  a very short read  was hard to put down  Although I rarely watch a movie before I read the related book  I am happy to say that without spoil the book was able to stir emotions that the movie could not even hint at  The end was masterfully written  the question of dreams and reality merging into a single clause that tastes of the visual effect going from a black and white to color  reminding me of the scene when Dorothy wakes to find herself in munchkin land in the land of Oz   The Giver  by Louis Lowry is a twisting book that follows Jonas  a boy who grows up to be special and different  Jonas s lives in a society that rejects differences and supports sameness  When Jonas is selected to receive memories  he discovered a new world that was hidden beneath the layer of sameness that the society had set down  Jonas begins to see different things that no one else can see but the Giver and himself  Jonas begins to realize that he wants to open up the world to what actually lays beneath sameness  good or bad  As he receives more ememorieof happiness from what once was  he is motivated even more to save the people from living a life of dullness   This book was amazing    It had some great plot events and a great climax  I rate this book 5 5  I recommend this book to people who like Lois Lowry books  I really liked the ending  In conclusion this is my review of The Giver  This book is about a Utopian society  where everything is the same and people have no recollection of the past  and becomes dystopian since people have to give up things  Everything is regimented as to what you can do and when  There are many rules that go along with it so that everything is fair and just  At certain ages  the people in the society get things such as bikes  Then later as they reach year twelve they get their job assignments which they will pursue for the rest of their lives Jonas one of the main characters in the story waits for everyone to get their assignments  When it is finally his turn the chief elder calls him up and let s him know that he will be the new receiver  The Giver has to give him memories and endure him with pain  This is a difficult job and he sees that after a while that he doesn t want this life  He also finds out through his observations and being able to go anywhere in the Utopian society what his dad s job really consists of  For us death is a major thing but for people in this society it seems to be nothing big  I teared up when I realized what releasing someone meant  So sad to think that this is something that happens to people  It is a dystopian fiction story  The ending is surreal and triumphant  Jonas take his brother Gabriel out of the society to discover elsewhere and to live with color  emotion  and to gain experience on things that weren t in his reach  He realizes that the environment he was living in was not good for him or the people  He wanted out and took every effort to leave  The sad part is once he leaves he cannot come back and once memories are transferred they are his and can t be given back either  What a dilemma  The mystery in the book keeps you wanting to read more  This book was so intriguing that I didn t  want to put it down  I want to read the other books in the series now I can t even imagine what life would be like if we weren t able to make our own choices  I guess when we are small in a sense we don t have to do so because our parents do it for us and as we get older we come to realize that at times choices can be difficult  This book would be great for 5th 6th grade to teach loyalty  family  home  recollection of past events  value of being an individual  and look at what is beyond the world we live in such as looking at demographics  It isn t that difficult of a read because of its almost journal like style and you could tie in community service or something to accentuate the giving  The astonishment of this book has allowed it to receive many awards including the Newbery medal honor and many others  There are no Illustrations in the story but because of the language use you are able to paint a picture of what the society would look like  As I think of it  I think of it as an older movie where it was just all black or white or the movie Pleasantville where eventually they start to see color  Something I would love to do would be to watch the movie to see how it correlates to the book  What a great teachable moment and a way to utilize compare and contrast in the classroom setting   5 words   This book leaves you thinking     This was a delightful gem  I only wish I didn t wait so long to read it To live in a world so organized with out life s wonders is a life I would never want  but it was great to see it through Jonas eyes A cleaver  charming and unique way of story telling Absolutely priceless and precious  This book was well written  This is probably okay for anyone over 9yrs old  I think this is a wonderful book  how Jonas thinks life is perfect  then unmasks the horrifying truth on the true meaning of being released  and finds out that it basically means to be executed  The Giver  the man who gives the receiver  Jonas  old memories of the past  plays a clip of his own father injecting an infant w  poison who was supposed to be released just because he had a twin brother  Jonas learns about Rosemary  who applies to be released even though she knows what it means  This is why Jonas can t leave  because her memories were released to the community  All the people who were old were celebrated because everyone thought they were going to another community  but they were going to be killed  Jonas and his family meet Gabriel  Claire  a birthmother s  son  Jonas and Lily s father takes him home because he has trouble sleeping  After another year  he is going to be released  Jonas s father doesn t like this  but his mother does because Gabe annoyed her  Jonas steals Gabe and takes him to another community   This book is just as enthralling and just as haunting as I remember  It was great for conversation  The boys were just as surprised by some of the plot twists and just as appalled at some of the choices made by the community as I was when their age  It left them begging for more which is always a good thing  I ve been seeing The Giver ever since I was in high school but I haven t really given any thought on reading this book  I can say that the reason behind it is because I wasn t particularly enticed by the book cover  I could even remember a time back then when an aunt of mine asked me if I have a copy of The Giver  which my answer was obviously  No   After reading this today  I briefly became angry with myself because WHY THE HELL DID I NOT READ THIS BEFORE    The book started with Jonas  the protagonist of this book  feeling apprehensive about the upcoming event which was an annual Ceremony on the month of December that includes the Naming  wherein  newchildren  will be assigned to their respective  units   and the Ceremony of One up to Twelve  which represents the children s age  with matching rituals  symbolisms and or new roles to play in the community  Jonas was specifically dreading the Ceremony of Twelve wherein their group will be assigned to different roles jobs in the community and would train from then on by the Committee of Elders who has meticulously observed every child in the community to know what lies ahead for the future Twelves The book sounds dystopian right  Well  yes  you re right but unlike other dystopian novels like The Hunger Games wherein there was torment  destruction and unhappiness  every bit from the story gave way to the notion that they were living in a world community of utopia  A place where there s only serenity and harmony  A place where people felt no real pain  A place where people have no recall of the past and everything alongside it  But with that monotonous order and peacefulness implies that there are so much that the people have been neglected of experiencing and feeling  People had no memories of the past  Only The Giver has them  That s what makes it dystopia  Who would have liked to live in a colorless and painless world right  That would have been excruciatingly BORING  Dull  Gray  Jonas learned more of the truth and the horrors and beauty behind it  He started to really  feel  which I thought was beautiful  It was as if I was witnessing a small child learning his way to the world  The writing style suited the story very well  I love the open ending  the mystery and all  This classic book surely did not disappoint and should be read by every human being at least once in their lifetime   Again  WHY THE HELL DID I NOT READ THIS BEFORE    I wish there were more stars to give this  Best children s book  and possibly best book  ever written  Absolutely loved it  A must read for everyone  especially those that live in a country which underwent the  government enforced normalcy  phase  like the American 50 s and 60 s  Not many classic books are anti tyranny without also being anti socialist or anti monarchy dictatorship as well  The Giver masterfully presents the dangers of social stagnation  and also the horrors that can be inflicted by a government that wants  above all else  to enforce the status quo To sum up  it s what Atlas Shrugged would ve been if Ayn Rand wasn t a fascist egomaniac  Read some of the comments about how the book isn t enough   somehow  These readers must have really analyzed it  I guess I took it pretty lightly  as an easy read  It s perfect for those moments where you want to just bury yourself in bed among your pillows and bawl about your childhood and not wanting to grow up and how the world is cruel et cetera et cetera yada yada  It s light  but it made me want to float around it in  And I would probably  totally  do that for the next couple hours until I calm the hell down Eeeh  I read this book a few years ago with my son  He really liked it and wanted me to get the other books in this series for him  And I have gotten them for him  but he is like me and has lots of books that grab his attention  It was a great read and a way to spend some time reading with my son  It another world and my son really got into it  My son is not a strong reader  so we took turns reading it together  He loves to read  but he just doesn t get all the words correct so the meaning gets messed up for him  It was a great way to bond  and I was proud when he didn t understand and asked questions to get clarification   It was so good reading The Giver again after ten years  Excellent book   No Spoilers The initial utopia of The Giver had me fooled  The title on this one doesn t necessarily indicate what you re getting into  In talking with others I ve realized that there are critics to the heft of the story as it relates to the age group for which it s intended  Although the story is rooted in a perfect utopian society  the degradation of the experience throughout does send red flags to those who bother to envision such divine life  If you re very sensitive to having your child exposed to all of the tangible intricacies of life and culture  then this book may be upsetting for you  For the child however  not so much  It s difficult for me to see this story as  too much to handle  for any age group  although not every person matures at the same age  The Giver is simple reading  geared toward adolescent teens  though engaging enough to be interesting to an adult  There is no foul language  gratuitious sex or etc  It is a story that should stimulate your child s consciousness  imagination and awareness  I d suggest that  rather than trying to keep this out of the hands of an adolescent  that instead a parent would introduce it in a reading and discussion round  The Giver is a quick read  part of my reason for picking it up  So when you re out at the pool or on a transit  pick up this quick good read   The Giver is a book about an utopian community  This community has no colour and no memories  Well the only people who have memories are  The Giver  and Jonas  Jonas was just a regular boy in the community  well he was until his ceremony of 12  Jonas was granted  Receiver of Memory   the Receiver of Memory is a very rare job to be given  Near the end of the storyline Jonas realizes that his life has been a lie  The place where he grew up in was just basically a prison  his mother  father and sister have been hidden from the truth  So Jonas plains to escape his life with the help of the Giver  But he doesn t go alone  I loved this book it has been my favourite book I have read so far in this year  The plot of the story is great  And the detailing in the story is incredible  This is why I gave this book 5 stars  I listened to this book on CD as I spend much of my work day traveling from patient to patient  Purchasing it for my grandson  I wanted to preview it for appropriateness  I was not ready to hand it over promptly as I found myself drawn into this story  Completing the book I continue to ponder the lessons  They are not simple and they do not settle easily  I may not hand it over at all  I think it calls for a very strong heart  I would like to experience the other stories in this series  Days after I finished this story I am still enjoying the complexity of the message  As I have spent my life serving those on a suffering journey I can appreciate how very alone those who suffer or those who are different in presentation can feel  It gives me new insight as I continue to serve  The less perceptible layer of aloneness is more to my attention now  I am sure I will carry this message with me as I continue to serve   Amazing alternative world  The first book I can remember reading and thinking this is awesome and so unlike anything I ve ever read before  Definitely a must read for any young and old reader alike  When I realized that The Giver was written in 1993 and was not one of the more recent dystopian novels  i e  The Hunger Games  Divergent  etc    I was even more impressed with it  After extolling its virtues to my 25 year old daughter she said   Oh yeah  We read that book in school  It was awesome   How did I miss this   Ah  the days of juggling 4 kids   my mind is still a blur  In any case  The Giver is an exceptional book that makes one question what is makes a functional society and the extent to which the government controls over our personal lives    truly exceptional  This is like a short story to me  Only 168 pages long  Omg that ending  it s exactly like the spinning top thing from inception  I dig this kind of mind eff shit  5 stars  favourite   I gave this book five stars because of how different it is  This book is about a society that doesn t know about uniqueness or variety  Everything is the same and everything is controlled  No one has any memories and can not think for themselves  Decisions are made for them and it takes one person to start to think for himself that finally causes a change within that environment  The way the author portrays the characters and daily life makes it a very good and interesting story  The ending of the book was great but also very frustrating  It left a huge cliffhanger that made readers  specifically me  want to anxiously know what happened after  The main character does something that causes everyone in the boring society to receive memories about different things  The adventure that led him there was interesting but the book never says what happens to him at the end or how the society was after receiving memories  The ending left many unanswered questions   Had never read this one  it s kind of a  Brave New World  for kids  Well done creepy and surprisingly upsetting for a kid s book  I look forward to the day when my son is old enough to read this one  Mini Book Review  I am at a loss for words to express the brilliance of this work of literary art  Such a simple yet complex story that you could spend hours discussing  The story has stayed with me all day and I cannot wait to talk with my book pals about it  Also have a feeling Chapters Shawnessy will have a spike in sales on this one as I will be expressing to customers my mad love for this  Reminded me a little of Brave New World and Logans Run with the same vibe of a supposed Utopian society that seems idealistic with no prejudice or violence yet a world so horrifying to me as there is no passion  love or freedom of choice  And don t get me started about a world where people have limited access to books   Jonas is such a unique and richly developed character that you come to love and feel for  The world Lowry has created is fascinating and you can see how it could develop  Perfection in 179 pages  My 11 yr old and I are just finishing up The Boy with the Striped Pajama s and this will be our next read out loud book  I cannot wait to hear what he thinks  Oh yeah now have the song Freewill by Rush stuck in my head    read the book you will understand  Ok peeps if you haven t read this book yet  get thee to a book store immediately and pick up a copy  or a Library if funds or shelf space is an issue  I know this review is kinda rambling but I don t want to give away anything  I truly want you to experience this book as I did  FYI I am kicking myself right now that I met Lois at BEA last year and knew nothing of this spectacular book  Lois I want to go back in time and thank you for writing this lovely book  Guess I will be picking up my copy of Son tomorrow    sorry kids mommy might be busy tomorrow 5  Dewey s I purchased this from Chapters Shawnessy and did not have to review it  I just loved it so much I had to tell you all about it  I quickly devoured the book and loved it  There s so much in those pages  Choosing it for Book Club required me to re read it since it had been four years  This is one book I won t mind reading and re reading  I m immediately in the society and can see it in my mind s eye  After reading and thinking about it this second time  I love it even more  Part of that may also be my exposure to other novels similar in theme such as Fahrenheit 451 and 1984  The drabness enforced upon the societies in order to achieve  sameness  is similar in both The Giver and 1984  The trash receptacles  rules  and punishments all hum a similar tune  The lack of culture found in literature and art are missing  all in the pursuit of different yet similar goals We gave a copy of this novel to one of our nephews for Christmas  We didn t just randomly choose it  It s one of our favorites because it has so much to teach within those pages  Amazing  Definitely one of my favorite books  This was a great book  At first I thought it would be boring but it caught my attention later on in the book  The Community is perfect  Everyone is the same and equal  To further this  each person has a role they fulfill  When Jonas turns twelve  he is made the Receiver of Memories  the only one who knows the truth about the past  It is the GIVER who must pass these to him     And now I know where all those MATCHED comparisons come from  Yes  credit where it is due indeed Ms  Condie  Stuff mentioned from the pills to the roles that everyone must fulfill could be construed as having been  inspired  by THE GIVER    They want a perfect society community where everyone is treated the same  instead they end up with a people whose freedoms are stifled    all just so they don t experience the difficulty of making the any hard decisions  Everything they do  everything they feel is determined by the Community  It s intriguing  and much deeper than the other book I mentioned earlier   It made me think  It isn t a romance  It isn t an epic action novel  It is incredibly thought provoking   a   That family isn t family as we picture it  It s temporary   b   Freedom and equality  Would you rather live in a Community where people are free to decide as they please  but burdened with chaos  Or would you rather be in a Community of people whose decisions are taken away from them in place of which is a kind of  peace of mind    c

from the elders  Jonas is given a special job  He is chosen to bare and remember the horrific memories of his town and the hidden secrets of his village  He learns about euthanasia  the birth mothers

small child whom his is close with  Gabriel  is doomed to die he comes up with a plan to save the child and release the memories he holds back to the people of the town  The Giver says that when Jonas leaves  the memories will flood the town  The reader is left with the image of Jonas running away with Gabriel  The reader is uncertain about what exactly happened to the pair  however  it seems like a peaceful place  This book is a book that I personally love  I think a really great way to use it in a classroom would be to tie it into social studies  Students could learn just how important it is to remember and study history  If we as a people do not know our history  we are doomed to repeat it  We also could tie this book into personal memories and the weight they hold  This book is a Newberry winner   Fantastic and short book  Glad to have finally read it  even though Hollywood rarely produces accurate book adaptations  at least they re successful in getting me to pick up the book first   The ending  though  was certainly unexpected    I ll just have to read the rest of the series and hope that Jonas and Gabe s story is contiued like the reviewers have said  Wow  reading this book is a certain torture that I enjoy immensely and felt disappointed when it s suddenly over with a cliffhanger  Lois Lowry  I demand a longer story  your book is too short  This book leave me many things to ponder before i go to sleep like pain  humanity  memories  life and love        And  I have to know will Jonas and Gabriel be safe   I need the next book like right now    A reread of an old favorite    a book on my list for absolutely perfect YA books  Beautiful  moving  and potentially life altering  Now that s a novel   This book took me a long time to read  but once I finally finished it  it turned out to be one of my newest favorite books  Jonas  an eleven year old boy is living in a  Utopian  society where everything known to man is controlled by a higher form of government in the civilization known as  the elders   The elders decide what your role in the community will be  as well as how much you know about reality   spoiler alert  Only one person has the knowledge of true life in this society  he is known as the giver  Jonas is selected to gain that knowledge from him over a long period of time  As the book goes on  Jonas learns and experience the very real feelings of love attraction  war pain  and happiness sadness which he has never felt or known  I mainly liked this book because I love anything that has to do with fictional society s such as a utopia  The author use of syntax and diction creates realistic sense of emotion between the characters  Especially a strong loving sensation between Jonas and the giver   The setting of the story was set in the future  where Jonas and his family life in an Utopia  where people decision and future has been arrange  Every kid after they turned 12  they receive an assignment that best fit to them  Unlike the other kid  Jonas get to be The Giver  receive all the memories of the past  painful  color    he always thought he is living in a perfect society but he is not  The memories he received completely change how he sees the world around him  I love this book  I couldn t leave my eyes after I got the the half of the book  I recommend this book for people who like science fiction and future genre This book brought me many feelings  I thought the future society is perfect  our future had already planned and we just need to follow that plan with out any struggle  But i never though Jonas had change my thought completely  I started to hate this society  people had less right  people has limited imagination and this is stupid  I am happy with my life here   The Giver  written by  Lois Lowry  Copyright  1993 by Lois Lowry  180 pg  Newberry Medal Winner 1994 The expository of this book is interesting in itself  but as you read  the world Jonas lives in becomes increasingly interesting  Living every day of his life the same  each year adding a new aspect to his life as he became another year older is a simple way to live  then Jonas reaches the moment of truth  the Ceremony of Twelve  where he will receive the job for the rest of his life  It is ironic to me that he is so apprehensive for the Ceremony  because compared to the challenges he will face as the Reciever this news is nothing As Jonas goes through training with the Giver  his world begins to change  Everything that he knows begins to become more vibrant and his eyes are opened  Not only does he experience positive feelings  but is passed on feelings of when things used to be painful  Through the memories the Giver shares with Jonah  I began to think about my own life and how it would be if I had lived in Jonah s world of Sameness  This book does a great job presenting situations in which we stop to reflect on and question our own lives  What would I be willing to give up  Who would I be willing to give up  and who would I be willing to fight for  Do I really want to have choices  or are they detrimental  Through these questions and many others  I rediscovered the things I valued most in my life  For this reason  I would recommend this book to any readers who may feel lost in their lives  feel they are going through a constant routine  or are even tired of reading the same types of books  Venture into a world where things we take for granted do not even exist  where choice is not a choice  and where a single brave individual carries the pain of many  Read this book  and I promise it will change the way you view your own life  as it has done to me  The Giver is a story about a young boy named Jonas who had unique controls over society  In his existence of civilization there was no suffering  hunger or war  Everyone had some form of over power and there were always details aligned with each and every factor of this society  This world was a very bland place to be  as there was no form of color  emotion or love  which served to be a very lonely  There were lots of rules in this society that ranged from the limitation of 2 children  to potential candidates for marriage and what type of job you had  Throughout this society due the guidelines for life  if there were any forms of rebellion there was always the threat of being  released  which meant death  Because of this lack of life being lived  Jonas was overwhelmed and done living under these circumstances  so he decided to run away with the help of the Giver in order to escape being  released  after he attempts to help a young child named Gabriel  However his plans were changed when the time frame was forced forward and he and Gabriel had to begin their journey towards a new life earlier than expected  The language and style of the giver seems to reflect that of a very straightforward style of writing  which leaves little to wonder because of the amount of detail provided   The Giver  a story in the future  by Lois Lowry  is of an ominous world where everything is the same  Geography  color  people and emotions are all more or less the same  At the age of twelve  boys and girls in this community get their jobs as Laborers  Birthmothers  Engineers and a variety of other jobs  Jonas  an Eleven turning Twelve  has not been assigned like his friends  but rather selected by The Giver  better known as the Receiver of Memory  Jonas will be trained to become the new Receiver of Memory and will feel sadness  joy  anger and love for the first time  Jonas learns the secrets of his strange community and the sadness that no one else seems to feel  Lowry has made a world of Sameness  something we can t quite comprehend  and forces us to consider what will happen to the world in the future   This book The Giver is about a  Community  where every and anything have rules  In this book a boy name jonas is SELECTED to be the reciever of memory  They call this job the reciever of memory and the most important job in the community because in this community they dont know or understand any of the things we do  They dont know about animals snow or hills  In this community they all do the same thing except for the reciever of memory In Jonas s community only once in a while that anybody is SELECTED to be the Reciever of Memory this year JONAS who just turned tweleve was selected to be the new reciever of memmory  The mintue Jonas was selected his whole  normal  life had change  he will start getting trained by the old reciever of memory  anything normal to us that we know is gonna be given to him as something new an as a memory Jonas is no longer  normal  in his community he is royalty  This is a great book i would recommend it to anybody that likes mystery books  I think this book was awesome and should have been much longer  Very sweet and endearing at times  Loved it  I reread this book in preparation for    I was struck by the message about memory in the book  The giver and the receiver hold the memories for the community  They must remember good and bad things that the community has decided are only tangentially relevant to them  By choosing  sameness   they have left behind some of these memories  yet they realize that they might need to draw from the wisdom gained through experience  That s why they designate a person to keep the memories for them I made a connection between memories in this book and memories in the Harry Potter series  where memories are stored in a pensieve and can be shared with someone else  Also  I recently listened to   which talks a lot about memory and how it works  When the receiver leaves the community in The Giver  the memories are suddenly available to everyone again  Also  the memories are a burden  The Giver  perhaps  is one of the most innovative and one of the best silent dystopian novels in the market today  In my opinion  this is the best dystopian I have ever read so far  If you came across this book before  it wouldn t be new to you that the events in this book happened in a  utopian  society where everything is almost perfect  balanced and working  This specific element is perhaps the most evident reason why I dubbed this book as one of the most innovative  To think of it  almost everything in the contemporary dystopian genre has evil and suppressive governments  rebellions  scientific conspiracies  and  oh  do not forget the almost mandatory teenage couples in them  The genre is seriously lacking innovation and ideas are just being recycled every now and then  It s kind of like the battle of smartphones today  Everyone is claiming to be revolutionary when in fact the features are being repetitive  Therefore  it was a great opportunity and break for me to have read the Giver because it released me to the unforgiving uniform talons of cliche dystopian novels  To be honest  I am not sure how to review this book without writing a very long unintelligent entry  The Giver intelligently presents us a dystopian society in a very oxymoronic manner that is  a dystopian novel with a utopian society  A very innovative idea in this time of recycled concepts  It is also very effective  As I read through this book  I felt myself longing for a society like the one portrayed in the plot  One where everything is perfect and every need are provided  I think the very purpose of this book is to dwell on the reasons why a man is called a man and what are the qualities that define a man   Man as in the whole human species  not the gender   The book presents an opportunity for comparison between what is a man in this utopian society and a man in our current society  These comparisons  I believe  yield great wisdom  I cannot talk about character development because unlike other books  we only have Jonas  the protagonist  developing  And his development greatly relies on the fact that his job is to be the Receiver  so he is open to wisdom unlike other citizens  I do not find it a disadvantage though because I believe this book is not about Jonas  It is hardly about Jonas  This is about the society  Jonas is just our guide and possible mediator for realizations  I need to shut my mouth up and end this very random and incoherent review  I just want to say that this book is great  very unlike the expensive trendy and tiring dystopian novels around and has a huge amount of indisputable wisdom to offer   In a community that is all the same lives Jonas  who discovers that he is very different  Jonas is the main character in the book  The Giver  one of my favorite books  I loved The Giver because the plot was very creative  the theme was magnificent  and the setting was vivid  I think you should read this book for many reasons  The theme of this book is clearly represented  freedom  the right to make your own choices  uniqueness  and individuality are worth dying for  In Jonas s community  a commitee selects one s job  war is unheard of  all people wear the same attire  and all are assigned spouses and families  When Jonas is given the special  wonder filled occupation of becoming the Receiver of Memory  he finds that there is much more to life  Through his task of becoming the Receiver of Memory  he discovers the meaning of love  pain  frustration  color  and cold  That is when Jonas realizes how much more there really is  Life soon becomes overwhelmingly unbearable in his world of  sameness   He finds life isn t worth living without the qualities  often that we take for granted  he discovered  That is when Jonas goes on a dangerous journey to find a land that is different  The setting in this book made it quite a pleasure  Everything in the community was predictable and pre planned  The housing units were all the same  There were designated spots for everything  The setting helped develop the plot and theme  The mysterious ending leaves one filled with curiousity and wonder  The book  The Giver  by Lois Lowry is pure enjoyment  especially for someone who likes a good theme and plot that ties in with the setting  Check out my review here  http   thepaige turner blogspot com 2    We enjoyed sharing with the kids the parallels of the  perfect world  created in this book with 2 Nephi 2 11 12  I can t wait to read the next two books in this series  I will definitely come back to this one again and again and dig in much deeper with the kids as they get older  I hope the new movie coming out does the book justice   This book had an impact on me even though I hadn t read it  My son read it in class and talked about the book with me just enough for me to see how a person could do great evil  and think they were doing great good  by trying to eliminate all the causes of cultural and racial clashes  It reminded me of the history here in North America  of forcing native children away from their parents and into schools where they were punished for everything that made them part of their culture  and forced to learn the language and wear the clothing of the dominant culture  I wrote my Villain in my novel  Duffy Barkley is not a Dog  to be Smelter  a man who hated war and tried to bring peace by eliminating differences by force  Then I moved on to write other books and forgot the Giver until we were at a friend s home  The daughter had stage managed a college production of the Giver and Lois Lowrey had attended  We decided to rent the movie and watch it  From there I realized I still hadn t read this book  Now that I have read it  I have to give it five stars  It is a powerful book  even though you can tell it was written for children it has an appeal to adult readers too  I love the bare bones feel of the story  although at times I wish it had more character development  Jonas is vague enough that anyone can identify with him  I loved the uncertain quality of the ending  but felt frustrated by that same thing  I wanted to know that Jonas and the baby survive  So I dove right into Gathering Blue  which I adore  but answered none of the questions this book left lingering  Anyway  five stars  You should read it  I think by now it is part of the Classic book list that any educated person should have read  I had a hard time remembering this book from elementary school  The only memories that seemed to creep up were those that seemed strange to my 5th grade self  The scene where the young bathe the Old  for instance  Looking back on this  I see why I thought it was strange  What a beautiful idea  the Old being cherished and cared for by the young  Of course it caused controversy  Someone  somewhere  sexualized it  Sadly  it won t be be in the movie  Even so  I hope the other difficult themes will remain in tact  Release  Overall the theme is challenge  Not only authority  but yourself  I know I have personally struggled with this and I hope they continue to have this in youth curriculum  Even if I couldn t remember the details in the book  I would like to think it helped culture me  Helping me realize that not everyone s truth is necessarily my own  I would have to say this is a 4 and 1 2 star book  The reason being that the end left a little to be desired but in a literary world  it does work  Even if I wanted more closure  life doesn t always offer it  Again  a good lesson  Finally  I m glad I took the time to re read this  It asks many difficult questions  doesn t always answer them but leaves us hopeful  The present can seem bleak  the future questionable but we should always maintain a shred of hope Can t wait for the movie  In Jonas  utopian world  adult males and females are matched to be a couple based on their traits so that their dispositions balance out  If their  marriage  works out for three years  then they can apply to bring home a child  There are separate birthing females who deliver children  and these children are sent to be cared for by couples who have applied for a child  Each couple can have only two children   one male and one female  In December  there is a two day ceremony during which each child between the ages of one and twelve celebrates the milestone of completing another year  Depending on their age  a child is given a bicycle  assigned volunteer hours  gets his her hair cut  or given a life career  Jonas himself is approaching twelve years of age  the age at which he will be assigned his career  and he is feeling apprehensive about it  What if they assign him a career that doesn t fit him  But then  the committee gives him the highest honor of being the Receiver   the one person who receives all the memories of the past  including all the horrible things that happened   hunger  pain and war  and the good things like color  snow  happiness and love  from the previous Receiver  who is now the Giver   Except  now Jonas feels strange about the life that he took for granted thus far This past weekend  I drove to my friends  place in Raleigh  which is just a little less than 3 hours from my home  As I always do on those drives  I popped in a Newbery Medal winner in my car CD player and settled in to listen to the one book I was most reluctant to read  for reasons I don t remember any more  But as the narrator started reading the first few passages  I was hooked  For the first time since I started listening to audiobooks  or rather the second time   Dracula would have the honor of first place   I began to find ways to lengthen my drive  especially on my return   driving through tiny towns en route or taking unnecessary pit stops  Just as Kira Kira  another Newbery Medal winner  wowed me  The Giver also had me intrigued from the first page Lois Lowry creates a very utopian world in The Giver   a world where the concept of  Sameness  has been adopted  In this world  everyone is same   they have the same skin tones  same hair color  same eye color and have their decisions made for them by a higher authority  Since there are no differences to exploit  there are no competitions  It s easy to see the appeal of such a world  where you get your perfect career  where there is no bigotry or racism since everyone has the same basic physical attributes  where the old are taken care of in a housing by professional people whose job is to do that  where couples move in with other childless couples once their own  assigned  children move on to their careers  where rudeness  bragging  and wrong use of language are all punishable offences  For someone who has tasted freedom  people like us   we can immediately spot the failings of such a community   while it may be a great idea never to have to worry about your career  the fact that people don t have freedom of choice would be a huge put off for us  But  for people like Jonas and his parents and friends  who have not known any other world  the idea of choosing one s own career is a hugely laughable and impossible idea I loved this book  I ve been a huge fan of dystopia for many reasons  but mostly because I stop taking things for granted when I come across great dystopian literature  While most of the worlds explored in such books will probably never come to pass  they explore ideas that are ostensibly the solutions to today s problems or ideas that are extreme versions of the troubles of the world  The Giver envisions a world where no one starves  everyone has equal opportunity  there is no pain and there are no bad feelings between people  Accidents don t happen  and everyone lives to a ripe old age  But to make a utopia  there would always be some sacrifices   to lock up all the badness in the world  the people were forced to also lock up the goodness as well  The people don t feel pain  but they also don t feel happiness and love  and family isn t a concept that s understood at all  There was a scene where Jonas experiences the memory of Christmas  and I was terribly moved by that moment  realizing that Jonas and his people don t celebrate life and living  All these good and bad memories had to be held somewhere   that is the Receiver s  Jonas  job  Ultimately  we begin to see that there can never be a utopia without an accompanying dystopia   a yin for a yang  heads for tails  Even for a book like The Giver  targeted to an audience far younger than me  I was hugely impressed by the depth of this novel  by the questions it raises  by how it makes the reader actually think about the consequences of wishing for utopia Although this book is slim and a fast read  Lois Lowry gives a well etched description of Jonas  world  There were some aspects that weren t explained all too well  but they didn t bother me  The ending of the book was very ambiguous  but I don t want to give it away  It was an ending that s fitting in so many ways  and I could see two possible interpretations   one somewhat dismal  the other very optimistic  but however I chose to see it  the message is a happy one and I liked how the author left it to the reader to decide what could have actually happened  As I understand it  the question is resolved in the third book   Messenger  which makes me eager to go grab the next books right away from the library And there s a lot more about this book I want to keep talking about  but then I ll find it hard to stop  I was thrilled to discover that this book has two more sequels and there s a fourth book coming out next year  Mostly I loved how it becomes obvious that you cannot live in a world in any way than how we live in ours   would you rather live in a perfect world with no wars  hunger and famine but no happiness  sadness  family or love  or would you live in the world as we know it with all the horrible evil but with the ability to have feelings  appropriate or not   Our people made that choice  the choice to go to Sameness    pg  95 I m glad there s people like Jonas  willing to take any risk to find the true meaning of happiness  I absolutely loved this book  The plot was perfectly paced for how short it was  and it wasn t choppy like I was expecting  I love the concept and how deep it got  The world is very logical  which appealed to me  I felt calmer whilst reading this book because of how conflict free it was at first  And even when conflict occurred  it didn t seem as bad as it actually was  because honestly you just felt sad for the things that these people had lost  I love this book and hope to see the movie very  very soon  Oh  and the ending was great   La rilettura mi ha permesso di apprezzarlo molto di piu della prima volta  Adesso pero devo recuperare i seguiti    Book Review  The Giver by Lois Lowry This is  by far  one of the best and thought provoking books in the young adult and fiction genre  There are a plethora of books published about perfect worlds and societies  where change is unacceptable and cookie cutter human beings have become part of forced living communities  as a result of the leadership s fear of human will and their determination to right the wrong courses society had taken in the past  The giver is one of them  but unlike the many that surround it  it stands out as one of my top picks for meaningful and thought provoking books appropriate for young adults and the young adult genre The book is centered around Jonas  a young boy who lives within a community of perfect individuals and families  void of sickness and differences  where  although  it is all they know  society is not actually what it seems  Jonas  curiosity throws him in the path of his mother and the chief elder  which spirals his life into a bubble of questions  revelations  and a thought provoking analysis of his community and his life  Once meeting The Giver  an older man who lives outside of the realm of Jonas  community  he is faced with the reality of the  perfect  society in which he lives and is enlightened to the realm of possibilities that exist outside of the rules set in place by the elder community  The Giver  which is the holder of all the memories associated with the community  walks a fine line between accepting his responsibility as the keeper of all these memories  advising the elders on their decisions  and exploring the possibility that maybe these memories are rightfully belonging to the members of this censored community  I recommend this book to all individuals aged 12 and older  and for more context  I would recommend also watching the movie after you ve read the book  as it does cast some critically acclaimed and academy award winning actors as well  This is my review on The Giver  and you can find this review posted on my LeafMarks  BookLikes  GoodReads  and BookBlogging profiles soon  ISBN 10 0544336267ISBN 13 978 0544336261Buy on AmazonBuy on Barnes   Noble This was one of my favorite books as a teenager  and it was fun to revisit it  I remember how intriguing it was to imagine a seemingly perfect world where all major problems had been solved  and the learn pros and cons of it  It is a thought provoking book  and I still love it  This time through  I listened to the audio version narrated by Ron Rifkin  He did a great job for every character except Asher  his interpretation of a pre teen boy voice kind of grated on my nerves  I recommend reading it instead  The Worst part of holding memories is not the pain  It s the loneliness of it  Memories need to be shared I m not going to lie  I felt I was late to the party on this book  It seemed the entire world has read this book but me and once I got my hands on it i knew I had to join in The entire story line was based what it appeared to be in the far future  with history far behind and all forgotten by the general population  Every person has a duty assigned to you on the 12th year of age  Jonas the main character of the story get s assigned as the memory keeper  To me his roll is like a historian but more important because he s the only person besides the current giver of memory who understands the history of their existence  he s the only one who can feel pain and see color  one who can understand morals  After a year of memory keeper training he decides after the discovery the truth of a releasing ceremony he needs to take actions into his own hands  The end of the book is however you perceive it to be  For me I was rather optimistic   The Giver is a book about a 12 year old boy who gets chosen to be the new receiver of his community which is a highly respected job  After receiving wisdom from the Giver for a year  the 12 year old boy  named Jonas  wondered why everyone couldn t experience the same joy he did  So the Giver and Jonas formulated a plan to change things  However  he learns that the newchild of his family will be put down so in order to save the baby he makes a slight but very risky alteration to his plan  After two weeks of traveling to the land called Elsewhere the child and Jonas finally make it there and their success saves his community from the threat of ignorance Jonas is clearly the hero of the story but every hero has a hero and his hero was the Giver  Also known as fifth business   but that s another conversation    The Giver s job was to train Jonas to be the new receiver as the chief elder told the crowd during his selection     Our community has only one Receiver  It is he who trains his successor   61   Throughout the story the Giver is frequently breathing wisdom into him  That s why I like the Giver  I feel as though i could relate to him because often I too have had friends approach me requesting advice  As I share my knowledge our relationship grows stronger as the Giver s did with Jonas especially when he said to him    I love you Jonas   162   The emotion  love  was foreign to the people of their time except for those two  And that s another reason why I like the Giver  He raised a hero with those three words If I were to describe this book in one word  This book was marvelous  there just aren t enough words in my vocabulary to describe it  I like it because it s another  what if  book   What if  this happened   what if  the world was like this  It opens up a new opinion from an interesting point of view  I would recommend this book to anyone between the ages of 10 and 40 who s interested in  what if  books and enjoys investigating new opinions and points of views to better their own knowledge and perception of the world  The scene where Jonas discovers color has stuck with me since I first read The Giver in middle school  This is one of my favorite books of all time because it creates all sorts of imaginative questions in the reader s mind  MILD SPOILERSI really enjoyed reading this book  In fact  for what may actually be the first time ever  I even enjoyed the Introduction by author Lois Lowry  This review does contain some small spoilers  such as laws of the community and practices therein Lowry was well before her time with this book  as evidenced in the upsurge in dystopian literature these days  Written in 1994  The Giver tells the story of a pseudo perfect society where there are many rules  and most people don t break them  It is rare to have a criminal  though there is mention of it   and there wouldn t be rules laws if they weren t needed  Words and language used is precise   you aren t allowed to speak in generalities  and you don t accidentally use the wrong word for something   and these rules are taught at a very  very young age with a discipline wand  As you get older  you are told where to go  what to do  and when to do it  You are to act the same as everybody else  Everything is decided for you by the Elders   who were chosen by the Elders before them and back and back and back   and they make these choices very  very carefully  They decide your vocation  your mate  the name of your allotted two children   one boy  one girl  what you eat  what you wear  Because it is the same for everybody   except for your vocation  There are no real familial relations to anybody else in the community  No emotional bonds to anything  Then there s young Jonas  seemingly a perfect fit in this almost perfect society  But does he  The Giver is an intense  extremely moving  deeply emotional story   and a very interesting concept when it comes to memories and history  and how we use them to gain wisdom  clarity  and guidance  FYI  This review is copy and pasted from my amazon review   Questo romanzo all inizio l avevo preso sottogamba  pensando fosse molto infantile visto anche il protagonista di dodici anni  e invece via via che proseguivo con la lettura mi sono resa conto che in realta i temi trattati sono molto maturi e profondi  Il prezzo del romanzo e un tantino alto rispetto alle pagine e la versione ebook a 8 99 euro e improponibile  considerando che si finisce velocemente io l ho letto in due giorni  Ma visto il prodotto di un ottima qualita si puo anche chiudere un occhio  ma preferirei che le case editrici stabilissero un prezzo non oltre le 10 euro per i libri cartacei e non oltre i 5 euro per gli ebook  ma credo sia una mia utopia  Jonas e il nostro piccolo protagonista  molto maturo per avere solamente 12 anni  Nella sua societa tutto e prestabilito  deciso a priori senza che nessuno si possa ribellare  o piu che altro nessuno sente il bisogno di ribellarsi  quindi compiono le loro azioni quasi come degli automi  L individualita della singola persona viene messa da parte a favore del bene comune  Le donne scelte per essere le partorienti mettono al mondo per tre anni dei nuovi neobimbi  dopo di che vengono assegnate come Lavoranti  I neobimbi invece vengono affidati alle unita familiari un bimbo e una bimba non di piu  La stessa unita familiare  cioe il padre e la madre  sono stati uniti secondo il volere degli Anziani  Una volta che questi bimbi diventeranno adulti i loro genitori verranno assegnati al gruppo degli Adulti senza bambini e dopo di che al centro dove si occupano delle persone anziane  una sorta di ospizio   I nuovi bimbi che verranno assegnati a questi altri bimbi divenuti adulti  in pratica non conosceranno mai i loro nonni  Tutto viene deciso dagli anziani  come il lavoro che una volta adulti si dovra svolgere  Non esistono pulsioni sessuali  chi anche in sogno dovesse provarne viene anestetizzato attraverso una pillola  Non esiste l arte  la letteratura  la pittura  visto che sono stati aboliti i colori  la musica non esiste  Se per la perfezione si deve rinunciare a cosi tante cose  preferisco mille volte la nostra imperfezione del nostro mondo  Certo i lati positivi sono che ora la societa ha un suo equilibrio  nessuno soffre di fame  non ci sono guerre  carestie  malattie  Ma quanto sono importanti le piccole cose che ci circondano  il romanzo mi ha fatto capire anche se in fondo tutti noi lo sappiamo  quanto siano belle le piccole cose  la neve  divertirsi sulla slitta  il sole e il suo calore  i fiori  l arcobaleno  l AMORE senza amore e sentimenti non si puo vivere  Verso la fine il romanzo si fa molto triste e per poco non ho versato qualche lacrima  il nostro protagonista scappera insieme ad un neobimbo che doveva essere congedato  non dico di cosa si tratta per non rovinare la storia a chi leggera il romanzo  ma non e niente di positivo  vengono congedati chi non si comporta bene e infrange le regole  le persone molto anziane e i neobimbi se non idonei   Jonas vuole raggiungere l Altrove  il finale e aperto a libera interpretazione  Ma in fondo e comunque un finale positivo c e una speranza anche se l autrice non ci ha dato la certezza e io voglio pensare in positivo  Libro consigliato a tutti  adulti come bambini  indipendentemente da quale genere preferite  e veramente un libro per tutti molto istruttivo Il post sul mio blog Club Urban Fantasy http   cluburbanfantasy blogspot it 2    It is nothing like books I ve read  It s different It s new It s  I suppose  inspiring  in it s own way And it took me less than 48 hours to read Lois Lowry has managed to give us a visual  or understanding  on how different our lives could be without knowledge  or better yet  love  and pain  and anguish  They re all things we love through every day  and she has managed to show is how things could be without it  What if we couldn t love  Couldn t live with our true families in peace  I can t wait to start the next book  hope it is just as intriguing as the first  5 5 stars for Lowry   Deceptively simple  At first  Then quickly turning creepy  under the layer of fake comfort and cheer  A lollipop you sink your teeth in and find poison  But in the end there is love  And beauty   I   can t   even  I think that if I leave a comment on my status update for the book  it doesn t get saved anywhere  so I m going to start commenting in the review section when I have something other than  omg  and  yay  book  I am rereading this book  because I finally got my hands on the sequels and they were ok  but I remember really connecting with The Giver and I couldn t fully remember why  As a Mormon  this book resonates with me  because it is an imagining of  Satan s Plan  for our life here on earth with everything being the same  there being no real choice  and ultimately  in the end  what is the point  So  for that  I like the book a lot  As I m reading it again now  though  I am seeing the issues of the book playing out more  There is the obvious comparison to the  nanny state  we hear so much about where people are  saved  from their bad decisions by outlawing them  I m not a fan of this practice in general  being of a libertarian mindset  And so I m liking the book a lot for that reason But even more personally  I am at the part of the book now where Jonas is questioning the point of keeping all the negative memories in one place  and the wisdom in not teaching their history to all the people  And I think of the new edition of Huck Finn that is being published where  nigger  is being changed to  slave  throughout the text  That is what is really hitting me this time  because as a homeschooling parent  I look at my kids and I struggle deeply with the issue of how to teach my children about racism and slavery  My kids are not like other kids in that they have lived an internationally life  We currently live surrounded by  brown people   aka Filipinos  They have a grandmom from Mexico  and uncles who are half white half Mexican  I know that there have been studies done on racism in families and generally speaking  parents think their kids are less aware and judgmental of race than they really are  But in our family  I honestly don t think that that is the case  The girls are aware of race  and they don t care  except when there is a language barrier  but that is another issue   They think judging by skin color is ridiculous  They know that there are people who do  and they aren t free from other judgments  In fact  they can be pretty classist at times which bugs me to no end growing up how I did  but we deal with that as needed  And racism isn t an issue for them So  I worry about introducing it to them  I don t like presenting it to them for fear that it will become an option for them  And so at first  the idea of an altered Huck Finn sounded great  But now I m rereading The Giver and I am remembering myself how important it is to remember our history  Not only because it s important for the sake of the present to know how we got to where we are  but because there is a value in knowing the negative and making an active decision to not go there  That is where character comes from  and compassion  and Christ like love where one sees the differences and does not care because it s the individual other who is paramount  We don t study American History until next year  And I m still not looking forward to that part of it  But it s something that they need to know  because it s part of the society they live in and it s part of their development into admirable people to know that that is out there and to turn away from it   What a lovely encouragement that it is better to love and live than it is to be  safe  and guarded and sterile in relationships    The Giver  is about a boy in a futuristic society that has gotten rid of all emotion  when they come of age  the people in this society are assigned to a job based on their skill set  the narrator  Jonas is given the job as receiver of memories  This means he will be given all of the memories of the past from the giver  who is the former receiver of memories  The memories Include happiness  love  pain and sadness  The realization that these feelings exist make Jonas flee the city that he has been in all his life with a baby named Gabriel  who is going to be killed or  released  the next day because he is different  In the wild  Jonas hears music and sees lights in front of him  My favorite character in the book is definitely Jonas  For me  he represents the fact that pain is worth felling if you also feel love  In the final chapter  it is the feelings of love and kindness that get him up the hill  Also  the fact that he does not fit into any normal job and likes many things makes him more like a modern human than any other character in the book  The author probably intended for this reaction to happen  Jonas is the character who displays the theme and describes all of his feelings throughout the book  Overall  the giver was a great book  It is the best book I have read in a long time  I think that it is a great book to read for anyone because it shows that no matter who you are  you still can fell any emotion  The book shows that feelings are quintessential to making us humans what we are  The Giver by Lois Lowry is a must read  I loved it because it is unlike any other book I have ever read  and it has such a wonderful ending  I was in tears by the end of it  The main character  Jonas  lives in a world of black and white  When you turn 12  you are given an assignment  which is your job  until you are  released   Jonas is given the most important job of all  The Receiver  That job means you go to The Giver  who is a man who holds all of the memories of the past  These memories include good things  like snow  sunshine  rain  sledding  and colour  The bad side of it is that there are also bad memories  such as war  a broken bone  a broken heart  and being betrayed by someone  Jonas then learns about true feelings  and he knows he must do what is right and just  What he decides on changes his life forever  While I was reading it  I felt this little thing inside of me saying  OMG this is so much like Hunger games  and City of Ember  and Uglies  it is so going to end just like this   But then  the book started to change my thoughts as I read  I started to love one of the characters  mainly because of how much he reminded me of my little brother when he was that age  The Giver has relatable characters  an amazing storyline  and it is unlike any other book  giving it a really beautiful little ring  The Giver is truly a book about true love  which is one of the many reasons to love it  I reccomend this for anyone who loves books like The Fault In Our Stars  The City Of Ember series  The Hunger Games  or Divergent   My favorite book when I was younger  It ignited my interest in dystopian fiction and led me to 1984  I love this book  and probably will bump to one of my top 10 books of all time  The plot is really interesting from the first chapter down to the last one  I even read Lois Lowry s speech for her award on this book  and it was really inspiring   I have mixed emotions about the story  but in a really good way  It went from curious  to interesting  to dark  to hopeful  I really  really liked this book  One of the best books I ve read in a long time  I was organizing books in our school library and this one crossed my path  I m in my 50 s  read all the time  enjoy books of virtually all genre s and age ranges and had never read it  I took it home and immersed myself in the story  I was completely stunned by the story  wow  It kept my attention and really made me think  I had figured that the book would have been appropriate at the junior high or high school  Was I surprised to find that that isn t the age that this book is assigned  I m not happy that it s considered an appropriate book for 5th graders  especially without any kind of a warning to the kids or their parents about what the story is  I considered the subject material to be too mature for this age level  Specifically in the way that society treats life with very little value  IF the book were handled properly by the teacher  with parents aware of the book and prepared to discuss issues that are brought up by what happens in the story  it could be an excellent book for upper elementary children to read with lots of material for class discussion   This quickly has become one of the best books that I ve ever had the pleasure of experiencing  I just completed reading The Giver for the first time  and I am still digesting it at the moment  I remain in the afterglow of experiencing something so beautiful  so elegant  so thought provoking that I think it may take some days or weeks for me to fully process what I ve just experienced  Right now  all I can do is be thankful for this masterpiece and the joy and wonder I ve received from it  At this point in my life  I d resigned myself to the fact that there was no more joy or wonder for me to experience in this world  but I was so very wrong  Strangely  through this book  I ve experienced a rebirth of sorts reminding me there is still beauty  joy and wonder in this otherwise troubling existence  Before the Hunger Games  after Brave New World and Animal Farm  Lowry creates a dystopian society where life is so perfect that people no longer need to love  or stay alive if they are somehow not perfect  or see in color or figure anything out  At age 12  each child is given a life s assignment  and that is when Jonas discovers that there is a whole new dimension to life than he has ever known   He meets THE GIVER  This man holds all the memories for the whole society  The tragedies  the exhalations and every other degree of feelings in human experience that have been taken from the people so that they can function  perfectly   THE GIVER begins to school Jonas to become the new carrier of emotions  dreams  ideals and passions that are taken from the community  In the relationship that develops  Jonas begins to feel and see not only the intense pain that humanity has endured  but the great beauty and triumph too  He s determined to find a way to freedom from this  perfect painless society   and is encouraged to do so by THE GIVER   His quest involves attempting to save Gabriel  an imperfect infant  Jonas runs away with Gabriel to an entirely different world where the freedom to see  and to think and to accept life s true complexities becomes  after all  more than perfect    WOW I am truly amazed by this book    The writing is so wonderful  I loved Gabe so much and Rosemary s story truly shocked me  I loved every minute of this book  There were tons of moments that I was left stunned or shocked  I only wished we knew what happened to the community and Jonas and Gabe LOVE THIS BOOK     I just re read The Giver for the second time since middle school  and it meant much more to me now than it did back then  This really was the first novel of its kind  a broken society that is mended by taking away choice  feelings and even color  I wish the ending would show what happens  but Lowry is trying to make a point about the society that Jonas left  not the one he is heading to  The Giver portrays hardship  choice  and opposition as the best gift you can get  This book has been on my radar  for what seems like an incredibly long time  I m not sure why I hadn t read it yet  but I m so glad that I finally got around to reading it  The Giver is mentioned as one of the original YA dystopian books  I know it s read quite widely in American schools but I feel like it slipped off the radar when The Hunger Games  Divergent and others like it became popular  The movie adaptation definitely brought it back to my consciousness  that s when I was reminded that I wanted to read it  I always try to read the book first The Giver follows a world in which every choice individuals make are limited  The community that you live in controls your life  This is even to the extent of the role you play in society  Everyone has a role to play in society  and that role is picked for the people  The world in which individuals live in features no fear or pain  Our main protagonist Jonas is picked to receive special training from The Giver  The Giver is an incredibly important person in this community  because they alone hold memories of pain and pleasure The Giver is a short  but powerful read that makes you question what it would be like to live in a community that completely controls your life  If you ve read this book after The Hunger Games  Matched  Divergent  or most other dystopian reads     and not realised that The Giver came first  then you might think the ideas explored are not particularly original  However  The Giver was published in the  90s  so its ideas were both scary and exciting at the time This book is part of a quartet  which I knew going into it  I think if you didn t know that then you might be incredibly frustrated by the ending  The ending seems quite frustrating anyway  as it s open ended  I m intrigued to see what the next book is like  Luckily I have my hands on a copy already    I LOVE this book  It is so well written  So many people say that this book is not good for my age   grade 6  age 12  but i do understand it and i enjoyed reading every word  There are some sad parts in this book but there are also parts in this book that make you not want to put the book down  It just draws you in  The start is a bit slow i will emit but once you get up to when he is in training for his job it draws you in to keep reading  Still once you get in to this book you just cant put it down  It is such a great and entertaining book that is near the top of my fav book list  Can t believe I ve never read this before  I read this book a long time ago and must say it is one of my favorites   I thought that this book was well written and directed perfectly  It had that touch to it that didn t just make it a good book  but a great one  After reading a couple of pages I was hooked to it  This book is about 12 year old Jonas living in a perfect world where there s no color no twins and absolutely no freedom  However Jonas is chosen to be the Giver  a rare and very important job  That s when he finds out that what was happening to the twins when they were released was that they were being killed  injected with poison I would recommend this book to people who can catch on to a book easily  because it takes a while for this book to start getting interesting to younger audiences  However this was truly an amazing book and I would read it again  An all time favorite  Could read this one over  over and over  I had heard terrible reviews from peers in school  When it came time for me to read it  I was very negative about it  But  I was instantly caught in it and could not put it down  I dreaded the bell ringing at the end of English class  And  that is saying something  Since elementary school I have read it a number of times  Each time the story gets more touching  My husband keeps begging me to watch the movie with him  But  I refuse until he reads it   It s the future and the perfect society exists  Sameness  Everybody is equal  No body has to make choices  Everything is the same  There is nothing but peace  There is no emotion  no pain  no hunger  no inconvenience  You are assigned a partner  y all are assigned two children  you raise them until they are adults  then you live with childless adults until you are too old and get  released   Jonas is 11  awaiting his 12th birthday so he will be assigned his occupation  He gets that of Receiver of Memory  When Sameness happened  all the strong memories had to go somewhere  and that is the role of the Receiver of Memory  to hold all the memories and feel all of the emotions  Jonas forms a bond with the previous Receiver  named the Giver  as well as a child his parents were assigned  Gabriel   The Giver and Jonas decide that this society of emotionless people is not right  that no one can experience true joy because they haven t experienced true pain  They decide that something has to change  so they make a plan to disperse the memories to the people  But will it work  Will this just put Jonas  the Giver  Gabriel  and all the people in trouble  I read this for the first time this week and I liked it a lot  I liked that it served as a simple reminder that emotions  good and bad  are worth it  They are what makes us human  that s what the human experience is all about  I think presenting this to teenagers is a great idea  it wouldn t hurt to remind them that the struggles they are going through at the time are worth it  that they make the happiness even brighter   By far a better  dystopian  story than either The Hunger Games or The Divergent series  Also  not quite the  scary  prospect of a futuristic dystopia like Orwell s 1984 or Bradbury s Fahrenheit 451  This is the epitome of the engineered community and yet it is still flawed and the Giver knows it and yet can t fix it despite his wisdom  Instead  someone new must come along and look at the society with new eyes in order for true growth and learning and progression to be able to take place  Wonderful characters  Wonderful writing style  Believable plot and conflicts within the plot  Excellent character development and emotion within the Giver and Jonas    I just finished reading The Giver for the third time  Each reading left me with new insights and a better understanding  In fact  three of my grown children and I have decided to read this book  and the next four in the series in order to share our thoughts and discuss where we think Ms  Lowry is going  What does it mean to live in a community of sameness  where choice is obsolete  Pain and fear is eliminated  but is that a good thing  Roles are assigned and citizens that are no longer useful are celebrated and released  But what does that mean  I found The Giver to be completely engaging and provocative  Our discussion group is always stimulating and lively  It is no wonder that this book is a Newberry Medal winner  What a great read  I ve got to say but this book is the best book I ve have ever read so far if I had known about this book I would have read if all the time instead of any other book I loved it so much I cried it felt so real right in front of me and what s the good part of this book it has series and a movie     just imagine the world without either humanity and color it will be like a stolen thing from us and we people have no place in this world without humanity  I recommend this book to all people of all ages but when I told my little sister about he book she was going crazy she is just a fourth grader and wanting to read if she even thought that this things happened for real she though that Jonas was a hero for saving the world but when I told her it was dystopian she just laughed it made melaugh how younger kids just think that every thing they see hear or get is all real and that was the purpose of having a hero in the end this book it made me cry in the end just imagine a world without the word love would we live        I remember reading this book over the summer when I was grounded  and it was probably the best book I read at that time  The things introduced into this book felt so real and I could have good pictures in my head about the story  i could picture what was going on because it was so detailed  People call this book   great   and  good  but I think its way more than that  Words can barely describe it  My favorite character is  Jonas  He seemed to be a very wise person and he is very serious about the things he s doing  I liked the part when he is just learning how to train with the Giver  This was just a very good book  Very interesting as well The Giver This book   I had no expectations  hadn t read any reviews or heard conversations of it that made me want to read it  I didn t expect anything  so a lot of it was confusing  The simple descriptions bugged me at first because I wasn t sure what Lois was talking about at some points  But the moment I got the information it all made sense and I was hooked  I have yet to read the rest of this series but that will soon be remedied  I love this book and can t wait to see what s to come    I commonly get interested in a book immediately when it is not one of those books which you can easily pick up the theme in movies  The Giver by Lois Lowry caught my attention right at the moment I started reading it  The book is a classic  It has so many lessons in it that teaches many things in life  The concept of the book is spectacular  and I was truly glad about it  Erasing memories of people so that everyone would be equal  organized  and wouldn t feel the pain of feelings and the past  The lesson is wonderful  Everyone wants to get rid of feelings that tend to demolish us inside  In the book  life seemed easier  People taking their  stirrings  to get rid of unwanted emotions  Although what I liked most was the fact that the book taught us that feelings are all part of life  so are the events in the past  These are things that shouldn t be erased   Surely war happens and they destroy many things  and of course  people  but it still isn t a reason to delete the past from everyone s life  The past may hurt people  and feelings may break someone  but still they are all part of what makes us live  Even if they can destroy someone  they can also create a person  The book was marvelous  The main character being the receiver saw what pain was  but also saw the joy that real things in life brought  He fought for color once again  and the true meaning of living by bringing back to everyone feelings that are to be felt  The characters in the story were all given the chance to do a part  which is something I really like  The world described in the story isn t something hard to imagine  it is given in detail  and it sure fits the concept of the story  The book is short  but the ending was satisfying  and so is the pace of the story  It is simply written  and though it may be a children s story  it could be read by everyone  Especially those who lack understanding of what life means  I recommend it to everyone  The story of the book isn t just a story  but it is also valuable in our lives  so I definitely gave it 5 stars   This book is about a kid named Jonas he just turned 12 years old and receives special training for his job kind of thing  I recommend this book to to people who likes really good books       THIS WAS AMAZING         the ending though     why why why      I think this book will stay with me for a long long time   everyone should read it and i will definitely watch the movie as soon as possible    Originally I plucked this book off the shelf of choices for required reading in high school  This was during a very painful time in my life  when I didn t have much interest in much of anything  The Giver changed that There s a sense of hopeless hope that carries throughout the entirety of the book  It s one of those stories that are so well written that you can t bring yourself to read it again simply because of the multitude of emotions it s able to bring forth Well  it s been over a decade for me  With the new movie out  I finally bought a copy and will be revisiting this gorgeously written story once more  Hopefully before I see the movie  This review will be updated as needed once I finish  For a suburban kid like me  I related wholeheartedly to Jonas  life when I read this book in sixth grade  My community was safe  well maintained  organized and extremely homogenous  much like Jonas  community  For the most part  every family was concerned with  sameness  as well  Our  rules  stated the colors you could paint your house and how high a fence could be built on your own property  The police were called for any aesthetic infraction  I had very few choices growing up in my community  and I was strongly discouraged from taking any risks that could in any way be dangerous  I can see now that my choices were limited by the fear of wrong choices  The PTA moms would have probably agreed with the Elders on the choice issue As I read this book  I began to question what life was like outside of my quaint suburban bubble and my fascination for everything  different  began  I wanted to know what kind of depth I might be missing  The Giver inspired my interest in other cultures and sparked my later interest in joining the Peace Corps  Without reading this book  I may have missed out on the most fulfilling experiences and deep understandings of my life  The message of The Giver was right    If he had stayed  he would have starved in other ways  He would have lived a life hungry for feelings  for color  for love   I can t agree more  I ve experienced more discomfort that I ever imagined as I traveled and followed a  risky  path in my life  but the depth it brought me was worth it all  I m sure Jonas discovered the delights of diversity and the wisdom one gains from experiencing the whole spectrum of humanity  I recommend The Giver to anyone  especially a kid who is yearning for something more  It s also an excellent book to re read  The Giver is one of my favorites  and it is labeled as a classic  I think it is probably one of the only Dystopian classics  I had read it a few times before  but I wanted to read it again for this class  As I was doing some research I came across some ideas in which in the end Jonas and Gabe both die  freeze to death  The house with music and such being a pre death hallucination  As long as you ignore the fact that this book is part of a quartet  The possible death ending made me kind of sad  but  I liked it in a nostalgic way  It was a firm piece of closure for a really great book  The society take euphemisms to the extreme  They cheer the  release  when in fact death is really ugly  Of course  we use them as well  when we say so and so is  in a better place    with the angels  etc    None of which are good options  I guess the pill takes away the ugliness of death  along with everything else  Everyone is assigned jobs  and lives that have no real meaning or emotion  JOnas becomes the receiver and sees another way of life  I enjoyed reading about his struggles in life and his bonds with the infant Gabe  I am not sure yet  which ending I would have preferred   This grey dystopian novel left me with a sense of utter confusion over whether the world was really a dystopia  One person s dystopia is another s utopia  I guess  It s not even really a true dystopia   much like Brave New World  no one was really suffering  It really forces you question whether your own perception of suffering is all that important in the grand scheme of things  One would be tempted to say its a dystopia because of the sameness and the lack of choice and the loss of emotional depth   but at the end I really had to ask   So what    After reading The Giver my junior year of high school  I found and intensely new appreciation for my senses that continues to expand the more I live on  Just the use of color  the absence of it and then the discovery of it  is such a remarkable concept to incorporate into writing  This is surely not the only book that directs a reader s attention toward the finer tunings of our sensual perceptions  but it is written in such a simple way that it might be one of the only books that gives the phenomenon of color real meaning and relatable depth  The coming of age aspect of the novel also strikes home in terms of writing  Jonas s existence in such a seemingly perfect world is rocked by the discovery of the  other   that a reality exists behind the superficial reality which is perceived by the senses  The toughest concept to accept is that the senses are the gateway  therefore we must become more in touch with our senses in order to break through to this hidden reality  The Giver teaches Jonas this lesson  just as the novel teaches the reader the same  So good  This book changed my life when I read it in 5th grade  I recently read it again as an adult  worried that I wouldn t feel the same attachment  It was still there  Fantastic  thought provoking read  I have seen this book everytime I swing by my local bookstores and I always pick it up  look at it and then put it back to the shelf  I always think to myself that the book wasn t for me because it seemed so old and like a classic  but a lot of my friends seem to enjoy this one  So before the movie comes out  I figured why not give it a shot  Jonas  the main character  is an eleven year old boy living in a perfect society  Everything is in order and people aren t really presented with a lot of choices because the committee decides almost everything for the whole community  I found the ceremonies particularly interesting because people are given and presented with different things that can serve as their identifications  For instance  the Nines are given their own bikes which may serve as a sign of independence  Also  the Twelves being given their role in the Society  I think  somehow this reflects to our society nowadays  having people be grouped together based on their age groups  I also liked the idea of The Giver and The Receiver  It gives a sense of passing on wisdom to the next generation  only here it s almost everything has been passed to The Receiver  I liked the twists and turns of the story  It s very compelling Honestly  I am so happy I have finally read this book  It s really amazing how such story was fit in less than 200 pages  I loved the concept of the story  I was in awe and was imagining how such community will function nowadays  I m so glad this book is being used as a required read in the American Education System  I hope one day it s going to be used here in the country because there are a lot of things that you can learn from this book Love this book so much       Should I really say love I should say I am filled with emotion considering that the book doesn t let the community know what love is  I really recommend this book to anyone who likes crying over a book like myself The Giver What if everything you knew was a lie  What if you had the power to open everyone s eyes to those lies  Jonas lives in a perfect world  There are no choices  pain  or fear  There is no war or doubt  But what if all that changed  Every December a group of children become Twelves  This is when they are assigned a role in the community  Jonas is selected to be become the Receiver of Memories  Trained by the Giver  he learns of a world completely opposite to what he knows   The Giver is a wonderful book that demonstrates the significance of memories and how important it is to remember and respect the past  You can t just forget bad things because you are ashamed  you have to remember them in order to learn from the mistake so you don t make it again  Written by Lois Lowry  The Giver keeps you guessing until the end  It is very entertaining and is marvelously written even though the ending was highly confusing  Having said that I would love to read this book again  I think that it is one of the best books I have ever read  At times  I felt angry with the way things were turning out and I wished that the author would have written it differently  however  now I am happy in the way Lois Lowry wrote the book  Also  I got confused frequently  but eventually all of my questions were answered sooner or later  My favorite part of the book was when Jonas started his training with the Giver and started receiving memories  His confusion really demonstrated what the world was like  As Jonas received memories it helped you understand the situation that the world was in  Of course  my favorite character was Jonas because he had the bravery to defy all that he knew for what he believed in  Additionally  after I got into the plot I felt like hating a lot of people  except Jonas and the Giver  even though they were completely incompetent that what they were doing was wrong  I did not like it when you learned the truth about the Release  Even though you knew what was really happening from context clues it was still hard to actually hear because it was so horrible and sad   In conclusion I thought that this book had more good parts than it had bad  It is a great story line and it is very exciting  It made me want to never put the book down and to keep reading late into the night  On a scale of one to five I would rate this book a five because it was beautifully written and it had a good plot  It teaches you the importance of memories and the consequences of forgetting the past I really love this book  but I thought it was a little too short  But I still need to read the rest of the series because the ending was such a cliffhanger  Thank you Lois Lowry  for providing such a wonderful book to help me discuss the complexities of rules  emotions and ethical societal issues with my children   and also for reminding me of what is most important in life  A beautiful  painful but ultimately rewarding read not only for YAs  I m going to buy the four series set on line  Highly recommended  Category  Science FictionPublication date  1993Annotation is posted above via GoodReadsThemes  Rules and order  safety vs  choices  traditions and customs

about what it is like to no longer have any choices  and also describe their feelings about their new name and job  Other information  As noted repeatedly by the ALA  this book is often on the most challenged banned book list  It would be best for older children  such as sixth graders  A great story the second time around  Having read this book a decade ago  I had forgotten just how amazing this book is  Chapter book without pictures  this one is targeting the older readers  maybe as young as junior high  The story line is one that is hypothetical  yet almost conceivable  The character is a young twelve year old  so readers of many ages can really relate to him enough to enjoy this book  A wonderful concept with descriptive writing for any reader to appreciate and love  Good read    The Giver  by Lois Lowry  is a retelling of a young boy named Jonas  Who finds himself in a difficult  but yet not so difficult way of life  In Jonas community  it is a perfect environment  free of crime  anger  and uncertainty  But with a so called   perfect life   there comes consequences  Yes  you might be thinking   it is a perfect life  everything has to be alright   but what you done see is that when everything is given to you  and you do not make anything yourself  it becomes unbearably boring but there is one thing you also do not see  when there is no crime  no anger  there is also no emotion  Yes  I said it  absolutely no emotions  including love  And for a matter of fact  you can not choose your fate  It is given to you when you are the broad age of twelve that is not much time for being a kid in Jonas s world  Now you are probably wondering to yourself   why go to such extremes at such a young age   and my favorite   I thought you said this was a perfect lifestyle   Well that is just the point my friend  this is not a perfect lifestyle  It is a place of the ordinary  no one knows how anything truly happens in life  Well there is one person who may or may not know  but that is for you to read about    Wait  wait  wait     do not turn the page of this magazine just yet  You might think The Giver is just another book in the shelf  No  no  no my friend  Lois Lowry did not just write this book because she thought it would of been easy  Lowry choose Jonas to represent herself  Jonas is a way for her to express a way she feels about society  Jonas is stuck in a world where you have restrictions  She is trying to say that she thinks that most people do not know what to do with there life and much like the giver himself  only few comprehend what life truly is  and what to do with it  The Giver is just a retelling of what teens are feeling  It is emotional  inspirational  and it is just a piece of pure fundamental happiness  This book is a sense of Lois Lowry at her best she puts everything to point  She has the book written in a way  that if you did not know this was a book  you would of thought that it was a diary that she wrote  I personally loved this book  because it highlights each and every small details  and it also makes it seem like you are there in the book  living your life with Jonas  I would one hundred and ten percent recommend this book to anyone  My class and I read this amazing book that I loved called  The Giver   and it s about this boy named Jonas and his world is   well perfect  Jonas is turning twelve and is going to get his new job  He is singled out of everyone and is picked to be the new receiver and is going to be helped by The Giver  Jonas will have to face the pain and happiness of what life really holds  There is no turning back  I really like how futuristic it is and I also think the theme of the story is to choose your own path and don t let anybody control your life  I would recommend it to people that love sci fi books  I also think that this story is a very touching story that is sad and also happy at times  some examples of these times was when Jonas saw the video of the baby twin brother being released and another time was when Jonas was picked to be the new receiver  Thank You  Not a long read  I finished it in maybe two hours  Really good  I was hooked from the first page   view spoiler  The ending made me cry  I saw it as Jonas hallucinating before he froze to death  which of course was terribly sad but also felt like the right sacrifice to make for the community to be able to break free of their Sameness  However I ve heard the ending interpreted literally  too  Of course I want the characters to have happy endings  but for me the story almost loses some of its power if Jonas doesn t die   hide spoiler   I really liked this book as a distopian novel because of the society that was described  It is interesting because it is kind of like communism without one real leader  but there is still extreme involvement of the government in everyone s lives  Also  for the first time in my life  I began to fully appreciate color  This book really made me think   I first read The Giver over a decade ago  when I was in elementary school and our classrooms participated in the reading assessment program  Accelerated Reader  Now  after revisiting the story as a post college graduate  I must say that I had an entirely different reading experience altogether As a child  I remember this book being one of my favorite reads during that particular school year  It may have been the very first time that I delved inside the world of dystopian fiction  and I found the concept to be new  fresh  and exciting  The diction was simple and easy enough for me to understand  and I passed the AR assessment test with flying colors  never forgetting the world of Jonas and the Receiver for many years to come Well    in a nutshell  this book is still fantastic  even for a twenty three year old  It is much  much shorter than I remember it being  I read it in just one sitting   but the characters are still just as dynamic and colorful in their rather colorless world  Despite the fact that dystopian fiction has blown up and taken over literature in recent years  this novel still stands boldly as  the original   and it suitable for readers of all ages  although probably more meaningful and full of depth for those over eighteen  Once a favorite  always a favorite  I think The Giver is an expertly put together book that deserves many awards  The fictionally made utopia in the book has many laws and a very well made government governs how every single person lives  Everyone has no choice which makes the book thrilling because you have to wonder if the main character Jonas will start to make his own decisions  This book is pretty dull in the beginning because the author is trying help you understand the lifestyle of the characters in the book  The author succeeds in explaining the plot throughout the novel  Nothing in this book was obvious or expected  The character development was done all at once instead of only one person at a time  This method of character developing helps the reader like or dislike the characters earlier in the story  When all of these components are put together to make a wonderful novel   I was riveted from the first chapter  I am not quite sure what has kept me away from reading The Giver for so long   if I m being honest with myself it s probably the cover  which is such a shame because it is such a beautifully crafted story  The world building is exquisite  in that you as the reader get a clear picture  and such a sense of what living there must be like from the first few chapters  The characters and their lack of individuality in this Utopian world are beautifully written  because despite their oneness you still relate to them I figured that at some point the story would kick into the next gear  but I was perfectly happy if it never did  Upon finishing the story  I had to take a few moments to process what I had read before I could decide if I was happy with the ending  When the fog cleared I loved it  I would absolutely recommend this book to everyone  even those that think they would not enjoy it  The Giver was first introduced to me by Geordane  and then I encountered it again after reading Veronica Roth s Divergent I finished reading the book for less than a day because it was really gripping  The Giver centered on Jonas and his community  and it started with Jonas  apprehension about the Ceremony of Twelve  a ceremony where the twelve year olds of their community are given their Assignments  During the Ceremony  nineteen  Jonas  number  was skipped by the Chief Elder  He thought that he was not qualified to any Assignment  but after the last one in his group was called  the Chief Elder explained why she skipped Jonas  Jonas was selected to be the new Receiver of Memory  the most honored position in the community  At first  I thought that the community in which Jonas lived was perfect  It seemed nice to have everything planned for you  like the things you wear  food you eat  and whether you are eligible for a spouse or to have children  A community that encourages a time where members of a family unit share their feelings  worries  and dreams  It seemed ideal  I even pictured myself as a Nurturer or training in Law and Justice  not until I got to the latter part where the oh so perfect community showed its flaws  The process of releasing inadequate newchildren and the Old disturbed me  By the end of the novel  Jonas and Gabriel climbed the top of a hill where it was snowing  There was a sled which Jonas  while carrying Gabriel  got on and rode it downhill  As they were going downhill  Jonas had a similar experience to the Christmas memory that the Giver gave him  and he heard something  music  Lois Lowry wrote a rather puzzling ending to The Giver  It is the kind of ending that would haunt its readers long after they have read it  The Giver will leave you thinking about what happened to the characters  Did Jonas and Gabriel really get to Elsewhere safely  Did they end up somewhere else  Or did they die  Lowry left a lot of things for the readers to ponder on  Generally  I think that The Giver was skillfully written and I commend Lois Lowry s genius for coming up with such fascinating story  Young Adult Audio BookI picked this book up because I wanted to see the movie coming out  Also  our 6th graders in the school read it as an opener to their dystopia genre study  This book is incredibly thought provoking  I am surprised it s typically a middle school read  In all honesty I think it is a fabulous adult book  If I had to pick a book it reminded me of I would say Hand Maiden s Tale  It builds a world in which emotions have no place  it s a cold and clinical society  I plan to read the next 3 books   The Giver  book One This community  which is all Jonas knows of the World  is small  contained  controlled    Communist or Socialist in nature  everyone leads a heavily planned life  Children are not biologically related to parents  they are assigned  As are Spousal Partners whose only task pleasure is to raise 1 boy and 1 girl   no connubial duties  Each year in December  all children of an age are advanced one year  4s become 5s  etc  with new privileges allowed that year  Everyone is on the same path At 12  the children receive their Adult Assignments  from Nurturer  takes care of Newchildren infants  to Birthmother and Laborer  considered bottom in prestige   JOnas is Appointed   an unusual  job   to be the Receiver  whatever that is  because the current Receiver is getting old  And because he s passing on his knowledge  HE becomes the Giver of the title Written simply yet eloquently  most of the revelations come in between the lines  The Reader immediately begins to compare his her life to the events in this book  finding all the  holes  in this society  wondering just HOW such a society could become Things the Receiver experiences so the common folk don t have to  real pain  no medication if you re the Receiver   anguish  isolation  neglect  hunger  deep knowledge of consequences  starvation  warfare  being cold  destruction  burdened with the knowledge of all this  birthday parties  being special  unique  proud  snow  excitement  exhilaration  exhaustion  sleds  hill  unpredictable weather  sunshine and sunburns  no wind  COLOR  different skin colors  rainbows  animals of ANY kind  weaponry  CHOICE  fear  mostly   sadness  grief  books  diverse  unnecessary  knowledge  LOVE  injustice  cruelty  passions  art  music  the ability to feel At the end  I felt SAD  SO SAD  I SO wanted the book to end differently  Such a good book  I first read it when I was in elementary school  but wanted to reread it as an adult since I remember it being good  The protagonist is born into a world that is perfect  However  do to his new job as Receiver he finds out that his world seems perfect because everyone is oblivious to what s actually going on around them Lowry is an incredible writer  She s able to describe in 179 pages what other authors aren t able to describe in 400   Dimly  from a nearly forgotten perception as blurred as the substance itself  Jonas recalled what the whiteness was     beautiful  I had no idea until recently  when my wife pointed it out to me  that there are three companion books to the Giver  I d read The Giver years ago  so I picked it up again and continued to read right through the other three and couldn t put them down  If you haven t already read the whole  series   I highly recommend reading Gathering Blue  Messenger  and Son  You ll be glad you did  Loved this book  Yes  this is the kind of story I thoroughly enjoy reading  None of that YA fluffy superficial stuff  This story really makes you think about what it would be like to have our agency taken away  although there were a few flaws in my opinion  For example  if the people didn t feel anything like love  then why did Jonas  father want to take Gabe home to see if he would get better  If he didn t care  he would have just released him from the very beginning  Right  And  how did Jonas even escape if they were constantly being monitored  I didn t want to analyze the story too much but the ending almost made me feel like I was watching the final episode of LOST  did Jonas leave Elsewhere in the first place just to go to some subconscious world for a day  I guess I ll just have to read the next two books in the trilogy  Anywho  I still think the story was very well written and one of the best books I ve read lately  for that I give it 5 stars   So loved this book  It made me gasp out loud and that doesn t happen often  The Giver is a story about a boy who grew up in a  colorless world  where  sameness  is valued and differences have been illuminated to prevent trouble or war  It is the winner of the 1994 John Newberry Metal  which awards based on the criteria  Marked by eminence and distinction  noted for significant achievement    Marked by excellence in quality    Marked by conspicuous excellence or eminence    Individually distinct The book is individually distinct because it spoke of a futuristic  almost other dimensional world of almost black and white  and how to live in that kind of world is to not live at all I chose it for my collection because it is a marvelous little story that celebrates all the differences that we as human beings have to bring to the world  and it is something that all children should know about  I read this aloud to my children and was more touched than they were  I still see an image of people on a sleigh going into a wintry town one evening  I don t remember why  but I remember it felt and feels comforting  Still  Jonas   Ceremony of twelve  is rapidly approaching and he is eager to find out what his assignment will be  In the community that Jonas has grown up in  words are chosen with care  children are placed with parents  and each year a child gets older he or she receives new privileges and responsibilities  Jonas would have never guessed what his assignment would be  but it changes his life forever  He is to become the new receiver  the holder of the community s memories  a job that has many responsibilities as well as mysteries uncovered that Jonas is shocked to learn As a fan of the dystopian novel  I found myself completely wrapped up in Jonas  story and his livelihood  I felt just as shocked as he was to find out the truth about his community and the life he never knew he could have  or the life he was living  I wish that I had not waited so long to read this book  I feel that this is a title I would recommend to tween readers  especially boys  I also would recommend this book to other dystopian novel fans This is a great example of fantasy fiction that I think would be great to read in a classroom setting  It would really get tweens thinking about what if they were living in a community like Jonas  What if they were chosen to take on his assignment  I also think that it is a great choice for a tween library book club as well  Awards  ALA Popular Paperbacks  2010  Newbery Medal  1994 Characters  Jonas  The Giver  Lily  Gabriel

really loved this book and couldn t put it down  The idea just seemed to unique  it was written in 1993  so it was all before the whole dystopian wave took over the book market  and it didn t seem like a cheap romance novel  It focuses on Jonas and The Giver  who maintains the memories of an early society  much likely to ours   These memories are important to Jonas society because everything there has an order and a purpose  also people get jobs assigned depending on their talents  Or they have to apply for a partner for kids etc     The Giver is there to help the heads of society to make important decisions with these early memories Jonas  who gets assigned as the Receiver of Memories  alias the future Giver  learns about the early societies and doesn t want to accept the way it is now  Also there is baby Gabriel  a baby that isn t really fitting into their society and is assigned to get released  nobody in this society knows what actually happens when somebody gets released   So Jonas has to make a decision in which the Giver is more than helpful So  as I see it  the book is about doing the right thing when everyone and their grandma are against it simply because they are told that the current way of living is the best way possible  If you re talked to in this way for years  you simply acknowledge it as the truth  can be applied to today s ways as well   But by simply thinking outside the box  you realize that there is more than you believed in first place  This book is a book I have read over and over again and every time I read it I bring something different out of it  That is the true strength of this book  The world that Lois Lowry builds is so rich and detailed that every time you read it there is something new  Even as you age there is something new you will see with each age group you enter  The greatness of this book comes from the growing sense of unease  At first the community doesn t seem like all that bad of a place  The way this book slowly shows you just what it means to live in this community is why it stands apart from other dystopian books  There is no big statement that the community is not what it seems  Instead there are small clues along the way that make you uncomfortable  It s in a strange statement or a punishment or a word that is no longer used that you see how the world is  There is no long explanations about the community it is all shown to you  The thing I love about this book and the reason why I keep coming back is that this book gives you no answers  I makes you wonder and think the way the best books always do   Wow  this book was seriously amazing  My 13 year old daughter read it in English class this year and she insisted I read it  I have been feeling bogged down from the onslaught of dystopian hysteria escalated by The Hunger Games  which  by the way  I read before the madness started   The Giver feels like a refreshing look at the distant future  only to learn it was originally published in 1993    WHAT  Lowry deserves every literary award she has received from this amazing story Jonas was chosen for  arguably  the most important and largely difficult jobs in this white wash world he lives in  He becomes the keeper  the Receiver  of all memories  Memories of color  love and happiness  now banished from his world of  sameness   But also memories of pain  hatred and war  the sole reason his job was most grueling  As the Receiver of memories  Jonas will hold all the joy and all the pain of worlds past allowing his predictable  uniform civilization continue There are two things l really loved about The Giver  First  I appreciated the author s construction of Jonas learning love and family for the first time  Each time Jonas was taking in a new memory  I imagined discovering it along with him  Guessing what the memory was before it was revealed  Lowry s interpretation was simply ingenious  Second  her insinuation that pain and suffering is necessary for the world as we know it today is quite brave  It s a reminder to me  I am who I am because of the happiness and the anguish I have felt in my life  Without those experiences  I would be in a world of sameness too   The Giver  by Lois Lowry was an amazing and interesting science fiction read  The setting takes place in a community in the far future  The main character is a teenage boy named Jonas who is at first struggling to figure out where he will fit in for the rest of life  In his community  you make no choices and all decisions are made for you by a council of elders  Once you reach a certain age  they decide what job you will work at for the remainder of your life as an adult  Jonas is selected to be the Receiver of Memory  an important job that is very rare to be chosen for  He struggles with the tasks that he has to face and the pain he will have to endure This book was very well written with some difficult vocabulary that only seemed to make it more mysterious  At some points  it was confusing to read because not everything is explained at first  but it was also nice because it makes you think as a reader  I chose this book because I m interested in seeing the movie that will come to theaters soon and now I can t wait to see it  The book is apart of a four book series that I will definitely continue to read  Some may not catch onto the plot right away  but I would recommend it to certain people who would enjoy the genre of science fiction  The writing style in general that the author used is very mysterious  but they did a great job of describing a whole new world with concepts and ideas that don t exist in our modern world  I love  The Giver  and can t wait to start the next book in the series  The town and its society may seem perfect at first glance  but you are immediately hit with a feeling there s something fishy going on  Kids assigned their bikes  comfort objects  etc   at a certain age in a ceremony   this overly controlled and ritualized behaviour doesn t bode well  And we soon find out why  Individuals who don t fit the mould or are not useful for the society anymore are eliminated  The scary part is that no one bats an eye  It s normal to be assigned a life time job at 12  to feel nothing when babies and elderly are killed off  It s normal to be assigned a life partner based on your job profile and community needs  given a child born by  breeders   and so forth  I believe every reader gets the chills when more of the atrocities are slowly revealed to us  Poor Jonas gets the shock of his life when he shares memories of the past with the Giver  He receives horrible memories of war  death  hate  but also memories of holidays  play  and colours  These people live without the ability to see colour and without the emotions colours call forth  Their colour blindness extends to human interaction and compassion as well  No books for them either  No wonder that first signs of a coming dictatorship are press censure and banned books  closed libraries So  this rather short book  by today s standards  is still a great read  I don t know about the movie adaptation  but read the book  It will open your eyes to certain things  while reminding you of several dystopia books it inspired  Despite the ambiguous ending  you will enjoy it   One of the best books I have ever read  Jonas lives in a world of sameness  where his community s Elders make all important decisions  selecting jobs  spouses  and children for each citizen  When Jonas turns twelve  he is assigned the most important of all jobs   view spoiler   Receiver of Memories  He begins spending time with the old Receiver  who calls himself The Giver   and learns all about the world before sameness  both good and bad  and begins questioning his friends  his parents  and his whole life  When Jonas learns that a newchild he has become attached to  Gabriel  is scheduled for Release  ie death   he decides to take Gabe and leave    hide spoiler  The Giver won the Newbery Medal in 1994 and is considered the first children s dystopian book  It tells a traditional coming of age story  with Jonas learning about the harsh realities of life  not only in the world at large  but also within his own community  Because it is a dystopian  readers are also learning along with Jonas  seeing what drastic measures the community has gone through to try to create a perfect and harmonious world  They  along with Jonas  are able to see the benefits and drawbacks to this kind of living and can contrast it with their own way of life  Booklist calls this book   an especially good introduction to the genre because it doesn t load the dice by presenting the idea of a community structured around safety as totally negative   Best for middle schoolers and older  it would be a good book to begin discussions of dystopian worlds  One of the best books you will ever read  Read as a child and then re read every five years or so  You will have a new  profound reaction each time  This book takes place in what seems to be a picture perfect world    only it isn t  This book poses the question   Is ignorance really bliss   Well wrtitten with with a perfectly paced plot  Once you start  you ll want to finish   I read this back in high school  and with the upcoming release of the movie version  and since this was a relatively short book  I decided to pick it up again  I enjoyed it  It was a simple story but still wrought with emotions  I liked the flow of the narration  It captured the orderliness of the community perfectly  I could understand why the community would want Sameness  because who wants to experience loss and sadness  But they were also missing out on so many good memories and feelings  I liked experiencing Jonas s confusion and development as he gained memories  and how he tried to hold onto the Sameness since that s what he knew  I remembered this book ending with a cliffhanger and being annoyed  Now that I know it s a whole series  I ll be continuing on  I m interested to see if we revisit Jonas s community  what happened to the Giver  what happens to Jonas and Gabe  and will that lost Caleb make an appearance  I can t wait to see the movie and how they interpreted it  especially after an 18 year journey  What a fantastic book  I can t believe I hadn t read it until now   The Giver by Louis Lowry was an amazing book  It had me on the edge of my seat throughout the entire book  The Giver gives an interesting perspective on what the future might hold  I really enjoyed this book  and the movie based off this book was excellent as well  The Giver takes place in the future  Jonas and the rest of the community  follow strict rules everyday that prohibits them from feeling emotion  seeing color  tasting and many other characteristics  Jonas and his friends are days away from receiving their assignments  Jonas is given the most important job in the community  As Jonas starts his training he starts to become curious about the purpose of the community s rules  and why they don t allow people to see color or taste or hear music  He continues to learn things that the community hides that grow his need for a rebellion  Will he do something about his beliefs  I would recommend this book to both boys and girls  It is an adventurous and mysterious book  I also recommend watching the movie after you read the book   I did not know who Lois Lowry was prior to reading THE GIVER  I plan on getting to know her through her words intimately  That is how good THE GIVER is  Her style is somewhat unique  THE GIVER is written through the eyes of a twelve year old boy  and is purposely written in a style that lacks narrative detail description  leaving a lot to the imagination of the reader  This style is perfect for this book as  the perfect  society plays such a pivotal role in this book THE GIVER is obviously the beginning of Jonas  saga  Unlike many other series starters  THE GIVER is written as though there won t be a follow up  I did not get the hint that a follow up would be coming until the last chapter  Again Lowry succeeds The way Lowry keeps the reader s interest in the early phases of the book is stunning and a good lesson for authors of any level  Her characterizations are immaculate yet simple  This is a KISS book all the way around Keeping it simple stupid  In following this philosophy the author gets so much more traction out of the words  It is an amazing example Although the book is geared toward the young adult demographic   It won the Newberry Medal  it s just as entertaining for adults because of the memories described in the book  Without giving away too much of the story  the memories make the reader appreciate everyday things that we as a society take for granted Both THE GIVER and it s author succeed in the purpose of why it was written in the first place  This is one of the rare books to get and read to your children if they can t read it for themselves  The movie is being released in a couple of weeks  I m looking forward to seeing it  This book is far more than just being worth the investment  it s a definite on anyone s reading list   The Giver is about a society in the future  Everything is robotic  predictable  and the same  The founders have taken the love  hate  and all emotion from the people  However  when Jonas is selected for the position of Receiver of Memory  he sets off to change this demented society One injustice in the book is release  Release is when somebody is killed because they are old  are born as twins  or aren t developing as fast  Near the end of the book  Jonas  dad was forced to release a child because a birth mother gave birth to twins  His dad didn t realize exactly what was he doing because the memories were taken from him  Jonas did know because he had the memories  Jonas was disgusted when his dad killed the child  The situation may have been resolved at the end when Jonas looked for elsewhere  The memories were passed to the communities I recommend this book to advanced middle schoolers and high schoolers  Also  adults could enjoy this book  too  It is exciting  deep  and it teaches lot of lessons  However  you need to able to think and understand things in depth  More than that  you need to LIKE to think  Sometimes the book is vague  and a little hard to follow  The ending is very indistinct and personally hated it because it leaves you wondering  Overall  this book gets nine out of ten  have you ever wanted to live on a perfect world  Well if you read this book basically everything is perfect and messed up  in my opinion this book at first was lame but when you keep reading it gets really good  this book is a non fiction  this book theres a boy who has a horrible life but doesnt know he does  untill he got a long life job to be a giver  days have passed getting trained to be a giver being taught shown things on the outside world  they had a talk about the outside of the world and the boy was crying and he wanted to leave  the giver gave him a plan to leave this point of view in this story is 3rd person omniscient  really helped telling us every detail and that was really important  passage helped to establish the conflict witch it s person vs society because the boy was in a fight against society where he doesn t like what others do  in my opinion I really like how the author told us the story little by little by giving us a lot more details my opinion about this book was very sad but awesome at the same time  I was surprised when the boy wanted to leave the place after what he found out  I liked the way how the author told us made the story so interesting and sad at the same time  I was angry about how people didn t love or had feelings about other people like why sleep with someone if u don t love or like them on a scare from 1 to 5 I would rate a 5 why because this book made me cry how they wouldn t even care for someone who has sons and daughters and they don t even love there sons  I would recommend all of you guys to read this book because it gets in your heart  if u read this book you won t regret it it s actaully really awesome and sad at the same time I absolutely adored reading this book  and the movie didn t disappoint   view spoiler  However  is it just me or did the ending give the impression that Jonas and Gabe died in the cold  Towards the end he recalls that he falls into the snow and closes his eyes  but he somehow gets up again and spots a red sleigh and uses it to slide down a hill towards a house with a family and a Christmas tree inside it   but it was the same vision of a red sleigh and the scene of a family celebrating Christmas in a house that the Giver gave Jonas    hide spoiler   This book is amazing Do you like realistic fiction If you do and then you should read this bookJonas is almost a Twelve  When his group members and him turn Twelve they are going to get assigned to their life assignment  Or a job  But    they can not pick their job Jonas got  The Receiver of Memories  He is going to get special training from The Giver Their Community  is not like our community    The people that live there has to follow every single rule in the Community if not they get released     The Giver by Lois Lowry is mostly about a boy named Jonas who lives in a community that has no unique things and no emotion Jonas has no feelings until he is assigned to the most important job  The job is that everyday after school Jonas has to go to a house where he will learn about what the receiver has to do which is keep the memory of the people so that the community can still have no uniqueness  He learns all this from his teacher the giver  I liked this book for three reasons   The first reason that I really liked this book is that in the book it has a lot of parts where you really want to read more and you can really be in the story and picture you doing what Jonas is doing to go to the place where there is so many unique things  For Example  When Jonas is running away with his little companion which is a baby that was going to be released as in killed  Jonas and the giver the day before planned that when Jonas is going to run away the giver will say that Jonas jumped into a river and drowned  BUT when they here this they don t believe it and starts to get the memories of things in the past the whole community is thrown into chaos  While Jonas and the baby is running away they are discovering many things but also when Jonas is catching food the baby will shout airplane if he spots one  This really wanted me to read on to see if they will make it to the place that already seems imaginary   The second reason that I really liked this book is that the characters really don t give up on themselves and keep going through the challenges  For Example  when Jonas encounters many search planes and of course when that happens the baby would say  airplane  and they would duck for cover until it is gone  But as the days go by there are less and less aircraft looking for them until there is none   The third and last reason is that you can relate and feel how lucky you are not to live in that kind of life and instead you can think freely and be creative and choose your emotions instead of having none  For Example in the third book it shows that Jonas made it got married and had a lot of children and it shows that the village that he reached has many different emotion and also it is not like the community which had no emotion  I recommend this book to readers who like quartets and like how the first book is one of the best introductions and readers who like reading books that give a cliffhanger at the end so you have to read the next book and the next until the last one that you finally understand how its all connected   The giver takes place in a community where everything and everyone is the same  Until everything changes because of Jonas  the main character  Jonas is also the receiver of memory who for the first time experiences love and sees color  he thinks everything could be different but he doesn t know what to do  should he stay with sameness and hold on to the memories or try to change everything  My favorite part of the book is the ending because the author lets you come up with your own ending and believe how the character should end  I recommend this book to people who like adventure and suspense   La disumanita della perfezioneIl  quasi  dodicenne Jonas vive in un mondo praticamente perfetto  in cui tutti sanno qual e il proprio posto  dove nessuno deve sopportare il peso delle scelte  dove parole come sofferenza  dolore  abbandono  solitudine  violenza non hanno alcun significato  I bambini vengono educati con rigore ma anche con gentilezza  gli anziani sono rispettati e accuditi  chi incorre in un errore chiede sempre scusa  nessuno e indiscreto  le unita familiari sono luoghi equilibrati e armoniosi    e cosi via  Ovviamente  vivere in un mondo tanto perfetto ha un suo prezzo  ed e un prezzo   anche se i suoi abitanti lo ignorano   altissimo  Questo libro mi ha colpito come un fulmine a ciel sereno  Per quanto mi riguarda  si tratta del capolavoro dei distopici di ultima generazione  seppur scritto in tempi assolutamente non sospetti  risale infatti al  lontano  1993   Adesso che le distopie sono diventate una moda  ovviamente  questo romanzo  primo di una saga da quel che ho intuito alquanto anomala nei suoi sviluppi  e tornato agli onori della ribalta con tanto di relativo film  che non ho ancora visto  ma la locandina mi ha fatto sorgere il bruttissimo sospetto che la storia sia stata   non so quanto   modificata al fine di adattarla all attuale pubblico YA e far cosi buona concorrenza ai vari Divergent e Hunger Games   Ma  e doveroso dirlo  qui siamo su tutto un altro livello  non troppo distante dai grandi e inarrivabili capisaldi del genere  Pur nella sua apparente semplicita  e uno di quei rari libri che riescono e scuoterti dentro  Potente  With all the dystopian type books out there right now  THE GIVER should not be forgotten  Why I hadn t read it before is a good question  I loved this first book in the quartet  Lowry s unique story and strong characters make this a definite page turner  There is so much to discuss and think about especially at the end of the book when the reader is left hanging  I ve heard that in the fourth book  THE SON  the characters in the first three books are reunited and the story finishes nicely  Can t wait to read the read of the books  No tengo palabras para describir este libro  Fue una experiencia sensorial y reflexiva unica  Tal vez pueda quejarme porque fue muy corto y su final demasiado abierto a la apreciacion del lector  pero no puedo  El autor planeo exactamente cuantas palabras necesitaba para contar esta historia y uso exactamente esa cantidad de palabras para relatarnos los hechos  Ni una mas ni una menos  No hay momentos blancos o aburridos en la novela  aunque este relatando sucesos cotidianos  dentro de este mundo distopico  claro  engancha  El autor teje con maestria la cotidianidad de este Comunidad con los misterios del dador de recuerdos  dando como resultado una novela sencilla que se lee en nada de tiempo porque es imposible abandonarla  Me gustaria una continuacion para debelar los misterios sin resolver   Claro  Pero se que los siguientes tomos de la saga son individuales y no tengo muchas esperanzas puestas en eso  Aunque me encantaria saber el destino del Dador de recuerdos  Jonas y Gabriel Da placer encontrar libros asi   me ha encantado   The Giver is about a boy in a perfect utopian society  There is no feelings  no war  no pain  and no joy Everyone is the same   except for him  When he  Jonas  is assigned to become the next receiver of memory  he soon discovers his power  to see beyond  Jonas is trained by what he calls The Giver  They are both in common for they have feelings and both seek something very significant  change  What Jonas discovers about his so called perfect community is far from good  Will he be able to change the rest of the people in his community This book kept me thinking  Lowry is the master at writing  clues and symbols revealed later on in the story  things left out to add mystery  and cliffhangers at every chapter  I read another book related to The Giver and I found it just as intriguing  A must read   A couple of years ago in english at school  we did a term long project on this book by Lois Lowry  I wasn t looking forward to it at all  I thought it was going to be one of those books written decades ago where you couldn t understand what was going on as the language was old fashioned and hard to understand  It wasn t   I was pleasantly surprised when I found that I started to enjoy it  and therefore I read ahead  not being able to take my eyes of the book  I loved the story line and the made up community  and after reading about all those things that they were missing out on in their lives  I started to appreciate the fact that I did have colour and feelings and freedom etc   I know this sounds cliche  but don t judge a book by its cover  I read the book within a matter of days and I thought it was amazing  A must read   I decided to read three different Newbery Award winning honor books this summer for work  First up in the roster is 1994 Winner The Giver by Lois Lowry  I adore Dystopian fiction  and always enjoy anything which centers on this sort of plot The Giver is about a future society where everyone has given up all semblance of feelings  choice  and pain  With this goes much of what makes us humans  though no one within the society realizes it  On the day of his 12 ceremony a boy named Jonas acquires a much lauded position within the community   he is to be the new Receiver  a very rare position  At the start of his training with the aged Receiver  renamed The Giver when Jonas takes up the position  Jonas begins to understand just how difficult his task will be  The Receiver must act as a conduit for everything the community has given up  Through a series of touches the Giver hands off the knowledge that has been passed down through the ages  that of pain  sorrow  war  and loss  He also passes on the knowledge of colours  music  joy  and acceptance  These concepts have all been phased out and upon learning any of them Jonas world will never be the same I enjoyed this immensely  It s incredibly well done  Perfect  Lowry has such skill with this kind of story  We feel every bit of Jonas  anguish and heartache as his horizons are broadened beyond belief  The descriptions of joy and pleasure are equally as impacting  It s a gorgeous book that is a very quick read  I sat down this very morning and read it in about 3 hours  And  yes  I probably should have read it years ago  But I read it now  So there For the first of my three Newberies this summer I give a well deserved 5 of 5 stars  I hope the other ones turn out to be this good   review of www bibliopunkkreads com The Giver by Lois Lowry was published in 1993 with an amazing story written in 179 pages  This sci fi book really changes your perspective on how to view the value or purpose of life  I love it when an author can awaken you and make you question your own thoughts and opinions on situations or maybe even sometimes the world  In this book Lowry wrote about a boy name Jonas who figures out his community chooses sameness rather than individual expression and then make a way to change his community  The book is about a futuristic society where things are perfect and everyone is equal  but still controlled The Giver plays a part as the memory of the old human life in the story  The Giver took away the memories from the people because without a memory there would be no pain   This also way a way for the utopia to stay well   perfect  So no one would have the memory of human history and to live in total peace   Jonas tackled the challenge of how the people were being controlled and make a change  So every time Jonas receives memories from the Giver the memories would open him up to love  comfort  and pleasure  I love the message of this book because it is very true  To live without pain is to live without memories  How can you feel pain if you don t remember the thing that brought you pain  They don t feel anything that has a relationship with pleasure and pain  In order to gain a memory of something you have to value the pleasure in that experience  The important message that we should take with us is that we should not blindly obey the rules of society  We must always question and challenge the ways of society   Lois Lowry did a great job of imprinting the story into the reader s mind  The reader finds himself in the world which is far away from his own  but still it is a world which he can easily relate to  The main character is a young boy named Jonas  He lives in the Community called Sameness  People there live by strict rules  but they do not feel helpless or limited because of that  They do not know any other world besides their own  The author shows the world which is guided in every possible way  Some limitations or rules at first seem completely harmless or even good  but as we continue reading we can see that everything is not so harmless and innocent  There is A LOT more going on than it seems at first The Giver  written by Lois Lowry  is a book that makes a reader think  The reader soon starts comparing his world with Jonas s world  He starts to think about his own limitations and ignorance  The Giver deservedly won a Newbery Medal  it is a great book worth reading  I enjoyed reading it and I grasped the whole book with enthusiasm  I encourage you to read it   I have just finished reading The Giver by Lois Lowry  Mrs  Lowry is an american writer  she is credited with more than thirty children s books and autobiography  She won a newbery medal for the book The Giver  Lois was born in 1937 in Honolulu  Hawaii  her father was in the army so she moved around a lot  This book is about an eleven year old boy named Jonas  He lives somewhere where everything is perfect no flaws at all  When Jonas turns twelve he is chosen to be the receiver  The old receiver has taught Jonas everything he knows  now he has become the Giver  He receives memories that change the way he thinks about himself and others  Gabriel is a little baby both that Jonas  father is taking care of  I think she wrote this book to show people that it s okay to mess up  The point of this book is to entertain all kinds of readers  and help people understand that everyone isn t perfect  Also  it helped me to understand to look at things differently in life  I actually liked this book a lot  It was very interesting throughout the whole book  It teaches you the importance of things  This book kept me wanting to read more because it was engaging  There was never a dull moment in the book   I would recommend this book to anyone  A friend actually recommended this book to me  She told me that while she was reading this it made her think of some things that we talked about  I dont think you need to know anything for you to be able to read this book  3 08 15  Just reread this with Stefan  It was even better experiencing it through someone s eyes who hadn t read it before I just reread this a couple of weeks ago  Great book  still kinda confused at the ending I have had this book for years and have never considered reading it except for the hype around the new movie that has just been released and the fact that they filmed some of it at Solitude while I was there  I have always liked books before movies so  I pulled it down LAST NIGHT and began  I closed it this morning  tired  emotionally drained and with a brain running in overdrive Very few books leave me mentally stuttering as I struggle to put my thoughts into words  but  somehow  The Giver has done just that  It will take me a while to be able to make sense of  not just the story  but my response to it What I can say is  the premise of living a life without agency is downright scary  We all wish  at times  for a world filled only with peace and happiness  where no one feels pain  hunger or sadness  However  we know that without feeling the depths of sorrow and misery  we can never know happiness Can someone just explain to me though  Was it all a dream  Were the boys safe at the end or did they die for the community  I am making my son read this right now and look forward to an almost 12 year old s perspective on it  I thought this book was brilliant  Beautifully written and a page turner from start to finish  The way Jonas slowly lost his innocence through the Giver s memories was heart breaking  but with them came greater understanding and wisdom about the value of life  choice and freedom  A great book that in my opinion shows the delicate balance of good vs evil  One of the marks of a good book is its ability to change how you think about the world  The Giver is one of those books  It asks the reader to imagine a world where freedom of thought is governed by the strict control of the emotions people are allowed to feel  Painful memories are dulled or erased  but through that process all of the good feelings and events of our life are also dimmed  The line between utopia and dystopia is a narrow one  For those who live in the community  life is one free of pain or want  but it is also free of desire and love  The author has a simple  clear style that makes an enjoyable read  The tone of her characters is measured and controlled  The community is passive aggressive in its calm orderliness  This creates a growing tension for the ultimate decision that must be made by Jonas  the newly selected Receiver of Memories  The ending left me a bit confused  as did the architecture in which the world exists   view spoiler  Perhaps the entire world exists inside the mind of an individual  I wasn t quite sure  I also wasn t quite sure what happened to Jonas at the end  Did he die  Did he escape from some mental disorder  Or did he simply leave the zone of the community as the book s narrative describe  In any case  finishing the last page only left me thinking more deeply about what had just happened  view spoiler    hide spoiler    hide spoiler   I loved this book so much but  I wished there was more to this story about Jonas and Gabriel   The Giver is about a boy that lives in a close to perfect community  In this community in which this boy lives  everything is chosen for its citizens and privacy is close to none due to the Elders decisions  The only person in the entire community that has privacy or that can even lie is The Giver  The Giver is a man or women that holds all of the memories that no one in the community holds  None of the citizens have any memories due to certain medication that erases memories of pain or even of the situation  Anyways  when this boy  Jonas is very close to the ceremony to become a Twelve  he starts to see objects differently  This ceremony is held every year and it is when a child graduates to an older age  No child in this community is their actual age  they are in an age group that the Elders wanted them to be  When this ceremony is held  children graduate to new age that holds new responsibilities  Jonas  the boy not far from this ceremony can see an aspect different about some objects that no one in the community can  He has no clue what it is he is seeing but he only sees it for a second before it is gone  Jonas is very clueless but does not say anything to anyone until the ceremony  At the ceremony the Twelves get jobs and Jonas was selected to be The Giver  This is when Jonas changes forever and will never be the same  He has to learn new experiences and how to cope with them because no one can know what he is doing or holding  Will Jonas go mad from the memories  Will the community get their memories back because Jonas followed in the steps of the last failure of the previous Giver   A situation in The Giver that shows an injustice is the taking of pills  A citizen  any age can take these pills and what these pills do is  help  a citizen if they are in pain  One day  Jonas accidentally slammed his hand in a door and cried for the medication because it makes everything better  Jonas  mom ran for the pills and had him take them  Instantly Jonas felt better and started to loose memory of the situation  This is what the pills do  They erase most of the memory of the situation so that the citizens don t remember exactly what happened  All Jonas remembered was that it hurt slamming his hand in the door  He doesn t remember how much it hurt  just that it hurt  These pills are an injustice because they erase most of the memory of a siuation  This is injust because it makes the citizens not really exposed to true pain and also takes away the chance to learn from their mistakes  Whenever an accident happens  you gain wisdom  but since these citizens have their minds erased they don t gain any wisdom  How this situation could have been resolved was giving the citizens a less strong medication  This way  the citizens of the community would have the pain go away little by little but would remember the situation and how it happened  By having this memory  they would learn and gain wisdom  Pain definatly makes a person stronger  but the community is taking that chance away   I would recommend this book to an audience that likes a great adventure that has a lot of rebellion  The Giver reading level is quite advanced  so the grade group I would recommend this book to would be from advanced sixth graders and up  The whole plot of the book is very well thought out and has advanced vocabulary that explains exactly how the character feels  Thats who I would recommend this book to and why  Name Form 1 English  section  Due Good Reads Review  Summer ReadingIn the book The Giver the message is the significance of memory The book takes place in a fairly small utopian society  The protagonist Jonas is an 11 year old boy who was chosen to be the receiver of memory when he turned twelve  The story is told from the perspective of Jonas  The book is about a boy named Jonas who lives in a utopian society where all pain  fear  war  and hatred are eliminated  In this world no one has memory of the pass  so they give one person all the memories which is Jonas  He meets the giver who was the last person to have the memories  The Giver inspired Jonas to save his little brother from this perfect world  Jonas runs offf with his brother and you have to read to see what happens next   I do not relate to this book in anyway  My life is far from perfect I have my ups and downs  but I perservere just like Jonas  I believe this book was very amazing  he book was jaw dropping with details and it was never boring  That is my point of view on the giver   What a wonderful book  I couldn t put it down  even though I had just picked it up to scan to see if I wanted to read it next  It s well written  interesting and thought provoking  The characters are real  the society scarily believable The inside flap says it makes us reexamine our innermost beliefs  I thought that rather far reaching for a children s book  but I really did find myself stopping to think about society as I read the text  I also was continually surprised by my assumptions about the characters and their world when those assumptions were jerked out from under me  It s a sad book  and disturbing  but an engaging dystopian novel that I highly recommend  such a pleasant and interesting read  it left me with a lot of thoughts and feelings  which is always great  the lack of romance and jonas s young age was really refreshing and a nice change  i m glad it was such a quick read too since i ve been stuck in a bit of a slump  hopefully this series will help The Giver was an INCREDIBLE book  I think it shows how no world can be truly perfect and that there will always be people like The Giver and Jonas that will disagree  If enough people knew what Jonas and The Giver knew  everyone would understand that some of the things in the world are not very  perfect  after all  The concept of utopia is very interesting  but I think eventually all utopias will someday end up as dystopias  People have tried and tried to make worlds without sickness  war and other things humans classify as horrible  but almost every time they have failed  I think that there is such thing as a perfect world  but only if the right people live in it  At the beginning of The Giver  everyone  including Jonas  thought their community was a perfect place  but Jonas eventually learns that there are very important things missing from their world including color  memories  emotions  snow  sunlight  and the most important being love  I thought The Giver was an amazing book  and I would recommend it to a ton of people  This is very moving book  Though it seems that this book is for young adults  this applicable to everyone  It explores a society  its people  young or old and the fear of making incorrect choices and their consequences  In the dystopian novel The Giver by Lois Lowry the main character Jonas was the chosen one  Jonas learned more than anyone else in the city  When Jonas was chosen for his job he learned more than an average human because his job was to secure memory  His city is closed in and will not talk to outsiders  They are alone and that s how the conflict came into place  They have rules like when to get a bike and they pick your jobs  Jonas found out something no one knew about and had to save them  Jonas had an odd job in which I found interestIng  This was one of my favorite books because there was something new in every chapter  It starts off awesome and confusing because the city is different  You feel the intensity in your heart when you get to the end  It was a brave and thrilling ending because the setting  the conflict and the events that Jonas goes through started to all add up  I hate to read  I dislike reading so much that I ve only read 10 books my whole life  When I opened the book the best thing was not putting it down  I would recommend this to people who like a mystery and suspenseful book   What an amazing book  This is a dystopian novel unlike that of the Hunger Games or Divergent series  This book and others in the series were written long before Katniss shot her first arrow  I love how Lowry paints a picture of a society that decides to live in ignorance of the pain and war scars from the past  What would life be like if one removed all emotion and feeling  Is ignorance truly bliss  Read this book  It will be one of your favorites  Side note  The movie is really good as well  Not often is the movies as good or better  but I found it quite satisfying  My thoughts on the book The Giver are  Jonas reminds me a lot about my brother Josh he has the power to make everything ok  when I am down I will always know that my brother Josh is there to give me a hug  Jonas does that same thing to Fiona and Gabe  My favorite part of this book is when the Giver tells shows Jonas music  that song has been stuck in my head ever since we read that part and watched it   The most sadess part about the book movie is when Jonas chooses to watch the relesing of the twin that weighed one pound smaller than his twin  When I saw and read that part it was the most touching moment I think in the whole book  A lot of people say the books are always better than the movies but in this book and movie I think they both had there differences but I personally think that they both were great and equal to eachother  The Giver  1993  by Lois LowryLiterature StudyJonas is an eleven year old boy who lives in a strictly controlled society sometime in the future  In his  community   there is no suffering  hunger  war  and  as you will soon see  no color  music  or love  In the beginning of the story  Jonas is almost twelve  which means it s almost time for him to get assigned a profession  There s a big ceremony at which the decisions are announced  The Chief Elder finishes the ceremony and explains that Jonas has been  selected  to be The Receiver of Memory  Jonas begins his training  which consists of receiving a series of memories from the old Receiver  who is now referred to as The Giver  These aren t just any old personal memories  rather  the old man is passing on to Jonas all the memories of humanity  going back in time before their community was established  back when there was color and love and music and emotions  While Jonas gets to experience lots of fun things like Christmas and birthday parties  he also has to deal with the bad memories  like sunburn  loss  death  and warfare  Needless to say  this completely changes the way Jonas looks at his world    I remember reading this book in middle school and not having much interest in it at all  but re reading it as an adult completely changed my perspective on it  This book is one of the best I have read in my adult life  From the very beginning it pulls you in and keeps you there  The story never gets boring and uses great detail  The compassion that this story shows is intense and surreal  It is an amazing read for anybody  middle school aged and above  I highly recommend reading or re reading it if you haven t read it since middle school because I picked up on a lot more the second time around    The Giver  is a utopian novel in which the main character Jonas is chosen for the rare position of the Receiver of Memory  He then receives pre utopian memories from the Giver  the previous receiver   These memories include joy  pain  colors  snow  war  etc   all things that don t exist in the community  When Jonas learns the truths of his community  he decides he must leave  taking with him a little boy  Gabriel  who has no family unit and who is schedule to be  released  I have read this book at least 5 times  and probably more than that  It gets better every time I read it and I am always surprised when I come across something I didn t notice before or that I didn t grasp when I was younger  Lowry s minimalist way of writing shows a skill that I hope to have in my writing  as she paints such vivid pictures with few words  I will always recommend this book to anyone  Even thpough this story was written for Teens it resonates even with adults  Actually this book is more of an expreience than just a story  Imagine a existence totally structured to eliminate emotions  everyone has a place  no one suffers or is hungry  Only The Giver has the memories of the people  The time is coming when he must pass them on to a younger person  as he is getting older  What happens when this occurs puts both the old Giver and the new Giver into an entirely new situation Highly recommended The GiverBy Lois Lowry180 pgs FictionDecember 8In the book The Giver  Jonas lives in the world of sameness  Everything there is so boring you can t even imagine  People cannot even see colors or experience feelings much  Your age puts you into groups  It goes all the way up to twelve  On the twelveth year you get an assignment  It is basically a job  They even have birth mothers so people live with different parents and siblings  On assignment day Jonas is given the assignment of receiver of memory  He has to go to the powerful giver  The Giver is like what a person is today  He knows all the colors and actions that happen today  His daughter could not bear seeing war because she could not experience that normally so she is released  When somebody is released they get an injection and die  A baby living with Jonas and his assigned parents might have to be released because he is not independent  Jonas does not know what release is as do his peers  but he realizes that release is killing  Jonas experienced in what death was in his receiving given to him by the giver  He always knew after release people were gone after release but know he realized the people were killed  One day when he receives what love is he felt sad  He asked his parents if they loved him but they were in sameness so they did not show love to anyone  He also realized Gabriel would have to be released and he saw what that actually meant  death  Jonas experienced how real life without sameness would be painful with war but there was love and people were not killed because of flaws  The Giver told him to take Gabriel and leave where they could go to a real place  Jonas asked The giver why he was not coming but he said he had to meet his daughter Rosemary  Jonas knew that meant he was going to die soon  Gabriel had to go with Jonas not only because of being safe  but he also had memories of the real world when Jonas accidently touched his back giving him some memories  So they eventually escape into a world of unity and love  and they live happily ever after  My ThinkingI think that this was a very good book I would give it 5 stars  It really showed me how we underestimate how good we have it today  We have love and sledding and emotions  In a world of sameness there would be no unity or culture brought in  The world would be totally boring  The worst part is  no love  We would not care about the people who had deficiencies mentally and physically   Everybody would have to look and act the same  Also I think that this book is not only a good lesson but it was extremely sad  When Jonas parents said they do not love him but care about it it was sad  He not only does not get to live with his biological mom  but he cannot experience love  I think it is normal how the author the author explained what a stirring was  Which is basically Jonas wanting to get married to Fiona  It explains how even in a world of sameness everybody grows up  Which leads me to my next point  people cannot have they re own children in this world and they do not seem to care  It is great how the author created this unique or in their way  same characters  I think that if the story continued Jonas would raise a family of his own and they would all live together with Gabriel and love each other  Jonas always seemed like a thinker so I thought while I was reading is he catching on to the fact that sameness is not real  Jonas begins to realize after the many hard lessons of the giver that it is not normal in what world they live in  Like Paul in Tangerine  Jonas is a thinker  I think the author from Tangerine and from The Giver both are showing that by that age you should fight battles with your mind and think with your mind  and not with your emotions  In the end I really enjoyed how not only does Jonas leave by himself but how he takes the baby Gabriel with him  This part was interesting to me  because in the beginning of the book Jonas said that he would never get attached to the baby  The whole family had to swear because in the world of sameness only two kids per house and Jonas had a sister  His dad had to take care of it while he became independent  Jonas grows to realize that he loves the baby  So when he left with the baby it really warmed my heart   I thought this was a very well written book  The plot was easy to follow and wasn t too complicated  but the meaning was much more  If I could describe this book in one sentence  here it is  Eveything was the same  someone knew it shouldn t be  and they changed it  There was much more than that though  I originally read The Giver a few years back and reread it just today  This time  I found it even more compelling  having not to acclimate myself to Lowry s stark style and heavy exposition  in the early chapters  on the workings of Jonas  sterile  dystopian society  These details are revealed through the 11 year old s musings of his daily and family life while looking expectantly toward the Ceremony of the Twelves  when he  and all other 12 year old children  will learn their adult occupations within in the community Not until chapter 8  23 total   when Jonas finally learns what is to be his select and singular role  does the story gain a momentum that grows with each passing chapter  racing toward a spectacular end  At the Ceremony of the Twelves Jonas learns that he is to become the Receiver of Memories  memories denied a populace pampered and disciplined like pets  Jonas alone is to receive  from the old and ailing Giver  all the wretched and wonderful memories of times past  before society accepted  Sameness  as a doctrine for living  But in turning from strife and decision making  the people abandoned emotional depth  even depth in perceptions  so that only the Giver and Receiver can perceive color or feel emotions of love or hate  And with his awakening to pain and joy  Jonas finds himself on a road to either oblivion or freedom The Giver is a companion book to two subsequent stories of dystopian societies  Gathering Blue and Messenger  I read both of these immediately after first reading  The Giver  Can you guess which book I ll be reading next   The Giver is another one of those books where I am not quite sure what I can say about it that hasn t already been said so many times  I guess  first and foremost  I would say that  as a massive Science Fiction nerd  it is a perfect representation of the genre  You re never quite sure which characters you can trust or even which characters are good or bad  the ending is really open to interpretation  even if  as I understand  that wasn t the original intent I personally like this book because it makes you think  It makes you ask yourself what is right and what is wrong and how close are the problems plaguing the community to our own world and culture  It makes you ask what you would do in the Jonas  situation and how far you would go to do what you felt is right  I know that there is a lot pf philosophical and social issues that can be discussed when reviewing The Giver but  as I said  that stuff has been talked about to death so I just wanted to share my personal view on the boo and why I love it  I would recommend it for everybody to read  but  if your teaching it in a classroom  I would wait until like 6th or 7th grade because some of the material can be a little dark   That ending      Well  I have a lot to say about this very interesting book  The author did a fabulous job of weaving her ideas of  the community  and all of it s practices into the main characters life  It really held my interest and I was very curious throughout  to find out just what the author was trying to teach us about human nature  and the opportunities we have living in the communities we do  What it all boiled down to  in the end   was this  Would you choose out of your own free will  to be able to experience love even if it meant you were at risk of experiencing sorrow and pain  Would you want to live life making your own choices about things  even though you would be subjected to making the wrong choice  It made me think again  of how grateful I am to have the testimony I do   which is that God is all powerful  all knowing and perfect in every way  I m grateful that I took his advice and decided to come here and be subjected to the pain  the sorrow  and the wrong choices  So far  the love I have felt in my short life  is worth every minute of it    I read this book for the first time in fourth grade and I hated it  It was the worst thing I had ever read  Then in eighth grade my english teacher convinced me to read it again  This time she told me to think of irony  and let me decide some of the story and what it ment  That time I Loved it  I understood it more and could enjoy it more than when I was younger  I plan on reading it again this summer  It s been four years since then and everytime I read it I seem to get more out of it  I definatly suggest reading this when you get a chance   Jonas lives in a world full of rules  security  and order  Each family in Jonas s society is given an artificial family  job  and home  This lifestyle Jonas is given appears to be comfortable but citizens are constantly reprimanded for saying the wrong things  for not saying the right things  and for not fulfilling their role in the community  At the annual ceremony that all children must attend to up until the age twelve they are assigned their roles in the community that they would continue for the rest of their lives  Jonas is not given a role but a high position of being a receiver of memories of the past  The giver  the one who gives the memories  to Jonas reveals the life before community  Jonas must decide what he will do with these memories in order for him to be free  I feel that this is one of the best books ever written about agency  I think it is important for not only educators to share this wonderful story with students but everyone for all ages should read this book  The plot captures the reader because of all the things that lead up to Jonas s decision  This book has many powerful themes that both young adults and even adults should look into  The content warning for this book is brief talk of sexuality  drama  and murder   Book  51  I knew nothing going into this book except that it is another book turned into a movie with Taylor Swift in it     This is a fast paced and no lulls book with a very well described setting which makes it a very interesting read for me  Its concept is very engaging  It s very effective in making my brain think and ask questions  A well written book for both children and adult  It makes you realize the importance of making your own choices and not letting others make the choices for you This is my first experience with Lois Lowry and I m looking forward for more  The Giver a book I never wanted to put down  Two chapters in  I was hooked  I ve read book like this before  but this by far snagged my favourite  It s set in a community where everything is decided by the authority  Literally everything  Clothes  food  spouses  jobs  anything you can think of  It focuses on a boy named Jonas  who is selected to be the Receiver of Memories  From there  the novel is about his experience as a Receiver in training  The book made my thought run circles around my head  What s really important in life  and how will I live it  After reading it  I looked around my room and took in the colors and I couldn t imagine not being able to see them  I imagined having my future completely laid out for me  and it s a relief  Eliminating the possibility of bad choices  but it s not really living  Reading this  I felt this book had hints of dramatic irony  especially at the end  The people of the community didn t know what snow was  or colors  or animals  but we knew and so did Jonas  I really empathized with the frustration he must have felt keeping all this new knowledge tucked away inside of him  The ending confused me  and I had to seek clarification  I was extremely sad when the book ended and I knew I had to pick up the companions to it  Overall  I recommend this book to anyone and everyone  It s one of those book that begs to be read  The Giver by Lois Lowry tells an interesting tale of a place where they have gotten rid of feelings  color  memories  and decisions  Jonas is soon becoming a Twelve in his community  This means that he will be given his official job  Jonas was number 19  Right after 18  right before 20  That was not true when he was given his job though  They went right from 18 to 20  After everyone else had been called  Jonas was finally announced  He was the reciever of memories  He would be trained by The Giver  He stored all of the memories so the community would not have to feel loss  sadness  or pain  This also meant that the good memories had to be taken away too  The only reason the community has taken away things was to make things easier  but this resulted in the loss of things that were good  No more color  no more feelings  no more decisions  and no more memories  I encourage you to join Jonas on this journey to find out what to feel truly means  and what pain really is  I enjoyed how the author showed many themes throughout the book  and also a lot of symbolism  For example  in Jonas s community there are no feelings or colors to make life interesting  Since Jonas has the memories though  he begins to see the colors no one else can  He begins to see red  and the Giver explains that with time  all of the colors will come to him  Jonas then begins asking why everyone cannot see the colors  He then said it was because the community wanted to make things simpler  and that they also got rid of memories to get rid of pain  Lowry 95   This shows that without any pain or sadness in life  you can never really appreciate the wonderful things  This was the best thing about this book  which related to my life a lot  Whenever something bad happens to me  even if it s just that my knee got scraped  I realize just how good the rest of my life is  and that makes me happy again  It shows me that my life is awesome  This was almost the best book I ve ever read  When I saw that I accidently rated it four stars instead of five  I immediately changed it  This book doesn t just deserve more than four stars  it deserves more than five  I would give it 10 billion stars if I could  I m so glad I chose to read this delightful Newbery award winning book  My book club chose to read The Giver in preparation for the movie  which will be out in August   I think it s probably been a decade since I last read this  I loved it then  but I have read so much dystopian literature at this point that The Giver comes off as very simplistic  Very little of Jonas s world makes sense to me  Why don t they see colors  Where are the animals  How does the Giver and the Receiver have magical powers when no one else does  I remember being shocked at what happened with the father  but blurred it in my mind with another book that  released  old people after a celebration of their lives  was is Matched by Condie   I m glad I reread it  because it was an important book for its time  I m just not sure how it holds up  It didn t for me   1  Genre  Science Fiction2  Summary  Jonas is about to turn twelve  a big deal in the Community  a utopian society where people are devoid of pleasure  grief and suffering and apparently all are color blind  When Jonas turns twelve he is assigned the role as the new Giver  a role given solely to one person to hold the memories of all that has happened in the past  Not only is Jonas  eyes opened to pain and pleasure but to the truth A  Area of Comment  ThemeB  The underlying theme of Lois Lowry s novel is that without the memories of our mistakes and triumphs we can t live life fully  We need pain to help us understand our grief and we need a more personal connection with our family and the ones we love  Another powerful theme that the reader takes away from this book is the right of choice  whether it s the path we take in life or making a stand against something that is wrong C  A powerful moment in the book is when Jonas is allowed to watch recording of his dad performing a  Release  of a twin baby  In Jonas  mind a release meant being allowed to leave the Community but to his horror it meant euthanasia  In that moment it shattered his belief in the Community and in his father Curriculum Connection  This novel should be only used in the higher elementary grades or middle school because of the nature of the theme  Some of the concepts are too abstract for younger readers  A writing prompt the teacher could give is to ask the students what they would do if they found out the truth of the Community  Would their actions be similar to Jonas or would they be different  The Giver was so intriguing as on the surface many of today s modern problems  and problems within our society were just gone or eliminated  Everything in the Giver s society was so neat and clean Really though  by the future society eliminating  freedom of choice in choosing a profession  eliminating teenage pregnancy  separation of families and divorces  and people moving for work  their society became more secretive and evil  People closed off their feelings and emotions to the point nothing and no one was important and their innermost relationships were based on lies and betrayal  The Giver was intriguing as I wanted to read on to see what happened to Jonas as he found out more of the real world and truth of what was hidden to others in his community  I found the ending full of joy and hope for change  I think most people reading the book would hope that they would have the courage Jonas did at the end  and follow their heart  I think the Giver has a good moral for everyone about not playing it safe  and living a life dull and meaningless life  The Giver inspires people to look for more in their everyday lives and not to accept what society tells them they have to do or be  The Giver can be shocking in its blunt take on the cruel nature of Jonas s society  Other than that I think it is a thought provoking book about how society can dominate us if we follow blindly and don t look for own answers   DISCLAIMER   I won t spoil Can you believed this book was banned  I still cannot get over it  If they ban things like The Giver  what happens to The Adventures of Captain Underpants  Then again  maybe it is because this book was just crafted to make the reader question and wonder about the text too much  but even then this enticingly captivating book can outweigh a lot of books  and if you thought that this was biased  it is because I read Ship Breaker   This book can go under a lot of genres  but I personally would label it coming of age  The plot revolves around a 12 year old boy  Jonas  who lives in a utopia which is called a community  and everyone is assigned jobs  jobs like caretaker for old  birthmother  labourer etc  So as you can see  it is organised  and it has been working Until Jonas is selected to become the giver From that point on  everything changes  In his war less world  he is yet to learn about how it came to be  and that is probably the most interesting component of the story  But it is unmatched  for there is something even more interesting   the giver  The giver is the only one who can visually see the past  and it remains this way  This goes generation to generation Now there is a lot to spoil  so if you have not read it  pick it up and flip it  This book is very intriguing  and will make you think  Brayleigh Brunet 8G 126The book the Giver is connected to a sequel  It is the very first book  The books don t leave of in the direct mine set of the same character though  Each book has a new main character with a new story  The Giver is set in the future  The characters all live in a stable society where they have to follow certain rules  Out of their community  there is a place called Elsewhere  Elsewhere is a place that they send unhealthy babies  old people  or disabled people  They don t all know it at the time but when they are sending them all off  they are actually killing them  When the characters get older  they get assigned to work one job forever  They all play some sort of role in their community  Later in the story  the main character gets assigned his job  Unlike all the other people  he gets a special job that is really rare to get  Everyone is surprised yet happy for him  He isn t suppose to talk about his role though  He is supposed to be trained by the  Giver  and keep quiet on what he finds out    The main character in this story is Jonas  Jonas lives in a society where everyone is suppose to fit into place  Unlike the others  Jonas gets put into a special place  He is given the job of the Giver  He is taught by the Giver secrets of his worlds past  He is shown good and bad things that the world use to be like and have  This book is fiction  Social Science  and utopia  The elements that make it utopia are the fact that Jonas s community is a perfect society with no pain  suffering  or violence  The moral or lesson that I can learn from this story is that change is good  In this book  the Giver shows how people have different personalities and different needs  Along with that  I think that this book shows us how people don t have free will  Because no one has free will  everybody is suffering from their own ignorance  So the moral of this story is that knowledge and free will is sometimes taken for granted   I can relate to this book for many reasons  I may not live in the same situation that Jonas does but I relate to his feelings and thoughts throughout the story  Like Jonas  I often feel like Im not where I belong  like I don t fit into my society and something may be wrong  Even though we both feel this way  in the story he is given his place  I can find my place in life and work from their like he does  When somethings bothering him  he does something about it just like I do  We both want to make a change in the world we live in   I rate this book a ten out of ten  This book always kept me interested the whole way through  I love that it teaches you so many things about life as well  This is definitely one of my favorite books  This books shows a lot of things in life that you should treasure and be thankful that you have  Each person is their unique individual and has something great to show the world  I am so glad I decided to read this book  I am currently reading the other books that Lois Lowry has written  I may even have to read the Giver once more  The Giver left me really astonished  How could I miss this book for so long  I bet there is not a person who doesn t fall in love with this novel immediately  The Giver tells us a story about the little community who lives according to the rules established for so long  that they can t even remember  They obey the rules blindly  The main character of the story is 12 year old Jonas who lives in his  family unit  that s how they call two people living together who can request a two children  Jonas lives with his small sister Lilly and his father and mother  Who are not his real parents  Each year every child gets something to celebrate his new year  For example at the age of eight a front buttoned jacket with pockets  which shows individuality and that a kid is able to take care of his own little belongings and also start volunteer hours  At the age of nine  which Lily is so looking forward they get their own bicycle  Before they are not allowed to ride a bicycle  Jonas on the other hand will in December be twelve which means he will get the Assignment   work  That s when he is considered to be adult  His father works at the Nurturing Center and his mother at Department of Justice  But he doesn t want any of these jobs  Their usual day at home starts with the dream telling and analysis the dreams  then the kids go to school and parents to work and in the evening they talk before the meal about their feelings  Jonas feels uncertain and apprehensive about his assignment  When the day comes everyone gets the assignment they wanted but suddenly he is skipped  But at the end of the ceremony one of the Elders tell his name and that he had been chosen to be the new Receiver  He receives a new set of rules which confuse him  because from now on he s able to ask anyone anything and also can lie  When he starts the training very next day  he meets the old man who was Receiver for many years  During training Jonas lies down on the bed and Receiver is transmitting memories  all kinds of memories   joy  happiness  love  sadness  fear  starving  loneliness  Jones starts to see things differently as they were before they went to Sameness   he sees colors  he feels compared to other people  He learns that the release from community is not a real celebration as they stated to him in the childhood  This book in some way reminded me of Hardboiled Wonderland from Murakami  I love that book but at the same time this is special  different  new and I hope that also the other three books from this quartet are that great  Cause I feel for Jonas and Gabriel  They became so dear to me  The world described in the book is so unique  I never thought I will find such a book which from the first page will be one of the best books I ever read  Thank you Lois Lowry   I must review this book now  Why  you ask  Because some of the reviews do such a piss poor job of capturing the magic that makes this book great for young adults and a winner of the 1994 John Newbery Medal   For The Most Distinguished Contribution to American Literature for Children  This book is not likely to blow the socks off an experienced vet of the best English literature has to offer  So don t start the book expecting to find a realistic portrayal of a dystopian society along the lines of some of the science fiction greats  Instead  expect to find a touching story of a young boy as he enters his place in society  only to uncover all the deception surrounding what he has been told as gospel Jonas s coming of age ritual is to stand in front of his community with the rest of the twelve year olds and take his adult role  But something strange and unexpected happens  when normally nothing in his society happens out of the ordinary  Cue movie theme song   I m just an ordinary human    Briefly  Jonas doesn t fit in and he is given a very special honor  One revelation after another eventually leads him to the conclusion that  view spoiler  he can t fit into this monstrous society and he leaves  against all odds  to go  Elsewhere  Of particular disappointment to maintaining a cohesive plot is that  with 40 pages left in a 180 page book  they start killing babies  Correction  Not just anyone starts killing babies  the main character s father kills babies  He takes a newborn  fresh out of the womb  weighs it  and then kills it in cold blood  stabbing it in the head with a needle and crooning to it like some sociopath Next up for execution  the very baby boy the family has grown attached to because it lives at their house Yes  the book has to end somehow  So  WITH LESS THAN 20 PAGES LEFT  Jonas impulsively scraps whatever plans he had to graciously leave the community and sets out ill prepared into the wider world to face whatever adversity lurks in God s natural world  away from climate control and Sameness   hide spoiler   And let me tell you  the finale may hold up for the limitless imagination of a young teenager  but following any reread or the rational mind of an adult  and the illogical twists and turns necessary to achieve the required affect only serves to highlight how the author has done this to a substantially lesser degree throughout the story There are a number of fallacies and mathematical impossibilities in the text and they probably won t be noticed by most readers because the author leads you right past them  I don t think pointing out these flaws does much to critique the story besides discrediting the author s opinion by hoping to show carelessness in the writing Unfortunately  Keely s dissertation on the twisted political undertones of this fictional children s story and some other criticisms I ve read have taken hold of me  I ve been forced to reevaluate this old favorite of mine from when I understood that the author may have an agenda after all  even if it flies over most kid s awareness The book is about social control and social freedoms  how society only gives one perspective  the mainstream  to the next generation so they can perpetuate the same morality over and over and over into the future  But nobody s presenting the real truths in their arguments  Even parents tell  white lies  to prevent themselves from contradicting themselves  It s about atheism and socialism and abortion and what happens when man plays God with his world With a mature perspective now  I assert my wish that the author had shown more restraint in the anti abortion symbolism and message of the finale   view spoiler  Jonas plays the role of mother as he nurtures the child and puts its needs ahead of his own  He is determined to keep the baby even though his parents tell him he s just acting out of emotion  while they have determined it is unrealistic  He runs away from home  trusting in faith to get him through and the memories to help him  A good old fashioned miracle caps it all off   hide spoiler  But I saw none of this the first two times I read the book  Younger readers will enjoy the clear  consistent writing style and the creative names and memorable expressions   We accept your apology  and  Thank you for your childhood  and  Back and back and back   Lowry makes the big  bad world seem like an overwrought school system  with its rules and social inclusion exclusion  Lowry captures the pleasures and horrors of life in memorable  vivid detail  all transmitted through the caring hands of an old man  And schoolchildren may rethink the war games they play on the playground The book is about culture and society  so  even though the writing is easy to read  expect sparse description surrounding most characters  It s about troubling situations and new experiences  emotional reactions and bonds  There is just enough there to tell the story  and not really even enough words there to tell the ending  I don t think anyone will have trouble envisioning the uniform social conditioning reminiscent of 1950 s America and the outlying factories and farms similar to Soviet Russia  But wait a second  No one has books in their houses but the Giver has a video screen and Jonas thinks it s completely normal  I laugh  I do  I like how simple and yet complex this book is  This is because we experience the seemingly utopian society  and discover the pitfalls of it  through the eyes of a child  A feeling of truth resonates in the words of this book  It reminds me of 2 Nephi chapter 2 in the Book of Mormon  that there must be pain in order for us to truly know joy  there must be an opposition in all things  I gave this book 5 stars because it made me think and helped me understand life better I first read this book in elementary school  While the plot is simple  the underlying themes were yet too difficult for me to fully grasp  and I was left feeling slightly disturbed by this book  For this reason I have avoided it since then  and was confused about why anyone would like it  Recently  I have enjoyed other dystopian novels and have matured to gain a greater appreciation for non idyllic endings  With that and the movie coming out soon  I decided to give this book another look  I m so glad I did  However  I may decide not to see the movie  The memories of pain and the  releasing  parts were so raw and real to my tender emotions  and I don t know if I could handle a vivid visual representation of those scenes  At the end  I felt like they died and went to heaven  The description of the family waiting for them resonated with how I feel our ancestors and family on the other side of the veil will be smiling and waiting to greet us when we pass on I wish it explained the connection between those with pale eyes   the giver  Jonas  Gabe  Rosemary  the 5 year old girl  When I read this as a child  this really bothered me and I dreamed up a whole new character   a birth mother   and she and the giver were the biological parents of the pale eyed children  I just reread this as I decided to read all four of the books in the series  I was surprised by how much I liked it again  I m not a big re reader but I definitely needed to read this in order to appreciate the others  This book is one of the best books I ve ever read  The online flaw   A bit too short  The story is amazing and unique considering the time it was written in  bad English in this sentence  The writing is beautiful and Jonas and the Giver are great characters  I d heard so many people praising this book  so I figured I ought to try it  I was a little off put by the fact that it was in the middle school section of the library  but I figured that the worst that could happen would be that it was a little immature  Boy was I wrong  I honestly don t even know how to explain what happened in this book  If you asked me what the book was about I m not sure I could explain it  I do know that in the few pages it had it managed to set up the world very clearly  Though I would ve loved to know all the ins and outs of this society  I realize that it would ve just made the story boring  Lois Lowry managed to find the perfect balance between explaining the world and leaving it up to your imagination  Though I do think everybody should give this a shot  I do have some complaints  I feel like every character besides Jonas and The Giver didn t really have any personality  Honestly  what were the points of having Fiona or Asher  Though we hear of their friendship  and are told of their behavior  we never really get to know them  As much as Fiona was talked about  I thought she would have more value to the story  Truthfully  she could have disappeared and nothing important would have changed  Also  the ending felt fairly rushed to me  Maybe I was reading too quickly  but I didn t really understand why Jonas and The Giver were doing what they were  The ending left me slightly frustrated  though I have a feeling that it was supposed to do exactly that  All in all  this book really did make me feel things  and tore at my heart  Any story that does that is a good one in my opinion  so I think that everybody should give it a read   The Giver  by Lois Lowry is about a perfect society  There is no fighting  no lies  no inequality  no choice  Everything is the same  Every morning you share your dreams  every evening you share your feelings  Every family is a father  a mother  a son and a daughter  There is no color  no music  no holidays and no options  Everything is decided for you  from your child  to what your job will be  At the Ceremony of 12  the same jobs are given year after year  Engineer  Laborer  Birthmother  Caretaker of the Old  but not this year  This year  there is a Receiver of Memories  His name is Jonas  There has not been a Receiver for 10 years  and last time it was catastrophic  On Jonas s first day of training  he meets the Giver  The Giver was the old Receiver of Memories and now he must transfer all those memories to Jonas  Memories of happiness and strength  but also memories of pain and sadness  As Jonas continues his training  receiving the memories   he feels more and more detached from his family and friends  However  he relishes in learning about the past  Back when everything wasn t the same  when people had choices  Every day  he and the Giver and explore the past until one night  Jonas has to leave the community to save someone he loves  Will he have enough strength  Now a major motion picture  The Giver is a story about the power of emotions and inner strength One thing I liked about this book is that it made me think a lot  At times it was very deep  I wondered about how this community came into existence  I wondered about why the people in this community couldn t see color and I wondered if the Chief Elders actually knew about how the world was a different place at one point in time and if they are actively trying to not let it happen again  or if this is all they ever knew and they are just trying to do what they think is right  I also really thought at the end of this book  Just they way it ended  I felt was kind of a metaphor for something else  As if something happened to them  even though Lois Lowry didn t outright say   This happened   Sorry this isn t really clear  I just don t want to spoil the ending  Another thing I really liked about this book is the description  Whenever Jonas got a memory  I felt like I was there with him  I felt like I was there when he was sliding down the hill  the wind whipping my face  I felt like I was there when he was basking in sunlight  I felt like I was there when Jonas experienced love and Christmas and real  actual families for the first time  Also  I could totally picture the dwelling in which Jonas lived  and the stuffed animal that his sister had  I could picture the entire book pretty well actually  and it was like a little movie in my mind  which was cool  One thing that I didn t like about this book is that it has a sequel  Now  the sequel might be great  it might be better than The Giver  I don t know  I haven t read it  but the way that The Giver ends  I feel like there really shouldn t be a sequel  It doesn t need one  Besides  Jonas isn t even in it and it is my understanding that Lois Lowry went a long time without writing a sequel  Apparently it wasn t her intention to write one at first anyway  The reason I feel like this book should be a stand alone is because of the way it ends  I can t say too much without spoiling the ending  but the way the book ends just seems to imply that certain things happen and if those things did happen  then there is absolutely no reason why there needs to be a second or third or fourth book All in all  this is a great book  People who would like this book would probably be people who like books about dystopian societies  For example  The Hunger Games  Divergent  Legend  Although  The Giver doesn t have half as much action as those books  so if you are looking for a book with a lot of fighting and guns and wars  don t read this book  In addition  A Wrinkle in Time lovers would probably appreciate this book  People who like fiction would like this book too  Another group of people who would definitely enjoy this book are the people who watched the movie The Giver and liked it  The book and the movie are pretty similar  but there are some key differences that make the book worth reading   I absolutely LOVED this book  I got it for Christmas of 2010 finished it the very next day  I COULD NOT put it down  It was thankfully an easy read but also an amazing read  Although at times the book can be sad it makes you think about life and i love that it makes you do that  I also loved how in the end the author has allowed us to imagine somewhat our own ending  Being able to do so is good and bad at the same time though  Being able to think up an ending on your own allows you to make your own happy or sad ending  but also being able to make your own ending also means not having a clear ending so you truly never know whether the ending is truly good or bad  BUT in the end it was an overall AMAZING    book  I would recommend it to anyone that likes fiction  It gives you a good think on life as well though  so if you don t want to have an imaginary world life book that truly makes you take a good look at your own life then I m sad to say but the book isn t for you  But again overall a wonderful book     Easy to read and an easy favorite  This reminds me of  Enclave  and  The Hunger Games  and the movies  Pleasantville  and  The Truman Show   But this one is definitely better  Lowry used simple words and sentences but her words conveyed great emotions and memories  It was truly felt  My favorite scene is when the giver gave Jonas his favorite memory  People of all ages should read this     I LOVED it   It was amazing  I read it in one day  Though the ending was very depressing   It was also very inspiring and sensational   I ve never recommended this to anyone who didn t think it was incredibly good  It will make you think long after finishing it  I stayed up until 1 in the morning to finish this book  It was so good  I m kind of upset that this wasn t a required reading for school back in the day  I feel like I would have loved this book then just as much as I love it now   The Giver  this book was a very interesting it is the first book of the series  In this book starts off with a boy named Jonas who lives in a community that is very strict  weird  and strange one of the strange things is all the people can t see color s and no one has feelings no one can love  love means nothing to anyone love is a meaningless word to everyone  There are two people who can love in this book Jonas  and an elder man none as the Giver he is one of the head people in the community  So in the book Jonas lives with his sister and parents  Jonas is a eleven getting ready to turn a twelve and is about to get his assignment he does not know what he could be because he does not focus on one thing  He is tossing a apple to his best friend named Asher and out of no where the in the air changed it turned red but Jonas didn t know what the color red was or looked like he didn t know what it even look like  It s now the ceremony and he is turning 12  it is about to be his turn then its his turn he is skipped  Jonas was so ashamed  they then call him up  his assignment was to be the receiver the receiver is the one who will be given all the memories of the past and memories of color and etc  Jonas is now taken to a room for training Jonas is given dreams about colors and other fun things like snow   This book was interesting  and could be very boring sometimes  In it there were a lot of flaws and things that could be changed to make it look better  as in how come only the apple changed color and not the whole room  This book was very weird as in how once your assigned a job that is your job till you grow old  I didn t understand how come everybody couldn t see color and couldn t have feelings about one another and if you say a word wrong what if you should not get in trouble for it  I could not foresight this it was hard to tell what happens  I liked this but it kind of made no sense what so ever  This is a book is what would have happened if George Orwell had written Fullhouse  Set in a society in which extremes are non existant everyone is nice to each other and genuinely content  The reader is drawn into what really is a perfect society  I suppose doing a summary of the book is very much like trying to describe an episode of the aforementioned television sitcom  there is really nothing to it  The story is about a boy about to turn twelve  He is apprehensive about what his life career might be and as he begins training for his carerr he is both amazed and shocked at what he sees behind the scenese of this content society I can see in the simplicity of this plot why it could be seen as a piece of children s literature  it did win an award in this category   Th ending is perhaps a touch too simplistic  not delivering quite the punch that these type of books generally do and it is a very quick read  However for me this book does not deserve to be relagated to that category  it is a classic work that should be read by all  This book is seriously the bomb  It makes you view things in such a different way and expands your way of thinking  This book impacted and changed the way I view things and my perspective upon arguments  I think it is a good book to read it you are around the ages of 12 to 17 because you can relate to the main character Jonas  Its an awesome book though I would recommend it to everyone I know   This book is probably my favorite   One of the best books I have ever read  Another short read  just a couple of hours  but it has a lot to teach  I have read it over and over and have told many people about the book at they should read it  Okay so this was a rather easy book to complete  not just due to its size but also the lightness of its writing and the gentle main character  Now in no way am I saying that the book is simple because it is filled with numerous complex ideas  though always from the very distant point of view of a child  meaning they are not expressed in full  To me it seems like a book that is nicely inbetween the Hunger Games every other dystopian novel  not that there is anything wrong with those  they are just a bit repetitive   and a darker more political novel 1984  It gave me a glimpse into a society that I am not too sure of  as normally you know full well that the society is evil  and that rebellion should happen  but here i doubt if a change would be the wisest  due to the phrase Ignorance is Bliss  It is rather interesting in the way that it explores a fundamental question about life  do we try to be human with artistic faults  or do we try for symmetry and order  Which will give us the best happiness  It was amazing how a book of 250 pages can feel like a short story where essentially very little happens  yet there was such development in the main character and the novel is very well structured  I am a little bit confused with the finer details of the novel  but I am sort of stuck between just embracing the confusion and going on Wikipedia to find the answer  now wether this is mine or the books fault you decide  I for one am confused as to the concept of how this event in the novel will actually cause any change in the community   There s a reason this book has won so many awards  It is an amazing work of dystopian fiction  Eye opening and sometimes disturbing  it will create some wonderful discussions about how far a society should go to be logical versus emotional in trying to keep the peace  As far as reading level  a fourth or fifth grader could handle the words but I think it would take a little more maturity to fully appreciate the content  There are some intense scenes in the book regarding babies being killed in this future society and for that alone  I m waiting to share it with my own children  but when I think they are ready  I absolutely want them to read this story    The Giver  was recommended to me when I was quite young  so I didn t get to read it until recently  Knowing that this book was a book to read a few years back  I didn t expect it to be any good  as I thought it would be an easy reader that was relatively simply written with a not very interesting plot line Boy was I wrong  The Giver  is such an interestingly written book that I don t remember reading a book like it  The description that is given to describe the new experiences that Jonas lives through is actually so fascinating and even relatable in a sort of way that I personally cannot explain This book has become one of my favourites over the years and I still tend to think about it in a praising way  The plot line is original and the scenes that happen in it are very attention grabbing as you need to at least finish the chapter you re on before closing the book  I was ecstatic to move on to the next chapter as soon as possible and I just felt worse to finish the book to closer to the end I got I don t have any complaints about the book  really  The relationships between Jonas and Asher is very sweet and the thoughts that Jonas has on Fiona is also absolutely adorable  The different reactions that Jonas has to different people really are noticeable and fascinating  especially since a big part of the book is the slow changes that Jonas has in his attitude and personality the more he finds out about the real world from the Giver Basically  there isn t just one point to the book  there are many different things that you start to see happen in the story  and many times  your heart aches at some of the scenes  Most scenes between Jonas and his baby brother Gabriel are heart warming and could  at least personally  nearly bring you to tears The story really is something that you probably haven t read before  and that s one of my favourite parts The ending of the book is so cool as it incorporates something that happened near the start into the end  Though it s still a bit confusing as the ending has many different meanings  either a happy  or a sad ending  it sort of lays up to you what you prefer to think of it as you re still left with a few questions that you can choose to answer yourself In the end  the book itself is very good  including the small details that you realise are important later on in the story  and the way it was written really gets to you  as you see that going as far as seeing colour on an apple really affects the main character in an unusually  exaggerated  sort of way For me  the book deserves the five stars  but of course my rating will not be reciprocated by everyone  but based on this review  I really hope that you start on with reading this book  because I really  really recommend it   The Giver is a book that was set in the future  The main character Jonas lives in a community with no crime and no happiness  People are assigned parents that didn t bore the kids  The rules were strict and kids were assign specific jobs at the age of 12  Jonas was picked to be the next Giver  He was to be the receiver  In Jonas community  people that went against the community were known to be  released  but people had no idea what it was about  The Giver held all the memories about senses that were banned from the people  Jonas was the Receiver and the Giver was to pass all the memories to Jonas  Jonas started to realize that what was kept from the people  He started to learn the feeling of smell  colors and even music  Finally he learned the actual meaning of  release  was to kill someone by inserting a certain liquid into someone with a needle  During his lessons with The Giver  Jonas started to have an idea of changing the society  Together  they constructed a plan that can change the society but also destroy all of them  One day  Jonas witness his assigned dad  releasing  a twin  Twins weren t allow to both live  The weaker were was to die  The Giver also told the his own daughter was chose to be the his successor before him  But because she couldn t handle all the memories being given to her  she was asked to be released  But this cause the memories she had to return to the society  causing the people to panic  Jonas was to run away so that the memories can be return to the community  Buy he was force to leave earlier than planned because he wanted to save the twin  Gabriel  that was going to be killed  Jonas hid the baby and stole his father bicycle along with some supplies and left  On their way  the community kept tracking them  Jonas used the memory to escape the detections  They finally reached a village with music and light  but along with exhaustion and huger  The Giver was a shock to me  I wasn t expecting what I was going to read  The story plot was well planned and the transitions are smooth  I was really pulled into the plot of the story as I read along  Although that their were a few disturbing scenes in the book when they were killing the baby and had a little sex reference that caught my attention as I read  But I think it was a thought provoking novel   I will recommend this book to my friends  It is because that it changes the way people think and changes the way we view the world  Utopia sounds nice but in reality it might not be as fun as we thought  The Giver by Lois Lowry is about the world with no colour  no thinking  and the world is only with strict rules  The world in The Giver s society is totally with strict rules  If you do something wrong  you are released from the society   Release  is one of the most terrifying thing that could happen to you in this society  Jonas  when he is passing through the experience he had more think of why can t he get out of the world  and start to think getting out of the society  In my opinion  this book has good plot and story  This book also clearly shows what could happen if our society become like this  By thinking that this society could be my society  I felt bit scary while reading this book  If I rate this book  it is probably 5 5 because they clearly shows about society being in strict rules  Also this book makes reader really focused on what will happen next  Like Drama   This book was such a good piece of reading for me  We read it for assigned reading and I was not prepared to like it because of the way our teacher presented the unit and the book  I m always wary of the whole  If everybody was equal  we d live in a utopian wasteland  idea because I feel like it de rails important discussions about social justice and equality  e g  Just because I want gender equality doesn t mean I want everyone to be uniformed pawns of conformity  like what the hell  I was pleasantly surprised when I started reading  I really loved how much love and freedom were stressed instead of the whole  only the strongest survive  idea that I really hate in a lot of Dystopian novels  or at least today   I really felt for Jonas and the themes of loneliness and love really hit me hard One thing you ll notice reading The Giver  is that since it was such an influential book for the utopian dystopian novel is that if you ve read a lot of modern Dystopian books  this will definitely seen stale to you  whether it s written better or not  I usually don t read Dystopian books but I recognized a lot of patterns and that might be a turn off for some people   I thought this was a new book   I thought it was in line with Hunger Games and Divergent  then I realized it may have been one of the originals   I really enjoyed the book and it s a nice quick read  Highly recommend it  What an interesting concept and I can t wait to see the movie Utopia was Thomas More s attempt in 1516 to critique some of the problems in his society and put forth a challenge for reform  but many of the ideas proposed in his story are far fetched and impractical  From More s work  a lot of other utopian and dystopian literature developed and dystopian fiction and films are continually being written Dystopia happens to be one of my favorite genres of fiction  So here s the funny thing  I m sometimes accused of being a perfectionist by people who know me well  but for some reason  I enjoy reading stories of societies which are far from perfect  even though they were established with that intention  I think I like these stories because as a  perfectionist  I m also a fixer  If I see something amiss  or something that I think could be improved upon  I just have to jump in and try to remedy the situation  So I can relate to the story characters that see the problems in their culture and are not content to just accept it and go along with society  I also admire characters who are determined to fight evil and injustice  even when it means defying the culture they live in One of my favorite young adult dystopia books is The Giver by Lois Lowry  I ve read it numerous times and have also taught it a couple of times for Jr  High lit courses  The setting of The Giver could be futuristic or simply an alternate reality  Real historic events that have taken place on Earth are mentioned in the story  so it apparently takes place in a community somewhere on Earth  but not the Earth as we know it  In this community  most aspects of life are controlled  population  weather  education  jobs  recreation  property ownership  even death  Families are formed by a Committee that assigns spouses and children to each household  and occupations are assigned to children when they turn 12   Sameness  is emphasized and individuality is discouraged  Asking questions is considered rude  and everything is carefully planned out in order to  protect people from wrong choices   Rules are strictly enforced and very hard to change Twelve year old Jonas had always been respectful of authority and very careful about following the rules  He accepted the way things were  the rules made sense  and he never questioned them  Although he was aware that the rules stated that  if you don t fit in  you can apply for Elsewhere and be released   How could someone not fit in  The community was so meticulously ordered  the choices so carefully made   While the community is rather isolated and protected and its citizens are almost completely free of pain  sorrow  illness  fear  or worry  it is also devoid of creativity  variety  privacy  imagination  opinions  choices  and adventure  The story s conflict develops when Jonas is selected to be the Receiver of Memory  the most important job in the community  and  now  for the first time in his twelve years of life  Jonas felt separate  different  He remembered what the Chief Elder had said  that his training would be alone and apart  When he begins his training to take on the role of Receiver  which is passed on to him from the Giver of Memory   Jonas gradually learns about all that has been kept from the people  for their good   As Jonas gains this awareness  he begins to resent the restraints and rules in his society that are limiting personal freedom  individual expression  and human relationships  As he acquires memories  experiences feelings  and gains an understanding of concepts like family and love that none of the people in his community are familiar with  he becomes more alienated from them and discontent with his life  At one point  Jonas expresses his frustration with the situation with the Giver  But why can t everyone have the memories  I think it would seem a little easier if the memories were shared  You and I wouldn t have to bear so much by ourselves  if everybody took a part  The Giver sighed   You re right   he said  But then everyone would be burdened and pained  They don t want that  And that s the real reason The Receiver is so vital to them  and so honored  They selected me   and you   to lift that burden from themselves   When did they decide that   Jonas asked angrily   It wasn t fair  Let s change it   How do you suggest we do that  I ve never been able to think of a way  and I m supposed to be the one with all the wisdom  Jonas wonders if things could somehow be changed  but it is the Giver who comes up with the plan to return the memories back to the community In The Giver  Lois Lowry uses foreshadowing effectively to build the suspense  As the story progresses  she gradually gives the reader more information about Jonas  society and what is kept from them in order to maintain a sense of security and sameness  The Giver also raises some good topics discussion  which is why I chose it for literature studies  For example   Is it worth giving up personal freedom in order to have security safety   Which is safer or better for society    freedom of choice or control  Which is better for the individual   Is it better to express inner thoughts  feelings  concerns  and opinions  or are some thoughts and feelings better kept to ones  self   How do family and other personal relationships give life more meaning and purpose   How are mistakes  disappointments  pain and sorrow important  even beneficial  in life   Why are memories important in our life  If we could have all of our bad memories erased  would that make us happier individuals Warning to parents and teachers  The Giver has been the target of censorship due to some of the controversial subjects it touches  particularly euthanasia  For this reason and for its minor references to sex and drugs  I would recommend this book for ages 12 and up  Apparently some have thought that Lowry is suggesting that some of the practices in Jonas  society should be implemented in the real world  However  I think it s clear that she is merely putting forth a hypothetical situation to show the possible negative consequences of establishing such a rigid  controlled community The Giver was followed by three additional companion works  Gathering Blue  Messenger  and finally Son  which was published in 2012  I ve read all but the last one  but so far The Giver remains my favorite  it s a story that really stays with you  The Giver  by Lois Lowry  is about a preteenager named Jonas who lives in a perfect world where nothing that makes humanity suffer exists  Jonas  like the other people in his  community  is assigned a occupaction when they turn 12  During the  Cerimony of 12   Jonas was selected to be the next reciever of memory  The Giver  a very eldar man  then trains Jonas to experience the true pain and pleasure of life before the world he lives in  There is no turning back for Jonas in this suspence story that had won a literary medal Jonas has friends and family living in his community  He has two friends  Asher who is a wise guy that mixes up his use of vocabuary  and Fiona who is close friends with Jonas  His family consists of his parnets  Lily his younger sister  and Gabe who is temperary moved in until a mother is assigned with him  The tone of  The Giver  is some sort of monotone  the mood setting is something of an old black and white movie and the language is sophisicated because some everyday terms we use may feel too powerful for the community citizens to handle  It is a successful book because it makes the reader guess what will happen next throughout the story  This book is recommended for suspence fans and for those who has a great knowledge of vocabuary  Stars  5       Overall  Words can not describe how AMAZING this book is  It made me take a look at the way the world and how life works way differently  Characters  Jonas   the GiverPage Turner  Yes  especially once you start to see the Giver Series Cont  Yes   sadly i just found this out    PRecommend  OMG YES  If you haven t read this book already then you need to get to it because it s genius   This is a spectacular book    Lois Lowry makes a utopia turn into a dystopia  And that alone makes this an AMAZING book I love how the writer makes you want to keep reading by keeping things exciting  Having thepsychological part of the protagonist I think is especially important  This makes it so you can put yourself in the characters shoes and better understand what the character is going through I think this book will keep your interest and not disappointAnd I can t wait for the movie that is coming out           https   www youtube com watch v iJNNu    I d been meaning to read this book for quite awhile  but was nudged by my friend Lisa to read it now  I really enjoyed it  Although it is a children s book  it can be read and enjoyed by everyone It takes place in an unspecified time in the future  where there is no wars  no pain  no fear  no lying  no bad weather  Everything seems  perfect   But there is also no choices  everything is determined for you  Most people live happy  fulfilled lives  In their twelfth year  children are assigned their life vocation  This book reaffirms my appreciation for diversity  and how things that are not pleasant  like bad weather  make one appreciate the good all that much more A very thought provoking read  Great for older children  maybe as young as 8 or 9  depending on the child  through adults   This book was a true pleasure to read  Although I have read it before many years ago  I did not remember it so it was like reading a new book all over again  This easy to read book was so engaging and interesting that all I coud do was keep turning the pages   The whole idea about a futuristic society where everything and everyone is controled  with no feelings  choices  color etc    is so interesting to me  I like how Lowry created this world so vividly and almost realistic that it was very easy to visualize and someday could be a possibility hundreds of years from now   My favorite characters are the main ones of coarse  The Giver and Jonas  but I also like Gabriel as well because he was an important part of the story  This is not a spoiler alert but one of my favorite parts is when the Giver gives Jonas the memory of christmas  I mostly like this part because it gives a visual of what I love and remember christmas to be  and Jonas seems to like it just as much I do   I would highly reccommend this book to anyone and of any age  It is easy to read  quick and very well written  The details make the book come alive with your imagination  making it an easy book to visualize   Este libro es buenisimo  Te hace sentir diferente y te cambia  Amo este libro  Me encanta la Comunidad ya que todos son MUY inocentes y tu te sientes asi tambien  Sientes que el corazon se te encoge  bueno  eso en mi caso  con las situaciones que ellos pasan  Una parte que me marco mucho es la de las paginas 123 125    Vosotros sentis amor por mi Hubo un momento de silencio violento  Despues Papa solto una risilla   Jonas   Que tu salgas con eso   Precision de lenguaje  por favor   Que quieres decir   pregunto Jonas Hacer reir no era ni mucho menos lo que habia previsto  Tu padre quiere decir que has usado una palabra muy generalizada  tan vacia de contenido que ya casi no se usa  explico cuidadosamente su madre Jonas les miro sin pestanear   Vacia de contenido  Jamas en su vida habia sentido nada tan lleno de contenido como aquel recuerdo        Comprendes por que es insatisfactorio emplear una palabra como  amor    pregunto Mama Jonas asintio  Si  gracias  lo comprendo  respondio lentamente Era la primera vez que le mentia a sus padres   Otra parte que fue muy     reveladora  fue la parte del juego  128 131  ya que yo nunca habia cabido en la cuenta de cuan cruel es ese juego  Este libro te hace  despertar   darte cuanta de muchas cosas  Yo diria que de una forma u otra  te hace un poco mas sabio  Ame a Jonas  el personaje es hermoso  Por ser tan valiente y luchar por lo que el cree que es correcto  por su inocencia y por su amor por las personas  Tambien ame al Dador  por ser tan bondadoso y por sufrir todo lo que sufria por el bien de las personas  Por ver a Rosemary ser liberada y seguir adelante  Esos personajes son simplemente magnificos El final te deja en shock  yo literalmente tuve que leerlo dos veces porque no me lo podia creer  Cuando lo terminas solo quieres comprar el siguente libro  Este libro es uno de mis favoritos ahora  Este libro me parece magnifico  Even though I watched the movie adaptation of the book before I read it  this book is awesome  I enjoyed every page of it  I wanted to read it for a long time and I m really glad that I finally did  Teresa ChoMrs  ElshoffWriting 25 December 2015 Different and yet the same  The Giver and Anthem about the freedom of mankind Imagine two novels  The first one  Anthem  is about a dystopian society written by a Russian woman in 1973  The second one is called The Giver and is about a society with perfect order written by an American man and even featured as a major motion picture in 2014  Readers might agree that the two award winning novels are both intriguing and interesting but might not notice how many similarities they actually contain  However  if one looks deeply into the two stories  they are more similar than different  In the novel The Giver by Lois Lowry  readers can easily spot numerous similarities to the novel Anthem by Ayn Rand in the ways of the society  characteristics of the main character  and the it s message   To begin with  the governing style of the society of The Giver is closely related to a communist society and so is the community of Anthem  Both societies are from the future and their government has decided to change the ways of the society from the past  Each society does not provide any liberation or individuality and strongly emphasizes the concept of sameness  This shows how the two authors are illustrating their societies by exaggerating existing communist countries such as China  Cuba  Laos  and North Korea in the real world  In The Giver  the society s government has sovereignty and controls even the most basic possessions of the citizens  For example   The children all received their bicycles at Nine  they were not allowed to ride bicycles before then   Lowry 13   Similarly  in Anthem  Equality 7 2521 tells the readers how they are brainwashed by the society and how they are taught that  We are one is all and all in one  There are no men but WE  One  indivisible and forever    Rand 19  Furthermore  both of the novel s main characters show similar traits in their personality and has similar ideas  For instance  Jonas from The Giver and Equality 7 2521 from Anthem shows inquisitiveness when both characters discovers something new  For Jonas  his discoveries are the memories of the forgotten past transmitted to him by the Giver  His eagerness to learn shows starting from his first receiving of a past memory  the memory of snow and sled riding  In this scene  he shows his passion and curiosity by feeling  eager for whatever experience would come next  But he had  suddenly  so many questions   Lowry 83   For Anthem s Equality  his new discovery is the concealed science lab from the past  In the mysterious lab  Equality 7 2521 secretly reads books  conducts experiments  and learns new things daily  During this process  he shows his spirit of inquiry  eagerness to learn  and how he  loved the Science of Things  We wished to know  We wished to know about all the things which make the earth around us   Rand 23  Rand and Lowry have both chosen their main character to have curiosity which enables them to constantly question the world and give them the potential to break free from the chains of their controlling society  Moreover  both novels send a message to their readers with a similar message  In The Giver s case  the story concludes with a scene of Jonas escaping the community  This shows the readers how freedom leads to glee for  he had never felt such simple moments of exquisite happiness   Lowry 192   Similarly  Anthem s Equality 7 2521 absconds from his communist community to emphasize the importance of human liberty  This also proves the author s point of the importance of human freedom as he  declared to all his brothers that a man has rights which neither god nor king nor other men can take away from him  no matter what their number  for his is the right of man  and there is no right on earth above this right   Rand 102   In modern days  freedom and liberation is something that are considered to be a basic possession given to all man  However  due to the world s dark past of slavery  concentration camps  the soviet union and much more  both novels tries to show their readers how freedom is not meant to be controlled or taken away from   Overall  The Giver and Anthem are two novels that are very similar in various ways  Some might disagree  since they have a different story line and contain a lot of different events  However  by showing readers a similar community  characters  and a message  The Giver by Lois Lowry and Anthem by Ayn Rand can be considered to be homogeneous and shows a lot of common aspects  One of the reasons why such similar stories could have been written despite their time difference and their distinct authors  is because society sometimes tends to corrupt and results in negative aspects such as communism or dominant rule until this day  Both novels are addressing this world wide issue  and aim to show readers the importance of liberation  They both believe that every man should have their own rights and Equality emphasizes this point by saying   I guard my treasures  my though  my will  my freedom   Rand 96   Works CitedLowry  Lois  The Giver  New York  Laurel Leaf  2002  Print Rand  Ayn  Anthem  Place of Publication Not Identified  Signet N A L  1982

 Web  11 Dec  2015  The Giver   Common Sense Media  N p   15 Aug  2014  Web  11 Dec  2015  i like this book but there is a problem  The end is a cliff hanger which i dont like  Jonas a boy who lives in an utopian world is assigned to the giver  At twelve every child is assigned a work place on what their good at  The giver gives Jonas a power of receiving memories  During the time he is receiving hs memories he see s color  Since Jonas  world is in black and white he is the only one to see color because he is the receiver of the memories  Only him and the giver can see color  Then when he finds out he is having a baby brother he takes his brother and tries to escape the horrific world he is living in  My favorite part was when he saw color for the first time because he was really freaked out  My least favorite part was the ending  Lois Lowry just left us dying to know what it was  This book was in a trailer  i saw the trailer and i waslike  I ll read the vook then watch the movie  The book is always better than the movie   i was right  the movie was just a love story  i did enjoy this book but it made mad at times  i felt like strangling Louis  Overall i would read this book again because why not and i would definately reccomend just be prepared to be mad at Louis  I saw the movie before I read the book  The book is better  Lowry does an excellent job of revealing how stunted the people are in this Utopia  and they don t even know or understand how much of life they are missing  As Jonas discovers things  I thought  They don t see that   And the control over their lives is so insidious their responses are programmed  I would have never made it in that world  I would have been Elsewhere Did you know there are sequels to this story  I think I will try another  The first of Lois Lowry s The Giver series  Lowry tells the fascinating  original and depressing story of Jonas and the dystopian community that surrounds him  The Plot  Jonas is a 12 year old boy that has lived in his community for his entire life  He s never known anything but his community  He s never known about the things called snow or rain  he s never heard the sound of an airplane fly overhead  he s never even experienced real human emotions  like true love or depression  Jonas hasn t even seen in color  The only person in the whole community that can understand all of these things is the Receiver Every person in the community is assigned a task at the age of 12  From then on  they are to work with the people who have the same task  Jonas is given the task of the Receiver  He soon meets the man who was the old Receiver  now called the Giver  and is welcomed into the world as we know it today  The Ending  SPOILERS ALERT  This section has spoilers    After figuring out that Gabriel  a child Jonas s family has been taken care of  also has the ability to take in the memories of the normal world  Jonas escapes the community with Gabriel  After days of traveling farther away from the community  he finally finds a sled on a snowy hill  like in his favorite memory the Giver gave him  He explains that he can see a Christmas tree and that he can hear music  The book ends without telling the reader what exactly happened  but we assume that he lives and is now in the normal world  The Goods  Though the story may sound a bit cliched  I don t consider the story as a whole unoriginal at all  The reader can tell that Lowry put a lot of thought into Jonas s world and the emotions he feels and things he sees  I loved the effort that Lowry put in to what Jonas saw after his sessions with the Giver  It really shows what he s been missing  and it makes you think about whether or not you could really live without love or colors  SPOILERS ALERT  This paragraph has spoilers   I am a very deep person  therefore I strongly appreciate the depressing moments of the story  Like when Jonas s father had to kill the twin baby  That was horrible  But you felt what Jonas felt  not in the full sense  but you felt appalled that someone would kill a little baby just because he s the smaller than his twin  and then throw them down a garbage chute  This was just devastating  The feelings of betrayal  depression  and confusing were very well played out in this novel And overall  I loved the plot  Especially the ending  Not to sound British or anything  but oh  the ending was brilliant  I love mysterious endings  did he die or not        and I love it when the books are more personal and letting you decide  It s like The Shining  Stanley Kubrick s version of the movie   otherwise  the original movie in 1980   Both the movie and The Giver left out a lot pertaining to what exactly happened  and it makes it more personal  something for you to decide what happens or not  I think the music and the Christmas feeling and everything at the ending of The Giver really made me love it  Again  I m all for mysterious endings  The Bads  I can t think of anything bad about this book  End of conversation In conclusion  The Giver was anything but a cliche  Sure  the idea of a boy who escapes from his dystopian home sounds a little overused  but after you read the book  you will think differently  Don t let the sound of the idea throw you off  The way that Lowry wrote out the novel made it completely original and a favorite of her books I Recommend this Book  ages 11 and up  for extremely depressing moments and a scene with suggestive content My Rating     I loved it  This book was better than I expected  I liked how the author made the character of Jonas go from a young boy who knew basically nothing about life to a young man who was willing to risk his life to save another  as well as enlighten a community who desperately needed it  This change only took a year  showing what a strong person the character really was  Overall  I really enjoyed the take on what can happen if people decide that feelings are too much to bear  Simple isn t always a better way of life  I Think That The Giver Was I fun Book   Then It Kind of Got Boring  I Didnt Understand The Book At The beggining   Then It Came To A End An I Didnt Understand What Was Going On  They Should Have Been More specific At The End When They Was Running Away  Jonas In Gabe should Of stayed In The Community But Jons Did What He Had To Do  I Didnt Like This Book Because First   The Giver s Daughter Rosemory Was Released   Then They Had KIlled That Little Twin   And I Didnt Like The Fact That When They Killed Poeple They Called It Release  I Will Not Recommend This Book  It Stoopid IN Boring An Very Confusing   I do Not like THis book at all   they should have never made it     SPOILER ALERT    Do you like science fiction novels  The giver is a science fiction novel  I think the book is a great book to read because it has a good plot  Jonas  an eleven year old boy who lives in a rigidly controlled society some time in the future  In his  community   there is no suffering  hunger  war  and  no color  music  or love  Everything is controlled by  the Elders   right down to who you will marry  who you receive as children  and what you will be  assigned  as a job Individual identity has gone the way of cassette tapes  and everyone is essentially just like everyone else  It seems that no one has really left the area  except to visit other neighboring communities  To get  released  is a big deal  It only happens to sick infants or really old people  or to people who break the rules  The story takes place in an unspecified time in the future in a utopian community that is part of a larger utopian society  presumably on Earth  Jonas s new emotional and sensory awareness cause him to rebel against the restrictions his society places on freedom of choice  individuality  emotion  and human experience  The conflict is Person vs self because Jonas cannot control his emotions and he doesn t know what to do in respect  The themes are the importance of memory  the relationship between pain and pleasure  the importance of the individual  The 3rd person point of view affects the story by only letting the narrator know what Jonas observes and thinks  A major event that changed the character is when Jonas discovered his father killed babies who couldn t survive in the community  This made Jonas very mad and sad  He didn t know what to think of  Jonas started to cry and sob  He started to lie in the community  His rules told him he may lie  but he hadn t  No one in the community may lie  Jonas started to lie to his parents  called the family unit  The character s motivation is when his father says Gabriel will be released  Gabriel is a new child that is in Jonas family unit because Gabe isn t strong enough  Jonas family takes care of Jonas for a while  SO Jonas gets angry and sad when he finds out Gabe is going to be released  I was angry when I found out that Gabe was going to be killed  I started to feel like Jonas because it makes me sad when babies die for no apparent reason  I was satisfied with Jonas when he decided to leave the community with Gabe in secret because I would have done the same thing  When the Giver gives Jonas memories of strength and heat and cold  Jonas leaves  My favorite part is when Jonas crosses the boundary of memories and releases all the memories  Another favorite part is when Jonas hears music at the end and sees a house and go s inside   One of the best books I ve ever read  One of the best books ever written  Cealy F GoodReads ReviewEnglish   Yellow The Giver by Lois Lowry is an amazing Dystopian book  One of the big themes in this book or how the author thinks people should behave is to never give up in what you believe in  This book is set in a utopian community  probably a long time from now  in the future  This community is isolated from anything else in the world at that time  everything is perfect there  and there is much sameness  For example  only when kids turn a certain age are they allowed to have a bike  and ride it to and from school  Everyone is watched in the community so the Chief Elder can make sure everyone is following the strict rules  The Chief Elder even has cameras places in houses so she can watch people s every move  Jonas is a twelve year old boy who lives in this community  and is also the main character in the book  Every year  during the ceremony of twelves  the twelves  twelve year olds  are given a life time occupations  When Jonas turned twelve  he was chosen to become the new Receiver of Memory  the most important job in the community  During Jonas  training  one of the other main characters  The Giver  the old receiver of memory  transfers memories of the past  that came from outside of their community to Jonas  including memories of snow  and music  After a few of the memories have been transferred into his memory  he begins to notice that his community is far from perfect  and everyone there lacks emotion  they only have trained emotion  He  and The Giver are the only ones who can think for themselves  because of all the memories they have of the past when people actually did have feelings for themselves  He also has a few questions about his community  and asks to see a video of a baby getting released   A baby getting released into  elsewhere   away from the community because it s not strong enough or too small   After the video  Jonas realizes that the babies aren t really getting released into elsewhere  but actually getting a shot that eventually kills them  Jonas learns that Gabriel  a baby staying at Jonas  family s house so he can become stronger  and begin to start sleeping at night easier  is going to be released soon  and wants to save him  When looking through The Givers things  Jonas figures out that is he passes his community s border  he will release all of the memories and everyone s personal feelings throughout the utopia  Jonas goes on a mission to help his community  and to save Gabriel from being released  he brings him along  I like this book because the ending let me imagine what happened myself  I liked this because most books that I red don t include this type of ending  The ending gave me a curious mood that made me want to find out more  After Jonas and Gabriel s mission  the narrator explains   Behind him  across vast distances of space and time  from the place he had left  the thought he heard music too  But perhaps it was only an echo    178  This is important because the author leaves out part of the story so you can decide what happens  I also enjoyed this book because it had an strange and unique  but interesting setting  The author writes   Everyone had known  he remembered with humiliation  that the announcement  Attention  This is a reminder to male elevens that objects are not to be removed from the recreation area and that snacks are to be eaten  not hoarded   had been specifically directed at him  the day last month that he had taken an apple home    23  This shows how strict the leaders of the community are  and how perfect they strive to make their community  It also proves how much the leaders watch over everyone  and how strict their rules are  I understand now that no matter how hard the challenge is  always be up for doing something you believe in  It s important that people follow this in real life so someone can follow their own path in life  not just copy what everyone else is doing or believes in  This same theme reappears in the book Chains by Laurie Halse Anderson  where a slave in the New York area fights for what s right to be set free  I would recommend this book to anyone who loves science fiction or classic books  I would recommend this book to my friends because it has a very unique  but interesting setting that makes you want to learn more about the background of Jonas  community   I had heard many things about The Giver  and it has been on my to read list for awhile  I started to read it because my English teacher wanted the class to read challenged banned books  so I thought it would be a great opportunity to read it  Anyway  once I began reading the first page  I knew I would love it since my kinds of books are the ones based on the future and dystopian  Jonas is a very special twelve year old boy  He is different from everyone else  and he has task that everyone relies on  He meets The Giver  and he learns many new things from him that no one else is able to manage  There are many things you have to infer about in the novel too  which I like because it keeps me engaged with the story  You can tell that Lowry s imagination just ran wild when she was writing this story  This book is definitely in my top list of dystopian novels  and I would love to be able to read the rest of the books from the series  This book blew my mind  I can t believe it s a middle grade book though  It seems to me that a middle grader would not be able to fully grab the concept and depth of this book  I did not want this story to end and was sad it was so short  I enjoyed every second of it  Such a wonderful and original idea for a story  So enjoyable  Creative  This was by far  one of my favorite reads of this year  The Giver is about Jonas  an eleven year old boy who lives in a strictly controlled society some time in the future  In his  community   there is no suffering  hunger  war  color  music  or love  Everything is controlled by  the Elders   right down to who you will marry  who you receive as children  and what you will be  assigned  as a job  Individual identity has gone the way of cassette tapes  and everyone is essentially just like everyone else  It seems that no one has really left the area  except to visit other neighboring communities  To get  released  is a big deal  It only happens to sick infants or really old people  or to people who break the rules  Because Jonas is almost twelve  it s almost time for him to get assigned a profession  There s a big ceremony at which the decisions are announced  Jonas watches all his friends get their jobs  but then he s skipped over  The Chief Elder finishes the ceremony and explains that Jonas has been  selected  to be The Receiver of Memory  which is a BIG DEAL  Jonas looks over at the current Receiver  an old man who  like Jonas  has light eyes  Jonas must recieve the memories from the old Receiver  who is now referred to as The Giver  These aren t just any old personal memories  they are all the memories of humanity  going way back  The memories are from before their community was established  back when there was color and love and music and emotions and hills and snow and sunshine  all of which are gone from Jonas s world  The very first memory he receives is that of sledding down a hill in the snow  While Jonas gets to experience lots of fun things like Christmas and birthday parties  he also experiances the bad memories  like sunburn  loss  death  and warfare  This completely changes the way Jonas looks at his world  He realizes that no one around him has ever felt any real emotions at all  Jonas encounters many challenging situations throughtout the book  I highley recomend reading this book  it teaches you that ignorance is hapiness because if you don t know something  it can t hurt you  This book also makes you wonder what life would be like if we lacked emotion and feeling and it persuades you to be thankful for the good and bad things that happen to you in life  In  The Giver   Jonas s world is the same everyday  Everything goes as planned  and there is never and war  pain  conflict  or any kind of emotion  One day  it is time for Jonas to recieve his Assignment  and he is selected to take on the best  yet most painful and difficult Assignment of all  the Reciever of Memory  Jonas soon learns his world is not only boring  but it is unfair and unknowledgeable A situation in  The Giver  where there was an injustice is when Gabriel is to be released  The Nurturers in the Nurturing Center find that Gabriel is much weaker than the other children and can t sleep through the night  He is then sent to live with Jonas s family unit  so hopefully they can help him catch up to all the other children  He grows a little healthier and Jonas transmits some memories to him to help him sleep through each night  however  the Community still decides that he is too weak The situation is resolved  Jonas already knows what release is  and he is in the process of running away for the Community s own good  He resolves the situation by bringing Gabriel with him  The injustice affected Jonas s family unit because they had grown attached to Gabriel and now they would never get to see him or Jonas again  It affected Jonas because he now has to support himself and Gabriel while he tries to save the Community There are many groups who would find this book acceptable  Because this is a Science Fiction genre book  I would recommend this to readers who like sci fi  Also  this is a great book for students doing a book report because our class analyzed it deeply and found that there are multiple examples of symbolism and great for finding different themes  This book is not mainly aimed towards boys or girls  so it is suitable for either gender  Because of its many themes and symbolism  this book is very interesting and a fun book to read during your free time  What a gorgeous book  The Giver is a beautiful story  gracefully told by Lois Lowry  After having trudged through so many of the teen dystopian sagas of late  it was really nice to read this book   not that it paints a cheery picture for us  but because it is told in a much different way than the others  With others  we get large scale governmental conspiracies  but this is an intimate story  much better suited to be rendered on the stage as a play than as an August popcorn movie  Perfect for use in the classroom   grades 7 9 would be ideal   it could spawn some terrific discussions among children  I first read this book while in junior high school  I believe I was in 8th grade   I loved it back then  and have looked forward to the day that I pick it up to read again during my adulthood  I finally got around to reading it again  and it did not disappoint  I was captivated from beginning to end  The story fits the mold of what is now very popular in young adult fiction when it comes to futuristic  dystopian societies  It is interesting that this came out so long before the trend was popular  I was surprised by how dark the story was in many places  as well as how sad certain things were in Jonas  life  I didn t remember feeling some of these things when I read  The Giver  as a younger reader  I highly recommend this book  and was interested to learn that the series continued with three additional books  I had always thought it was a stand alone story until very recently  VERY SLIGHT SPOILERS I don t want to give anything away  but I will say that I still remember how blown away I was back in 8th grade when the story twist was revealed halfway through the book  That reading moment has stuck with me my entire life   Honestly  this book was one of the best I ve read  I cannot describe this book other than  a perfect read   Mom got mad at me for coming to dinner twenty minutes late so I could finish the book  It was an easy read  but boy did it keep me hanging on until the end  Lois Lowry has built such structure into this book  changing the meaning of dystopian  It almost made me feel like I was in the book  Of course I had to see the movie  which could ve been better  as I enjoyed reading the book much more  I gave this book 5 stars because many of the books I ve read haven t made me think as much as this book has  Usually non fiction books and historical fiction really make me think  but I ve read this book at least four years ago  and being sufficiently young I didn t quite understand what was going on behind the scenes and I couldn t understand Lowry s way of writing  so I read it again a few years later and I was astonished at how much I picked up from it the second time  I know this book made me think because I still remember three pages of it  Didn t memorize it  didn t read it over and over again  Lowry s writing is just so different  it s so well structured  well written  and  well  beautiful  We all experienced things in life that we wish to erase or block from our memory  Many of us wish neither to feel pain nor suffering  This book will show you that even Utopic attempts to achieve idealistic societies for humans will backfire and ultimately create a dystopian one  If you can t feel the extremes of sensations that means you are restricted i e  you are not free  Amazing book  loved it     This review is originally posted on The Bookish Girl                  Thought provoking  It s the perfect adjective I could come up with to describe this amazing book But before I get into the review  let me tell you something embarrassing first  I ve heard about this book for years already  but I couldn t bring myself to pick it up until now  because I was put off by the cover   insert awkward laugh  Okay  so the old man on the cover made me hesitate  since I wasn t sure if I wanted to read about an old man  Then the movie came out  and everyone kept talking about it  so I bought the movie tie in edition and read the first page  And BAM  I didn t know what I had been missing until I read it Following a 12 year old boy Jonas  not an old man obviously   we are introduced to a  perfect  society  Nothing or nobody is out of place  Everything is in order and  Sameness  is appreciated  Then when Jonas reaches 12  he is selected as the new Receiver  Then his training begins  and the familiar world is different ever since Unlike most of the other dystopian stories  which may require some time to get into the new worlds  I found it very easy to immerse myself into this different society in The Giver  It had the magic to pull you in  and make you believe that it was real  And you know  in other popular dystopians like Divergent and The Hunger Games  they kinda focus on the kick ass side of the characters  rather than the problems of the dystopia  Yet  without romance and fighting scenes  this book really provides questions for you to think about  I believe the purpose of dystopian novels is to stimulate our minds  using the undesirable conditions of a future society as a warning  and this book really does a great job on that I m now very curious to know what happens next and I m excited to see the movie soon  I hope   I seriously hope that you would pick up this book if you haven t yet                You can get this book on Bookdepository The Giver  the Giver  certainly gave a great performance  I just can t believe what the earth and it s society could be years from now  or even going on right now  The story line of an innocent little kid  Jonas  no knowing his future on his towns ceremony year  Every year at the mark of age from 1 12 and each age has a milestone  The twelfth year of age was the most significant in Jonas s community because kids started job training that they have been assigned  He gets one of the most honored jobs in his community but  this job involves pain  sorrow  and yet happiness  In this book you have to take a ride along with Jonas and experience what its like to have a whole new world right before your eyes in seconds  This goes from one of the most perfect societies to one of the most infamous societies on the inside  As Jonas finds out that he can change this  it may cost him his life  So can you endure the pain and sorrow that Jonas endure or will you apply for release  I remember really enjoying this book about 12  years ago when I first read it in school  though now that I ve read it again as an adult  I m surprised that I liked it back then  or rather there s so much in this little book that I m sure I didn t understand a lot of what the book was trying to say  In that sense  this book is more suited to adults  but in another sense  it s definitely a top notch book for introducing younger readers to Orwellian and Utopian themes Things that I found very interesting this time around that I probably didn t catch appreciate when a kid 1 The fact that the community in which the story takes place chose the life they live  sacrificing some basic human aspects to perpetuate a sense of total control and safety   We gained control of many things  But we had to let go of others  2 The fact that childbirth is the lowest and least honorable position in the society3 Everyone takes pills to keep the  stirrings  away once they hit puberty  Had to laugh a bit at that  but eerily creepy as well 4 The emphasis the community puts on maintaining  the sameness   the fact that racial culling was involved in their past 5 The connection the author draws between freedom and choice   If everything s the same  then there aren t any choices  6 The deplorable fact that people basically chose not to choose  and in doing so  made one person their scapegoat who would carry the burden they had made so that everyone else could escape responsibility Overall  this small book is packed with interesting themes and topics  I wish there had been just a little more of everything  but then it probably wouldn t have been a children s book  A rather abrupt ending  but not necessarily unsatisfying If you ve never read this book at least once in your life  go get it  It was excellent  I loved it although some parts were cruel  But I liked it alot     Wow this book was very interesting  I don t love this whole dystopia genre like The Hunger Games  Matched series etc  but this one was interesting  What happens when you turn 12 and get your vocation  what happens when you are  released  from society  What if you find out your reality isn t what you think it is  This dysptopian society is fascinating in it s weirdness  Parents don t have their own biological children  they are basically test tube babies a birth mother incubates and they you can request a child from the pool  Children aren t with their new parents from birth  They are raised for 1 year by the society before they can go to regular families to make sure there are not abnormalities  Being a birth mother is 3 years of ease and plenty of food  they are allowed to have 2 children   and then they are sent to hard labor  When you get old you get a  release  ceremony by no one knows where they go  To another society  To a big party  No on knows  Parents don t pick their marriage partner  they can only request 2 children  One boy one girl  Undesirable babies  like those who cry all night or are sick or are born as a twins  only the strongest twin will survive  are  released   There are no cars only bikes  and people only see in black and white  There are so many details and things that are interesting I couldn t even write them all but basically the lead character  a young boy  gets his new job and he is to be receive all the knowledge an information about society past and present from The Giver an old man ready to be  released   This is a very painful process physically and mentally  The last Receiver failed and asked to be  released  because she could not accept and process and deal with the pain that all the information brings  Can the new receiver fulfill his duty to society  Once he finds out the truth about his society and even about the parents he loves can he accept the Status Quo  Great book    maybe for as early as high school students  Way too deep for Elementary or Middle School kids I loved this book and am going to read the whole trilogy   I believe this is an incredible book that was new when I was young in late elementary or middle school  It s obvious it s geared towards children  but I believe reading this in middle school rather than other short novellas  we read would have been incredible  I doubt as a young preteen I could appreciate the story as much as I did  seeing the nuances very clearly  It raises incredible questions on the role of emotions and individuality that are invaluable  I have always been a reader  I would have relished this in school as required reading and see this book has most definitely influenced other books that are contemporary     the most obvious being the divergent series  The Giver is one of my all time favorite books  Of the few books I ve ever reread  The Giver is the one I ve reread the most  It is everything I could ever want and more from an  utopia gone wrong  novel  Brave New World  while in a similar vein  is dense and lacks the captivating storytelling power that Lowry loads The Giver with  Is bringing this into a classroom even a question  If I could have somehow replaced any book in my high school curriculum  or maybe even middle school  with The Giver  I would have done so in a heartbeat  From a student perspective  there is nothing to dislike in this book  It s got everything  It s got the youth rebelling against the system after he learns just how terrible it is  Hunger Games  major pull  anyone   and it s just so     Ah  it s just so good If a teacher doesn t have to defend bringing Brave New World into the classroom  then I think a teacher should have to fight even less to get The Giver into the classroom  It s a coming of age story and a novel that warns against the dangers of a regulated life  and one without hardship  Especially considering current events in the United States  I would say it s pretty relevant now  but even if it weren t as relevant as it is  students would still find it engaging  How could anyone not  when the novel lures you into a world where everything is seemingly perfect and to be different is wrong  a very popular theme in many YA novels  such as the Uglies Pretties Specials series   Besides engagement  the novel opens up a vast pool of potential dialogue among students  It gets them thinking and talking and  in some cases  arguing  It offers us a perspective nearly impossible to achieve in everyday life The Giver  whether as a classroom text or an independent project  should be available in all classrooms  hands down  I just re read this book  as I m studying it with my grade seven class  I d forgotten how much I love it   The concepts presented really make one think deeply about what is important to make our lives meaningful   Is it made meaningul by choice  seeing colour  marrying who you love  picking your career  having memories     All of these situations are what you will ponder alongside our main character  Jonas   With the popularity of many dystopian novels in the last few years   such as The Hunger Games Trilogy  The Matched Series  The Selection Series  etc  etc    it is nice to be reminded that The Giver was one of the novels on the forefront of this genre for young readers  I just can t speak highly enough of this book    I think that this book is a absolute must read if you like science fiction  However  there are a few key points that make this book more than just your everyday si fi novel  For one thing  there is definitely a slight romance storie between Jones and Fiona  Also  the crucial presence of external conflict of Jones and The Giver against their society and their past  This novel holds so much more than whats on the surface  The use of sameness brings the ability to see what our world would be like without any diference  or individuality  I would highly recremend this book to all types of readers  Is it a Utopia  The life of the people in the community is very protected and safe  In the book Jonas begins to notice some thing  When he looks at stuff it kind of changes but what he s actually seeing is color but he doesn t know that  his world is colorless  well at least to everyone else it is colorless  How would it be like to not be abel to see colors or show emotion  how would that help us  This book made me really look at society and how it is run  it really make you think  i recommend this book to young adult and older people   The Giver  e stato uno dei primi libri distopici che ho letto  e stato quello che probabilmente mi ha fatto veramente rendere conto di cosa effettivamente fosse questo genere  Proprio per questo per me e molto speciale  E  un romanzo che fa pensare e riflettere  che rimane dentro  Una delle cose per me fondamentali in un romanzo e che mi lasci qualcosa  che mi venga da pensare a quella storia anche molto tempo dopo la lettura  Sicuramente  The Giver  mi ha fatto questo effetto  infatti negli anni che sono passati dalla prima volta che l  ho letto ci ho ripensato spessissimo  Il fascino di questo libro l  ha tenuto vivo nella mia memoria  Ora  in vista dell  uscita del film e grazie all  uscita della nuova edizione  ho avuto l  occasione di rileggere questo bellissimo romanzo  Questa seconda lettura me l  ha fatto apprezzare ancora di piu  visto che sono riuscita a cogliere meglio ed a pieno tutto cio che lo collega colleghera ai libri successivi  Io amo  adoro ed impazzisco per questi collegamenti  che fanno di questo libro  che all  apparenza potrebbe sembrare anche autoconclusivo  il primo di una serie con storie intelligentemente intrecciate tra loro  Questo lo rende ancora piu interessante e dona a tutta la serie quel qualcosa in piu L ho trovato ancora una volta particolare  nonostante tutti i libri distopici che ho letto  questo ha qualcosa di speciale  E  sempre piacevolissimo e stimolante e se durante la prima lettura avevo trovato meno bella l  ultima parte rispetto al racconto di come questo mondo e costruito  questa volta l  ho trovata davvero affascinante  tanto quanto tutto il resto e  ovviamente  di fondamentale importanza per il prosieguo di questa meravigliosa serie  I must say I absolutely loved this book  It was definitely a page turner for me  It kept me guessing and wanting to know what is going to happen next constantly  I also was very interested in seeing how Jonas was going to handle all of this responsibility he had gained at such a young age  I really enjoyed how Lois Lowry gave such great detail that I was able to visualize what was going on while reading  This book definitely is an emotional one but I definently would reccomend this book to any student 5th grade and above   The Giver is Portrayed in a perfect world  There are no mistakes and everything is kept in order  At the age of twelve each child is assigned a specific job that fits them to be their occupation in the community  Johnas is chosen to become the new receiver  a position in the community that is rarely talked about of taken over by another person  He must learn to take control of the feelings from the real world  some are absolutely fascinating and wonderful however  there are also gruesome horrible dreaded memories  all in all he must learn to conceal all un perfect feelings from the community  My favorite part in the book is when Johnas receives his first memory  It is incredible to see the joy and happiness a simple memory can bring you  A strong reminder to be grateful for the ability to FEEl  Anyone who likes a book that really sticks out and jumps into your face would absolutely love this book  The Giver was the type of book I didn t want to put down  For some reason I never read it in school and I felt like I was missing out when all of my friends had read it and said it was really good  I decided to get it from the library and it took me only 2 days to read  which is an accomplishment for me because I usually take forever to read a book If you have never read this book I would strongly recommend it  It is a classic that everyone should read  I love it and I need to hurry and get the other 3 books in the quartet   The Giver is truly sensational  Two years ago  I had to read this book for school  I never finished it  Now that I have  I don t regret it  Being a person who has read other dystopian books like The Hunger Games  and Divergent  and Shatter Me  I thought this would be similar  It was in the aspect of the government is ruling society in a way the main character does not agree with and rebels  but The Giver differs  Our main character Jonas is in the dark like all the others in his society about how different their society is and how it has changed  Then upon becoming he receiver  at The Ceremony of Twelve  he begins to understand how his society is altered in a way he does not feel is right  Then with the help of The Giver  he decides to run away leaving his society behind so that they too may experience how their society has differed and altered in a way that is not right  Again like other novels this book talks about courage and sacrifice but in a different way  Whereas The Hunger Games for example  Katniss sets out to kill the rulers of her society like Beatrice in Divergent and Juliette in Shatter Me  Jonas sets out to reveal the truth in a passive non aggressive way which is where this book differs from the rest  Another way this book differs in particular in romance  Yes  Jonas likes his friend Fiona but he does nothing to show her that he likes her  Now that might be because she doesn t understand love the same way he does  being the receiver  Instead to free them all of their Sameness he flees so that they may know the truth  another may this book differs from other dystopian books  Overall  this book is full of decision  freedom and understanding  A beautiful book  5 stars I don t have a problem reading Young Adult books  I read  The Book Thief  last year and it is now one of my favorite books   The Giver  has more than 3 000 positive reviews on Amazon  so I thought I would give it a go Even though it s over 170 pages  the pages are small so it s not a very long read The concept is about a community where everyone doesn t feel  they have strict rules  and everything is decided for you from the clothes you wear to the occupation you have  Her writing style reminds me of Stephen King  but it s a completely clean book  No swearing  sex  or violence One of my favorite parts of the book was reading about a character named Asher  who was always happy and who everyone loved  He was such an easygoing kid and he s the main character s best friend  I d never heard of this book  so it gave me goosebumps There are two other books in the series  Gathering Blue and Messenger although I heard that they can be read independently and all three are equally great If you re a movie buff  this was a cross between The Island  Equilibrium and Pleasantville Recommended to Those who like a good  short read ORThose who like fantasy science fiction books ORThose who are looking for a book to read with their teenagers  Well worth the hype  Over twenty years old now  and many current authors have repeated these themes  although not as deftly as Lowry  who is also providing some beautifully subtle  for a YA novel  especially  commentary on the Reagan administration  adults  needs to ignore the pain of their convoluted pasts and feelings  and the need for teenagers to be like everyone else as they join  adult  society  I couldn t stop reading  even though I was at a day camp for my son and one mom made a snarky comment about how it was so nice I had time to read  Whatever  hater  I m reading The Giver  it s that good   The Giver by Lois Lowry is about a boy named Jones growing up in a town that is very different then ours  In there town they it is all very boring  there are no holidays  music  colors  animals  They do things that are very different then we do things  When have birthdays they have ceremonies of them moving up a year  On they ceremony of twelve they are given there job that they will be doing for the rest of there life  When Jones gets his job he is announced to be the new receiver or memory  The receiver is in charged of keeping all the memories from the past  and only the receiver can see color hear music   Jones wanted everyone to have the memories of the great things that are or was he wanted to everyone to know there is more then what they know now  So he and the old receiver came up with a plan to give every one these memories  He would run away so that when he got some where new all his memories would return to his old home so that every one would have these memories and they would have to see that there is more then the sameness that they only know   I thought this book is one of the best books I have ever read  I thought that the whole thing was just great from start to finished  I think that at the end it would have been cool if he would of kept the book going a little longer  I wish that he would of told us what jones had seen and if he ended up being ok  and if some one had taken him in as there own or something along those lines  Over all I can honestly say that this is one of my all time favorite books ever  If I could recommend this book to any one I would say that any one could read it  I don t think that this book is really for just boys or just girl or anyone specific  Anyone would like this book  If i was rating this book 1 5 I would give this book a 5  It was a great book and once you start you would want to put it down it was that good  I liked this book a lot more than I originally thought I would  The main reason why I read it was because my husband  who reads more sports articles than books  read this in only a few days and told me it is his favorite  Figured why not give it a chance  I loved that it focused mainly on one person but Lowry didn t forget Jonas wasn t the only character  More than a few times I ve been confused while trying to remember details about the character  That didn t happen this time  I m really anxious to read the other books   This book is a futuristic examination of the effects of trying to create a utopian society  one where everyone subscribes to the idealistic happiness of being exactly the same  all your decisions are made for you  everything is orderly and predictable day after day   They are almost robotic   Any person who doesn t comply to the rules  or fit the mold is  released   but no one really knows what that means  they just disappear  Not surprisingly  in their efforts to eliminate any pain or difficulties  this society has also eliminated the ability to experience any deeply felt emotions  true happiness  or love for another person  Jonas is the 12 year old boy assigned to be  the Receiver  and therefore holds all the memories of past societies  before their attemps at controlling everything   both the happiness and the sorrow  and to be the keeper of these memories so that the rest of the society can live their burden free lives  The burden that he must bear is incredible  and I kept comparing Jonas  calling to that of Christ s  born to bear the pain of all of our sins  I don t know if that s something the author was trying to convey or not  but those were some of my thoughts  After seing how wonderfully colorful  unpredictable  and meaningful life used to be  Jonas is no longer able to be a part of this absurd community  Great book   The book is called The Giver  It is written by Lois Lowry  Book s genre is novel  I read this book because I watched the movie and I really liked it    The Giver   is a story of a world where everything is controlled  The story centers on Jonas s life  How he lives in a world where everything is controlled and when he meets the real world with pain and color  fun and love  The main characters are Jonas and the Elder who is the Giver  The plot is exiting  fun and thrilling  The thing I liked was that Jonas ran away with Gaby and took care of him  But in the same time I didn t like the ending because I wanted to know more  Young people would enjoy this book because it is different in a good way and interesting  I can thoroughly recommend it to teenagers who like exciting books  I first read Lois Lowry s The Giver back when I was in grade school  I remember that I loved it so much  I read every single one of her books that I could get my little  eager hands on  Prior to rereading the book last week  I did not remember entirely what the story was about or my exact reactions to it as a young adult reader  As a 22 year old reading the book  I am a bit out of the typical YA age range  which I am sure impacted my opinions of the story  making me wish I could remember how it impacted me back when I was the same age as the main character  Jonas  I can guarantee that the impacts were vastly different  knowing that my middle school self would not have understood many of the references at that time The story is set in a futuristic dystopian society which has been based on a concept of  sameness   governed by a set of rules that were established to keep peace and order in the community  The twist of this society  however  is that the people have no memories  Thanks to genetics  these people have no knowledge of pain  war  famine  love  family bonds  colors  or weather  everything that we know to just exist in our everyday lives  When the community was created  back and back and back   many generations ago  they did want to keep the memories alive  and thus the role of Receiver was created  a person to take on the burden of the memories  In the story  Jonas is selected to be trained as the next Receiver of memories and the old Receiver becomes The Giver  Jonas is only twelve  a typical 6th to 7th grader in most of our American school systems  still five to six years until high school is completed  However in this society  Twelves  what children at age 12 are referred to as  receive the job they will be assigned to do for the rest of their working years  The typical YA Literature age range is 12 to 18  and while Jonas is technically at the lower end of the range  he is far beyond his years  allowing the entire seven year gap and more to relate to him  YA books typically have to do with a conflict related to the coming of age  the Ceremony of Twelves that Jonas goes through at the beginning of the story is his society s version of coming of age  The story is creatively written  relatable  authentic  emotional  and thought provoking throughout  There is drama and conflict both inner and in the world around Jonas  Once he begins receiving memories  Jonas is given the ability to think with wisdom and knowledge that the way they are living may not be in everyone s best interests  After Jonas first experiences color  he immediately says  It isn t fair that nothing has color      If everything s the same  then there aren t any choices  I want to wake up in the morning and decide things  A blue tunic or a red one   97   This concept expands beyond choosing the color of his shirt  and Jonas discusses this inner turmoil with The Giver  an older figure  often found in other YA stories  Together they work out that his feelings are viable and they plan a way to help the people of his community to see what they are missing  even if they have to deal with the pain and suffering in order to have choices and love   The Giver by Lois Lowry is about a twelve year old boy named Jonas On his birthday he is assigned the job of a Receiver of Memory  The previous Receiver helps to convey the memories of the past to the boy  He receives memories such of love  and snow as well as war and starvation  With the help of these memories he finds that his once utopian world is actually a dystopia  In his world there is no color  and there are no chooses  They are assigned their families as they are signed every aspect if life  One day  Jonas learns what happens to those who are release  He learns that they are killed  When a young baby is planned to be release Jonas takes the baby and runs away  After walking through the snow he falls and sees twinkling Christmas lights and learns singing  He knows someone is waiting for them  This story carries may different themes  One theme is of the importance of memories  Memories are experiences  without them one does not experience anything  They cannot feel the happiness or sadness or comfort that comes with them  It also erases history  If one does not remember then the past is lose and one cannot truly move forward  Another theme is the importance of the individual  Everyone in Jonas s world is the same and they do not make any choices  They do not dream and they do not develop talents that make them special  The story celebrates the difference that is Jonas  Symbolism can also be found throughout the book  One symbol is the baby named Gabriel  Unlike the other babies in the community  Gabriel is different  He had trouble at the nursery and stays for a bit at Jonas s house  Gabriel symbolizes hope and a chance for change  As a baby  his life is a blank slate and anything can happen  He can develop memories and become an individual  He is the reason that Jonas runs away  Another symbol is the sled  Sledding is the first memory that Jonas receiver and it symbolizes the journey that Jonas must take  It is a journey to discover the truth of the community and how he must make choices in his life   Jonas lives in a future utopian dystopian society where everything and everyone is the same  the weather  physical appearance  2 child nuclear families  everyone is colorblind  etc   We read this in our mother daughter book club and it s great  There s a lot to talk about  freedom  pain  responsibility  utilitarianism  perfection  individuality  relationships  government  etc   The author can be a little heavy handed when she s trying to make a point  but I m willing to overlook this in a children s book  Two things to keep in mind with this one  1  This is one of those books that gets better with a group discussion  Some people will hate it  For the most part  I found their viewpoints arguments valid and intriguing  and they really enriched the story when I went back and re read it  2  It is kind of dark  but not  scary  in the typical sense  so I can see why it would be disturbing to some younger children  However  the parts that make it chilling are ripe for discussion    just talk through it  This would make an incredible movie in the hands of the right director  it switches between a world of black and white and color    Since the movie is coming out  I thought I would re read this favorite  Still love  love  love this story The first half of the book continues to creep me out  The utopia presented is so impeccably perfect and I m more of a Mary Poppins practically perfect kind of gal  No poverty  No hunger  No war  No conflict   of any kind  Oh  so easy to achieve because there are no feelings  Thinking about how bland every aspect of this seemingly perfect existence must be gives me shivers  And considering how bleak and desperate life must have been after the implied war with chemical and biological weaponry makes me incredibly sad Once Jonas receives his assignment and meets the Giver  the story quickly delivers all the behind the scenes wizardry of this dystopia  Neither Jonas nor the Giver are happy with their responsibilities and decide to try to change the community I love the ambiguous ending  but I ve learned recently that the ending may not be as ambiguous as I thought years ago when I first read this book  Must read the fourth book in this world soon  Another book club read  This one was a quick  easy read  I finished it in one night I hadn t heard anything about this one either   except that it was going to be a movie Turns out that it is another dystopian novel  It is quite similar in story to Divergent  and even to the Maze Runner  although only tangentially there  I did enjoy it  although not as much as Divergent   and I m intrigued that it has received so many awards Setting  The story is set somewhere in the US  In a small town that has secluded itself from other towns and areas  Everyone has a job and is given a job when they turn 12  The job is supposed to fit them perfectly  In any case  there is not much information given about the area so it feels bland and unobtrusive  We do learn that the weather is always nice and has been so for a long time  The town keeps everyone in the dark about history and bad things Plot  The plot is that a 12 year old boy is asked to be the new  memory  for the town  He becomes the receiver of all good and bad memories  from the Giver  so that the rest of the town doesn t have to have them because they want everything calm and controlled  But  as he learns the  truth  about his town and their way of life  his perceptions and morals change Characters  Jonas is the main character  although the title character is also prominent since he is giving the memories to Jonas  At first  all the characters seem likeable and pleasant  but as we get to know them  we see that they are all rather flat  This is not bad in this case  because that is what the author is going for  Jonas has some genetic or special gift that they don t have that makes him able to receive the memories  We learn much about his thoughts and feelings throughout the book Conflict  The main conflict is with Jonas trying to figure out what it all means  This is more an  idea  story  so conflict and character are not really that prominent or important compared to the  message  being given  It seemed all a bit too heavy handed to me  which is why I m so surprised it earned a Newberry award Text  The writing is actually well done for the effect that is being created   especially with word choice that makes everything seem calm and nice  There is an abundance of oxymorons and softening language to belie the depth of the darkness that lives in the story  This book reads as a young adult targeted dystopian novel  The immediate parallels one is drawn to are 1984 and Brave New World  The protagonist is a boy entering his twelfth year  when all children are assigned to their future vocations  This is a society of equality and similarity  There are no conflicts  and there is no pain  However  there is also no choice  there is no individuality  The common happiness and peace of society mask a darker reality  There are deeper similarities in this novel to Anthem and Never Let Me Go  as well as the short story The Lottery  This is a very well written story  and is a good first step into the genre  There is a sparseness and simplicity in the story that can be seen as both pros   cons  It does suffer in comparison though to more mature novels  such as those mentioned above  EDIT 5 21 12 After reading some more YA Dystopian novels  I keep being drawn back to this  The Giver is a much better book than I had initially given it credit for  There is so much more underlying the superficial story    Raising this from 4 stars to 5 stars on my list  Il mondo di Jonas e un mondo perfetto  Un mondo dove tutto e pianificato in ogni minimo dettaglio e ogni abitante e parte integrante della societa e ha un ruolo ben preciso  Non esistono ingiustizie  non esistono diversita  non esite poverta  non esiste violenza  non esistono guerre  non esistono carestie  Un mondo asettico  pulito  ordinato  sicuro  scandito da ritmi regolari  con regole ben precise che tutti seguono fin dalla nascita  Jonas pensava che il suo mondo fosse l unico mondo possibile  non riusciva ad immaginare nulla di diverso  nulla che potesse essere meglio di cosi  Ma non si puo creare un mondo cosi perfetto senza scendere a compromessi  Jonas non sospettava niente  ma quando ebbe la consapevolezza di cio che realmente era il suo mondo  scopri che tutta quella perfezione era solo una facciata esteriore  Il suo mondo non era affatto perfetto  metteva i brividi  Era il peggior incubo in cui potesse capitare  E tutto cambio    Sono rimasta totalmente ammaliata e rapita dalla lettura di questo piccolo libro  Non bisogna mai valutare un libro dalla sua dimensione  Perche  The Giver  e come un piccolo scrigno prezioso che contiene l universo intero  Una storia breve  ma talmente intensa che mi e difficile esprimere esattamente tutte le emozioni e le riflessioni che mi ha donato  E  infatti proprio il caso di dire che  The Giver  e un libro che fa riflettere    Fa riflettere sulla vita e sul mondo in cui viviamo  Penso sia normale a volte pensare che vorremmo vivere in un mondo migliore  Pensate ad esempio alla situazione mondiale attuale  il tasso di disoccupazione e alle stelle  la popolazione e sempre piu povera  le guerre sono uno spettro che non vogliono andare via  il clima e pericolosamente instabile e le ingiustizie e le violenze sono all ordine del giorno  Eppure  la lettura di questo libro mi ha fatto capire che un mondo imperfetto puo essere piu desiderabile di un mondo monocromatico che ti priva del libero arbitrio  La liberta e un valore troppo prezioso per essere sacrificato e nonostante tutti gli orrori di un mondo imperfetto preferisco la possibilita di scelta  Altrimenti non e vera vita  The Giver  e un libro meraviglioso  una favola un po  inquietante ma piacevolissima da leggere e assolutamente priva di fastidiosi risvolti moralistici  Grazie allo stile di scrittura semplice e scorrevole lo possono leggere pure i bambini  ma per i contenuti profondi che ha  io dico che e perfetto per gli adulti  Al suo interno si possono trovare piccole analogie con famosissimi romanzi distopici  pur mantenendo completamente inalterata la sua forte personalita e originalita  Non siamo infatti davanti a una scopiazzatura di opere maggiori  ma ad un romanzo con una storia inedita a tutti gli effetti  che e stato gia tradotto in tantissime nazioni e che  tra ovazioni e tentativi di censura  e gia diventato un classico per ragazzi  E dopo avere avuto il piacere di leggerlo non ne sono per niente stupita  The Giver is a novel that I have read time and time again  It never gets old and it always feel different every time I read it The synopsis that I m sure you ve heard over and over again is as follows  most of this is stolen from Wikipedia   The novel follows a boy named Jonas through the twelfth year of his life  Set in a future society which is at first presented as a utopian society  The Giver gradually appears more and more dystopian  Jonas is selected to inherit the position of  Receiver of Memory   the person who stores all the memories of the time before Sameness  in case they are ever needed to aid in decisions that others lack the experience to make  As Jonas receives the memories from the Giver  he discovers the power of knowledge  The people in his community are happy because they don t know of a better life  but the knowledge of what they are missing out on could create chaos  He faces a dilemma  Should he stay with the community  his family living a shallow life without love  color  choices and knowledge or should he run away to where he can live a full life  It reminds me of Fahrenheit 451 and the film Pleasantville  The old were always given the highest respect   It s the memories of the whole world   Honor   he said firmly   I have great honor  So will you  But you will find that that is not the same as power   Our people made that choice  the choice to go to Sameness   It s the choosing that s important  isn t it   We have to protect people from wrong choices      things I wish they would change  But they don t want change  Life here is so orderly  so predictable  so painless  It s what they ve chosen   They have never known pain  he thought  The realization made him feel desperately lonely  and he rubbed his throbbing leg   The population had gotten so big that hunger was everywhere  Excruciating hunger and starvation  It was followed by warfare   I knew that there had been times in the past   terrible times   when people had destroyed others in haste  in fear  and had brought about their own destruction   Jonas did not want to go back  He didn t want the memories  didn t want the honor  didn t want the wisdom  didn t want the pain      so that now he understood the joy of being an individual  special and unique and proud   Memories are forever   Memories need to be shared   Of course they needed to care  It was the meaning of everything   I ve been wanting to read this and it took me forever  But Finally I read it  and I loved it OMG It was such a freaking book  I really liked it especially the world building without any emotions  Is it possible to create a perfect society   one where everyone is well fed and healthy and carefree  How would you do it  Are people only entitled to live in the society if they actively contribute  What do you do with those who are not capable of contributing  Do you have to sacrifice individual freedom for the greater good Well  this story is set in a perfect world  but it is only perfect for the inhabitants because they are subdued to the point where they do not question the decisions which are taken for them by their elders  Children live in family units but not with their natural parents  At the age of twelve they are assigned to learn their adult duties  The only object in life is to conform  But in return for this the people never experience hunger or pain  You may think they do not experience real life at all since there is no emotion But there are some ugly truths propping up this particular community  Who takes the really difficult decisions which are outside the limited experience of the ordinary inhabitants  Jonas  aged twelve  and teetering on the brink of trainee adulthood is selected to become the new Receiver of Memory How on earth do you bear the burden of memory of the whole of human experience  The agonies of war and disease and loss  the heights of human achievement  freedom  music  colour  and the overwhelming power of love  Jonas must keep these memories on behalf of his community  but he may not share them with anyone because no one wants to experience the whole range of human emotion  It is too painful  See how Jonas copes This is an excellent book and will give you plenty to think about  I was rather confused with the ending and would have been happier with a different one  but it is  of course  the writer s privilege to choose  But why does he suddenly come across the sled and the hill at the very end  It doesn t really seem to matter too much if the storyline has weaknesses though because the strength of the book is in the ideas and the community which the writer has created  Read it and see what you think   The Giver by Louis Lowry is a great book  It is a dystopian story that takes place in a futuristic time period  I liked this book because it us very interesting on how these people live their lives with such strict rules  Jonas  an eleven year old boy  ongoing twelve  lives in a small community where there are certain rules you must follow  He lives in a Community where everyone his age is born on the same day  There are celebrating the ceremony of twelve  and Jonas will get his assignment  job   And as he is sitting in his seat ready to get his assignment  which he is number nineteen they called  16   17   18   and Jonas was so ready  they called out   20   Jonas was concerned and did not know what to do  I recommend this book to boys and girls from the ages 12 and up  I recommend this book to people who enjoy dystopian and futuristic books like the Hunger Games books and the divergent series  Hope you read this great book  Jonas lives in a  perfect  world where war  disease  and suffering have all been eradicated  Everything is in order  everything is under control  The people have no worries or cares  The Community strives for  sameness   in which everyone and everything are the same and equal  To help the Community function as a cohesive unit  each member is assigned a position in society  When Jonas turns twelve  the Community selects him to be the new  Receiver of Memories   Only the  Giver  knows the truth and memories of the past  and now he must pass these memories on to Jonas   The Giver  is a wonderful book  Lowry skillfully crafted an intriguing and profoundly thoughtful story  She subtly creates an uneasy feeling that something is wrong with this  perfect world   The Community s advisors intend to establish security within utopian society  but they really establish a stifling dystopia  To protect people from the risks of making poor or wrong decisions in life  the advisors plan and dictate the lives of the people  In effect  the citizens have no freedom of choice  they do not choose their job or even their spouse  Moreover  the advisors inhibit the people s ability to feel because they want to spare them from the hardships and pain of life  For instance  individuals must take a pill everyday  which suppresses passionate feelings  The citizens do not know or experience true emotions like love  One of the goals of the Community is to achieve  sameness  so that no one feels embarrassed or gets excluded for being different  However  this limits individuality and freedom of expression because everyone conforms to a certain desired image  Finally  to relieve the population of the horrors and devastation of the world and the past  the advisors isolate the Community from the rest of the world  also known as  Elsewhere  and give the burden of holding the memories of the past to a single member of society  the  Receiver   Therefore  the Community lives only in the present  and the people have a narrow perspective of life because they only know their community and way of life  They are naive  they do not gain knowledge or wisdom from the memories  Lowry s development of this civilization is so deft that her readers  like the community s citizens  will be easily seduced by the chimera of this ordered  pain free society  Until the time that Jonah begins training for his job assignment  the rigorous and prestigious position of Receiver of Memory  he  too  is a complacent model citizen  But as his near mystical training progresses  and he is weighed down and enriched with society s collective memories of a world as stimulating as it was flawed  Jonas grows increasingly aware of the hypocrisy that rules his world  Book Details  Title The GiverAuthor Lois Lowry Reviewed By Purplycookie I really enjoyed this book  Obviously it was a bit below my reading level as a children s story but that makes it even better because I got to focus on the amazing plot  I think I need more time to think about the ending but I know I loved the rest of the story  These dystopia type novels tend to be some of my favorites because they help me to appreciate the level of autonomy I enjoy  The Giver is a book I had often heard about growing up but I had never gotten around to reading it  With an independent reading assignment and the film adaptation on the way  this was a good time to catch up with the book  Jonas  an 11 year old boy  is tasked with becoming the new Receiver of Memories  After meeting with the previous Receiver  known as the Giver  Jonas sees that the utopian society for what it is  a dystopia of sameness protected by the Elders  Lois Lowry has crafted a memorable middle grade take on the themes of Fahrenheit 451  I think this book is very detailed as in its has things like how Jonas said his leg was in pain as his bleeding leg kept peddling  The book is mainly based on a boy like Jonas and and a man named the Giver so as you read the book it tells how Jonas is learning about visions and color and pain  Jonas soon feels how its like to be a giver by how he feels the memory s and the pain it gives he didn t want ask to be giver and now he chooses never to be  The reason he chose not to be the Giver is because when your the Giver you suffer a lot of pain  The Giver gave Jonas a war memory and he felt the pain and saw people die in the memory  So he didn t want to feel the pain anymore so he decided to make a escape plan to try and get out  He couldn t help thinking about what they do to babies as in they kill the babies is there not healthy  So he took his baby brother with him on the journey but on his way he suffered a lot  I think this book is amazing because its like a mix of intense and mystery so that what i think about this book and mystery is my favorite because its like can Jonas make it out alive or not  so yeah that s what i think about this book  What a sad story  It is a beautiful simple story but a story so full of sadness  I warned you  It s sad   REVIEWThis dystopian novel  written by Lois Lowry  addresses deep philosophical questions  truely making it the  Brave New World  or  1984  of younger readers  Some of the questions addressed include   is it possible to create a perfect society  Are people only entitled to live in the society if they actively contribute  Do you have to sacrifice individual freedom for the greater good    Although the book looks at these highly abstract and complex questions  the reading level itself is low  may be a 5 grade reading level  Therefore  children who are able to read the story without being deeply confused or lost in the complex lessons of the story  Given all the features this book as to offer  the action that will appeal to the boy readers  simply readability  great story telling of Lois Lowry and intellectual moral insight  this book a must read for all school aged children  SUMMARY The Giver  is set in a perfect world  at least that it is perfect according to the narrator  Jona  But is it really ideal  In Jona s world life is completely safe  orderly  and predictable  Rules are strictly adhered to  every aspect of a person s life is carefully planned by the government in place  People rarely make choices on their own  everything is decided for them by the community  There is no snow or sunshine  no colors or music  no animals or nature When Jonas and other Elevens become Twelves  that is they turn 12   they receive their Assignments  their career assignments   Jonas is selected for the most honored and respected Assignment in the community  to be a Receiver of Memories who will succeed the current Receiver  A Receiver of Memories is the one person in the community who has access to all the memories of the past  He must keep these memories within himself until he can train a new Receiver to whom he can pass them  Thus  the Receiver has knowledge of things that no one in the community has access to  but the Receiver also has the responsibility to shoulder the burden of sorrow and pain that the memories bring Through receiving the memories Jonas comes to realize the various truths about the community  He realizes that it is unfair to deprive people of ever being able to make choices for themselves about their own lives for the sake of removing discomfort  He understands that the people of the community have no genuine feelings     and on and on the realizations come    With his new sense of enlightenment  Jonas must decide weather to remain with his community and thus continue the contribute the system which he now hates  Or he must left his family and all that he has known so as to give his community access to memories of the past and knowledge about things  things like hair color and snow  that they have been missing all their lives    This book was dystopian before dystopian was cool  Excellent children s book I ve said it before  but I just LOVE that I am reading all of these great children s books that I missed as a child  I went straight to adult books  never thinking how remarkably well done these children s books could be  In fact  I now enjoy children s books MORE than adult books   go figure I read The Giver  along with my daughters  as part of our study of the East  This novel gives the reader an interesting look at what the  ideal  of communism could be  It opened the door for many conversations between the girls and I   about the importance of individuality and how one cannot have beauty and love and excitement  without the risk of hate  violence  and the ugliness that goes along with humanity This is also an excellent introduction into such dystopian literature as The Handmaid s Tale  1984  Brave New World  Fahrenheit 451  etc   in the later years  I absolutely love this book  I read it when I was in sixth grade and I remember imagining what it would be like to be different from everyone else i society  I mean Jonah didn t want to be like everyone else and this society actually did everything in its power to prevent Jonah from wanting to go back to the way it was  Jonah wanted to feel and have emotion  The Giver gave Jonah the opportunity to feel emotions for the first time  Jonah was the only person in this society that could handle this change  Jonah was strong enough to experience change  Jonah was the only person able to do that and I wish I was strong to handle such drastic change the way he did The part of the book that was most shocking was when the people in the nursery killed twins or killed babies that weren t essentially good enough  Innocent babies were slaughtered because they looked like someone else or just simply inadequate  In my opinion  those babies didn t ask to be here and to have their lives stripped away from them right after birth was crushing  Babies shouldn t have to endure that kind of pain  Luckily  Jonah was able to save Greg I think the baby s name was  Jonah even transferred some of his memories to the baby without even knowing  It was so sweet  Jonah became a better person because of the knowledge he gained from the giver  Jonah was able to process and understand the memories unlike Rosemary  Blessed HarveyMerino OttEnglish 2A14 November 2014Book Love Review In The Giver by Lois Lowry  the story line is complex  Basically  it is a world without color or emotions  the world has nothing but peace  Everybody has the same feeling  except one  Jonas  Jonas is the giver  he is the only one who knows the truth about the world  Through the plot events  we see the author s message that nothing is what it seems  We understand this theme through events such as war  no one knows about it because they were brain washed that the world was filled with peace  An important quote from the book that reinforces the theme is  The worst part of holding the memories is not the pain  It s the loneliness of it  Memories need to be shared   This is important because it shows the importance of what Jonas has to do throughout the book to show his memories  I found this book very inspirational because it shows how important history  Like George Santayana once said   Those who do not know history s mistakes are doomed to repeat them   You need to except the past to move on in the future  After reading the last page of The Giver   the reader is left with the feeling that there history always to be learned  As humans  we should take the advice of the author which is appreciate our past  some people cannot remember the past or the generations before them   I love this book I find it powerful and alluring  I think that it s a book everyone should read  what would happen if we took all choice away from people  all pain  all hardship  A perfect society would have all citizens monitored and repressed emotionally  You want to meet Jonas and live in the world that is very Pleasantville  Black and white and smiles for everyone  Jonas is picked because he is special  he is asked to experience color  emotions  pain  and live a life completely different from anything he has ever known  Great read for anyone fourth grade and up with enough to make adults think about what it means to live is a community where there are no choices  Give yourself a day and read this book  Also don t forget to read the next two in the series        Read again      This is one of those books that I occasionally pick up just to read again for the love of the story and Jonah  I actually wrote one of my Standardized Test Essays on him  This book is wonderful  I m so worried that the movie will ruin it  There are three other books in this series  each of which are their own self contained story  The last book unfortunately is pretty terrible and you should only read it if you really really really want to and you somehow got it for free   Stunning  In Jonas  perfect world  everyone is planned  Your life is mapped out carefully  It is a world of Utopia  perfectness  The elders command you  They choose who you are  your spouse  your children  your job  Until Jonas is selected to be receiver of memory  Together he and the Giver come up with a plan to help their community see  a plan destined to change everything    Amazing  Lois Lowry is meticulous  and doesn t let a single detail ruin her reputation  Like Howl s Moving Castle  this book has been a to read for plenty of years  so on my iPod it went to chip away hours of boredom at work  I don t know what I d do without audiobooks anymore  Probably bash my head into a desk Anyway  I blew through it in about 2 3 days  which I thought I might considering that it s a children s book  This is just the sort of book that I like to read  where the very fabric of society and all we think we understand is completely rewritten  This world of order starts off unsettling  as there is pretty much no such thing as choice  and everyone seems to be OK with that  Now  the very thing  in my opinion  that defines humanity is the ability to choose  so naturally when such a thing doesn t exist I hang on to the story until it does The concept of carrying the burden of all the world s memories  especially the painful ones  is interesting to me  I flinched at some of the more painful ones  though perhaps what was most unsettling was when we learn exactly what happens to those that are  released   I had guessed what that meant correctly  but that didn t stop the impact  I felt Jonas was appropriately horrified  I m not sure if I ll read the other books in the series  I liked how this one ended   My 11 year old niece has been bugging me to read The Giver for months now  I finally sat down to read it tonight  I was blown away by how good it is  It made me cry  Awwww I love Jonas  It s such an amazing story and I m so happy that my niece loves a book enough to recommend it  proud auntie moment   Loved this book  It reminded me of the feel of dystopia novels  but appropriate for middle readers  So good  I wish it were longer  I can t believe it took me until now to read The Giver  I loved everything about the story  Such a good sci fi dystopian work that knows how to draw parallels with the present and make you stop and think  A must read  This is a book that really makes you think about the importance of remembering our history and the effect those memories have on our existence  Wow  Definitely worthy of its reputation  this book explores concepts of a utopian dystopian society in which independence and interdependence are taught and controlled by a governing body and what individuality citizens of this kind of society would have to sacrifice to be a part of a structure this ordered and devoid of both good and bad emotions and generational memories  One problematic element    why are the lighter people  in this case  the lighter eyed people  the special ones  Other than that one detail  I found this to be an engaging  thoughtful  thought provoking quick read that might be life changing for the right kids at the right time  Highly recommended for everyone  especially for anyone age 11 and up who is a member of society  because If you re off living alone in the wilderness  you might not have a need for this book   The Giver is an incredibly powerful book  The book is filled with powerful short phrases of the Giver giving wisdom to Jonas  the new receiver  It all starts with Jonas s 12th year mark quickly approaching and the impending status of what his career assignment will be  He is assigned the new position of The Receiver  which is an honor beyond all measure  Through his training he is transferred all memories that the giver has accumulated over years and had passed down to him  He is the only one in the community with such knowledge and through the transfer of memories he finds out what color is and even discovers what music might be at the end  He does not realize until the book is almost through that the government has stolen basic rights  like seeing in color  from the people all in the name of sameness  It is not until he witnesses the horrible process of sending someone off  killing them  to make a difference  The Giver follows all the typical dystopian novel attributes dealing with age  government and the realization that something in the mix is corrupt  It is so different from the other books that are currently circulating the market because it is not a heroin rising above and beyond to personally take down a regime with her band of friends behind her  It starts off with a boy in a world that is so clearly restrictive but he is content in this and so is everyone else  Everyone has accepted the power of this new government    Jonas lives in a community where there are no choices  Everything is perfect  there is no pain  no sadness  no darkness  To prevent pain  sadness  anger etcetera in the community there is no such thing as someone choosing to do something for themselves  Everyones lives are totally mapped out  And that is not bad  until Jonas is chosen to be the new Receiver of Memory and is shown happier times  And darker times  The Giver by Lois Lowry is rich with meaning  Centering around a memory  less  perfect  Utopian society  it is full of themes of love  hope  darkness and pain  The story will scare you will its truth  It will raise unasked questions  It will cause you to think in ways you haven t thought before  In every page a shock of pure writing power will suck you into the story  into the memories  and when it at last releases you from its iron grip back to reality  The Giver will not leave you unscathed  For reality very much could be the community described in its pages   The Giver is one of the most interesting books that i have ever read  It s written very beautifully  It s really easy to understand and it has message in it  I suggest you to read this  I think you will like it   Initially  I read this book in fifth grade which was the year the book was first published  It stuck with me then as a ten year old child  At that young age  the story of Jonas and the Community of Sameness was bewildering and interesting  It was my first foray into a utopian     society  In a world now filled with dystopian young adult novels  The Giver stands as the most believable in the sense that the people are happy in their ignorance  They have no knowledge of back and back and back  They have no concept that back and back and back exists nor do they care  All of the memories are held with The Receiver of Memory  He is like the Jungian collective memory  As an adult and a student of psychology  there are so many complex concepts that the author addresses  For example  one idea that she addresses is that of precision of language and how language affects our reality  As Jonas becomes the Receiver of Memory  he gains words for sensations and emotions that he had never had before  When he has the words  he becomes able to perceive them and understand them in ways that other people in the Community cannot  He learns about truth and love and pain and loss  The novel might be passe for today s children with the amount of literature that provides a glimpse into a seemingly perfect  but ultimately flawed existence  However  the way Lowry presents this world in such a age appropriate and perfect way that it should still be on all elementary reading lists In sum  amazing book on so many levels  Loved it at 10 and loved it at 30  I read this book when I was in grade school  and to be honest  it did not leave a significant impression on me  Reading this book as an adult  I found myself far more willing to trudge through Lowry s Dystopia and come out pleased and slightly horrified by my experience  The word  Dystopia  is so deeply rooted in current popular culture that I would not have been at all surprised if after reading this book I would not be moved by Lowry s interpretation  but I was surprised and happier for it  I enjoyed every minute in the company of Jonas and the Giver  digesting the painful realization that perfection according to these communities requires sacrificing emotional and intellectual depth in order to maintain strict obedience and control over people that cannot be counted upon to control themselves  As Jonas received memories of joy  love  pain  and sorrow I recalled my own experiences and wondered what it would be like to live in Jonas s world  to regard the word love as imprecise and devoid of meaning or to not know what it means to feel pain or remorse  I like that Lowry seems to deliberately leave Jonas s story entirely wide open for readers to pick up and run with their own interpretations and experience and  more importantly  the value of sharing those experiences with others  I hope that if I should pursue teaching  I will have the opportunity to introduce this book to my younger students  but I must say that I found this book just as useful for adults to revisit as well as young adults  We can all benefit from a little wisdom  I know I can   I had never read this book before although I have heard students talk about it as we discussed it as having been banned during Banned Book Week  I really enjoyed the novel  The book itself revolves around the story of Jonas who has been chosed to be the Receiver in his community  He is to receive and be the record keeper of memories  When he receives the memories he slowly becomes unable to accept their way of life  The world in which Jonas has been brought in to is devoid of any strong feelings  The people have very little if any emotion  The world has been strictly regimented and tailored so that the citizens have every comfort and have EVERYTHING planned out for them  It is because they do not think for themselves that they are able to live together cohesivelly in peace  They have no emotion  color  ups or downs no horror or sadness but also no JOY or LOVE  THe citizens are blissfully ignorant  Jonas is ultimately able to break free but whether or not he is able to survive in Elsewhere  This novel would be a great choice to teach as a precusor to Orwell s 1984 or Bradbury s Fahrenheit 451  It is well written and relevant today as it was when it was written in 1993  TCL call number  J LOWRY Stephanie s rating  5 starsJonas is turning twelve and he s been assigned the role of  The Giver   While in training he s exposed to the memories of the past  including those of war  famine  and torture  but notwithstanding those of joy  love  and bliss  He is the only community member to feel the surge of emotions that the Receiver bestows on him  His job from here on out is to aid in some of the decision making that the Council charges it itself with  but cannot make  because of lack of experience  While in training  Jonas discovers the true meaning of  release   and is immediately pained with the reality of it  Everything he has even known and come to believe is too disturbing for him to bear  His world is made up of lies  Jonas is faced with a critical decision  Continue living this life or abandon it forever  It s been 21 years since its first publication  and 20 years since it won the Newberry Award  And it s taken me that long to read the book  This is such a good read  I m actually glad I read it now as an adult  because I don t think I could have understood all of the underlying themes in this story as a young in  Experiences  of all kinds  will definitely make this read a memorable one  Eleven year old Jonas lives in a community that is completely controlled by design  Residents are assigned jobs  spouses  children  and more  Behavior is tightly controlled and the ultimate goal is  sameness   When children become twelve they are given their job assignments  Jonas is feeling apprehensive and is shocked to discover they he has been selected for the most honored job in the community  Receiver of Memory  Jonas  predecessor  the Giver  is the community s sole keeper of life s memories  freeing residents from anguish of knowing pain  poverty war  etc  Now these memories must be transmitted to Jonas  Jonas will serve his life as a living history book who will keep all the history to himself but ultimately serve as an adviser to the elders While The Giver is tasked with passing on knowledge  he actually begins exposing Jonas to the thrill of living including the emotional and sensory feelings of Christmas and the concept of love  none of which exist in the modern world  Eventually though  Jonas will experience the horrible memories as well  those of war  violence  greed and death  I don t know why it s taken me so long to finally read this book  The Giver was the 1994 Newbery Medal winner  has become one of the most influential novels of our time  I thought it was a haunting and provocative story and hope to read the rest of the series  Lois Lowry has written three companion novels to The Giver  including Gathering Blue  Messenger  and Son  Just finished this book at 11 pm last night  I couldn t put it down  The story is very compelling  It seems like I would love to live in a place like the  community   perfect in so many ways  The kindness   the lack of hunger  no pain  no disease  no crime  They all seem so happy and well taken care of  Utopian society for sure  I will not give away the story line because it is a must read  But I will say that  Jonas is amazing and so brave  Not sure I would have the courage to go through with the plan  Needless to say  I Love this book     Will recommend it to all my friends  I am saving it for my 10 year old for maybe another 3 or 4 years  I think it would be a great read for her when she is in 8th or 9th grade  Not sure I want to see the movie because of course the story is will be sensationalized for the film  I did not know what role Taylor Swift played until I read about it in the interview section with the actors in the back of the book  I will need to do some more research before I make my decision to watch the movie soon or not at all  This book has made me want to read the whole  the giver series   As well as being interested in reading other books written by Lois Lowry  I share a similar last name with the author    My maiden name is Wry  Not that it matters  but for me it very cool to see the name in print  I am only sad that it took me 20  years to finally read the book that has been talked about so much since it came out in 94  I recently shared that I was reading this book and the response was so positive from a fellow book lover  She loved it too    This book has changed my view on life s choices  I don t understand any of the bad reviews or responses  For me it was all positive   This book was just  wow  I was hooked on it the moment I first started reading it  The storyline is interesting  A boy named Jonas lives in this world or  community  where there is nothing bad  No wars  no crimes  no rudeness  or even lying  so he thinks  But along with that  certain emotions and feelings  the positive ones  are gone with the rudeness and lying  Jonas spends his whole life waiting for his career assignment  and in the book it finally comes  but what he receives is not what he was expecting  He ends up receiving his rules and learning about his job and absolutely becomes shocked with what he discovers  The world he knew was nothing like he thought it was What I really enjoyed after reading the book was realizing how in the beginning  I the reader also didn t know what was going on just like the characters in the book  I got to experience Jonas s realization with him  It made me feel like I was living in his world as well  That is why I think I found this book so powerful  Lois Lowry made you feel like Jonas s world was your own  which I believe the whole point of the book was  To give a warning  possibly  as to what can happen in the future if we take the same actions as the community did in the story   The Giver is about a community where no one feels any feelings and they are kept from knowing anything at all  there is only one person that knows about everything from war to feelings to how the society should be  Jonas is about to take that position where he will keep the memories of what the community use to be like  once he learns all this it makes him upset and he decides to try and change the community but he fails and he just runs away with a child who was suppose to be put to death  Jonas the main character develops in this book from being naive about the community to learning what really happens and wanting that to change  The gender diversity is different Jonas mother is works in a courthouse and his father is a nurturer for newborns  which is different when the woman should be the nurture but in this book  it is different  This book is appropriate for student in the sixth to eight grade  These students will appreciate this book and will be able to understand why Jonas is upset with his community and why change and knowledge is important in a society    Do ever wish everything was perfect and stable and even in life  Or no one is singled out from being different  Well Jonas finds out that that world is impossible no matter how blissful it seems   The Giver takes place in a dystopian society whose main character is Jonas  This community has sameness or no feelings  climate  personalities  or love and everything is controlled for you  The community even chooses your career for you  When Jonas was chosen for the Receiver of Memories job he was extremely anxious  The Receiver of Memories carries the memories of past lives of before the  perfect  community so the citizens will not have to bear the burden and will not know what they re missing  Jonas begins to train for the career underneath the Receiver before him  The Receiver tells Jonas to call him The Giver  The Giver must give Jonas all the memories before he can retire and Jonas can become the new Receiver of Memories  Jonas  first dream was of him on a sailboat floating and sailing on the ocean with a tranquil breeze  Jonas enjoyed this dream very much  During this Jonas  family is taking care of a failing baby from the nurturing center  where newborns are born and raised  named Gabe  He was a twin of another baby and the community does not allow twins so they must release the least of the two  Releasing someone is a private event where you go into a room in the Annex and nobody sees you again  They are wanting to help Gabe so he does not have to be released  Jonas begins to feel isolated from his friends ever since he became the Receiver  they almost act like he s different now  Jonas has been getting peaceful and happy memories for the past days  but Jonas understands The Giver must pass on the painful memories onto him soon  The first painful memory Jonas gets is sunburn  but it only stings  It was difficult for Jonas to handle because he is not allowed to get pain medication anymore  Even though it is extremely painful for Jonas  he understands it is his duty to continue on and finish his training   Gabe is sleeping exceptionally well with Jonas  family with a little help from Jonas  Whenever Gabe is being restless Jonas transfers a calming memory to him to help him sleep  Jonas must continue to get painful memories and the worst one yet is coming  When Jonas comes to training he sees The Giver in a great deal of distress  Jonas directs The Giver to transfer the memory to him  The memory begins with a terrible stench  Jonas looks around and sees smoke and dead bodies on the ground  Then  he hears a boy next to him asking for water and Jonas gives it to him  After Jonas couldn t take it anymore he opened his eyes  Jonas was emotionally scarred and wanted to quit his training because he couldn t take it anymore  The dream of war brought more problems between Jonas and his friends  when his friends were playing like they were hurting and killing each other Jonas couldn t take remembering the dream and the boy in it so he makes them stop  They can t understand why it s wrong and his friends think Jonas is even more different  The next day in training Jonas wishes to know what happens in a release of a person  so he gets to watch him  Jonas is outraged to find out that a release is a lethal injection that kills the person  He gets so mad that he finally wants to change the community or leave  Him and The Giver make a plan to fix the community and save Gabe so read to find out how  By far one of the best dystopians I ve ever read  I need the rest of the series  This is the book that taught me to appreciate the dystopian fairy tale  Such a good book  I have read it too many times to count   The Giver is a book that completely discards the injustices of the world  Jonas is a very intricate 11  He is in a place or community that takes away all the conflict in the4d world  They have created pills for everything pain  love  weakness  and they took all human choices away from them  the decide their jobs  their lovers  their kids  and their houses  Jonas is becoming a 12 which is when they get assign their roles in the community  Jonas becomes the receiver of memory which is where he has to be faced with all the memories of the community  Jonas is faced with a decision to leave the community to endanger all in it or stay  See the decision Jonas makes in The Giver  An injustice I saw in the Giver was that it took away all feelings  choices  and pain with pills which I believe is wrong because we need to be able to learn from our mistakes so we know not to make them again  The injustice is resolved in the story because the memories escape from Jonas so the community is to face these memories and experience true love  pain  hunger and the true injustices of the world  It had a negative affect on the characters by having them being hurt and feeling true pain  I would recommend this book 11 year olds because of the intensity of materials that would be inappropriate for some ages  Also The Giver has high level words for some to understand  Overall the book is recommended for 6th grade and higher A must read  The Giver is a Newberry Medal winning book that can be placed in the genre of science fiction Summary This novel evolves around a society that has transferred to control the lives of people and eliminate any pain  suffering  or strong emotions that one may feel  At the age of 12 the community assigns each individual a job or role that they will be specially trained to help contribute  Jonas s special role is to be the  Keeper of Memories  in which he receives from The Giver having him feel all kinds of happiness  pleasure  as well as inflicting unbearable pain that he had never known Critique A  The descriptive style of writing and word choice help the reader establish the moods and settings of the story B  As the reader is reading he or she is able to form a connection and visualize  as if they are watching a movie or they re there themselves C  Lowry is able to achieve this connection often forming a bond between how the character  Jonas  feels and how you  the reader  For example on p 85 86 when Jonas asks The Giver about pain and The Giver provides him with his first memory of pain  Lowry describes the feeling with such accuracy that you feel it as well  Jonas s first feeling and emotion that he received of pain was of sunburn  Lowry describes how good it feels to lie in the sun and feel the warm sunshine  you feel the passing of time  and then your skin starts to sting  The sting then often turns to a pain  As a reader you often have felt these feelings yourself so as Jonas feels them for the first time you feel them as well Curriculum Connection This book would not be appropriate for a young age group  I would use this book for 6th grade and middle school students  What is really right and wrong  Have students have a class discussion about the community s decisions  Are our two communities completely different  Have students construct a Venn Diagram incorporating the likenesses and differences  I don t know how I had never read this book  My husband told me I d like it after he saw the movie   I haven t seen it yet and decided to check out the book first  Because dystopian is one of my favorite genres  I loved this book  I was amazed at how vividly she created the world and in such a short book  If this was a new novel  they would have turned it into a 1200 page trilogy  I m glad that s not what this was  I loved getting a glimpse into the world and then having to figure out the rest on my own  That s actually what I dislike about some of the new trilogies    It s like they are throwing things in there to meet a page quota until absolutely nothing is left to the imagination  An example of this is how much I LOVED Divergent and Insurgent  and that series would have been fantastic if it was 2 books long    But  alas  they had to make it a trilogy and ruin it  Anyway  I d recommend this one    Especially if you already have a love affair going with dystopian like I do     Beautiful book  I know there are subsequent books to accompany The Giver and I can t wait to get into those  I found myself frustrated by the ending because I want to know everything about what happened that led to the current societal structures  why people don t see color  and what do they see instead of color    what his connection to Gabriel is   what happens to his family  Where is he going with Gabriel  What lies outside of his community   I hope these questions are answered in the three remaining books    Young Jonas is called to become the new Receiver of Memories within a seemingly utopian society  As Jonas receives memories from the past from the old Receiver  now the Giver  he learns that their lives or missing a lot of what makes life difficult but also most of what makes it all worth it  Jonas begins to struggle to fit in and wonders if this really is the place for him  or really the place for anybody at all The social experiments and commentary in the book are excellent  It all comes together to reveal something profound about the human heart and spirit  How much love matters  how much pain does  It makes you question if it s all worth it  shows you that it is  and then  in a fantastically ambiguous ending  makes you question all over again Contend  infanticide  This book is called The Giver by Lois Lowry  This is based on the future  I have to read this book for school but I m glad I m reading it  I had read another book by Lowry  Which was called Numbering the Stars  and I loved that book too  I m glad I get to read it  to be continued   Continued   I finally finished it  And it was amazing but I have to admit  the ending was a little disappointing    But I think that there is another book to it and then another so hopefully I get those books for my soon to be here birthday  So  lets continue    this book  at which I thought was another book about the holocaust  is about a boy named Jonas who lives in the future  In this future  these people called The Elders basically rule your lives  They choose your job  spouse  children and anything else that we chose for our lives today  Sounds bad  huh  But in a way it isn t  This way people can t make any bad decisions  So  Jonas is finally going to become a Twelve  Being a Twelve means he can finally find out what his job is going to be and he is excited  They finally have the ceremony and he becomes the communities Giver  This occupation is described as someone who holds all of the memories  good and bad  for the community  And I ll leave you with that sort of long and sort of short synopsis of the beginning of this book  I totally recommend this for anyone  adult or teenager or pre teen   Awarded his society s unique  assignment  of becoming  The Receiver of Memory   12 year old Jonas sets out on life changing journey when he begins lessons with the aging  Giver   learning the unique power that memory   or the absence there of   holds over his sheltered and  fearless  society  Jonas  is plunged into further peril when he learns the truth behind his father s work as a  Nurturer   urging Jonas to decide what to do when a young infant  symbolically  named Gabrielle is at risk of being  released  from the care of his family Striking imagery and interesting use of the themes of light  darkness  and color combine for an interesting creation of a vivid setting easy to realize for the reader  The themes of memory  freedom  and sacrifice turn this traditional fantasy novel into a deep  thought provoking story about morality  and the difficulty of deciding what is  right or wrong  that is timeless With the story of Jonas  I think Lowry puts an interesting twist to the old convention of  the hero s journey   If we use the definition as extolled by Joseph Campbell  Jonas would have to go beyond this narrative s ending to not only  achieve the goal  of returning memory to his community  but also return to his  original community  as a functional member and somehow  improve  upon it  I think Lowry challenges us to re think our traditional views of the hero or what it means to be  heroic    I ve read this many times  I love this story  Great read  Different perspective on society  I m not really sure how this book never came my way during my childhood  It seems like all my friends read it in school  but it was never a part of my curriculum  make what you will of that   This was a very short read  but a good read  Probably one of the best dystopian novels I ve read  And I don t really think it s a spoiler to call it a dystopian novel since that s pretty much what it s advertised as  and you get an immediate sense of that in the first few chapters   The first half of the novel is   confusing   but not in a bad or distracting way  More in a sense of the reader trying to get a grasp of this new world  There s a very disturbing feeling of unease because everything seems so perfect that it s obviously TOO perfect  The second half   Jonas s training with the Giver   are the most beautiful and memorable about the book  Their conversations are both beautiful and sad  They make you appreciate little details in the world   how happiness is accompanied by sadness  and whether that pain is worth it  At the same time  you realize that this is also about the loss of innocence and childhood for the main character  It s controversial to say the least  I can definitely see people interpreting it as anti communist propaganda   but I felt that the book brought up some very good points about both sides of the issue  even though it pushed anti communism in the end   Dystopian novels seem to be the norm these days  but I think The Giver is the one to read because it s not written in that typical Young Adult format with romance and a cookie cutter ending  This one is very real  and the writing is not  dumbed  down in the way that most YA books are  essentially  I didn t find that there were trivial moments like there are in YA stories   It s a stand out and the themes  albeit controversial  are definitely explored in a novel way  Give it a try and keep an open mind  This book was sensational and full of realistic and relatable characters that you couldn t help but sympathize with i loved Jonas and the Giver they made the story great  i would recommend it to any dystropia lover but this is a book for anyone who likes a more serious fictional read  i must admit when i first started reading this book i was much more bored of the idea of a perfect society a colorless world i thought it was a bland topic  but once i had dug deeper into the story i felt excitement and sadness all at the same time anticipating Jonas to escape the society that has only known that is perfect and painless  to one that is hidden and concealed in the memories of the Giver as a complex world that was imperfect  Jonas is granted the gift of this memory he must use it wisely  Jonas is a curious person he seems to question most of his circumstances and once he does he finds this out he is motivated to see the other side of things  i guess you could say this book has a deeper meaning that many interpret differently on the moral of the story  the central message that is hinted throughout the story  i wont write any spoilers here if you haven t read  it is a excellent read please read it  Thank You for reading my Review      Kente Najee  The Giver  is a book about a utopian society where the protagonist  Jonas  is introduced to our  dangerous  community when he gets chosen to be the Receiver of memories  Jonas gets assigned to receive the memories of our world passed down from Receiver to Receiver  As he receives the memories  he becomes aware of how many things changed since then and he is not really happy with the changes  I really enjoyed the way the author described Jonas s feelings of being trapped  because I can feel trapped sometimes and have the urge to explore  I think this book deserves 4 to 5 stars  If you like books like  The Hunger Games  or  Divergent   which are all about utopian societies  I m sure you ll like  The Giver   The Giver by Lois Lowry is a YA sci fi dystopian novel that seems to be set in a  somewhat  near future  The main character Jonas lives in a Community that is very ordered  structured  and everything seems to have it s own place  And by everything  I mean EVERYTHING  No one has any choices in this novel  Your jobs are chosen for you  your family  your children  everything is carefully selected  No one can choose their own wife husband or anything  it is all chosen for them There is also no colour  no pleasure  not even music  Everything different seems to have been taken away from these people in favor for  sameness   Everyone even has similar hairstyles and clothing One would think such a lifestyle is well   scary and awful  Well  not to these people  See  almost everybody has grown up in this society so they have no clue what they are missing in life  They are totally oblivious to it  All who live in this community are   all except one person This person is called  The Giver   He alone holds all the memories of the world inside him  and it s his job to train his successor to do the same  Jonas is that successor This novel really makes you stop and think on certain aspects of our own society  Do we not try to erase painful memories  wishing them to go away  Do we not try to live our lives as pain free as possible  Do we not have something quite similar to the concept of  Release  Pondering these questions really makes you think that our own world isn t that much different from this one  And that s a frightening thought when one gets down to it Even though this is a YA novel  it does tackle some strong and  at times  disturbing themes  But it is all handled in a well crafted  genius story  I highly recommend this book if you haven t read it already I will definitely be picking up the two companion novels when I can  Lois Lowry has made it to my all time favorite authors list for sure  I liked this modern classic  The story is quite unique      The setting of the giver is in the future in a society where there are very strict rules or laws that all of the citizens must abide too  The main character Jonah lives in this society with his sister and parents who s names are not mentioned in the book  The story starts out talking about the rules that they must follow and then starts to drift into Jonah s everyday life which mainly consists of going to school doing homework and sleeping with not a lot of time to be around friends  Some of the rules in their society are  no lying  no cursing  no disrespect towards your parents and many more  If any of these laws are broken there are very severe consequences  Once Jonas became old enough to have a job assigned to him he will go to a ceremony with all of the other kids his age to receive their jobs from the elders  Some of the jobs consist of Birth giver  rule maker  recreation advisor and caretaker of the old  As the ceremony commences all of the children are called to the stage and assigned jobs except for Jonas  Later Jonas finds out that his job will be the next receiver of memories  I highly recommend this book I think that it is great for ages 10 and up  This book is the first part of a trilogy and I also highly recommend the second book of the trilogy which is called Messenger  It is very interesting to see how the giver transitions into the story line of the messenger  I really loved this book  It is something i would certainly recommend to read  I loved the concept  the characters  Very easy to read  I just wish the story was longer  to be honest  I don t know why but it kind of made me think of Divergent in a way   Eleven year old Jonas lives in a  perfect  society  there is no war  no poverty  no hunger  no sickness  Everyone has equality and there is Sameness exists  Everyone is given a job when they turn twelve  and Jonas is quickly approaching this important age  Jonas is selected by the Community to be the very honorable  Receiver of Memories   in which he spends time with The Giver and learns all of the memories of things past  The Giver is the only one who knows the truth of what went on before Sameness  and now it is time for Jonas to begin the process of taking those memories from him  I ve been wanting to read this book for a really long time  I have no idea why I waited so long  I inhaled it  It is absolutely incredible  Ms  Lowry did an amazing job creating a society that is free of worry  free of pain  free of anything troublesome  Everything is  well  just lovely  At least I thought it was  because Jonas thought it was       until I realized something HUGE about the way Jonas sees things  I mean  about the way he  literally  sees things with his eyes  Wow  Jonas only realizes that he and the rest of the people in his community are being completely deceived in their perception of things when he spends time with The Giver and receives some memories that are very confusing to him  As Jonas begins to take on the memories of the truth of the past before Sameness  he realizes that along with things like warfare  poverty  pain  hunger  there was also the warmth of sunshine  the beauty of color  the chill of snow  and the delight of rain  He realizes that he has a choice  to let the rest of the community continue to live as they are   without knowing any of the good and the bad of the past and also without the ability to choose anything for themselves  or he can make them aware of all that they are missing  What they don t know can t hurt them  right  Jonas and The Giver make a plan to carry out their decision   and then their plan A turns to a plan B   and things get a bit crazy and chaotic  My heart was thumping almost out of my chest  I would love it if everyone I knew read this book right now  It was that good  I will recommend it to everybody  I can t believe it has been in existence for so long and I am just now getting to it  But thank goodness I did  I finished it several days ago and cannot stop thinking about it  This is the kind of book that really captures the audience and submerges them in a fictional world  You can t put it down  because it is so captivating and interesting  I want to read these kinds of books forever  I think my interest in reading is going up again  The ending  I m not really sure what happened    but it is good  Also  I didn t really understand it  but I probably just have to read a bit slower to catch all the details  I zoomed through it because I loved it so much  I actually don t want to read the read the rest of the books because the ending is so perfect Also  does Sameness make people colorblind  Jonas saw colors  like red  for the first time in his life  but for some reason  he knew that his  and Gabriel s eyes were blue  which is a color  How does that work  after reading so not good books for a while and feeling very bad about choices of books I read  this one was bright little light that there is good fiction in the world  I loved the books  I could get into story and feel the things Jonas and giver felt and I felt that somehow it is a very sad world of sameness and without choices and many other things they lived  I wanna start the next books Asap  My daughter read this on her own and in class as a read aloud  She wanted to see the movie so I had to read it before that  I was hooked right away  Surprising parts I didn t expect  I cannot even begin to describe how AMAZING this book was    I just couldn t put it down    I mean the plot  the concept  the rules  the twists    everything was so perfect  Brilliant And now  that I checked the selected cast for the movie  I m literally hyperventilating with excitement    This is the best book  Rocky WalterAge 12 present Pretty much the quintessential dystopian read for younger readers  of course  Another reread for my Children s Lit class  I simply continue to be astounded by Lois Lowry s talent at building this world  In a ways  it s so different from ours  yet there are all these recognizable features  of what might happen should we continue to control the choices available to people  Jonas  plight will rip at your emotions  and the ambiguous ending is bittersweet  triumphant   whatever you d like it to be  The Giver is a book about a utopian city where nobody can experience love or other emotions but there is a boy who learns that there is more and tries to change that with the help of the giver  The book is very interesting and will keep you in the edge of your seat  Jonas surprised me when they said he was receiver but what surprised me more is when he had to leave the city with Gabriel  When Jonas first met the giver I felt that it opened more possibilities for him and the giver and is the beginning of his adventure  For anybody who loves a great fiction book and likes plot twists  this is the book for you  After reading The Giver in middle school  I decided to pick it up again before seeing the 2014 film adaptation  Though I have become a very different person in decade since  Lowry s book again had a profound impact on me  A great introduction into secular morality and ethical dilemas for younger readers  it remained relevant to me as a twenty something adult  Reading from a different lense  I picked up on more of political commentary subtely  and not so subtely  woven throughout  I may wait another handfull of years before I pull The Giver off the shelf again  but I will most likely revisit Lowry s other books from my childhood  including Gathering Blue  The Silent Boy  and especially Number the Stars On a different note altogether  I would also recommend the 2014 movie  Though not an exact retelling  I thought it was an honest adaptation of the book s heart and did the characters and story justice   The Giver by Lois Lowry is considered young adult literature This is what Amazon com has to say about this book  In a world with no poverty  no crime  no sickness and no unemployment  and where every family is happy  12 year old Jonas is chosen to be the community s Receiver of Memories  Under the tutelage of the Elders and an old man known as the Giver  he discovers the disturbing truth about his utopian world and struggles against the weight of its hypocrisy  With echoes of Brave New World  in this 1994 Newbery Medal winner  Lowry examines the idea that people might freely choose to give up their humanity in order to create a more stable society  Gradually Jonas learns just how costly this ordered and pain free society can be  and boldly decides he cannot pay the price  I honestly LOVED this book  It was very interesting to read about how the society was run  and how it was all set up  I loved really diving into this book and really thinking about it  It was interesting because there was no specific bad guy who wanted everyone not to feel or anything  it was just how everyone was brought up and raised  They didn t know any better I love the message of this book  It basically says that human life is a mixture of both good and bad things and feelings  This book shows us a glimpse into what life would be like without pain  As a result  you see that there is also no happiness  Jonas decides that he would rather have both pain and happiness so he leaves the community  I would recommend this book to anyone  It is very interesting  and uplifting if you really take the time to think about it  The Giver by Lois Lowry is by far one of the single most influential books I ve ever had the privilege to enjoy  After reading it at a young age for a school requirement  I thought it was very interesting  The second time around  however  changed my life because at the time  I was older and could interpret its contents more maturely  Jonas is such an intriguing character  the experiences and memories he had to endure with  The Giver  was so amazing  it still leaves me thinking  What I believe is most powerful with this relatively short novel is  The Giver   a character who I could relate to in a similar way I did with Jonas  view spoiler  At the end of the novel  when Jonas escaped with young Gabriel  I was  to put it in a cliche manner   on the edge of my seat   The abrupt end had left me hanging in a way where I didn t necessarily feel disappointed  but rather    Confused  Perhaps that is exactly what Lowry wanted to do when writing this amazing book  leave the end up for speculation  Even today  I still wonder what became of Jonas and Gabriel   hide spoiler   Especially since this is such a thought provoking book  I recommend this to anyone and everyone  Even though it s considered a book for  young children   people of all ages can gain much out of reading it because as one matures  it seems like the meaning  The Giver  instills matures as well  6 stars  7 stars  One of the best books I ve ever read  A Newberry medal winner  I bought Lois Lowry s series that starts with this book because I want to give it to my 11 year old granddaughter  Of course  I had to read it myself first  to see if she was ready for it  She s probably not  this book involves some themes that may be difficult for children under twelve  But in the process of reading it  I remembered that I had read it when I was young  many  many years ago and fell in love all over again  The Giver is the story of twelve year old Jonas  who lives in a world where everyone is the same  young girls all have the same ribbon in their hair and every child gets a bike at age 9   precision in words is required  and people talk about feelings but never really have any  good or bad   No one in Jonas s world is sick or dies and everyone has work to do and even your spouse and children are chosen for you  Jonas is going to become a Twelve and finally get to learn what career path he s supposed to be on  Of course  it s chosen for him  Then he gets his assignment and everything changes  Lowry writes perfectly  She sets up the story through Jonas s eyes  telling how he s a little tiny bit different  and making the reader ask questions about this seemingly perfect world  No conflict here  Think again  The conflict evolves into an ending that makes perfect sense but leaves the reader wondering  You know how you read a book and think   I could have written that   Not this one  I finished it late at night and thought   I wish I could write like that    So so good  I can t wait to watch the movie  This book is so amazing  I had read all 4 books a few summers ago and they re all quite amazing  I usually don t really love the utopian society novels but this one always caught my eye  I originally read this in 8th grade and had never thought about anything like this  As I got older I reread it  and then started the other books in the series  and I m so glad I did As a future teacher  I would definitely teach this to my classroom  If I taught older grades  obviously  It will definitely open up many students  views about books  I know it did for me when I was younger  It also shows students the possibilities of the future  Not that I ever think this would happen  but it definitely broadens the imagination  I think that The Giver is a very good book because it contains a message in it and it was really interesting to read and see how life changes for Jonas    The Giver  by Lois Lowry  is one of my favorite books  It is a very thought provoking novel  It makes you think about things differently  Even now as I type  I am relating to it  Like a couple others  this book takes place in a secluded society where government are keeping secrets which causes conflict with the main characters  kind of like the Matched or Divergent series  The thing that sets this apart from those series  is that only two people  Jonas and The Giver  actually want to  escape   If you like future society based novels  I think you d like this book  I would probably recommend this book to my brother because I feel like he would like this book  I loved this book  It was a page turner and I didn t want to put it down  Luckily for me it was only 170 pages or so  so I got through it rather quickly  I would love to learn that this book had a sequel  it could go in so many directions  Such and interesting story line and I really enjoyed the characters as well  I ll definitely be recommending this one    The Giver is a very good book  This book is so expiring and makes to think twice about what are world is like  I like this book because it explains a utopiea and whats problems it has  This book is confuseing but u would have a understanding of it  Most of it is exiting and keeps you gessing though the whole story  In the beginning of the story there is a boy that has to follow rules and cant have any interation with the out side world  Hes his about to turn 14 and has to have a job and take a test to see what postion he will be in  There are rules and has to end school when he turns 14 to take his test and go on with his life  His mom and dad got married by force and has to take another persons baby and rise it  He is scared and doent know what job hes going to get and hopes its a job he would like  The middle of the book is about what he goes thorugh with his firends and worrying about geting in trouble  Him and hes firend know about the woman that had a odd baby and they don t know what they are going to do with it  They might get in troublem is the athoritys find out they know about the misterouse baby  He also has problems with school and he likes a girl but knows he wont have a life with her because older people pick for you  This story has a good story and can really give you an idea about what life can be like  The Giver is a story that can fill u with thoughts and emotions  This story is about a utopians society with a world that cant be perfect  In this town kids go to school and the adults watch them and once they are down the adults pick their jobs they will have for the rest of their life  Jonas has no idea what he is going to get and is afraid that he won t get a job  His fear is confirmed when they skipped in the ceremony  Turns out that is actually getting a special job called the receiver  When he starts the job he has to go see the giver and the giver gives him memories of how life was before the town was like this  The memories starting getting harder to handle and is weighing down on Jonas shoulders because he is not allowed to share them with anybody  Will he be able to handle the memories or will the burden get to big for one boy to handle I first read this book in my fifth grade class and it has been my favorite book sense then  It has a really good plot line and they way the story is written  It makes you question the things that you do and really think if they are actually good or you just that its good and it actually bad  This book has a really good way of putting that moral to the test  It also really has a really good descriptions especially in the memories and makes you feel like you are experiencing it for the first time yourself  I would recommend that everybody reads this book  The book is way better than the movie   I read this book ahead of the upcoming movie  Frankly  I m surprised that I had not heard of this book before now  It was a thought provoking and eye opening read  and as the author has stated  it was a dystopian story ahead of its time  Though dystopian novels are the norm these days  The Giver stands apart and above  I loved that it was so different than the others in this genre  Lowry s ability to paint such a plain  bleak  and highly regimented world is a gift  I had a hard time putting this book down as I was eager to learn what would become of Jonas  The only fault I found with it was that we had barely learned about the characters and the community before the book ended  I m hoping that the sequels will at least give us a glimpse of Jonas  and Gabriel s fate  My favorite book of all time  With DROOD Still as heartbreaking the second time around  but this time I m not as harsh in my rating  Though I read this book back in 7th grade  or was assigned it  at least  I just seriously read it this last week  now in my Junior year of college  A lot has been said about this book  I suppose  noting the gold stamp that is so ubiquitously on the cover that it even made the GoodRead s profile  I had heard this book was given much rewards  and it is one of those books that everybody is assigned  nowadays And with good reason  This book is a highly provocative bit of dystopian fiction that goes down smooth and reads fast  Lowry s brilliance is presenting it in a kind of moral ambiguity that doubly serves to make the book palatable for the  young adult  audience  but if you fall outside that genre of fiction  have no worries that this book is not mature enough  At no point did I feel like I was reading a kids book  just a brilliantly depicted dystopia from a kids persepctive  and that is an important difference Lowry did a great job of capturing this society  and really the crux of the conflict presented to Jonas  in an astoundingly small amount of words  In some sense  this book is not about the prose but about the editorial sense  though the prose is good  too   Not a word is wasted  everything presented is both interesting and necessary  Though I think I saw Jonas s revelation about his father coming  won t spoil it  I was legitimately shocked and dismayed about how it was presented  not sugar coated at all and very much heart breaking There is no more to say  besides read this book if you haven t  It goes quick and is more than worth the read  Vivvie  I m confused  Super confused  Hawtshot  The ending was abrupt  so what  There s always sequels  Leo  I just looked up the descriptions of the sequels  they all look like they have nothing to do with this book Hawtshot  What   That s not possible  How the hell is that possible   What the   Jackjohn  BLEEEP Vivvie  Ooh  somebody s got a dirty mouth  Hawtshot  I need to go hide under a pillow now  I just got a cliffhanger with no answers  Leo  Uuuuhhh   Vivvie  Leo  You look like you re going to be sick  Leo  I just might be  I think I need to go be alone now    Vivvie  What a bunch of drama queens  So it s just you and me now  Jackjohn Jackjohn  Yuppedy dup dup Vivvie  Well  it could be worse  Jackjohn  I think that this book was very nice    and the characters were nice    and the Giver was nice   and   Vivvie  Shut up  So since Jackjohn is incapable of producing a thought  I ll continue this review  Don t tell anybody  but I actually loved this book  Damn  I feel weird admitting that  Anyways  I just wish it was longer  I kinda like the fact that the author isn t telling us what happened to the characters  Cuz now I can be creative  What s disappointing is that I don t actually want the characters to die  I usually want that to happen  But this time I don t  So this time  I m going to imagine that Jonas and Gabe took over the world and destroyed that weird so not utopian society  There  I actually had positive thoughts for once  Most people think I m incapable of that  but whatever Jackjohn  Yay  Yay  Good review  Good thoughts  Whoop dee doo   Great  easy read  Looking forward to reading with my daughter someday  Our book group is reading this and I will not be able to attend the discussion  I have read The Giver many times and taught it in my classroom once  I would teach it more except that the next grade uses it  I really like this book  I think that it has many things to teach us as readers  and citizens  What makes you happy  Is it knowing you have a job  Here you are assigned a job that where you show aptitude  You don t need to worry  because everyone has a job  Do you worry about the weather spoiling an outing  not in this world  everything is perfect  The weather is great all of the time  No need to worry about designer clothes because everyone is wearing the same cloth and style  All equal  No one has to have bad memories of things that cause pain  no one has misery  no one is hungry  Why it sounds like the perfect world  everyone s dream   Then we realize that the things we often think will make a perfect world  would turn our lives into a nightmare  Lois Lowry shows that our memories good or bad are a big part of us  We learn that we need to see and feel to have real experiences  The first time he sees the color red  didn t you appreciate the colors around  just a little more  When he has his sledding experience  didn t you remember your own  What is man without his past  How can we just live in the present  It makes journal writing more important  and makes us appreciate our sorrows and joys even more  I hope that the ending is discussed in detail  I firmly believe that he found what he was looking for  I believe that he helped the person that he took with him  I also know that the author left the ending open and reserved each reader the right to have his or her own opinion of the book  All thoughts are correct  Read this book  It is a good book for discussion and thought  For me  it is a way of reminding myself of the gifts that I have each day   I just loved the book  the Giver  by Lois Lowry  It s a wonderful book  I can relate to the story to a magical story where magic happens for good and betterment of the society that has eliminated all pain  fear  war  and hatred  The story revolves around the main character Jonas  He has exceptional qualities like pale eyes  unusual powers of perception that makes him different from other citizens  Because of these traits in him he has given a highly honored Assignment of  Receiver of Memory   Jonas receives the memories of the past  good and bad  from the current Receiver  a wise old man who tells Jonas to call him the Giver  From the childhood I am very much interested in the movies  books based on supernatural powers  Through Jonas task of becoming the Receiver of Memory  he discovers the meaning of love  pain  frustration  color  and cold  That is when Jonas realizes how much more there really is  So I found  the giver  appropriate for me  As I am a very sensitive and a positive person by heart so I want happiness  love in the world  As I can relate to this book as emotionally  socially as well as politically  Everything in the community was predictable and pre planned  The Story get a different direction when no one in Jonas s community has ever made a choice of his or her own that makes Jonas gets more and more frustrated  One of the main reasons that I like this story is that despite of the fact Jonas was getting irritated and pressurized by the society he was equally indulged towards his family problem regarding Gabriel  It shows his responsibility and duties of a son Though some part of the story was really disturbing for me especially when the members have to release from the society  That really makes me emotional and weak from heart  But the courageous and fearless action taken by Jonas again attract me towards the story  I would like to give this story a 5 star in the end and would like to suggest all my close ones to at least go through this amazing book by Lowry at least once  I absolutely loved the Giver  The Giver is an amazing story that everyone should read  It teaches several things about life  emotions and the importance of memories  I thought it was very inspiring  The Giver has also been made into a movie  and is showing now   The Giver is about a boy named Jonas in a society much unlike from ours  In the beginning  Jonas is very nervous about what job he is going to be assigned  because he doesn t feel like he belongs anywhere  When the Ceremony of Twelves begin  Jonas s name and assignment are skipped  He is then assigned to be the Receiver of Memory  That means he will be given the memories of the past so he can advise the Board of Elders on issues  When he receives the memories  he learns about color  feelings  love  pain and so much more   I really enjoyed the Giver because I thought it was fantastic to see a society that is so much different from our own  It was also very cool to see what our world may become  I recommend this book for mainly anyone who enjoys critical thinking  I think this book is great for anyone 10   I guarantee you won t be disappointed  Readers will be sucked into a world that seems perfect but will slowly start to figure what goes on behind closed curtains in Lois Lowry s The Giver  Jonas is just a normal kid when he is receives what job he is to do  he meets an old man who makes Jonas think and see his world in ways   they  never wanted him to find out about  The book is amazing because you don t get answers  the book not only messes with the characters in the book  but also with the reader  leaving you mind boggled  Jonas not only deals with what he discovers  but also with  family  and friends that act very strange all of a sudden  Most every age would like this story because not only does it go through the mind of a teen  but he has to cope with situations that most people don t have to  I would highly recommend this book to anyone that like mystery books  couldn t put it down  I highly recommend this series  Amazing from page 1 to the last   I think this book is important to read because  like anything that is good for us  it makes you think  But not only that  it makes you imagine  I found myself imagining our world without color  and the depressing image I got made me more grateful for colors than I ever thought possible It made me thankful for choices  even if I ve always had problems making them  at least I had them  Moreover  this book made me think about our world as an alien  everything new and wonderful and horrible  Our world s history  and what it must look and feel to someone just discovering it  And likewise  all the good things  like love  courage  friendship  became even more emphasized and wonderful as I saw them through the eyes of our young protagonist  Jonas  Lois Lowry has a beautiful style of writing that makes you feel what the main characters are feeling  Definitely my favorite book of hers  If it s not required to read in schools  like junior high and high school I think it should be  Those are the ages when we re discovering more about this world and who we want to be in it  I think this book gives a great foundation for that  Really good book for 7th graders   A corrupt  futuristic  government controlled is the place that our young protagonist  Jonas  calls home  Everything in his world is completely planned out  people can t see color  hear music  or even have feelings  All of this changes for Jonas when he is assigned the role that receives the memories of the life before the government took complete control from a mysterious man who calls himself the giver  He learns that people can feel things like love and happiness and plans to make changes   I believe that The Giver has lots of important lessons that government officials should look into  These include  the government taking to much control of the people s rights  it s very important to stay loyal to the U S  Constitution and it s rights  Personally  I loved this book and I would recommend it to any one who has read Ender s Game  or any sci fi books  This book is a great book and it is now one of my personal favorites   Summary  Jonas lives in a world with no sadness  hunger  or pain  His leaders manage everything  including the decision for careers of each of their citizens  Jonas is given the career of a Receiver  This means that the previous Receiver  who is now called the Giver  will have to transmit all of the memories of their world to Jonas  This is not an easy task for Jonas and has not been easy for previous Receivers  some of which have actually asked to be released after feeling the grief from those memories  During this difficult time Jonas is helping his father raise a newborn who will not sleep through the night  It is his father s responsibility to release the child if it will not sleep  Jonas helps the process along by transmitting good memories to the child to get him to sleep  The reason for this help goes deeper than just an interest  Jonas has just found out something tragic involving the releasing process  Now Jonas will stop at nothing to save this child and possibly his world from the secrets that keep them from truly living  Insights  This was  of course  intriguing  I am a fan of any distopian novel  especially one that involves a seemingly perfect world that underneath it all is corrupted  This book really made me think about intentions  Perhaps the intentions of their leaders were good  They did not want their people to experience grief or know of death  But this is not way to live  What if unhappiness is let lose somehow  They run the risk of all of the people wanting to commit suicide because of their grief  In a blink of an eye they could lose everything   LOVED IT  The Giver is an amazing book I would give it 5 stars and I think that it is better then the movie  But the movie is also amazing  The book is an kind of book that takes it time they didn t rush though it at all they took there time and put in every detail  I am not usually not a big reader but this book one I got in to it I never wanted to put the book down  Another thing that I like about the book and the movie is they didn t put any color an nether of them so it let you focus on the story instead of what is going on out side of the story  So this is forsure my favorite book  this book is a classic  It explores the frightening aspects of a world of conformity  without crime  devoid of any extremes such as anger  sadness  and pain or joy  love or pain  the concept is a great one and it is written in a very raw manner from the perceptive of a young character that is given the job of the apprentice of the sole keeper  the giver  of all that has been taken from the world  This young man slowly comes to realize the joys life has to offer  and that you have to take the bad with the good  Like I mentioned  this is a raw book  and is a bit depressing  but the depth of the lesson it teaches are amazing   i liked this book a lot and i read it in school too  not really in school  but on my bed sick reading it  It is a little like the book running out of time  another book i really liked  this was an awesome and interesting book  I read this book in one sitting  I could not put it down  Defiantly one of  if not the best fantasy book I have ever read  It is an utterly cold novel about social acceptance  Every page of The Giver was spellbinding and captivating  However very interesting the story it is still a little confusing  A world without colors  loves  pain  and so on  This world is interesting yet  scary  I consider this book to be among the best books ever published  Found in the children or young readers sections your local library I would recommend everyone give this a read  you will not be disappointed   This book was reallycool  The giver was training him little by little  he was very brave because he was protecting his real little brother   The Giver is one of the greatest books I have ever read The way the author creates this world and paints pictures in your mind is amazing  I liked the way she described the characters emotions  It made me feel as if I was experiencing those emotions myself  The voices of characters that she has created placed into my mind with incredible detail  The story itself was incredible  she describes a world completely run by the government  She depicted a world without love and without real pain  a world without choices  This world that she pulled straight out of her brain has shown me what memories really mean  This story is one of a boy living in a terrible world that you will never forget  If there was something I could change it would be to continue the story  In conclusion I think that anyone could read this and it will always stand out in their minds as one of the greatest stories ever told   I ve just finished this today  I started it as a bit of a palate cleanser between books and I d kinda lost my reading mojo  It had been sitting on my shelf for some months  and now I can t believe it took me so long to read Yes it s short and a bit simplistic  however I really loved this little book  I enjoyed journeying on Jonas  journey as he started to grow up and question everything around him  something that no body else did I do have to admit thatI wasn t 100  sure of the Giver  but that could be that I m a bit of a distrustful person Cannot wait to read what happens next to Jonas I think that this book should be as important to school children as To Kill a Mockingbird and The boy in the Striped Pajamas  This made me sad  Why would people choose to live in a world free of love  of colour  of music   no passion just to never experience pain  All of the most precious lessons in my life have been learned through pain  Jonas and the Giver are the only two adults in this book  they are the only ones who can feel pain and they are the only ones who can love  When the Giver said his daughter s name was Rosemary  I don t even know why I was surprised  in hindsight it isn t that surprising  but I suddenly overflowed into tears  I don t believe that the society in this world is possible  you would have to do a lot of genetic engineering to produce people like these    but it does make you think  The writing is simple and beautiful and it is the kind of book I would have loved when I was twelve years old  I really enjoy Lois Lowry as an author  She writes deep stories that go far beyond the surface storyline  She also reaches children and adults alike with universal themes I ironically had read The Messenger first and thought that I would have all the answers at the end of The Giver from having done so  I was wrong  I had a few very small answers  but really Lois Lowry leaves you with so much to imagine and hope for as a reader  There s a part of me that wants her to tell me exactly how everything turns out  But there s a part of me that was very content to imagine it just as I would like to  This would be a great book to discuss amongst a group  This book really allowed me to explore ideas about what life would be like without opposition  The theme of the book reminded me a lot of Ecclesiastes where it talks of the idea that there needs to be a time to laugh and a time to weep  A time to love and a time to hate  Basically    there NEEDS to be opposition in order for us to fully enjoy life  I also realized how much I appreciate agency and having the gift of choice in every aspect of my life  There were definitely spiritual themes intertwined throughout this book  but only if you want to see them  Along with the large blessings of agency and opposition  I came away from this book being more grateful for the simplicities in our life that we enjoy   color  sunshine  snow  love  family  grandparents    For I can t imagine life without them  And even some of the hardships of pain and loneliness that make us appreciate joy even more  I couldn t believe how fast I read this book and was really wishing it had lasted a little longer  But at least it left me wanting more and not wishing it was over  Sorry for the long review    it obviously made me think   I didn t like this book for the first eight chapters  Then I couldn t put it down  12 year old Jonas lives in a world of sameness  Everyone is pleasantly polite  everyone goes about their assigned lives contentedly  the inconveniences and rough edges of life  even bad weather  have been smoothed out  The residents of the community don t have to worry about risks or dangerous choices  everything is managed smoothly  When children turn twelve  they are assigned a role in the community and begin their training to become contributing adults  Jonas  however  is singled out for a unique honor  and it eventually leads to encountering the truth  One of the elements that I didn t like at the beginning of the book was the author s rather spare  bland style  However  it was an effective choice to convey the bland nature of the characters  lives  and to help set up the plot development regarding Jonas s experiences when he begins his training  Lois Lowry prompts us to think about issues relating to values and choice and risk  Is it too much risk to just tell it like it is  or is it better to just avoid talking about it and pretend things are fine  How many lies do people tell themselves every day  In our efforts to make the world a better place  how do we define  better   The Giver by Lois Lowry will always be one of my favorite books  It is about an eleven year old boy who lives in a controlled society  Everything in this community is controlled  the person you marry  the amount of kids you can have  literally everything  and it s all done by this special group of people called  the elders   Everybody thinks the same and doesn t express emotions  Jonas the main character is going to be twelve and be assigned a job  Jonas finds out that his new job is going to be the receiver  A very important part of the community that hold all memories of the outside world such as snow and rain  He finds out the unfortunate secrets that the community keeps from everybody and decides to run away  I chose to read this book because it s one of my all time favorite books  My favorite part is when the giver passes down the memory of snow to Jonas because when he describes the memory it sounds so relaxing and tranquilizing  My least favorite part was when Jonas decides to run away and take baby Gabriel with him  I always enjoy reading this book because every time I read it I understand it more and more each time  I would definitely recommend this book to all of my friends  It s such an amazing read and has an interesting plot   I really enjoyed this book  I thought it was very imaginative and almost ahead of its time  but also sort of a reflection on the society we already live in today  I think it gives the reader an understanding of how important being yourself and not conforming to everyone else is  and also not expecting people to be the same as you  I would recommend this book mostly for older children  as they will be more likely to understand the ideas and themes in the book  but younger kids would enjoy it too I m sure  It is a good introduction to science fiction and fantasy  and will keep anyone who is reading it hooked   The book is so much more different from the movie  But it was so much better than the movie and that is rare for me to say  It was very facinating imaginative interesting and   hopeful  that pretty much sums it up  If you have not read it read it and you won t be sorry     Gr 6 9  Following his life s assignment as an unnamed utopian community s next Giver  a twelve year old boy named Jonas struggles as he alone mystically receives from the aging Giver knowledge of pain and beauty inaccessible by others  His attempts to share his  memories  of the community s past  a life still accessible outside the community  are futile with all but Gabriel  a newchild who has been granted special approval to spend nights with his family rather than face an early  release   Despite the fact that Jonas receives both painful and joyful memories  very early in his training he realizes that life without choices or even natural urges may be safe  but not fulfilling  Ultimately  upon learning that his life  devoid of true love  is also predicated by lies  he embarks on a heart wrenching journey of self discovery and freedom  In very simple terms  Lowry s masterfully written tale champions the pursuit of truth and the real meaning of humanity  Readers will think about this one well after finishing the last page   How would you feel if everyone was the same  In this book you will find that it is not your everyday book you read  This book grabbed my attention from the start  It was nothing like I would have thought it would have been  But this book is a dystopia it is set in a future tense  But it is almost like it is in past tense  There are no advancements in society  If anything there are setbacks  That is really all I have to say about this gut wrenching book  Agree with me or not that is how I feel This book is just plain  You will understand that if you read the book I thoroughly enjoyed this book  It got my attention from the very beginning  I would recommend this to a person whose attention is easily grasped  That is how it was for me  Although I was a bit confused at the very beginning  This is the type of book you would to read it more than once when you get older  At least that is what I will do  Sometimes that is what I think makes a book so good  That you can read it however many times and always find something new in it  I am super glad I had read this book one because it is a classic and also there is a movie coming out about it  People who like adventure type of books would like this  Also people who like to think throughout the book would to  But get ready to experience the black and the white   I think  The Giver  by Lois Lowry is an extraordinary book  It s about a teenage boy named Jonas who lives in a place where there is no color or laughter  Everyone thought that they had a perfet He was assigned a job by the 12 elders  He was the reciever of memory Every once in a while  he is going to go to the giver who gives him visions about what the outside world was like  He saw love  family  fun  laughter  music  and color  He thought of why the elders made the city with none of these  He later learns that there were consequences to having fun and color  War  poaching  and suffering  He meets a baby named Gabe who was about to die because he did t pass a test  Jonas could tell that he will be the next reciever of memory  With the help of his friend Fiona  he saves Gabe and goes on a journey  His mission was to pass the boundaries to bring back the memories  I recommend this book to people who want to learn about life and who likes to read about a different world  I really love this book  and I believe that anyone can read this book   Do you like science fiction  If so  this is the book for you  If you are from the ages of eleven to fourteen this book is for you  It is for both boys and girls  This is a book with action and adventure  It is a really enjoyable book by a great author  I was glued to the book from the start  and didn t stop reading until I was finished  This is a wonderful book with a great lesson for people to learn  In a future society  one boy chooses to rebel against his government and job  I loved this book  Lois Lowry did a wonderful and splendid job writing this book  The lesson learned in this book is very valuable and useful  You learn that freedom is important and that memories are a good thing  The book could have had a little bit faster pace  but the book was still enjoyable  I think this is a wonderful book for teens  I think many people would like this book  This book teaches you a great lesson on how freedom is extremely important and that memories are a wonderful thing to have and without them you don t enjoy life  I hope many people read this book and love it as much as I did  This book is very interesting and enjoyable  Jonas is the main character and he teaches us that courage and bravery are very important  The giver is a great book  many people should read it  It is written by a great author  This book gives a very valuable lesson and is very important  I enjoyed reading every bit of the story  You can receive knowledge from The Giver  Thank goodness for a Facebook posting of  100 books everyone should read in their lifetime   I had read 87 of them  The Giver was on the list  but I hadn t read it  When I started reading  I thought I was reading a Divergent type book  But it was a book that was much more  This should be required reading for 8th graders or maybe even high schoolers  I loved reading about how a 12 year old feels when he first discovers love  pain  frustration  colors  cold  Sameness  is it good or not good  Many interesting concepts touched on in this wonderfully written book Jonas is an eleven year old boy who lives in a dystopian world of the future  The Community is seemingly perfect  there is no war  pain  decision making  and everyone has a job  But the Ceremony of Twelve introduces Jonas to a whole new existence  as the Receiver of Memory  The Committee of Elders seeks the advice of The Giver to remember what came before  but the responsibility is also fraught with unimaginable terrors  The Giver will transfer this knowledge to Jonas  where he alone experiences the world s history of hatred  pain  and war    and no one else can ever know With regard to the plot  The Giver was very believable  with the occurrences in the book being fairly well explained  The question   What caused society to become this way   is brought up by the reader themselves by the mysterious nature of the society and how this society is introduced by the author early on  The conclusion was satisfying  if not unexpected  There was very clear conflict between what appears to be a utopian society to the Community s members  but what the Giver and Jonas realize is clearly dystopian With regard to style and language  The author uses precise language in a clever way in this book  She brings attention to it through the Community s emphasis on precise language  therefore manipulating the reader s attention toward the use of language  There were many surprising and unexpected insights throughout the book as well With regard to pacing  The pacing is perfect for the intended audience  The story moves along quickly  but without leaving the reader behind  The author spends just the right amount of time lingering over necessary details  With regard to the characters  The main characters could have been more fully developed  As a reader  I didn t feel like I knew all of them  or any of them  well enough to connect to them as a real person With regard to the setting  The detail in which the Lowry describes the setting helps make it real  It is a bit difficult to understand  because the world they live in is black and white  so it s definitely not something we re accustomed to  but the author does a remarkable job  nonetheless Other considerations  The futuristic  dystopian theme is a very interesting choice for a juvenile audience  But I think the author did a good job of tailoring the story to her intended readers  probably around eleven years old and up   The book was absent of didacticism  Overall  this seems to be a very well rounded piece  The theme and content of the book seems well suited for the author s intended audience  and the delivery is well executed  Imagine  a world in which everything is the same  Children all celebrate their birthdays on the same day and while aging together  receive the same guidelines as to how to look and act  Members of the community don t even know color so nothing is different  Once the children turn thirteen  they become adults where a group of elders chooses their fate for the future  This is the society in the book The Giver  Jonas is a boy about to become a man  At his ceremony of thirteen  something peculiar happens  Jonas is skipped until very last to receive his job title  He is chosen as the next giver  What does that mean  Jonas will have to find out  When he does  big decisions must be made  Decisions that will change the future of the whole society   There is a definite theme in The Giver  It is that sometimes  we need to make mistakes so we can learn from them  This even applies to the present  For example  without the stock market collapsing  we would never know how to keep it from happening again  The past is one of the best ways to prevent disaster in the future I chose this book because I had read online and from many peers that it was one of the best books they have ever read  I have to say  The Giver definitely exceeded my expectations  It has made my top 10 book list  I would recommend this book to anyone middle school and above  I think to truly understand the message The Giver is portraying  the reader must be of a mature mind  Overall  I think The Giver was a fantastic book  I really thought that this book was very interesting and entertaining  I really liked the way the Giver gave a lot of stories to become the Giver to Jonas  the main character  I also really liked the relationship between Jonas and the Giver  I thought that it was very unique story that I have never read before   The Giver was written several years ago but continues to be popular with young readers  The Giver was dystopian before dystopian was a genre  The novel is written from Jonah s point of view and the plot of the novel is revealed to the reader through Jonas s eyes  The story takes place in what seems to be a perfect society  but as the story progresses it is revealed to not be so  perfect   Jonas is an 11 year old boy who lives in a community of sameness  Everyone dresses the same  wears their hair the same  and everyone follows the rules  Life is perfect in this community  This society chooses what they believe is best for everyone including what career they will go into  Each year a ceremony takes place and each year as a person gets older they earn a new privilege  for instance when you turn nine you earn a bike  Jonas is turning twelve  which is a very important year because this is the year he is given his profession  Jonas learns that he will be The Receiver  an extremely well respected job in the community  Jonas is quite nervous as he begins his new duties as The Receiver  Jonas begins his training as The Receiver  spending his days with the previous Receiver who is now called The Giver  Jonas is overwhelmed as he is allowed to break several of the rules of the community including he is now allowed to lie  During Jonas s training he receives many of the memories of The Giver  Some of these memories are painful for Jonas because they are nothing like he has ever experienced before  For the first time  he feels true pain and sees the devastation of war  But not all the memories are bad  Jonas learns what color is and holidays and what a true loving family looks like  As he receives more and more of humanity s memories  he starts to question why his community chose sameness  As time goes on Jonas questions more and more about the life of the community eventually leading up to a shocking revelation  The Giver shares the memory of release in the community and Jonah learns that release  which happens to the old  to those who break the community rules  and to sickly babies  is actually legal murder committed by members of the community  Jonas s outlook on life completely changes and he is at a turning point  He can continue to receive the memories and go on with his life accepting the rules of the community  or he can run away causing all his memories to be released into the community  Jonah chooses to flee and The Giver helps Jonas form a plan  Jonas and the Giver decide that during the next ceremony Jonas would run away faking his death  They work out all the details of their plan carefully and everything is on track for Jonas to leave when Jonas realizes that the baby his family has been caring for will be released  Jonas knows he must save this child and decides to take him with him  Now Jonas must deviate from his original plan and leaves that night on his father s bike with Gabe attached in the child s seat  Because he had to leave so quickly  he does not have the much needed supplies he had originally planned to take with him  As Jonas and Gabe travel farther and farther from the community survival becomes more and more difficult  They are cold and hungry and have no idea where they are going  As the novel ends the reader is left with uncertainty not knowing whether it is death that awaits Jonas or the safety of Elsewhere The Giver has earned many book awards and I myself feel it is one of the best books out there for young adults  The Giver provides a true depiction of a dystopian society without making it look cool or romantic like most of the dystopian novels of today  There is so much for young readers to learn from this novel that its modern counterparts don t even come close to doing  The Giver makes us think about how important it is to hold on to personal freedom and individuality and that perfection doesn t come without losing personal choice  There is no such thing as a  perfect  community  Students today can learn so many things from this novel including the importance of individuality and choice  This is a novel that students can discuss and debate over  It will make them think I highly recommend The Giver  It is written beautifully and stands up to the test of time  Each time you read this novel  you will take away something different from it  That is what I believe makes a good read  a novel that changes you each time you read it   Jonas  12  receives his career path of Receiver  This changes everything What it is most  is a novel about the cost of safety  While this fit the 90s  I think it fits even better now as our society pushes further and harder towards this end  What makes it especially good is that it addresses this idea  and others including the idea of utopias   dystopias  perfectly for it s intended audience while still working for older reads I read this in junior high  recommended to me by some guy in my class   yes  this is one of those rare books both praised and passed around by kids  and I got enough of it  When I reread it  I found it even more effective  I m still not sure what I believe happened at the end   While poking around online  I saw found that it s part of a loose trilogy  I both want and don t want to read more  I m fearful that she ruined the well chosen ambigious end of  The Giver  We ll see Class discussion   idea that most of use felt that when we read it  during the 90s  that it already felt like it had been around for years  Rarely are books automatically canonical  My second favorite book of hers  following Number the Stars The book The Giver by Lois Lowry is about a boy named Jonas who lives in a community  a place where strict rules are enforced  and is one day chosen as The Receiver  an important job  The Receiver holds memories of the past and pain so no one else suffers within the community  He is trained by The Giver the previous receiver who will pass his memories along with Jonas  Along the way  Jonas learns the memories he is being shown should be available to others in the community  I chose this book because my friend recommended it to me  My favorite part of the book was when the Giver gives the memory of Christmas to Jonas  This is my favorite part of the book because I like the feeling of being happy and it brought me joy  My least favorite part of the book was when a baby named Caleb drowned in a nearby river because death makes me sad  especially a childs  I enjoyed this book because Jonas is able to change his community  Overall  I would recommend this book to my friends because there is a lot of symbolism and the characters are well developed  This was actually a re read  via audiobook  I read it when it first came out but remember it only in broad strokes  With the movie coming out and my book group reading it  I decided a re read was in order  I didn t care much for the reader  there s something about men doing the voices of little girls that just irritates me  but it didn t bother me enough to put me off the story  I enjoyed re visiting the story  the details and the social commentary implicit in the story  My young colleagues and book group friends remember having mixed feelings about the book and its  ambiguous  ending but I think that is because they first read the book as a child tween  Since both my readings of the book were as an adult  I found the ending quite clear  not ambiguous at all  though sad and leaving questions open as to what effect events really had on the community  Of course  I can see how it is written in such a way that a child not yet ready to deal with an unhappy ending can choose to read the ending literally  and thus ambiguously  in order to hold on to hope   The giver reminded me a bit of Divergent ate 1984 and threw up Delirium all over the place  I did love the storyline  What blew me away was The Giver s Daughter and her little spot in the book  Also the ending has me baffled  I am unsure what to choose for the ending since this is one of those novels you basically can choose which ending you think is right for them  For me  I believe that both endings would be beautiful  Now I am being tortured with that ending but never the less I enjoyed this book  It is so worth reading   Haven t read this book in decades  It was great  Can t wait for my sixth grader to read it this year in school so we can discuss it  I wonder how much this book influenced the authors of the many many similar novels out there right now     I really liked reading  The Giver   Even though it is a childrens book  I think that anyone could enjoy it  This book takes place in a dystopian community  where the government decides your job  your spouse  and when you die  The citizents are blissfully ignorant to the past  they don t know about war  pain  or even snow  There is no sun  no hills  no color  and everything is supposed to be the same  The one person who knows what everybody does not know is the Giver  When Jonas becomes the Reciever  he learns of theese things that only the Giver knows  Jonas becomes disgusted with his parents and his community  When Gabriel s life is threatened  Jonas runs away  even though he had a plan devised already  After quite a long journey Jonas finds a sled and slided down a hill  where he hears music ahead of him  and echoes behind The ending in not clear  so that the reader can decide for themselves what happens  I think that Jonas does end up finding a family singing in thier home at the bottom of the hill  Here s why  Jonas used up all of his memories of coldness  so when he finds the sled it is not a memory  Because the sled was read  I m assuming that the memory of the family was real as well    I thought it was very thought through and its about a boy that does not fit in at lot and he goes and saves his world from the darkness of not knowing what it was like to love   feel peace and joy  Even the colors were gone and he went out and beyond the boundaries of the forgetfulness  he also stopped taking his morning dose of the forgetfulness  I thought it was a very good book of courage and strength to go against all odds to win and become new and himself and others he loves back to normal  great book and I also enjoyed the b movie after I read the book too  but like people say the book has and did have a couple of scenes that were not in the movie which I hope it would be because it was just that good   This book is amazing  I read it before the movie and it was the most imaginative and colourful book I could ask for  The imagery is so crisp and wonderful  The movie is good  but I understand why the books are better for me  because our imaginations are better than the movies  Unless it is Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings  I suggest reading this book first as it will be worth it  Or even reading it after the movie  there are a lot more details in the book that aren t explained exactly in the movie  This is one of my favorite of all times  simply because it shows what the world would be like  completely controlled  I know it s a concept used over and over in science fiction  but I believe Lois Lowry did an excellent job of writing in such a way that the reader realizes over time what the book is truly about  The ending is so good  Once you figure out what s going on  you just root for him to realize what there really is to living  Our teenager had to read this a few years ago and it was so interesting to hear her take on it  My husband also had to read this in a college class he took  I think it just goes to show what a treasure it is  I can t belive it s been such a long time since I read this  I absolutely loved this book  almost impossible to put down  I watched the movie first  which was the reason I decided to read the book  the movie was very well done as well   I just loved the plot and all of the unique ideas in the book  it definitely changed how I view certain aspects of my life   Wow  this was great  Really makes you think about free will  and agency and the importance of  opposition in all things   Its examined in a completely non religious way  which is interesting  because usually I think of these subjects in terms of religion  Anyways  It was definitely a great fast read  I wish it would have went on  I feel like the Hunger Games books tried to capture the same type of theme and power  but where they failed for me  The Giver succeeded  I really never felt any emotional attachment to the world or really even the plight of the 13 colonies or cities or compounds or whatever they were called in The Hunger Games  The whole series seemed very shallow  heartless  and rushed to me Anyways  I m not reviewing The Hunger Games  but just wanted to say that the Giver  while super short  really got me thinking about deeper thoughts  while at the same time I felt very personally involved in the story and felt like I really knew Jonas Great  I ll def read Lowry s other books  uma distopia rapidinha  pra ler em um dia  me lembrou bastante lua de larvas em alguns aspectos   adorei a maneira como a autora construiu uma sociedade nova de um jeito fascinante em 150 paginas  coisa que varios outros autores nao conseguem em 3 livros de 300 paginas  rs  amei amei amei     picked up this book because I wanted to see the movie and now I want to see the movie even more then I had before  I found it interesting how the story takes place in a community that is controlled by people that make decisions for them from what they eat to what they wear and how everyone is mostly the same  Hated how they chose to  release  the elderly  twins  or children that didn t meet up to what they thought they should be like  Thought it was interesting how the community chose one person to take on all the memories from years and years before and then he had to pass it onto another person and another person  Also how each family or unit could only have one boy and one girl and you had to apply for them and had to apply to get married  I love the ending there the new receiver takes the little boy Gabe and leaves the community to save the little boy after he learns how this father was suppose to  release  the child  Very easy read and enjoyed it very much  I read this book many years ago when I was still in school yet everytime I see it or hear about a friend reading it i m always taken back to this thought provoking story  It s a very interesting book that really worked my imagination  I would have loved to read a sequel or other books like it  I would love to reread this book now through the eyes of an adult since the last time I read it I was still a child  As a child it truly made me wonder about a  perfect world  where there were no highs and lows    everything is preordained and set out for you  In this society there is no thinking for yourself  their brain doesnt seemed tuned to that and if it even is there are means of stopping it  As a child I always wondered what happened next    did he make it to another society  did he go back  where does that leave him now  I didn t have much closure at the end but then again I was hoping that a sequel existed or would be written at some stage  Even though the lack of closure was hard for me I still think this was a remarkable story and is definately a must read  When I first read this book  I was only about 11 or 12 years old  So it was easy for me to imagine in the first couple of pages how the main character  Jonas  must have felt turning twelve  However I was a smart kid  because I also could not imagine getting a job at that age  and being expected to do that very same job for the rest of you life  I recently re read this book to prepare for the final installment of the quartet and I must say that this one is still my favorite  It is easy to go from page to page and this book could very easily be a stand alone  Imagining a kind of utopia where everything about the human experience is controlled  Eye color  skin color  the ability to see color  and feelings  The members of the community are forced to take pills so they will not feel  As a kid I couldn t imagine it  and I still feel the same as an adult  This book is about one young boy s journey as he becomes different and escapes from the community where different is not allowed  A lot of people do not know that this is a quartet because they like the way it ends  It ends with a cliff hanger of sorts and allows people to interpret what happens after that  But  I enjoy closure  I like knowing that there was something else after this book  I would recommend this book  but with a warning that the others are not as well done    What an interesting little book  What a wonderful expression of why agency is such a gift  I was fascinated with this story and could not put it down till I finished it  I read it in almost one sitting  My heart was broken for Jonas as he discovers his loss of not being able to choose even the basic things in his life  I was touched by his love for little Gabriel  and what he was willing to sacrifice to give him his life with choices  His love for the Giver and the plan they conceived through knowing the truth to give back to their people what they had lost was a great ending  I am so glad I took the time to read this book  I have a new appreciation of everyday choices I can make in my life  It also awakened me to a sense of doing what I can in my own country s government to assure that we never get to the point that we give up agency to make life safer  Risk and testing are a part of our lives on this earth and choice is central to our proving ourselves and our happiness   So near the middle of the book I started to wonder if it was going to be too melodramatic  And I think there are some substantial plot holes  But I still think it is very well written   the characters are compelling and you get immersed enough in this life style that the revelations have impact  More importantly  it has kept me thinking long after finishing it  which is a favorite quality of mine for any medium  Like I said  still sorting through my thoughts  but one issue I have been thinking about is that I didn t identify with this dystopia  I feel like in dystopic books  either the author lets you know what transpired to arrive at the dystopia  or else they assume it is obvious to the reader  That is  today s readers would accept stuff like world war  pandemic  genetic experimenting gone crazy  and sentient machines as plausible  enough  futures that the author wouldn t have to explicate anything  I couldn t really figure where this dystopia was coming from  or arguing against    but then thought of 1984  and figured this was a Cold War era book  Then a lot of things made more sense  Unfortunately  it was published in 1993  so I don t think that really is the key    A futuristic society  where the citizens have no sense of emotion  color  hot cold  pain  pleasure  time  or seasons  is where Jonas had lived his whole life  To him  and everyone else it was perfect  but his view of his world changes when at the end of his year as an Eleven  he is picked for a job where his mentor is a lonely old man who holds the wonders and horrors of the world before the community  He is faced with a decision  but before he had even made up his mind  he knew there was no turning back  I think that the Giver is a wonderful book  and every time you read it  you will feel differently about the things that happen throughout the story  If you are a person who enjoys thinking about the impossible  and you have a wild imagination that can take you anywhere  than this is definitely a book for you  Although  if strange ideas  societies and rules that are found in books confuse you or annoy you  you may have a hard time reading this book  To read this book  you also need lots of patience for the characters naivety innocence and their slow development throughout the book   The Giver by Lois Lowry was the third book that I read for MotherReader 48 hour book challenge  This book was recommended to me by a 15 year old boy who promised me it would be worth my time  He was without a doubt right  This story is set in the future and is about a boy named Jonas  In his world there is no hunger  poverty or conflict  Everyone lives by a set of rules and everyone obeys without question  Every family unit receives a boy and a girl to raise  When children turn 12 years of age they are given a life assignment determined by a committee of people called Elders  Jonas is assigned a job called the Receiver of Memories  It is explained to him that his job is special and it involves lies and and long buried secrets  His knowledge of things are not allowed to be shared with anyone  even those he loves most Jonas has always believed that he lived in a perfect place  but in this story learns that perfection comes at a high price This book was a page turner  I couldn t put it down  I had to know what would happen to Jonas I recommend this book to readers 12 and up    For this review  I chose The Giver  This is a book about Jonas  a 12 year old boy who has been chosen to be the next  Receiver of Memory   This is a job where he has to contain all the memories of the past  our society  You see  the story takes place many years in the future  in a closed off  dystopian society  Our society was considered too painful and chaotic to remember  so the Receiver of Memory has to contain all the memories of the past so that the public doesn t have to experience the pain  He has to get the memories from the last Receiver  and the more memories he gains  the more he realizes how messed up and sheltered his society is  until he snaps  and pulls off the ultimate revolt  This is one of my favorite books of all time  I read it in seventh grade  and it has stuck with me for this long  The story is so elaborate and the writing is so detailed and crafted that it left me begging for more  I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read things slightly more serious and intense than your everyday romance novel  All in all  this was a beautifully written book  and I give it 5 out of 5 stars  Thanks Sasha Didkovsky The Giver and The Receiver and the allYour world is perfect and it is all you know  Disruptions are minimal and dealt with swiftly  All is as it was And for eleven year old  about to turn twelve Jonas  you will find out all life is wrong That is the best  non spoilery  way I could think of to very swiftly describe The Giver  This award winning YA novel by Lois Lowry is considered a modern classic  having come out in 1993  and is frequently challenged by small minded censors They probably recognize themselves in The Giver  And not in a good way  Fun doesn t end when you become Twelve  But back to Jonas and his all When we start out  Jonas is telling us of some disquiet that happened one day and how his society remedies it This opens the window for us to see how this society works  his family functions  and the happiness all enjoy  All the structures and rules and firm politeness is part of the glue which makes everything feel oh so perfect  Inside the home  society gently makes the family all get along and be loving and supportive and kind  Any and all bad things that could possibly happen  or have happened  are sanitized with words and actions no one really truly understands  Thank you for your childhood  As Jonas approaches his Twelfth birthday  we see he has come of age for his career to be chosen for him  And this is where we  and Jonas  begin the unraveling of all that is For Jonas becomes the Receiver of Memory  Learning about the world from The Giver  Cue chaos It is obvious for any reader that the utopia presented in the first third of The Giver is not quite right  Hints and dangly loose threads of life show us that many many things are wrong here  By the halfway point  the clear picture of how truly horrible this dystopia is becomes clear  even to Jonas who is only now waking up  I accept your apology  With all the revelations  breakthroughs  plans  and deep thoughts that rolls on as The Giver progresses  the concepts of what is a good society is debated  The Giver and The Receiver will make you question the roles of emotions in who and what we are  plus how our actions because of feelings can affect the greater society around us As these issues are fleshed out  we also see Jonas learning of how the efficiencies that have always been part of the fabric of all he knows make everything fun so very very very smoothly  but at the cost of imagination  fun  and a sense of history So much of this culminates towards the conclusion with a subplot exploding that I never expected to explode  And crystalizes the massive differences of Jonas from the start to the Jonas at the end  Which also illustrates how the wrongness of this society can be fixed by a simple kindness by a child  Call me The Giver  The Giver is rich in thought and textures of emotions  Lois Lowry also provides dialogue and sentences that perfectly sum up so much in so little  Her accomplishment in making Jonas and this world ring true will cause an immediate urge to seek out the loose sequels Gathering Blue  Messenger  and Son One of these deals with the ambiguous final pages of The Giver  My optimism leads me to think happy thoughts  Ones I know The Giver and Receiver would be find pleasing Scoopriches THE GIVER I had heard about the book and seen it lying around my house for years but never bothered to read it  Then one day after seeing the movie  which I thought was great  I knew the book had to be really good too  I couldn t find it in my house so I gave up on reading it for a while  until I found it in my classroom and got my own copy the very next day PlotOne of things about this book that impressed my most is was the very deep and detailed plot of The Giver  The book is about a post apocalyptic future where in one isolated community  almost everything and everyone one is the same  In all this sameness where you have no choice  everything is chosen for you there is one difference  the receiver of memory  This is one person who is chosen to receive memories of the world before sameness and use those memories to help out the current lifestyle  This leads to conflict within the main character Jonas  When he first experiences these memories he wonders why those things no longer happen  and why people can t know  One example from the book is when the Giver and Jonas first meet and Jonas he says  But what happened to those things  Snow and the rest of it   and the giver replies  Snow made growing food difficult for agricultural periods  And unpredictable weather made transportation almost impossible at times   This quote is a prime example of a big idea that while sameness makes life equal it also takes away and restricts life greatly SettingAnother key factor in the story that greatly impressed me was the intriguing setting of the book  This book mainly takes place in a small community where everything is the same  like the land the buildings the clothes  the language the rules  like you cannot lie  you must use precision of language etc   and so much more  In this small community everybody lives in a house with 2 parents and 2 children one boy and one girl   until they grow older  When the children become 12 they go through a ceremony in which their jobs and the rest of their lives are chosen for them  When Jonas is picked as receiver of memories at this ceremony and starts his training he spends much of his time in a small house  The house is inside the edge of a large cliff  which also marks the end of the community  In this room the rules of the community can be broken like being able to have books  instruments and food at any time  One example of this from the text is when Jonas first visits the room and says   the bed in an alcove at the far end of the room was draped in splendid cloth    But the rooms walls were completely covered in books  Jonas just stared at them he couldn t imagine what the books contained   This quote demonstrates the lack of individuality in his community  A book with unique thoughts is something that because of that lack of individuality he could not understand  I d heard that the book was controversial and sad  Being the oddball I am  I wanted to read it because of that  I can understand why it was controversial and agree that it s sad  but those shouldn t be the reasons that someone reads it  They should read it because it s a beautiful thought provoking story which everyone should read at some point in their lives   POTENTIAL SPOILERS BELOW This book has my favorite ending of anything I ve ever read watched  Because of its ambiguity  you can interpret it many ways  That leaves you thinking about it for a long time  SPOILERS OVER This may well be the best book I ve ever read  Check it out buy it as soon as you can  you won t regret it  Genre Category  dystopian lit coming of age individuality power of historyRead for  oral author report  Lowry Summary  Jonas is a young boy who has grown up in the Community  a place of safety and peace  A place without war  sadness  love  or choice  It is a place where each person has a role in a pre chosen family and a pre chosen duty to perform in the Community  At the age of twelve  Jonas joins his peers to receive his Community Assignment which could vary from street cleaner to doctor  When his turn comes to receive his Assignment  he is skipped  something that hasn t happened in many  many years  When the Elders finally return to him  they single him out with a special Assignment  the most special of all the Assignments  he will be the new Receiver  Now  he meets with the Giver who relates memories of the past to Jonas  Slowly  Jonas learns of the emotions and choices that his Community has forfeited for Sameness  He learns of love and pain  coldness and warmth  This new knowledge reveals horrifying aspects of Jonas  life and when Jonas is faced with a life or death decision  he must make one that will ultimately affect the entire Community  I love  love  love this book  It is one of my most favorite young adult literature books because it tends to keep teaching  no matter the age of the reader  Its dystopic setting acts as a forewarning of the problems we see today  sameness vs individuality  love vs  pain  control vs  choice  Lowry s writing is clear and precise  yet provides a sort of lyrical insight to this bleak world  While the book is written in language that is easily read by children as young as 4th grade  it deals with difficult topics ranging from lethal injection  sexual repression  and total government control  It should be used with students in junior high but can easily be used in high schools as well because of the difficult issues it addresses   I so enjoy The Giver  I was never interested in it when I was a kid  likely due to the old man on the cover  I also confused it a lot with The Hobbit which really didn t interest me at the time  How wrong I was  I recently read Gathering Blue  the second book in the Giver Quartet  but I realized I had forgotten what happened to Jonas in the first book  While the two books don t connect in characters  that I can find   they do overlap worlds  I m hoping the other two books in the series will shed more light on how this society was created  One thing I had not noticed before is the magic of the memory transfer both from Giver to Receiver and then the lost Receivers back into the community  If not for that aspect  the book would seem like a potential post apocalyptic scenario  But  like the talents of the young adults in Gathering Blue  the memory transfer component lends the story of feeling of magical mystery     It was not a rule  but was considered rude to call attention to things that were unsettling or different about individuals    I feel sorry for anyone who is in a place where he feels strange and stupid   book  to me  is almost sacrosanct  such an individual and private thing   There was never any comfortable way to mention or discuss one s successes without breaking the rule against bragging   Jonas was glad that he had  over the years  chosen to do his hours in a variety of places so that he could experience the differences    He rarely dreamed  Sometimes he awoke with a feeling of fragments afloat in his sleep  but he couldn t seem to grasp them and put them together into something worthy of telling at the ritual   If you don t fit in  you can apply for Elsewhere and be released    But today we honor your differences  They have determined your futures    He didn t have it  the whatever she had said  He didn t know what it was    I m starving   Inmediately he had been taken aside for a brief private lesson in language precision   But the reason for precision of language was to ensure that unintentional lies were never uttered  Ask someone  some adult  his father perhaps   Do you lie   But he would have no way of knowing if the answer he received were true  Jonas frowned   I wish we had those things  still  Just now and then   The old man smiled   So do I    he said   But that choiceis not ours    But sir   Jonas suggested   since you have so much power   The man corrected him   Honor   he said firmly   I have great honor    How could you describe a sled without describing a hill and a snow to someone who had never felt height or wind or that feathery  magical cold   What words could you use which would give another the experience of sunshine    But you don t have to give me the memory   It s your memory now  It s not mine to experience any longer  I gave it away    how to explain this  Once   back in the time of the memories  everything had a shape and like  the way many things still do  but they also had a quality called color    There was a time  actually you ll see this in the memories later  when flesh was many different colors  That was before we went to Sameness  Jonas wasn t interested  just then  in wisdom  It was the colors that fascinated him  Our people made that choice  the choice of Sameness  Before my time  before the previous time  back and back  and back  We relinquished color when we relinquished sunshine   He thought for a moment   We gained control of many things  But we had to let go of others   If everything s the same  then there aren t any choices  I want to wake up in the morning and decide things   I know it s not important  what you wear  It doesn t matter  But  It s the choosing that s important  isn it   The Giver asked him   Oh  I see what you mean  It wouldn t matter for a newchild s toy  But later it does matter  doesn t it  We don t dare to let people make choices of their own    Or what if   he went on  almost laughing at the absurdity   they chose their own jobs   Frightening  isn t it   The giver said   He found that he was often angry  now  irrationally angry at his groupmates  that they were satisfied with their lives which had none of the vibrance his own was taking on  And he was angry  that he could not change that for them   The giver had encouraged all of his questions  not seeming yo be embarrassed or offended by even the most personal  Books are forbidden to citizens  You and I are the only ones with access to books   Didn t life consist of the things you did each day    But they don t want to change  Life here is so orderly  so predictable so painless  It s what they ve chosen   Reading  That s it  The giver shook his head  Your instructors are well trained  They know their scientific facts  Everyone is well trained for his job   It s just that   without the memories it s all meaningless    Things could be different  I don t know how  but there must be some way for things to be different  There could be colors   If you were to be lost in the river  Jonas  your memories would not be lost with you  Memories are forever    They know nothing  You said that to me once before    I said it because it s the true  It s the way they live  It0s the life that was created for them  The worst part of holding the memories is no the pain  It0s the loneliness of it  Memories need to be shared   The life where nothing was ever unexpected  Or inconvenient  Or unusual  The life without color  pain  or past   He had forgotten the fear of the searchers  who seemed to have diminished into the past  But now there were new fears  the unfamiliar landscape held hidden  unknown perils   After a life of Sameness and predictability  he was awed by the surprises that lay beyond each curve of the road   he had never felt such simple moments of exquisite happiness   If he had stayed  he would have starved in other ways  He would have lived a life hungry for feelings  for color  for love   But there was no purpose in if onlys  Dystopia  call it whatever you like but it something you undoubtedly want to read  Thought the story is a heavy on your shoulders   it would also be the best to say that it has it light moments to  What I like about  The Giver  is that it doesn t drag  I think it weighs down nicely  It has a sense of Tragedy  Comedy Romance and action all in one  I think that this is a great book recommendation for someone whom is very curious I think the characters  to put it very lightly  are clueless  they do not understand whats going on  I think the unavailing of jonas as a character through out the book is very mature as he understands more  I think that the bond between Grabiel and Jonas is one that cannot be broken  I think that when Jonas finds the meaning of  love  he starts to understand it and it hits him  I think this book lacks attention to the female role  It doesn t really focus on the hardships of a Birthing Mothers or just Mothers its a little weak for my taste  Though obviously the main character is a boy so things must have been put into his perspective Even though all the characters life s in the book seem very boring  I actually find their live tragic  They have no speech and no freedom of thought  This is something that can be described as  tragic  as more than boring  You may think that not seeing colors is  boring  but if you think about its more tragic that boring  Life without color means no feeling and no feeling is tragedy  I recommend this book for all as it is fairly well rounded  especially light readers as its not worded difficultly  I think this book may inflict pain or possibly make you cry as Jonas does a very good role in this book understanding the meaning of  love and friendship  Even so I would recommend this book whole heartedly  This is a very good discussion book group book  I enjoyed it very much and wish I had finished the series   I love how mysterious this book is  You feel like you understand everything and then something else is explained in a new way  It shows a new interpretation of the world today  Warning  This is a review on the book and the movie I really don t want to say too much about The Giver because to me I already knew everyone loved it and that it is a classic and thats all I needed to know  I truly believe that if you don t know what it s about then it will be more fun for you to go into it blind  I flew threw this book I loved all the characters my favorite would have to be the giver himself and also Jonas of course  All of them thew are vary amazing characters even if we don t see Asher and Fiona as much in the book as we do in the movie I still loved them in the book just as much  I liked Asher more in the book because in the movie they had changed him a little in the book he is just the happy funny friend that we all need  While in the movie he is that but he also starts to follow the rules and stops being with Fiona and Jonas as much as he was in the book  Fiona was also different in the fact that she wasn t as close to Jonas in the book as she was in the movie but that also is because they are only twelve in the book where as in the movie they are around eighteen  I thought it was so cute that Jonas had a crush on Fiona I also liked the fact that they started to fall in love in the movie instead of just Jonas having dreams about her I didn t know that Jonas could never come back after he left the community I thought all he had to do is go so far cross some wall or something and then go back but it seems that if he leaves the memories will just start going back to the community and if he goes back they go back to him  Which would suck I mean I know that he has Gabe and that there are three more books that might resolve that but I just didn t like the idea that a almost thirteen year old boy and an almost two year old are all alone in the wild with no way of going back to other humans  Over all I loved both the book and movie the same but for different reasons  Even thew the movie changed some things they still stuck with the plot and the characters they kept the most important scenes  But to me the movie was fairly faithful to the book and the book was amazing as i said  I loved both of them the same  Dystopian teen fiction is pretty hot right now  with blockbusters like  The Hunger Games  and  Divergent   But the grandaddy of them all was  The Giver  And long before it became chic  Lois Lowry produced a hauntingly memorable story set in a world where emotions are suppressed  and only  The Giver  has the power to change it  It s a powerful little story    whether read alone or with the three loose sequels    with haunting prose and some very strong characters  as well as a message of compassion and acceptance A young boy named Jonas lives in a rigid  joyless community where people use emotion deprivation pills and adhere to insanely strict rules    they have no conflict  poverty or discrimination    but they also have no love  no fun  and no creativity  When Jonas is selected as the Receiver of Memories  he is suddenly flooded with feelings and memories of both the good and the bad from humanity s distant past And as he comes to realize what his people have lost in their quest to be the same  Jonas begins yearning for the world he knows must exist outside the Community  But his quest becomes a more personal one when he discovers another price for the Community s existence  the  release  of babies that they don t deem good enough  The only one who can change the Community is Jonas Pretty much all young adult dystopian fiction owes a debt to the Giver Quartet    it has young people discovering the cruelty and callousness of their societies  and finding different ways to rebel  But Lowry doesn t shy away from asking the serious questions in her story  such as lack of respect for life  if it s inconvenient or doesn t fit in   kindness  compassion  and the good AND bad roots of what it means to truly live Lowry s writing is simple but poetic  winding through with some quietly eloquent language   Behind him  across vast distances of space and time  from the place he had left  he thought he heard music too    And she fills the story not with bombast and battle  but with tragedy and quiet triumph    and while we can see that Jonas  actions will have shattering effects  his rebellion against his cold  sterile society is an oddly quiet one And as this book is the quiet grandfather of current dystopian fiction  Jonas is the quiet ancestor of the Katniss Everdeens of today    he s an innocent young boy who discovers what being really alive is about  and the joys and horrors that come with it  He s not an action hero  but an everyman    well  everyBOY hero  struggling with the complex questions of what he should do to make his world  right  again It s also worth noting that while  The Giver  is part of a loose knit series  it can be appreciated as a standalone novel  However  the ambiguous ending is less ambiguous with the sequels that came some years later  which explain what happened to Jonas and Gabe    which was rather controversial  since it  ruined  the ending that fans had decided was the real one  The Giver  is a powerful  haunting little novel  like a quiet song that resonates powerfully in your memory    and conveys some powerful lessons about human nature and compassion  A true and deserving classic  I love this book  At first  I thought it would be too much like Matched  but it s not  This book is much more in depth then Matched  I love how the author describes Jonas  true beliefs so that the reader can actually understand why he is fooled by the Capitol Society Council whatever it s called  The big turning point in the book for me  when I really started loving it  was when Jonas and the Giver are talking about how dangerous it is to choose  Because of that  I finally realized why people would even think to go along with the Capitol Society Council whatever it s called  Somehow  I missed this reason in every one of the many sci fi books I ve read  I think the theme of this book is learning and truth  The Giver teaches Jonas not just about memories  but life too  He teaches Jonas the truth about the Capitol Society Council whatever it s called  He shows Jonas what really happens to people who are released  He shows Jonas what life was like before Sameness  Slowly  Jonas realizes that the life he s been living was a lie  I think that he will start to teach Gabe  Soon  the whole community will see learn the truth  I think that what the author  Lois Lowry   is trying to say with this theme is that everyone deserves the truth  and that one person  namely the Giver  shouldn t have to bear them all   Oh wow  What a terrific yet sad and shocking book  It was deeply moving and I wish I could have read and discussed it at school  Social criticism at it s best   Jonas can t wait until he turns twelve so he can be given his assignment in society  He waits patiently in his seat as the names are called before him  and he sits disturbed when his name is skipped  Worried there may be a mistake Jonas tries to think of any reason he wouldn t move on with the twelves   Then  his name is called  Jonas is being given the honor of being a Receiver  This is a job that only one member of society can have  only one and Jonas was going to be the current Receivers replacement as he was getting very old  Jonas realizes the amount of responsibility he will have as the Receiver after his first meeting with his mentor  He cannot tell anyone of the events that occur during his training  he has permission to lie  and he will no longer be like any other member of society  For 12 year old Jonas  this is a lot to accept The Giver  Jonas s mentor  begins training Jonas by talking to him about his visions  Jonas would look at things and see them differently  they were still the same object  just different somehow  The Giver explained that these visions are what makes Jonas a prime candidate for being a Receiver  Jonas experiences pain  wonder  and many other amazing experiences as the apprentice of the Giver  However  Jonas has a hard time with not sharing the discoveries of his training with others and wonders why he shouldn t be able to share  It is this delima that drives the book The Giver  why should the world remain as it is  The Giver is a book that makes you think  Do not read this book lightly  it will change your perspective on life  love  beauty  and perception   Wonderful book  but not for people under the age of 9  or 8  depending on what parents allow  due to slightly chilling moments  The first time I read The Giver  I found myself bored  Maybe because the novel is quite depressing and that my younger self can t tolerate such books before  But now  I realized that the Giver is truly a masterpiece and that it s one of my most favorite books of all time To start off  The Giver isn t flawless  There are some things that aren t explained clearly and some questions like why people in Jonas  world can t see colors  music and have no feelings  I mean  it doesn t made sense  for people to give up something so significant in everyday life  To give up colors  feelings and love doesn t make sense in a world where you were born with all those things  And the Sameness  where everything is created to be the same  is not explained how and why it occurred  But I always wanted to think that The Giver is not for that purpose  The Giver is for everyone to realize how it is to have no such things  It is for everyone who wanted to feel hope in a world where everything is dull and gray without so much as a burst of color  quite literally  and where people live a life of predictability and too much ignorance I m giving it five stars because on the way it made me feel  I feel sympathy and love and pity for the characters and I realize how important the unpredictability of life is to keep us going and taking new risks  There s only a few books that can be life changing  and The Giver is one of them  I loved this book  even though I m not a fan of scientific fiction genre  because it was very interesting to read  It is set in a society which is at first shown as a utopian society  where everything is the same  but gradually appears more and more dystopian  The novel is about a boy named Jonas through the twelfth and thirteenth years of his life  Jonas is selected to inherit the position of Receiver of Memory  the person who stores all the past memories of the time before Sameness era  the position is for wise people to help the community make decisions  if needed  Jonas learns the truth about his dystopian society and that sameness is not that good for a society  I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read about the future with a bit of thriller in the plot  An amazing fore telling of how the future may go ive read it many times  And I will Read it again  It will always hold a spot on my shelf   If you are a lover of the dystopian genre  you should definitely read this  I ve read this book multiple times ever since I first came across it  and everytime I find more and more reasons to like it  It s a very fast  short novel  but it does not leave me wanting more  I remember the first time I read this  I hated how it ended  But the more I ve reread this  the more I appreciate and welcome the ending  I think it fits the book perfectly The book starts off with Jonas being nervous about turning 12  When you turn 12 in this community  your role is chosen for you  Jonas is nervous  no  apprehensive about turning 12 because even he is unsure of what his role might be  Sometimes you have an idea  his father knew what he might get and was not surprised  The community elders study the children for years  watch their habits  their school work  to determine their future and they ve never been wrong  Jonas knows they won t get it wrong for him  but when his time to find out is to come his name is not called During this part of the book  omg  my heart is racing  did they skip him  They skipped him  What  Even though I ve read this book plenty  I am still always right there with Jonas feeling what he s feeling during his ceremony  view spoiler  Jonas is picked to be the receiver of memories  a very honorable position  yet he is so anxious and unsure  He wants to shout out that they chose wrong  he does not want to feel the pain that this honor bestows upon him  He can t possibly  see beyond   No  no no no no  The elders are never wrong  could they possibly be wrong this time Jonas is a wonderful receiver though  and the Giver and him have a very heartfelt  loving relationship  Jonas at one point in the book asks his parents if they love him and they laugh at him   You  of all people  Precision of language  please   and go on to tell him how love is an obsolete word  do they enjoy him  Yes  Do they feel pride for him  Yes  But do they feel love for him  Ha  No  it s meaningless Being released is a reoccurring theme throughout this  when one is released they go to Elsewhere  No one knows where or what Elsewhere is  but it is a time of joy and celebration  unless you ve been released to Elsewhere for bad behaviour which does not happen very often    hide spoiler  My favourite line in the book is this one   Was there someone there  waiting  who would receive the tiny new released twin  Would it grow Elsewhere  not knowing  ever  that in this community lived a being who looked exactly the same   because Jonas finally starts to question his community and what is going on around him  and how everyone just accepts it without question   First things first  this book is completely unique and awesome  and I m giving it 5 stars  It took me to an entirely different world  in the first twenty pages I thought it was a natural and common community they are living in  but when I encountered certain terms  I knew that I m not reading an ordinary book awesome terms I ve encountered while reading the book Committee of the elders  House of the old  Sameness  the numbers that I think became vitals for the story  threes  sixes  sevens and so on and so for  The Matchings  the Naming  the committee of twelve  and any other numbers  Hall of open records  hall of the closed records  the receiver  the Release and my most favorite word the ELSEWHEREso if you want to know what those words mean you better start reading the book This has a completely different story  at first it has kind of a utopian theme which the society was described as impeccable and thengradually turned out to be more Dystopian  This book gave me shiver knowing that you couldn t exactly predict what s gonna happen next  because each chapter has a twist on it especially on chapter 20  the confession of the giver really shocked me  I meant a massive black hole started to form inside me because I was really drifted away reading that part  And I was like gush  I was so dumb not to notice it but I have the slightest feeling that it was her  If you don t want to be left in daze with my review  might as well read this book  I don t wanna spoil anything  all I couldn t say is this book is awesome  this one deserves 5 stars  and I am now moving reading the next installment  The Giver  written by Lois Lowry in 1993 is a young adult novel about a young boy called Jonas who lives in a dystopia  In this world everything is controlled by the government  your family  what you eat  when you eat  and how you feel  At the age of 12 every child is assigned a job which is chosen by a counsel depending on your abilities  Jonas  the protagonist discovers that he has special abilities  unlike the rest of the community he is able to see color and feel emotions  Because of his characteristic  he revives the job of the receiver  The receiver is the most honorable job in the entire community  The job of the receiver is to obtain memories from the past from the giver  This job is though of as very dangerous because  a lot of the receivers have died from emotional trauma  After the receiver s training is complete their job is to help the government make decisions based on the effects they had in the past I enjoyed reading this book because it made me feel sorry for the characters  Lois Lowry did an excellent job at connecting the reader with the characters  As the story progress you can notice change in some characters personalities  Throughout this book you will compare and contrast Jonas  world to our modern society  I would highly recommend this book if you are between the ages of 11 15 and enjoy reading about different environments and comparing them to your own  Just one word  AMAZING  I finished this book within a few days  This barely happens when I read a book  And i know  it was short but I still couldn t put it down easily  I was fascinated by this world  How it was build up and organized  These people don t have any emotions  they can t see any colors and have to live by strict rules  Their entire life gets chosen for them and they can t decide anything  I couldn t live like that  Well  if I grew up there maybe I could but that s because I wouldn t know anything else  And that s the problem  These people don t know anything else  All of them  except for the giver  He has to carry all the memories of the entire world  I can t imagine how hard that must be  I thought  it was very well written  And the pace was okay too  even though it went a little bit fast at the end of the book  Having said that  let s talk about the ending  I m still trying to figure out what actually happened  And I will be trying the whole night to figure it out  Did he die  Did he find civilisation  Or was this just a dream  I think we will never really know what happened  It s an open end and I guess we just have to go with it    As good  if not better  than I rememberAs good  if not better  than I rememberI first read this book as a kid and it changed my life  and now reading it 13 years since  I understand why this book was so important  It s light preparation for reality  a commentary on values  and a questioning of the concept of uniformity and sameness  It was through this book that I understood the value of words and stories and shared experience  I hope to read this one day again to my future children  A utopia or a dystopia  You decide  The author creates a very convincing world  For a younger reader  under 18  this would be quite mind expanding  It was for me also  The end was a bit rushed but otherwise a very significant book  4 5 It started out a bit dull  But when the story began  I couldn t put the book down  This book taught me that you can t build a perfect community  it showed me what would happen if the community sought for perfection You can t diminish the bad sides of life without affecting it in another way  because life is a balance between the good and the bad  It made me love today and tomorrow with all their sunshines and storms I like how the author didn t even use the word  death  until the end  It proves the fact that they really didn t know anything about pain  The way she described pain in the memories   It hurt My favorite part   Although he had through the memories learned about pain of loss and loneliness now he gained too  an understanding of solitude and it s joy   I loved this book  Love  love  loved this book  Before it was assigned for my class   Social Justice in Children s Literature    I swore I would never read any Lois Lowry  her work never appealed to me  This is one instance where I am insanely happy to have been proven wrong  I was absolutely mesmerized by the story of Jonas  and found find myself thinking about it often  There is a lot of food for thought here  and although it is classified as a juvenile young adult book  it would provide a lot of material for an adult book discussion group  Add this to your  To read  shelf  Go find this book immediately  Wonderful book and banned in many libraries for some reason  The Giver was a great book in my opinion  I really loved the society in which these people are living in  although I would HATE that society if we had it  and I think this book really made me start to appreciate color more  I mean  they don t have color  AT ALL  Everything is the same there  Also  this book was a light read  which was perfect  and it was also very suspenseful  with touches of grief  sadness  joy  laughter  and longing for someone to love them  I really loved having Gabe as a character too  as it was nice for Jonas to have a companion on his journey  and also  Gabe is a really cute toddler in my opinion  So yeah  I thought it was an awesome book  that was written wonderfully  It was a pleasure to read this book  I wish we had this instead of The Pearl  It was a simple tale about being human and also humanity  There was a lot of depthness and the ease of its language  But above all  the story is possibly the most compelling read that question its dystopian and utopian qualities  Its about a child who realized that the adults lied about everything and through the story  this child began to appreciate the world through an enlightened gaze and renewed awareness  This is part of 3rd quarter reading    This was a class novel I really enjoyed reading the Giver  It taught me how life is not perfect  It can be close to perfect  Although  I have realized that there is nothing to do in a perfect would since there is nothing to fix The Giver is about a  Community  in an unknown area  The community is strict and is considered a Utopian Society  Jonah is a twelve year old boy living in this Utopian society  At age twelve  Jonah received his assignment of the of receiver of memory  His job was to keep all of the memories of the past in the community  This job gives Jonah access to all of the secrets of the community  These secrets backlash most of the events in the story I would compare this to World War II  Adolf Hitler wanted to have a Utopian society with only the Aryan Race  He did this by destroying everyone who didn t  fit   The nurturers was going to  release  Gabe because he wasn t the correct standards to stay in the community  People ended up finding out and this back lashed chaotic events that ended up not working in the end All in all  I thought the Giver was a great book to read  The life s truths are a great lesson   Book Title  The GiverAuthor  Lois LowryReview  The Giver by Lois Lowry takes place in a community that is based on sameness and ignorance  There is no weather  no colors  no music  no animals  and no nature  The people in this community don t even know what these things are  I liked the book for the erie and dark tone to the book  I found myself sucked into this world of nothingness  Main setting is a community of no color  no music  no animals  and no nature to speek of  The main character of the story is Jonas and the giver who lives in this community  The main conflict is that one day while Jonas was at training  he makes The Giver realize that love and pain caused from memories would improve the community  Jonas had to receive as many memories as he can and then run away from the community so all the memories would return to the people of the community  i would dearly recomend this book to anyone who likes dark and deep feeling books  I swear i felt it on my back  The book is great to all for every reason  The ending still gets me  i will not spoil it  Playlist  Davy Jones Music Box with Rain  in the background The Giver was not as I expected it to to be  At first  I thought that it would turn out as boring and horrible  but I guess that s what I get for judging books by their covers or movies   ___  I know  I m an ass  aren t I  Well  the book turned out to be  REALLY  good  No  it was MORE THAN good  The plot flowed well  in my opinion  and the characters have really shocking secrets  I also thought it was sad too  Maybe it was because of the kind of music I played while reading this  but who knows  Btw  I just found out that for some reason  Goodreads might have not saved my review on this  but I perfectly remember that I have written this review before  and they deleted it  So I am really pissed about it  I wrote a review on this book RIGHT after I finished it                EDIT  8 14 14            Just finished reading The Giver  so this is my second I ve read the book  So  all I have to do is wait until the movie adaptation of it to come out into movie theaters tomorrow  OH GOSH  I CANNOT WAIT TO SEE THE MOVIE  Urrrrgggghhhh    ____  teehee   D Jonas lives in a world where everything is the same  People are all treated the same  everything is the same color  you are given a meal everyday that is the same as everyone else has that day  Jonas enjoys his life  until he meets The Giver  On the day of his 12 celebration Jonas is chosen to be the next Receiver  This comes as a complete surprise to him as he has never really heard of The Receiver and has no idea what he is supposed to do  Turns out that there is a lot he doesn t know about the world that he lives in and he must decide if it is a world he wants to live in   I orignally read The Giver back in 6th or 7th grade  I was pleasantly surprised that I remembered almost nothing about the plot so on this rereading it was as if I were reading it for the first time  My reaing comprehension and recall has most certainly improved in the past 20 years  I really loved this book  It is basically a childrens  introduction to dystopian literature  It explores a lot of very complex themes about freedom of choice and what happens when a society or culture takes those away for the  greater good   I found it very well written and thought provoking and it moved along at just the right pace  My only criticism would be in the final pages  The ending was left open  which doesn t bother me necessarilly  but while most of the novel was pretty well grounded the end seemed lofty and metaphorical which left it feeling a bit rushed and unfinished Recent young adult fiction has been so atrocious it s refreshing to read something for kids that is really worthwhile   I m looking at you  Stephanie Meyer   I m definitely putting this on my kids future reading list  It was amazing  I mark this book as one for young readers  and it is   but at the same time  there are ideas in it that would be very hard for the fifth grader to grasp  Dystopia  Need I say more  It s a good read  about bubble bath in length and level  and thought provoking if you want it to be   The Giver  is a book written by Lois Lowry  It is hard to explain what this story is about because I am also a bit confuse of what is going on  The setting is presented in a utopian society but gradually appears to becoming a dystopian society as the story advance further  It has an open ending  almost as cliffhanger  I just realize that there are actually four books of  The Giver    I believe the themes for this book is  Control  and  Escape   I would recommend this book to anyone that is interest in the Utopias and Dystopias genre  and have a higher reading level  The reason I recommend that way because the concept of this book seems really easy to get  but the truth is it s harder to grasp the meaning of that concept  This book needs further analyze from me   The Giver takes place in a community that is based on sameness and ignorance  There is no weather  no colors  no music  no animals  and no nature  The people in this community don t even know what these things are  We are immediately introduced to Jonas and his family and we are also given a rundown on the community s rules and traditions One day while Jonas is at training he makes The Giver realize that love and pain caused from memories would improve the community  This is the day that The Giver and Jonas make the plan  Jonas is to receive as many memories as he can and then run away from the community so all these memories will return to the people of the community  Jonas escapes from the community and travels many days on his bike  Just when he reaches a point of physical exhaustion and starvation  he hears music and singing from a place ahead of him  This gives him a new hope  Jonas also thinks he hears music coming from a place behind him  He thinks the memory of music was given back to the community that he left behind  I don t think this book has been made into a movie yet  if it has  I have never seen it  and if it hasn t then I strongly believe it should  I recommend this book to everybody all shapes and sizes   Wow  What a great tale  I don t know if it was the fact that I watched the film first  2014  or not that I liked a few of the differences relating to the movie a bit better than those of the book  Regardless  this story is a must read  For all ages  It shows the significance of change and differences between individuals  That feelings  emotions  and virtues are important  And while such change comes with a price or consequence  life happens  There is no dull numbness  But joy and happiness  as well as anger  grief and suffering  They all play a part in the story of life  This book definitely had me riding on an emotional roller coaster  From anger  to sadness to hope this book was all around amazing  I really believe this book has given me a new look on the  normal  things surrounding me every day and how precious and worthy they are of our time and perception  I was so against this book for the first 5 or 6 chapters  but I finally began to realize that things were going to change for the better  I was finally able to grasp the full concept of the book between the new society and memories  The title began to make sense also as I read more and more  After reading the first 13 chapters I was literally on a race to finish this book and to see what Jonas  fate was to be   This book really made me think and truthfully it changed the way I see the things around me  There is a fine beauty in everything you see  I would definitely recommend this book to everyone no matter the age  gender or even customs beliefs  because overall it really invokes a strong message deep inside you   The Giver by Lois Lowry is an intimate and gripping story that will change the way that you think  It s wonderful depictions allow you to sink into the tale  making you feel as though you are experiencing the story for yourself  The book also plays on the reader s feelings  inviting them to know and love the characters as though they were friends with them in real life  Jonas  community is perfect  No pain  no fear  no grief  Yet  there is something missing  Jonas  community cannot see colors  and they have no real feelings  Family and friends do not love each other  and they can t comprehend why something like pain or love or even joy would ever be needed in life  Suddenly  everything changes  At Jonas  twelfth birthday ceremony  he is called to be the next Giver  He will hold the feelings of his generation and many generations before him alone  not able to share his burden with anyone until the next Giver is called many years in the future  Poor Jonas starts to wonder if it is really right to have the memories suppressed from the citizens  Finally  he and the current Giver make a choice and a plan that will affect their community forever This amazing story of a boy who simply wants to have a real family appeals to readers ages 12 and up  It uses a wonderful vocabulary and hides thoughtful and deep ideas between its pages  I feel confident that you will never forget this book and that it will make a positive impact on your everyday life  When Jonas turns twelve  he becomes the Receiver of Memory of his community  Nobody else has any memories so they will not suffer any pain  They also don t have grandparents  colors  or even love  One evening  when Jonas watches a private Ceremony of Release  his father kills a newborn child  The next day  his father says that in the morning  he would release the toddler who stayed with them for a couple of days  which is Gabriel  Overnight  Jonas saves Gabriel by escaping to a community with grandparents  colors  memories  and love  I read the book and saw the movie too  I thought the movie was better because it gave me a clearer picture of why Jonas couldn t go back home after he escaped  In the story  there were no feelings  no choices  and everything was the same  When Jonas becomes the Receiver of Memory  he learns about everything that makes us human  pain  happiness  worry  love  etc  He also sees more colors instead of just black and white  He even starts making his own decisions   The Giver  is a great book and can teach readers a valuable lesson about our everyday lives  I think this is a really important book  It provokes many thoughts and feelings in relation to both the world that is presented to us in the story  and our own world  as well  I  often  have felt  especially in terms of expanding consciousness  a lot of the emotions that were triggered in Jonas from the memories  the community s rules and drives  and the unknown blindness and ignorance of everyone else  and I think these are themselves transferred and given to the reader through language  including gratefulness for what we do have  and frustration and eye opening awareness at all of the things many in our world today haven t questioned  that once noticed cannot be just set aside again  like the need for control and security  to the point of lies  corruption and shallow lives  for example   I think this book should be read and understood by as many people as possible  for the sake of moving humanity forward in Love   Review featured on wwww evolvingthread com  Chilling  thought provoking  and skillfully crafted  Jonah lives in a world free from discomfort  pain

up  with the exception of emotionally mature late elementary students who have fellow readers to discuss and analyze this book with   This book opens  as many dystopian books do  with a seemingly utopian society  We follow a little boy names Jonas who is about to become a  Twelve  which means he will be given the title of his new job and become an adult so to speak  The society in which Jonas lives appears to be idyllic  there are no wars  no pain or suffering and no body has to think for themselves as every important detail is decided for them by The Elders  It is referred to as  Sameness  When Jonas is selected to take on the roll of  The Reciever  of memory   he is both startled and afraid  it is a great honour and responsibilty  During his training he meets daily with  The Giver  a kind but troubled old man who intends to pass down all of his memories from the past and some of them are quite terrible  Through recieving the memories Jonas begins to change  he experiences things not experienced while living in the  Sameness  such as seeing colours and feeling sadness This book was an interesting look at not only the dystopian society from the novel but a look at society today  It makes you question how far you would go to create the  perfect  life  Is giving up all feelings in order to not experience pain or hunger really worth it Watching Jonas  realisation was both beautiful and sad  I wanted only good things to happen to him and  The Giver  who both seemed so burdened by the memories of the past  It made me realise how beautiful the world is and how in order to experience the good we must also experience the bad I really enjoyed reading this book and I took a lot away from it  it wasn t fast paced but I enjoyed that  This book was a leisurely read and being that it is only 179 pages it wasn t overly long  I did feel a little frustrated at the end but that is only because I wanted to find out more about Jonas and Gabe and their new adventure  I gave this book 5 out of 5 stars and I look forward to checking out the next book in the series   This book was shocking  in a good way  I d say it was amazing  but no  it was above amazing  I can t find the words to describe it  it was just   inconceivably good  I read this back in middle school and all the characters stuck with me through adulthood  I strangely have a love hate relationship with this book  The whole utopia premise sort of freaked me way out  No color  No feelings  And they have to take pills for the Stirrings  Oh  hell no  And Jonas s dad gave me the creeps  even though he didn t know any better  That s their community s policy  Shudder  I would be utterly devastated if I had the knowledge of The Giver  That would drive me insane  and  in return  I would unleash the knowledge on everyone  Take that pain  Take that hurt  Take that fire  THE ENDING     In my heart of hearts  I always thought that sweet  sweet Jonas and baby Gabriel didn t make it  Damn Lois Lowery  She gave us hope and tainted it with the very last words  You are one incredible author  Bless you  Michelle Watson How would I describe snow  or sledding  to someone with absolutely no context for it   That s one of the questions perpetually doing laps in my brain after reading this beautifully harrowing story  There s a picture of me and my dad from Way Back When that s one of my all time favorite pictures of me and my dad  He s pulling me in a bright red saucer shaped sled down a snow covered street in front of the house I lived all of my young life  a mischievous grin on his face while a fully bundled  toddler sized me is clearly going tumbling off said bright red saucer shaped sled  a look that s half joy  half wintry terror frozen on my face So I suppose I d start describing it like that  Lowry does it better  This book is simply stunning  and I found myself simultaneously careening through it and savoring every page  trying to memorize every memory shared  pouring over every aptly written line describing a society rife with pain and darkness too deep to be felt  and yet Lowry lets us traipse along with young Jonas as day after day after day he discovers feeling is ever and always the only way  I was supposed to have read this book in middle school  and survey says I am potentially one of very few happy readers who never did  and when I finished I couldn t stop thinking about how it felt like Lowry could have said more  could have written more  could have let Jonas spend more and more and please MORE time with The Giver  And then I discovered she did  She did write more  There are in fact THREE more books in this little series   Go Go Gadget  Excessive Exclamating  yes  and  Library Hold Requests   And as of yesterday there is now also THIS and I m not going to lie  this week feels more than a little bit like Christmas  Five stars for so much  but especially for making me remember my first time on a sled and the taste of freshly fallen snow on my tongue and how gorgeous it is to live in color    I read this book in the 5th or 6th grade and I still have very vivid images of some of the scenes  It was the book that made me love literature  It was the first  real  book I read and the first book I connected to and could actually see for its literary value  I will never forget the image of snow in this book and how vividly it painted a picture of it for me  It was the first time I was asked to value human life in a way that I never had been before  It was the first time I was asked to think about the way we treat each other in a society and how people act react because of the way they are taught  It was the first time I connected so deeply with pages on a book that wasn t my normal childhood reading and favorite stories  This wasn t a story for me  For the first time  it was IN me  The scene I remember the most wasn t really because of what was happening in it  but rather the way the whole novel came together in one single imagery  one single moment in time  When I read the description of the cabin in the snow and all that it meant  I felt like I was there  like I was a character in the book  The author painted ME in this book and I fell in love  This book changed me  It made me realize the beauty in books  in reading  and in literature   Bittersweet and thought provoking  The Giver was one of my favorite dystopian children novels  The concept and themes were intriguing and the writing was clear and simple  Of what I could tell  Lowry s main arguments were that memories are important and one cannot understand true happiness without true pain  Personally  I was a little disappointed in the ending because I would ve liked a longer and more concrete resolution  however  I realize that Lowry could not have given a better ending unless he developed a whole new thread of thought  making for a messy ending   Wow  I feel quite churned up after reading this story  I needed to escape to a darkened room after reading this story to get my head around what I had just read  Despite its length it kicks quite a punch  They key question to answer is  Would I want to live in a society organised like theirs   To my horror i can t give a definitive answer to that question at the moment  The overriding answer should be  no    but    Given the amount of hits this book has received I can t believe I ve not come across it before  Anyway  this story is about a society that has organised itself as to remove all forms of pain harm  Whether physical or emotional  Everything is geared towards forming an ideal community  I d like to say that everyone has a purpose and is able to belong   but that isn t exactly true for everyone  There are lots of rules in this society including the precision of language to be used  Your role job is society is chosen for you   and with a great deal of care at that  Rules help people to live in community  But   there are trade offs and this is referred to  sameness   Having read a few reviews on goodreads people have strong views with regard to this book  I m not surprised  But wow  There is quite a lot of think about from this story   The man that I named The Giver passed along to the boy knowledge  history  memories  color  pain  laughter  love  and truth  Every time you place a book in the hands of a child  you do the same thing  This is the second time I ve read this book and I love it as much as the first time  maybe more  I have read lots of Dystopians but none of them can rival the exquisite simplicity of The Giver  It s a very refreshing read  a perfect recharge for me to finally start on loving Dystopians once more  I have problems with Dystopians lately   It might be due to the fact that The Giver is one of the first books of its genre  So  it is interesting to see how Dystopians have evolved throughout the years  It was a much simplistic read compared to modern Dystopians  There were not much sub plots  government conspiracies  maybe  a little one  and most importantly  no romance  I love how this book shows that you don t need romance to create depth in a character or to make a story flourish because ultimately  the main focus is the conflict in the world itself  And what a fantastic world that the giver lives in  Imagine a world of black and white and societies living in Sameness where everyone has the same things  same opportunities  same haircut and same everything  The idea of world in black and white is so captivating and one that I have given thought of when I was a kid and watching a black and white movie and truly wandering if the people back then do live in a colourless world   Hey  don t laugh  I was a kid  xD  This book has given rise to the thought and once again I m pondering about a world devoid of colour and what it will feel like  The Giver gave me a glimpse of that feeling The society live with rules as black and white as the world is devoid of colours  The people live in a society where there is a clear line between right and wrong  It s a kind of twisted and crazy world  For one thing  soulmates was assigned instead of being chosen by oneself  Also  there is a role in the society called the childbearer where the chosen women were tasked with  well  bearing child ren   There s also a clear taboo for teenage hormones as we can see from the main character  Jonas who when he developed a feeling for a girl  normal for teenagers  and told his family about it  he was told to take a pill that is going to quench that feeling  It s a very disturbing world indeed  Jonas is a very believable character that suits his years unlike most Dystopians that sometimes manage to overlook their main characters  age and would appear older  wiser or mature than they should be  The ending may bothered a lot of people and I admit that I do felt cheatedbut after some thoughts  I kind of like the ambiguous ending  It gives you things to munch on  All in all  The Giver is a book that every Dystopians lover  or not  should read  It has a great plot  interesting set of characters and captivating world of Dystopia   Science FictionLowry  Lois  The Giver  New York  Houghton Mifflin  1993   Set in a utopia  11 year old Jonas  is not sure how to feel about the upcoming ceremony of 12  The annual ceremony held in December  celebrates the birth of all the children up to the age of 12  This particular ceremony would be a life changing event for all the children of 12  Jonas would be finding out his lifetime career that the Elders chose for him  Jonas  name is skipped and he later finds out he has been selected to be The Receiver of Memory  As Jonas  trains for his destined career  he finds out what kind of place he lives in  This Newberry Award winner and famously banned book will have readers young and old alike wondering what Jonas will do when he finds out his father has been lying to his family unit  ages 11   Jonas had been enlightened by the Giver  The price for Jonas  the newly selected receiver  was a life full of memories from all past not to be shared with anyone else from the community  Only in training with the Giver would he share a companion of common knowledge  With memories came the responsibility to feel things alien to the world his family unit and community knew nothing of  This protected haven knew no suffering  no pain  no love  only sameness  Jonas weighs both worlds and implores the Giver to change the shape of their world  A plan is devised by both and Jonas sets out with Gabe  an infant codemned to die in the community  to find  elsewhere  and awaken his community to the knowledge he possesses  Jonas found love and the weight of it was greater than the sum of all man s fear  The prospect of death  chaos and an end to his community fell short of becoming a viable option  Jonas discovered living life without love wasn t a life worth living  Love was worth the price of it all   One of my all time favorites  I ve reread it half a dozen times and have never grown tired of it  Awesome  awesome book  I absolutely loved  The Giver   Now I m looking forward to the movie  My wife has been wanting me to read  The Giver  for years now  and after reading  Divergent   I had to give it a try  Veronica Roth  author of the Divergent series  said she was inspired by  The Giver  when she was younger and thus wrote a book based on the same aspects  Honestly  I thought  The Giver  was just a little better than  Divergent   not saying that  Divergent  was bad or anything  but couldn t carry the same weight that  The Giver  presented  The description of snow and color and war to someone who s life is so secluded was amazing to read  This was one of those few books that pulled my emotions out of me  I couldn t put the book down  and basically read the book in one sitting  The darkness and the emotionless state of the people in the book is sad when you realize that s very possible in our current culture  Some cultures experience that now  but not us Americans  And then when understanding love and color and life without hindrance  as the main character Jonas discovers  of course you re going to rebel against the  system   I m glad I read this book  and I m intending to read the rest of the series to find out what happens   I didn t really like The Hunger Games  but I thought this was a really good book  They kind of remind me of each other a little bit  Just a bit  But this one s better  It s shorter and I read it really quickly  It s also more interesting  because it has a thought provoking story line  Imagine a society that was really like that    A pill every morning  spouses and jobs already chosen for you  It made me think and I really liked how the whole thing was written  I also enjoyed the style of writing  vivid but not too detailed  Looking forward to the sequel as well  The Giver is one of those books that regularly turns up on the challenged book lists  primarily for material  not found suitable for children   I suspect  though  that it s almost better to read it as a child  after you re old enough to handle things like the deaths of cute little animals on the Discovery channel  but before your mind and your comprehension of suffering have developed to maturity  If you wait till you re in your thirties  you might find yourself in unexpected  explosive tears  Fair warning For the sake of concerned parents who have somehow missed this book  as I did   here s my best non spoilerific attempt at advisory  there s a non gory but very clearly described  and unbelievably appalling  death scene  Jonas also endures a brief but viscerally painful war memory The book is worth reading  however  worthy of its general status as a classic  it s thoroughly human  and the requisite grief is honest in its reinforcement of compassion and value for life  The writing style is deceptively simple  and the narrative short and readable  The apparent utopia and its horrific underpinnings are viewed through the eyes of a sensitive twelve year old boy  and Jonas naturally evokes sympathy  He s so sympathetic  in fact  that it s a surprise to realize  part way through the book  just how much of normative human experience he and his community are missing The tale has its faults  of course  The worldbuilding is so clearly science fiction in mood that the fantasy elements prove a bit startling  Memory transfer  which appears to be an innate magical power  comes out of nowhere  also  Lowry never explains the existence of a sky with no sun  These and other such were niggling details  but though they worked against the suspension of disbelief  they could not destroy it in light of the convincing characters and the all too believable inhumanity Thomas More s Utopia had an obvious influence on the structure of Jonas  community  family size regulations  carefully assigned work  schedules with little to no room for spontanaeity  As with More s work  the society starts off sounding like a good idea  creepier  less human practices show up over time  Unlike its predecessor  however  The Giver portrays a couple of the resulting situations in unsoftened  stomach turning horror  intimate and devastating  Its picture of affectionate compassion and pragmatic murder juxtaposed in the same person works as a fierce indictment of numerous attitudes and practices in modern society The ending is somewhat ambiguous  though the author has apparently made reference to the characters  fate in other tales of Jonas  world  The book stands alone well enough  however  and offers hope despite its horrors and uncertainties  a hope centered in the redemptive character of Jonas  Like many a child protagonist  he sees the world with an innocent clarity  a striking purity of heart  The very hopefulness of his closing dreams and of his selfless bravery are the sort of thing that can stand between the human person and inhumanity  Jonas is an average kid born and raised in a  Utopia   When you become a twelve or twelve years old in this utopia  you get assigned your assignment or job  It was the the year when Jonas would become a twelve  In December each year  the children become an age higher  like their birthdays   but they all have their birthdays at the same time  in December  When the day came  Jonas was excited about what his assignment would be  He was assigned the job to be the R O M   receiver of memory  He was shocked  he goes through training for his job to meet The Giver or the old R O M   In training for the R O M   there are memories of pain and anguish  If you want to know more  READ THE BOOK I think that the ability to love being thrown out is an injustice in this story  Instead people are assigned a partner  and not even to love  You get assigned a partner to help you with your child  which isn t even yours biologically  This problem in the story wasn t fixed  Instead the community gives people pills to stop feelings for others or known as stirrings  Jonas quits taking the pills and starts to like a girl named Fiona  It affects Jonas because he just wants Fiona  In the end Jonas runs away from the community because he doesn t like the utopia and one of the reasons is he couldnt love Fiona like he wanted to  I would recommend this book to all people with  like me  a good sense of right and wrong  There is a lot of justice injustice in this book  There are parts where I yelled at the book because something  in my opinion  was very wrong  I noticed how bad a  utopia  could be  If you have a good sense of right and wrong  I hope you have a nice and entertaining read  The last time I read The Giver  it was required reading for my seventh grade English class  We all read it together  taking turns out loud and doing the required packet of questions  The last paper we wrote was our version of the ending  did we think Jonas and Gabe make it or not  What did we think happened to the community after they had left  What had happened to the Giver I chose to listen to this as an audiobook and I absolutely loved the narrator  The voices were perfect  the music was perfect  the emphasis was perfect  I enjoyed every second of it  While listening to it  I wanted to watch the movie that came out last year  I just had to see how they interpreted the book and what they chose to do with the movie All in all  I think the book translated excellently into the movie  I know this probably makes me in the minority on my opinion  but I thought it was beautifully done  Jeff Bridges killed it as The Giver The book itself is an eerie commentary of a dystopian future  and I actually think quite a bit more chilling than say The Hunger Games  The Hunger Games was horrifying for the act of child murder and violence  but The Giver is far more cruel with a white washed world where emotions and feelings don t exist  where order and structure exist in such a way to give order to a person s life before they even exist  to choose their birth mother  decide their career  take away love and sexuality and intimacy and reducing it to plastered smiles and  precision of language    I think everyone should give The Giver a chance  Review of Lois Lowry s novel The Giver Jonas was an eleven year old boy who lived in a futuristic society that had eliminated all pain  fear  war  and hatred  Everyone looked and acted the same  and they were controlled by  The Elders   At age twelve  every member of The Community was assigned a job  based on their abilities and interests  Jonas had been selected to be The Receiver of Memory  and there he met a wise old man who delivered memories from the past to Jonas  who was called  The Giver  I found this book very interesting to read  and I had numerous favorite parts  One of my favorite parts of this novel was when The Giver delivered the memories from the past to Jonas   Beyond  through the swirl of what he now  somehow  perceived was the thing the old man had spoken of  snow he could look out and down a great distance  81   The Giver transmitted memories to Jonas by placing his hands on Jonas s bare back  and the first memory he received was about snow  and a sled ride  While I was reading this part  I really liked how The Giver could give his past memories to Jonas  who didn t know about anything  In their society  people didn t know anything about their past  such as the memories of pleasure and pain  I hoped that Jonas could deliver the memories that he got from Giver to other people in his society  There are other books that are similar to this novel  The setting in a futuristic society is also found in Veronica Roth s novel Divergent  The themes in both books connect with each other  because they both relate to the importance of individuality and doing what is right for yourself  that was limited in both societies  Also  the protagonists Beatrice and Jonas had similarities  Beatrice left her home faction  Abnegation for going to Dauntless  because she felt like she belonged more in Dauntless  Similarly  Jonas left The Community when he realizes how wrong his society was  He leaves with Gabriel and go on to Elsewhere  where Jonas could experience new things that The Community didn t have  Jonas and Beatrice both needed to get out of their  safe zones   to experience the outside world and start a new life  Finally  I would give The Giver 5 out of 5  I believe that this novel was written for everyone that likes to read dystopian novels  I would strongly recommend this book to them  and would like to read the rest of the series  I liked The Giver very much  I would recommend this book to friends  I would like to watch the movie  I was a late in reading The Giver  Honestly  I had never heard of it until last year  I have read all the popular dystopian fare offered currently  and I like the genre  It was refreshing to read The Giver being a stand alone book    the recent offerings are written as series  After reading The Giver I see more is not always better  This book was beautifully sparse  which makes it no less powerful  perhaps strengthens it  A test of a good book to me is its staying power after I read it  This has staying power  I won t spoil it  but once done it makes you think and fuels the fire for the need to discuss  Lowry was able to write an engaging book without the need for over the top action  As her character  Jonas  evolves  the reader is able to connect with him and evolve as well  The book for me was a contradiction in that it was simply and eloquently told  but its overall story is sitting heavy in my heart   This is a story you will still be thinking about years later  I listened to this book on audio about 6 years ago and recently reread the book with my 8 year old twins  The book is very short  about 170 pages or so  yet it still took us several weeks to finish because we couldn t go more than a chapter without having a long discussion about the many fascinating themes and ideas throughout the book  Maybe it s because the idea of living a life of creativity vs sameness also often means living a life of risk vs relative security really appeals to me  but this book beautifully examines that idea  At the same time it offers an interesting story  too  This isn t a book written in lyrical  flowing prose  It s simplistically written  But the style adds to the ideas and thoughts presented throughout the book and compliments it well  I m looking forward to reading the next three books in this series with my kids in the months to come   De lo mejor en su tipo Una distopia escrita cuando el genero no estaba sobrevalorado  Una historia que mas que decirnos QUE DIABLOS PASO PARA LLEGAR A ESA ESTRUCTURA SOCIAL  nos transmite de la manera mas hermosa y fluida los sentimientos de un nino de 12 anos hacia la vida que le ha tocado  Que les puedo decir Desde el primer capitulo me engancho la manera tan sencilla de la autora para contar la complejidad de la situacion  Tenemos a Jonas un chico de 12 anos cenando con su familia  en un ambiente armonioso  contando sobre su dia y expresando sus preocupaciones  Envidiable eeeh  De pronto  la autora te lleva por un camino agradablemente tortuoso para demostrar que la perfeccion no existe  que requiere mucho sacrificio siquiera acercarse a ella y entonces nuestro protagonista tiene que tomar decisiones acerca de lo que vale la pena salvar  Mi Experiencia  Si quieren mi opinion  el libro acaba justo cuando empieza  A pesar de lo genial que me parecio la historia  tuve una rabieta porque al empezar el segundo libro me di cuenta que no habia mas Jonas  al menos en el principio  y eso me decepciono un poco  Pero no tanto como para restarle estrellas porque la verdad es que literariamente esto para mi fue la perfeccion Es un libro entretenido  corto  la narracion danza en tu mente  las descripciones son justas  a lo largo de la trama te va soltando bombas informativas que te conectan tanto a la historia que te llevan de paseo por distintas emociones y ademas te recuerda el valor  no solo de la vida como tal  sino de la vida que eliges vivir Ese tipo de detalles es lo que busco en un libro  aqui no hubo necesidad de un romance porque todo el amor se presenta en forma de recuerdos y vivencias lo que nos deja en general  un libro que raya en la filosofia y las lecciones de vida  sin caer ni de cerca en la tediosa superacion personal Un libro que no deben dejar de leerBonus  Gabriel     Riveting  Intriguing   Powerful    A Beautiful Read    I Loved It    The book I read over the summer was The Giver  by Lois Lowry  The genre of this book was science fiction  The Giver takes place in a small  community  or town where everyone lives  The main characters of The Giver were  Jonas  the Chief Elder  the leader of the community   and the most important person to know was the Giver  the current receiver of memory  Jonas lives in a freaky world where rules are enforced and no one can make decisions for themselves  Everything is the same  no music  color  love  and no pain  Jonas gets chosen to replace the current Giver When Jonas gets his assignment  in training for the job  he learns things he never knew  the past  how our world is now   what love is  family  and most important  color  The more he discovers and learns  the more he wants to escape  I rate this book a five because it was such an exciting book  I couldn t put it down  loved it  would love to re read it Well I thought that this book is very interesting and I also thought that the ending actually left me hanging in the end  I really wanted to know what was going to happen and I was also thinking of what would happen  My favorite part was when Jonas got his letter and it said that he can lye whenever he wants  I was a little scared of that book because in that culture you are not aloud to lye to people and here people lye a lot  I was also scared because while I was reading The Giver I was thinking that I was there in the book and when The Giver gave Jonas one of his memories and Jonas yelled because it hurt then I also felt something hurt to so that is why I thought that I was in the book with them  I also though that the book was kind of a little weird too because that culture to me is a little bad and I thought that the one who made up the rules in that culture is a little retarded  so that is what I think so byyeeee      p s that book is good so u really should read it     I know u will like and there is a special surprise in it so I know u will like it                                      AMAZING AND ENTERTAINING   I must warn you  though  It does end in a semi cliffhanger   I really don t understand the ending  I want to read the rest of the series though  The book I am reviewing is called The Giver by Lois Lowry  This book is about a boy named Jonas who lives in a Utopia   and there are no mistakes in that society  In that Utopia  every single person your age does the same things and goes through the same things at the same time  But once Jonas becomes Receiver of Memory  he looks at his Utopia differently and everything changes because of what he learns from The Giver and the memories  Jonas discovers new things that are not so fair in his so called Utopia and he will try to find new ways to try to change that I think that when the author Lois Lowry was writing this book  she was trying to make the story have a moral or lesson behind it so that the reader is reading it not only for fun but so that the reader could have a purpose behind reading it  The moral of the story is that nothing is perfect and even in trying to make things perfect  there are bad things that you do to reach that  perfect  in something  and that s how it is in the story  I really like the moral in the story because everyone can relate to it because it deals with life lessons I liked this book a lot because as I said before  the moral of the story is amazing and everyone can relate to it  It is just one of those books where there really isn t anything bad to say about it and there is really really a good purpose in reading the book  I also really seeing all the things that the author thought was a Utopia  I liked seeing the different thoughts that the author had when writing the book and what she thought a Utopia was I would recommend this book to people in grades 6 and up  I wouldn t really recommend it to people younger than that because I tried reading it once in 5th grade and I didn t really understand it so I stopped reading it  But then again I think it was because I only read the beginning which for me is like the most confusing part out of the whole book if you don t keep reading it  Something the reader would have to know before reading the book is that like I said before  if you only read the beginning it will be confusing but if you keep reading it  everything will make a lot more sense  It is only the start of the book that is really confusing  I just have to say that this book is excellent  At the beginning  the author starts off with a rather bland beginning  I think this was in order to explain the story later because the story becomes better and better and you get that feeling that you don t want to stop reading because the suspense is gradually and slowly growing  This book had many things that contrasted from our world which really made this book interesting  This difference made the story exciting to read as it slowly told more things about the society that Jonas tried to change  This story s plot  use of the difference from our world  the suspense  and the conflict was just magnificent  In addition  the change with Jonas was great as he started to feel  feelings  and learning more about his society that I don t really like in many books but the author used the change very nicely  However  the only thing I have to complain is the ending  The think that the ending is for yourself to answer but it left me with too many questions in my head which was kind of disappointing like   What happened to Jonas   Although I had a disappointment about the ending  I greatly enjoyed this book and I certainly think that this book deserves five stars  I read this book at schools this year and I absouluteley fell in love with the character  The world Lois Lowery created was fascinating  Most kids in my class weren t a big fan of all the exposition in the beginning but I loved it  World building is something that I just love to read  It really gives an insight to the authors thinking  Jonas  I loved his innocence and wonder  Fiona  I loved her caringness and lovingness  Asher  I loved his youthful spirit and love of fun This book was amazing for the fact that it is so short  I loved it  This was an incredible book about a boy named Jonas that lives in a community where age is a very critical thing  At the age of 12  anybody living in this community will get their assignment  or job  that they will have for the rest of their life  Up until the age of 12 depending on if your a boy or a girl you will recieve a gift that every kid that age will recieve  After you get your assignment at 12  you don t really need to count your age anymore  Jonas is with all the other kids at the Ceremony Of Twelve  and he is ready to recieve his assignment  but his heart sinks when he realized that they skipped his name   Feeling devistated  he finally hears his name after all the others have had their name called   Jonas  please stand foward  You have not been assigned  You  have been selected   Jonas then finds out that he holds the position of the  reciever of memories   Only one person in this whole community will have the very special assignment  He soon starts to recieve memories from the giver of sights  smells  sounds  that the community must not know  But why can t they know this information and what is he going to do with these terrible and brilliant memories  That you are going to have to read for yourself  I truly loved this book  I thought the author did an exelent job of describing the memories and showing readers what they are missing in everyday life  He made the words dance on the page as I read them  I would reccomend this book to anybody  Especially those who love adventure fiction  In Lois Lowry s  The Giver  she is a critic on certain ideologies that mentioned in the book  Through dialogue and interactions with characters she expresses her disgust for the suppression of individuality  emotion  and what makes us human  The people that are in charge of Jonas s community tried to fill everyone with  sameness   This means that no ones sees color  or race  has no memories of the past  and jobs are chosen for the children  This negative connotation that a person s livelihood should be chosen for them  even if it is for  the good of the community   shows that thinking for oneself is wrong  These government officials are made out to be the villain of the novel  which makes everything they stand for wrong  Furthermore  the harsh tones that the Giver uses and his gruffness as a result of the government and the ideals makes the reader wary of those things  Lowry is also a compassionate mentor as well  She takes the ideas of emotion and individuality and shows the reader how key they are to human nature  When Jonas receives the memories he is filled with wonder and hope  despite some being bad  and therefore receives some of his humanity as well  The bad memories  such as death and war  serve as a reminder that people are going to do evil  but that it s part of our nature to do so  Individual thought is shown to us by Lowry when Jonas learns that the old and weak are euthanized instead of just sent away like he was told  The lesson to the reader is to think for oneself rather than depend on the word of someone  Lowry was able to critic and mentor the reader at the same time  The premise of a rigid and tough political party or figurehead controlling people s individuality and limiting their human nature had been explored before  The Giver   In George Orwell s  1984  he describes a future where a political party takes over and controls every aspect of their subjects lives  This included prohibiting free thought  sex  rebellious thoughts and words  and any sort of individuality  Lowry copies this in her book by eliminating individuality such as  sex  race  biological family  memories of the past  and the ability to chose their own jobs  Both books also have specific programs to limit their people  the Sameness in  The Giver  and Newspeak in  1984   While Orwell s novel shows a group being openly oppressed  Lory s is more subtle and creates a world where the inhabitants think they re in an utopia and do not realize their oppression  This adds a whole new dimension to the book because it leads the main character  Jonas  on a journey to find out what he believes is right and wrong despite what the rest of the people in his community think   Where have I been that I haven t read this book yet  With all the books I read I can t believe I missed this one  WOW what an amazing book  It made me think through the WHOLE book  It is a must read  I will read again soon for sure  Imagine a life without color  happiness  sadness  any feelings actually  or even pain  Just an existence  But then why was this community even doing what they were doing  Remember we chose this mortal life here for all the sorrow and pain to know the good and to have feelings and to have freedom  We need to be thankful for the freedom we have in our everyday simple lives while we live our short life  This story will sound familiar to many who believe in the pre existence and our choice to choose who to follow that day  I honestly love this book to bits  I got the movie for christmas so i read the book and have reread it so many times  It has such a good plot and the idea of it was genius  When books give you a new perspective and leave you wondering about what your life would be like in a different society it leaves me with goosebumps  I wish we learned more about the other characters through out the story but it didn t bother me as much because of the concept of Jonah s society  It s a classic and is a good well developed story and kinda reminds me of Divergent    Amazing  a must read for all agesThe giver is one book that left an imprint on me when I first read it as a child  This time  I am revisiting this wonderful piece of literature for a 5th time  The Giver immerses the reader into a world of sameness without the joy of colors  love  and sunshine  This is a must read for people of all ages  A reminder that the world in not comprised of just us  just now  Anything more that is said would be a disservice to the reader  spoiling what should be experienced first hand through the eyes of a reader   Like everyone else  re read because of the new movie  I remember this being the first book to make me cry and not understanding why I was so sad  Re reading as an adult  I still am left with this overwhelming ache  It is odd that this book is considered  children s lit  when the themes are so dark  I don t think 10 year olds can really grasp the message   Lately  we ve come to a sort of dystopian happy period of writing when The Giver and 1984 being the originals are being compared to these new stories  and it s sad that people don t think they can compare  For the Giver  the society doesn t use public beatings or killings as a way to keep the citizens alive  and that s the most frightening part  The ignorance of what had been  They keep secrets and genetically alter children at birth  keep emotions tapped down by required medication  and allow only one person in their community to know color  fear  and love  That s what s terrifying  They don t know that there is the possibility for something better   It s such a short novel but it packs a powerful punch  The ending seems to be what is highlighted in negative reviews  but being an English Major I m familiar with post modern endings   p I think it adds to the beauty of the novel  You are experiencing what Jonas is   that doubt and frustration and maybe a sliver of hope  I thought it was the perfect ending for this sort of tale  It wasn t one that a  happily ever after  would have fit with   While reading this the second time round  I read it as a teacher  I found it rich with symbolism and literary devices that enriched the tale  It s such a deep complex idea that I think people read too quickly  I think that if people didn t try to read it in one sitting they d absorb all the nuggets of awesome woven in there  Final Word  Just read it  Seriously   I really enjoyed this book  I like story lines where the world is vastly different in the way people are organized in their environments and how they interact in that environment  So when I heard Jeff Bridges promote the film I had to read the book first  I like the special relationship between the boy and the Giver  It s not a theme that is new  you can pull a number of young male   old male relationships out of any classic  Luke   Yoda  Appledore and Harry Potter  etc   but maybe what sets it apart is the agonizing things that the Giver must share with this young boy  As a mother  I can completely relate to this very human experience of sharing or seeing someone else experience pain or sadness  any number of difficult emotions  This made that relationship remarkable  I really found it an astounding statement when they later came to an understanding that sharing pain makes it less difficult because living in a world where people are ignorant of it is nearly impossible  What a wonderful plotline to think on  It was a very easy paced read and I ve already begun Lois Lowry s second book in the quartet  I m intrigued where this one will take me   I adore this simple book  I want to direct the film version of it   it could be brilliant  In a world where sameness has taken away individuality  choice  and even color  Jonas is about to find out truth about his community the cost of the  perfect  life  Jonas is given the job assignment of Receiver  meaning he will receive all the memories that are kept from the community to keep them in order  The story remains relevant over twenty years later and will have readers talking and cheering for Jonas and the choices he makes to free his community from their ignorance I really enjoyed this book and thought the message it relevant  How much control are we willing to give to the government so we can live a comfortable life  This was the ONLY book I read in highschool and I LOVED it  It brought to my attention the importance of our agency and how being ignorant  although may help temporarily to avoid hurt and pain  keeps you from living and experiencing joy  VERY interesting book   thought provoking   Good book   Has good lesson in it  WOW  Talk about leaving me hanging    what a cliff hanger     I just finished this book at 7 30 tonight and had to run to the library before it closed at 8 to get the next book because none of my local book stores have it   thank goodness it was check in lolanyways I now know why so many people have been telling me to read this book   even when I purchased it  which was also challenging trying to find a copy  the lady told me its a good one to have on your book shelf  a classic  and she was 110  right  I recommend this book to any and everyone    it has something for everybody  it kept me guessing  asking questions and on the edge of my seat the entire book  Outstanding writing  I honestly do not understand why it s in the juvenile section though   there were some words in there that I don t think the average 9 12 yr old would understand  let alone me     lol Absolutely amazing book   5 stars from me    can t wait to start book 2  Gathering Blue  starting is right now   I just had to add this since reading this book I still can not stop thinking about it    I seen the movie which in very glad I read the book first  it would have totally ruined the book for me  and although the movie is very different  but also at the same time the movie was more  on the edge of my seat   This book is one of the best  if not the best book I have ever read  I can t believe it s been out so long without me knowing about It  extremely happy I listened to everyone s recommendations this time  thanks   This is one of my favorite books from childhood  I even own an author signed copy somewhere   and this most recent re read was not a disappointment  The community is not dystopian in the sense that it is a terrible place to live  but rather it is a society of limited choice and maximized Sameness There are some heavy ideas presented here  heavy for both children and adults  Big questions are raised  how much should be given up for safety  comfort  and equality  What is the role of euthanasia in a society  What is the value of pain  of knowledge  of love There is a part of me that really would like to know more about this society  How did they come about  What kinds of technology do they use   view spoiler  How does the memory transfer occur  How does memory revert to the community when a memory holder dies leaves    hide spoiler   We are given some hazy outlines of ideas for some of this information  but not all of it  Inquiring minds want to know  I would love more detail about this world  But another part of me is also ok with what is given in this particular book I like it a lot Rating  a heavier PG  for some thematic issues and heavy questions  I really enjoyed the storyline and it really put a perspective on how our society is today in comparison to how the community in the book lived out their lives  It was an interesting take on a world were  sameness  was the standard and everyone had set rules to follow and everything was decided for them  such as their family unit and the job selection they would have to stick with for the rest of their lives  The book also brings about how important memories are and how it plays a very powerful role within this community   I loved the idea The ending was    well  not to my taste  Abrupt is the correct word  There could have been more  I m hoping that there ll be more in the other books that constitute the quartet   The giver is a wonderful work of dystopian fiction  I am surprised I did not read this book earlier  It was hard to put it down and I loved it from start to finish  I especially liked how all ages were represented so it wasn t just like solely living the young boys life    Of course they needed to care  It was the meaning of everything    I read this book for the first time in 6th or 7th grade  I can t remember which  I just remember reading it and loving it That was at least 15 years ago  and I found it on sale at Borders at the beginning of summer  Not knowing where my original copy was  and knowing it had also been destroyed by a red cough drop that melted in my book bag the first time around   I decided to pick it up  The book was actually a better quality  anyway  and I ve learned to appreciate them and not destroy them like I used to  Plus  it was  8  so I figured it was a good investment I read it again in in less than a day  It s a simple read and very addictive  I m pretty sure The Giver should be in everyone s repertoire  It was my introduction to books about utopia  back when I didn t know what utopia  or dystopia  for that matter  was  But I ve always loved books with this theme  which I realized back in 10th grade when I had to read Brave New World I m so happy I decided to sit down and read through it again  There were so many parts I didn t remember  but mostly parts I didn t appreciate when I was younger  Loved it  It make you think about your life and how special it really is to have a choice   Read this book in preparation for watching the movie  A great book that s on a par with Veronica Roth s Divergent series  I wouldn t be surprised if Roth had read this book as there are similarities between the communities and Sameness in  The Giver  with the factions of  Divergent   The Release in  The Giver  also calls to mind Exaltation in  Cloud Atlas   Clearly  Lois Lowry was the pioneer in YA dystopian future  Just didn t like the cliffhanger ending  but now looking forward to reading the rest in the quartet to see how it all ends for Jonas and Gabe   I was told  though  not to have high expectations for  The Giver  movie because it has diverged far from the book   i think this book was amazing    i think this was a great rainy day read  I gave this book a 4 5 out of five  If I had to compare this book to anything  I would have to say that it was an original story of a disillusioned utopia  that contained elements of political correctness  the Exodus story  and modern interpretations of Ann Ran s  Anthem   This book is a very quick read  that is not action packed  but is very though provoking  The main conflict of the story is deciding which type of world would a person want to live in  Option one is a world void of difference  strife  and pain  but also void of true happiness  individuality  love  or joy  Option two is a world like ours  where there is freedom of choice but equal heights of joy and depths of pain and sorrow  I believe the novel was a little slow at start as most of the novel is aimed at world building  but is not done so in a manner of  info dumping   The author gives us bits at a time  as the story and characters develop  But once the climax hits  you will not be able to put this book down  I do not know why this book is aimed at kids though  The scenes are age appropriate  and are nothing less than what they have seen on television  My main concern is that the intended audience would not be able to absorb the full meaning of the book  or think the issues in a manner in which is deserved  Maybe that too is a reflection of the story  change can only come through the next generation as adults are too set in their ways  I did read this prior to the release of the movie adaptation  Upon finishing it  I did feel eager to check out the trailer  and I am sorry that I did  From the trailer  it appears the movie has been turned into a generic dystopian action adventure story that veers far from it s original purposes  But I will not judge the movie too harshly as I have not yet seen it  At least I will carry on the memories of the book  I will definitely carry on with the series   Lowry  Louis  The Giver  Banton Doubleday Dell  New York 1993  180pp  ISBN  0 440 21907 8Genre  YA Literature  Fiction  UtopiaRating        The perfect novel about a perfect society  or at least that is what Jonas  the main character  thinks of his home until he is assigned to become the next Giver  Books about utopian societies usually freak me out and leave me with an eerie feeling  I however really enjoyed reading this book  Summary  Jonas lives in a community in which life has to be perfect  it is perfect in its sameness  There is no lying  color  individuality  bad feelings  nothing to make life difficult  Every year children who turn 13 are assigned their future carriers in a huge ceremony  Jonas learns that he will become the next Receiver which is a highly respected position in his community  He begins his training to become The Receiver with the present Receiver who becomes The Giver  The Giver holds all of the memories of past communities before him and he transmits those memories to Jonas  Jonas now knows what it is to have feelings and memories of life as it used to be  Through his training he believes that he can be The Receiver and hold the memories of his community until he sees his father kill an innocent baby  With the encouragement of The Giver  Jonas decides that life must change for his community  Main characters Jonas  Thought he was an average boy until he was honored with the position of The Receiver  He was happy living in the sameness of his community  Jonas new his future would be decided for him and had no problem with that  It is not until his eyes are opened to feelings that he realizes how messed up his community is Key Issues  Utopian societies  Responsibilities  Living a perfect life  growing up  survival of the fittest  Other interesting information  In Jonas s community everyone has been assigned a job to do  There is someone assigned to raise the children  make the food  and girls are even assigned to have the children  These women are allowed to have three children whom will be given away to married couples  After they have their third child they are forced to become laborers  Every couple in the community is allowed to have one boy and one girl  Imagine a world where there is no sunshine  no colors  no love  where you occupation and spouse is decided for you  That is the world Jonas lives in in  The Giver  by Lois Lowry  His parents are not his birth parents  nor his sister his real sibling  before being named he was just a number  19  His world is organized for him  There is no trouble  Just safety  Yet Jonas learns about things outside his world when he is chosen to be the next Receiver of Memory This book really tugged on my heart strings  I found it almost scary as gradually more about the world    earth    Jonas and his family lived in was revealed  trying to imagine having no sunshine  everything grey  not truly having feelings  nor having a true family  There was only safety and a degree of detachment ignorance Often we wish things were different  no pain  no fear  no danger  According to  The Giver    safe  can be having your life planned for you    who your family is  what you will be as an adult  who you will marry without you being allowed to choose for yourself  Never being taught about real feelings  hardships  And  finally  when old  another decides to  release  you At one point Jonas comments how people lived dangerously by loving  And that is how life is  There is risk in loving when it can be painful  Life is painful and scary  yet full of light and color  The Giver  is an powerful novel  helping one see what a rich world we live in   In The Giver Lowry presents the perfect dystopian novel  Mysterious  personal  and almost plausible  I loved the balance between individual characters and world building  Still an excellent read  Still very sad  I enjoyed it now as much as I did the first time I read it  I don t know now if I will see the movie or not  because it does make a person sad    I absolutely love this little book that is written for the teen section of our society  ie  12 14 year olds  or even younger   However  I think this is one book that transcends the  children teen book  classification  It seems much like a  nicer  version of George Orwell s 1984 book  The main character is a 12 year old boy who lives in a society where there is no war or pain  but no joy or love either  There is no crime either  it seems like a utopia  but only on the surface The main character  Jonas  gets his career placement assignment as a giver in training  The Giver is a person in the society who holds all the memories of war and pain  and of love and joy as well  The rest of the book concerns itself with the question of what Jonas will do with all this new knowledge  Even though this book is meant for the younger generations  it poses interesting and I think important comments on society and politics  just like George Orwell s 1984 does for the adult generations  This is why I think this book is so great for all ages and why everyone should read this at least once This is one of the best books I have ever read in my life  I read it when it first was written in 1993 and I have loved it ever since  It s a great book for children and adults so if you haven t read this  whether your 13 or 31  you should buy this book and read it It is a very short book  being only 192 pages  so there is really absolutely no reason why you shouldn t read this  I HIGHLY recommend this to everyone  This book is my number one favorite book of 2014 that I read  Jonas lives in a terrible Community  There is no individuality  No one knows what the world around them is like  Everything is chosen for you  Your job  spouse  even children  At the Ceremony of Twelve  Jonas is chosen to be the next Receiver of Memory  He receives all of the memories of the past from the Giver  He knows what the world around them is like  Some good  like love  some bad  like war  Jonas decides he has to escape from this Community when he realizes what they do to people who are no longer of use  Will he survive I ADORED this book  It made me want to cry and hug the characters  I give it 5 5 stars  It is my favorite Lois Lowry book  though I like many others   This 179 paged novel written by Lois Lowry is basically about the perfect world  which everything is controlled under the community  The community assigned each people their husbands or wives  children  one boy and one girl for each couple   and even jobs based on their interests and abilities for past years before they turned into twelve years old  Citizens could not see any colors or feel any feelings  They also have many rules to follow such as they should share their dream with their families  not lie to someone  or not ask someone rude questions  Also  flawed children  elderly people  and citizens who break the rules of the community are released  which means that they get killed  However  Jonas  the narrator of the novel  was assigned as the Receiver during the ceremony of twelve  It means that he does not have to follow the rules  he could see colors  feel feelings  and receive the memory from the Giver  As Jonas receives memories from the Giver  he started to realize that the community he lives in is bland and empty  Those memories he received  whether they are good or bad  make Jonas to think about more meaningful life  so he decided to change the community I really enjoyed this book  because not only I usually enjoy dystopian books  but also description the author used to explain the memories were amazing  Its details make readers to imagine the memories and feelings easily  so I feel like I am Jonas as I reading through the novel  This book truly makes me to think about that how happy it is to feel something even though it is painful distress  I would recommend this book to teenagers because this novel conveys the message of courage  love  importance of making decisions  and responsibilities  which would be nice lessons to them as they grow up as an adult  But still  it is nice book to share with anyone and is really enjoyable  This is an interesting book and it will make you think  I am not sure that the age that it is technically intended for will fully understand it  Not even if they are reading it in school with a teacher guiding them through it  There are just so many layers to it I cannot stand the idea of living in a world where everything is the same  Where everything is dull and has strict rules   or where they kill people who can t make themselves fit  And this is the kind of world Lois Lowry shows us in The Giver  What is amazing about the way Lowry wrote this book is that you can see the connections between our world as it is now and the way she wrote this futuristic world  It is the ability to make it so the reader can make these connections that makes this book so great  Only a great dystopian novel can pull this off I felt that this book is a warning to us and that Lowry is trying to make us see what is going on around us  I hope that others are able to get Lowry s message from this book  My love for this book is not something I can easily express in words  It is one of those books that when you are done reading it  it just sticks with you  You will need time to digest it when you finish before you are able to start your next read  Give yourself this time  you will be happy that you did Obviously  I give this a 5 out of 5 star rating You can find more of my reviews here http   readingwithcupcakes blogspot com  Very inspiring   except for a pretty disappointing ending  Okay  seriously  I hardly ever say this but    this was one of the best books I ve ever read  I wasn t impressed by how it started with mostly memories  but after the first chapter  wow  it captivated me  I read the whole book in one night  I had never heard the story before  so I didn t know any potential spoilers  And a visual twist in the middle totally got me   My favorite kind of book is one that s unpredictable  I m looking forward to reading more by this author  Thankfully  I have two other books sitting beside me to enjoy  Hopefully they ll be as good as this one  I m not even into the middle of the book yet and I already want yo read more and more every day  thanks for choosing this book mrs lore and mrs difusco  Just finished reading  I was somewhat thrown off by the trailers for the movie  I m so glad that I read the book first  I know the book is always better  and I often have a hard time reading a book after seeing the movie   Living in a world of sameness  would just suck  To not know color  love  happiness  pain  music  books   To be required to apologize for every small infraction  and in turn be required to always accept the apologies of others   To look  dress  and be the same as everyone else   To not have your own birthday  Christmas  Thanksgiving   I know this story has been around for a very long time  and I don t know why I have never read it until now   but I am glad that I did  And maybe I won t see the movie after all  but maybe I will  I have that choice   This is a carefully constructed world of no colors  no individuality  and no escape  The people are overall bland  except for one here and there with a dash of salt or pepper  like Asher   but otherwise  Sameness is a blanket over each aspect of their entire world  But then Jonas s mind starts opening up to colors  pain  loss  struggle  differences  and everything that makes OUR world fascinating  It s like stepping out of a 1950 s sitcom and into a modern day 3D movie  It s not a particularly long read but it is definitely a good read and I look forward to reading the others  This book is classed as a YA dystopia  but it is worlds away from Divergent  Delirium  and all of the other current drivel  While the first quarter of the book was a bit slow  once Jonas was selected as Receiver  it became completely riveting and moved a lot more quickly   despite being a quiet book  high on concept and insight but somewhat low on action While the initial set up is dystopian  I would classify this novel as a futuristic fantasy rather than as a true dystopia  Lowry has imagined a world where human perception is so changed from what we know that  when the details of that change begin to be revealed later in the book  they come as a complete surprise to the reader  having been barely alluded to in the first few chapters  Jonas s discovery of perception as WE know it  not through words or through life experience  but through the transfer of memories from generations before  is fascinating  touching  and sad  The story of Rosemary  only touched on briefly in the novel  is heartbreaking  especially when the Giver makes his final reveal This is a children s book on its surface  with simple language and very young characters  but at its root it is an exploration of the almost unlimited potential for human selfishness  and of what we might be willing to give up or to force upon others in the name of  happiness  and  peace   The emotional torment portrayed here is more disturbing than any amount of child murder and physical violence in the Hunger Games and other recent series  I m only sorry that it took me so long to finally pick up this book  Genre  Science FictionSummary  This title takes place in the perfect world of a eleven year old boy named Jones  His life and community is a place of  sameness   something that has happened  back  and back  and back   However  all of this is about to change as Jonas goes through the life change of the ceremony of twelve  meeting the giver and becoming the receiver Critique a  The strongest area of this book is  without a doubt  the setting  b  This books setting  which is a world of sameness  is undoubtedly its strongest aspect  It presents the reader with a perfect world that has no experience with pain  loss  war  hunger  and numerous other things  This creates a sense of wonder and suspense with the reader as it is a world that is so different from ours and that we want to learn more about  c  In one instance Jonas and the Giver discuss the aspect of color which does not occur any longer in their world of sameness   Why can t everyone see them  Why did color disappear  The Giver shrugged  Our people made that choice  the choice to go to sameness   This explains the setting of the book even further  a world with no color  Curriculum Connection  This book could be used to discuss descriptive language use  in that it is something that is discussed often in the book  It could also be used to discuss the events of the past  relating them to Jonas  and the Giver s painful memories  such as war  It would also be successful in discussing societies today and through history  This beautiful negative utopia definitely deserves its Newberry Medal  This is the second time I read this  and I loved it  The story is riveting  the characters  emotions are realistic  for being institutionally repressed   and the writing is powerful and flowing  I love the message of the dangers of forgetting the past  of giving up agency in your own life  of refusing to think about troubles and difficulties  I especially like the scene where they discuss  love  as a meaningless  obsolete  term  the Community and its  precision of language  is all about creating a world devoid of any sort of strong emotion or deep understanding  everything Jonas  parents say is true and  more precise  but cannot encompass the depth that is  love  when properly used  A world where all things  all people  are the Same is frightening and necessary  children need this book to understand just what their parents and teachers mean when they talk about how everyone is unique and what a good thing that is  This book shows what happens when conformity is absolutely without thought  when people let others make all the decisions for them  I read The Giver in 7th grade and loved it  so I was very excited when I had a reason to read it again to tutor a junior high student  Even though I remembered highly enjoying the book  I couldn t quite recall the plot  I could only remember that I found it shocking as a 12 year old Fast forward a dozen years or so and I find The Giver even better than I remember it  If anything it is more meaningful now that I truly understand the message of the author and the details she uses to depict a society devoid of pain  diversity  and  ultimately  meaning  Lois Lowry skillfully constructs a Utopian society that operates without any discomfort  emotional  physical  or otherwise  and then uses her introspective young narrator  Jonas  to reveal the hidden costs of such a way of life  Jonas s discovery of his society s flaws mirrors our own  and together we realize the horror behind the controlled Sameness that dominates this society Lowry s descriptions of daily life make this society believable while still leaving it general enough to stand in for any place the reader imagines  Daily life seems pleasant at first  as parents encourage their children to share their feelings and the elderly are respectfully cared for  However  the reader soon pieces together that any circumstance that might lead to strong emotions is strictly controlled  medication alleviates physical pain and the  stirrings   a euphemism for sexual desire   parents don t conceive their children  and any negative feelings are addressed and subsequently dismissed at the dinner table  Jonas s time with The Giver  the man who transmits forbidden memories and emotions to the chosen Receiver  Jonas   causes him to conclude that all people deserve a chance to experience the fullness of life  including all of the love and heartbreak involved Lowry s tale is cautionary but also uplifting  Despite enduring the worst terrors life can inflict through the teachings of The Giver  Jonas decides that the experience of love trumps that of sorrow  and ultimately concludes that life   true  uncontrolled  unpredictable life   is worth living  amazing that I did not read this book until I reached my 60 s  http   divagaciones de una poulain bl   Jonas vive en una comunidad perfecta  No hay guerra  no hay conflictos  no existe la muerte  ni la desgracia  no hay hambrunas  Pero tampoco hay colores  o musica  o arte    En esta sociedad todos son iguales  no hay posibilidad de eleccion  Es una sociedad repleta de normas sobre absolutamente todos los topicos  Y esa sociedad es aun peor que la que creo Lauren Oliver  en Delirium  alimentada por el miedo  o la sociedad de Suzanne Collins  que peca de indiferencia y de miedo  No  en esta sociedad no hay miedo  no hay paranoia  Todo parece perfecto  todo parece esta en el lugar correcto en el momento correcto  y todos parecen estar felices con ellos Y da miedo Sinopsis  La sociedad en la que vive Jonas es la perfecta descripcion del mundo perfecto  Todo esta bajo control  no hay colores  ni musica  no hay guerra  ni posibilidad de eleccion  Cada persona se ajusta a las Normas de su Comunidad  Cuando Jonas cumple los 12 anos y debe ser asignado a una profesion  es elegido para una funcion muy especial y unica en su comunidad  En su formacion descubrira las verdades que subyacen bajo la fragil perfeccion de su mundo La autora va soltando la informacion sobre esa sociedad perfecta tanto que parece ser una comunidad ideal  sin embargo  poco a poco esa utopia se convierte en distopia  mientras Jonas va descubriendo los recuerdos que vuelven tan fragil la perfeccion del mundo donde ha crecido y que le parecia tan agradable  No hay odio  no hay amor  no hay ira  ni sentimientos Los sentimientos que los personajes dicen sentir son solo un vago espejismo de lo que son los sentimientos en realidad  Tampoco hay posibilidades de eleccion  a los doce  a cada persona se le asigna la mision que cargara el resto de su vida No hay amor  No hay odio  No hay elecciones  No hay colores  no hay musica  y los libros estan prohibidos  Todo parece perfecto  todas las personas  cordiales y amables  No hay guerras  ni conflictos    pero   no son los sentimientos un precio demasiado alto a pagar por la paz Considerado un libro prohibido que ha estado censurado muchos anos en Estados Unidos hace que te plantees las cosas de un modo diferente  The thing that I loved most about this book is the same thing that frustrated me the most  I had NO idea where the book was going  I was so confused at one point that I thought I had missed something important  but it turns out I was just supposed to be that unsure    I definitely loved this book though  My only complaint is that I wish it was longer  This is a classic example of why you should never judge a book from its cover  All my life I have steered clear of this book because I thought it looked really boring  I only finally decided to read it because the movie is coming out soon  and I m really glad I did  I think it might become a favorite  This Newberry award winning book for the middle grades is a wonderful book  It seems that life in the Community is perfect without conflict  fear  war  hunger  or need  Feelings are reviewed  apologies are made and accepted  and meals are delivered on time for everyone  From birth  each life is mapped out  Children are raised in family units and each individual s birthday is celebrated at the same time  Year 1 for everyone is the same  Year 2 and so on  You always know when you ll get your bicycle and when you will be assigned your profession for life  age 12   Rules are strictly enforced and three violations mean the person will be released to go Elsewhere  presumably to another community  The reader has  perhaps  a different conception of release than the members of the Community This is the story of Jason  a 12 year old  who is assigned to be a Receiver  His training with a Giver is to received the stories and memories of the Community and the distant ancestors  The receiving is done through a hypnosis like transfer of the memories and experiences  And he experiences the pain  sorrow  cold  colors  and emotions  It is painful for him and the giver  It also changes Jason s perception of the Community forever  His understanding of the notion of Release becomes fuller and more horrible This is a thoughtful  intriguing  wonderful book  The growing understanding of Jason about the fullness of life is wonderful  The events in his life in the Community leads him to some actions different than the leaders may have anticipated What an incredible gift to middle graders in its honesty and compassion  This is a great discussion book as well as a completely enjoyable story  Well written and fabulous characterizations   This entire series is brilliant and really made me re examine some assumptions about our world and way of doing things  I just re read this book  for the third time and it still strikes me as profound  I can t imagine what I took from it at age 9 or 10 when I first read the book in 4th grade  I think it was  but i m pretty sure I ve taken quite a different outlook on life and matured considerably since then  as I m now almost 31  But the book is still thought provoking and profound in it s simplicity and that old cliche that ignorance is bliss is certanly challenged and exploited and we re reminded that the imperfections and the detailed diffences are what make us beautiful  not in spite of  but becuse of  Although I ve read The Giver three times now  I ve yet to read the 3 books that follow in the Giver quartet  for fear that they might not measure up to the high standards of the first  Although my curiosity is getting the best of me after this 3rd time and i might break down and read them  yet I ve been told by others that this should have been a stand alone  I ll be my own decider of that  I m also curious as to the movie rendition of this classic and am looking forward to viewing the work on screen  Five star rating and recommended to anyone at any age and any intrest in reading  This is a great book  quick and easy read with a beautiful message   The plot was intrigiung  in this world in the future of communities  As Jonas spends time with the Giver  he uncovers horrifying secrets in this world  Emotions are considered evil and people that are unfit are killed  In this story  Jonas undergoes pain and happiness and a breathtaking journey  By Lois Lowry  The Giver is going to blow  Your  Mind  This is the BEST book            Rereading this book reminds me that books can impact us differently depending on when they are read  I remember reading this book growing up and loving it  I think this was my first dystopia and it really impacted me  Now as I read it as an adult I still think it is a good book but I am greatly saddened reading the story  It is definitely worth the read for all ages  A note on my rating  although I would not give it 5 stars now  I am leaving my prior high rating because many years after first reading it I remembered it as being worthy of those 5 stars  So  younger me gives 5 stars  present me gives 4 stars  mn  rw  m qr t   f l rwy  tkhTf l nfs    bqyt mshdwd  Ht  akhr SfH    wl tjrb  qr  ly lhdh lmw

it all  very fun to read  Much better than Divergent which was made way to similarly to The Giver  Pretty light and easy but really good  surprised I liked it because it s a third person pov book   pretty different to the movie  especially in the way of the age  the fact that the givers place had a lobby  where I m the movie it was shown as being pretty isolated  Like that this is probably one of the only non romance books around  so not cheesy I find it unrealistic  though  that Jonas would understand colours so easily  I mean  he understands the second the giver tells him it s a colour    It dosent quite seem that easy to define what a colour is  I actually fell in love with the world of the giver  the story of it  anyway  I loved that it dosent give a clear ending  but it implies rather than tells  which I adored  The memories were brutal and beautiful  I felt them with Jonas  I felt sad about the fact that Jonas s family unit didn t even love him  That no one loved anyone  And I m confused about the birth mothers  I mean  unless I missed something  you need a males um  fertilisation to produce a baby  So where do they get that from  Machines  Syringes  Who are the males  Do they have a supply from years ago  Are there random men who disappear and become the birth fathers  It s interesting to think about  I like that the book dosent go deep into the past and why the communities exist and why it is the way it is  such as colour and emotions being taken away by a pill  They don t even have a freaking fun in the sky  Ah  climate control     Gabe  he was awesome  Such a cute and sweet kid  I felt a strong connection to him  as well as to Jonas  Lily is hilarious  And Lily s story about them maybe all being twins and their twins in elsewhere    Another Cheif Elder  Oh  lord  I love how Jonas thinks of Fiona as his Gentle Friend or Favourite female  In the movie at least  I ship it  Jiona  Jonana  Fionas  Fias  Hmmm  I find it interesting that if Jonas died his memories wouldn t die with him but everyone  Would remember them  That s interesting   Oh my god  The releasing  That hurt to read so much  even more than the memory of war And the fact that only The Giver and Jonas know about what releasing really is    Gosh it s horrible  I hate it  that this happens  They just KILL innocent babies because they re identical to another  it s MURDER  DO THEY NOT REALISE THAT  NO  THEY DONT REMEMBER  SILLY ME  THEYRE BRAINWASHED  ARGHHHHHHH AGEHDHDBSBSJSHSNSM  Sorry for the rant  But it s so horrible  I apoligise  Please accept my apology   Haha    Attempt at an inside joke for other readers of this book     I get it  I get the ending  When Jonas leaves  his memories return to the others in the community and they remember things  Here The giver shook his head and made a gesture to silence him   If you get away  if you get beyond  if you get to Elsewhere  it will mean that the community has to bear the burden themselves  of the memories you had been holding for them  I think that they can  and that they will acquire some wisdom  And the Giver helps them deal with the feelings and the pain And about Jonas  I guess he stays in that home  I mean  the giver did say he would never be able to come back    I m pretty sure anyway    Well kind of  I m kind of confused if I m thinking too deeply and Jonas just leaves and everything goes back to normal  It s not a toxic community   But it s not perfect  I mean  no colours  no love  I hope I m right with my first idea   And I dunno  The Giver did say he wanted to change things  But how is Jonas leaving and everything going back to normal changing anything       I am a little confused  So I m just sticking to my first assumption  Or  Maybe when it mentioned Jonas feeling happy when he got near that house it s because it s in a new community which is our world that we know  As in  not a utopian one  but a normal everyday life that we humans live  in the real world  away from fiction  I know it sounds weird and confusing and I m regretting thinking this book wasn t deep  The bit before Jonas s journey to elsewhere  leaving the dwelling etc  was more detailed in the film  I think that was because Fiona and Jonas were like in love in the film  And he visited her first  and there was the stuff with her about to be released  and things were more detailed  But it was glossed over in the book because they re only 12  Jonas did dream of her once  but he didn t have romantic feelings for her like he did in the film  Also in the film  the Chief Elder saw Jonas leave on the camera thing  And then she sent Asher to find him on this computer tracker  But he let him go HOW CAN THEY DO THIS             DONT RELEASE GABE  I BEG YOU            How could you  Mr Jonas s dad  Does the Giver have a name  I know he was the reciever but what was his birth name    Hmmmm Imagine if the other part of the world away from Panem from THG was divided into the communities and the factions  If all those worlds existed at once  I m turning into Lily  XD5 5 I just almost cried like ten times  Why have I never read this book  It means so much  I thoroughly enjoyed this book  I don t really have much else to say  It was the cliche to begin all cliches but that made it all the more enjoyable  I have read my fair share of dystopian post apocalyptic novels and I had a lot of fun picking out different parts of this book that I have seen show up in other novels  I m sure it was groundbreaking at the time of its publication and its actually quite interesting how this whole genre has erupted since then  I really liked the narrator and the style of narration  I would recommend this book to anyone who didn t have to read it in school as it is very good without being picked apart for symbolism and all that jazz   i loved this book it kept me interested in the relationships and how they lived  Can t wait to see this movie  Wow  Really good  This book what amazing  I loved it to bits   There was new things around every corner  It captivates the audience and makes you want to read more and more  I really enjoyed the writing style of Lois Lowry  The only thing I didn t enjoy was the ending  I mean I loved it but it made me angry because I wanted more  I mean yeah he leaves and he see people happy and sharing their love right at the end of the book and that s a beautiful ending  I just want to know what happens next though Ok all I can say is this book is creepy        And I loved it   Jonas lives in a utopian society and as you get through the book you realize that what you think is the ideal society is actually a creepy dystopian society Jonas as you know is singled out to go and get training from The Giver  creepy man on the cover  he and Giver are the only people who know what true fear is  Just let me say this is the creepiest book I have ever read much creepier than even the hunger games if you hate to cry in books don t read this if you hate cliffhanger endings don t read this  Just think about that I am 11 and was 10 when I read this and I was slightly creeped out but it is a great book and I totally recommend it This is the book that started it all with the trend of dystopian novels the giver was banned from libraries the first 5 years it came out because it is so different this is a must read pick it up today Like I said before you think this society is utopia but truly when you get into its depths it is actually a creepy and gory post apocalyptic society  I feel that this book was set with a cliffhanger for many reasons  But if you like post apocalyptic books you will love this book  I went back recently and reread the Giver  This time around I was struck by how completely disturbing this book is  It s set in what s positioned as the perfect world   everyone has their role and contributes to society  people are taken care of  and everyone is happy fulfilling their societal requirements  Yet underneath the surface is a coldness which powers society but removes any sense of caring and compassion  The main character  Jonas  receives his proclaimed occupation and as a result starts to see the cracks in the perfect facade  As he learns more about what really happens  along with glimpses of the warmth and love that used to exist in a much messier past  his world begins to crumble around him   Why is it that I m 21 and it is my first time reading this book   I wish I was introduced to The Giver earlier on because it is that good  I had a hard time putting this book down  I just wanted to know what was going to happen to Jonas next   In the first few chapters of the book  I did not fully understand what was going on  I did not comprehend what type of society Jonas was living in  Or what he meant at first when he mentioned the terms ceremony and assignments  As I continued to read  I started to figure it out   If I were to teach this book  I would introduce it by reviewing some of the vocabulary used in the text  For example ceremony  assignment  imperceptibly  etc  Therefore  students will have a better idea of who Jonas is  and the type of society he lives in   The Giver is a great book to add to your classroom reading assignments and or to have on your bookshelf  I would suggest this book is for 5th graders and up  There are many questions this book raises that could lead to a high quality class discussion  I personally think one of the strongest components of The Giver is the ending because Lois Lowry leaves the ending open for individual interpretation  Some class discussions could be prompted by these types of questions What happens to Jonas and Gabriel at the end Why do you think Lois Lowry ended the book the way she did Compare the type of society Jonas lives in to the one we live in today Also  depending on the class and your students  a discussion on the topic euthanasia could be done  The Giver is an excellent read  and I strongly recommend it   A great book about a utopian society  it deals with the bad parts of having such a perfect society  As a job  Jonas recieves the reciever of memory  he is shocked of what awaits his training  Usually I prefer to read the book before seeing the fim adaptation  It didn t happen this time  only because I was not aware of the book s existence  I loved the movie  and could not wait to read the book From the very first page I was transformed to this  perfect  community  where everyone is contented and lives by sets of rules  At the same time I got the feeling of coldness  detachment and basic lack of humanity In this perfect world  every one was the same  Everyone was equally important and had a very imporant job to perform  This setting in it self was vey thought provoking  Could we humans eliminitate all emotions  wants  likes and other characteristics that make us unique in order to eliminate hatred and wars  In theory   maybe  In reality those differences and amotions help us to be better and to appreciate life Looking at this utopia from a distance away  we see children looked after  we see older generation cared for and family units functioning and supporting one another  What we don t see it the cost  the ultimate price that was paid  I loved the Giver and the Receiver Jonas  Jonas was simply perfect hero  one who realises very quickly that people need everything in their lives  the true happiness  as well as true pain  Jonas  journey was difficult and challenging  Some scenes were ver powerfull  especially when he realised the truth about  release  It will be great to see how this story continues Overall a great book not only for young adults but everyone  who likes to question what an ideal society would be like  This book is chilling and amazing and hopeless and hopeful and everything else good that a book can be The solemn  philosophical novel known as the Giver was a tremendous  outstanding novel  This novel was quite a unique one  for it foretold a possible future when a controlled  prefect  utopia is created on planet Earth  Basically the novel s about a curious boy by the name of Jonas  who happens to live in the bland  but perfect  society  Within that society  the laws governing the citizens are much different than the laws that we  real life humans  have  And so on  and so on through out the book  the plot gradually builds up suspense and information as Jonas continues his  special training   Anyway  I absolutely loved this novel  I thought it was an interesting novel  with its sci fi ish elements and brainwashing factors  The conclusion  I thought  was the most unusual I ve encountered in any novel I ve ever read  Pretty much at the end of the novel    it leads off open ended  Despite the odd ending to the story  I thought the novel had a fascinating mood and aura flowing through out its text  The characters were set up nicely  but very simple  as the author would intend them to be   the setting was alright  it could ve had a little more imagery  Other than that  I absolutely enjoyed the sci fi novel  known as the Giver   It s very very interesting book It s about how we can create our future make it beautiful and be succeed  Starting out 2012 by re reading one of my favorite books of all time     This is the original YA dystopian novel  and all the more frightening because the  bad guys  are so well intentioned  Very enjoyable book  Kind of a cross between Brave New World and 1984 but in my opinion  much better  Certain parts of it  release  also reminded me of Wool  I was able to breeze through it  Its not a long book to begin with but the story was so nicely written it was hard to stop reading it  It had a great ending  There are other books in this series but it appears each one can be a stand alone  The other books are not as well liked and their description doesn t interest me  So I wont continue the series but highly recommend this book   IS THAT IT  IS THAT HOW ITS GOING TO END  NO  NO  NO  NO  NO  NO  NOOOOOOO  I JUST  I JUST HATE THIS BOOK SO MUCH BECAUSE IT HAS RUINED ME BUT I LOVE IT SO SO MUCH LIKE I CANT DEAL  MY THOUGHTS ARE EVERYWHERE AND LIKE NO  NO  NO  IT WILL NOT END LIKE THAT  WTF  NO  NO  GOD PLEASE NO  ILL DO ANYTHING  NO NO NO  but shit  Yes  this book is just yes and NO s   like 97 8  are NO s   and everything like i don t even know  BUT NO DONT END IT LIKE THAT  DONT END ME LIKE THAT  SHIT  NO  NO NO   I have no idea why I haven t heard of Lois Lowry until now  I ve seen this around reading lists appear over and over  and finally I ve gotten around to reading this  The book has a great story  presenting a dystopian future of humans that are finally able to rid themselves of pain and suffering   that comes at a significant price  In Jonas  universe  there is sameness  order  and rules  Jonas is handpicked to succeed the one person who keeps all memories of the earth  and he learns later on how the world used to be before his time  when there was pain and suffering in the world  The story is simply written but explores complicated moral concepts  and I can only wonder how youngsters that pick this book up process the moral implications of having a pain and suffering free world  Lowry brilliantly describes the experiences of Jonas in a world that does not know warfare  hunger or even sunshine  The language used in the book was a simple but representative one  with one most interesting for me is Lowry s use of  Release  to indicate that a member of the community was leaving  The book also ends vaguely  but ends in a good note  which leaves a lot of room for reader interpretation  One of the most thought provoking books I ve read so far on humanity and our moral capacity for the future  Everyone should read it  Read during my 9th grade of High School   6 years ago   Lowry s The Giver will forever mark the beginning of my love for books outside of the Harry Potter series  In my English classes  I would usually ignore the novels that my teachers assigned and if they weren t Shakespearian plays  in which I usually volunteered to act as a main character  mainly to get through the class   I would bring in my Harry Potter books  place them in front of the assigned novel and read it pretending to be following along  The Giver charmed me instantly due to the fact that all the characters in the novel are in state of innocence  This novel displays the importance of an individual  as Jonas becomes more and more awake with memories from the Giver  we readers must begin to accept differences between Jonas and his world   since we do not accept full heartedly their strange laws the ones that become similar to us  the one of war  colors  gender  and pleasure become a difference that we accept Jonas to live in  However I give this novel a 5 star mainly due to its theme of the importance of memory  Lowry seems to have realized that without memory  there is no pain  if you cannot remember physical pain  you might as well not have experienced it  and you cannot be plagued by regret or grief if you cannot remember the events that hurt you  At some point in the past the community in The Giver decided to eliminate all pain from their lives  To do so  they had to give up the memories of their society s collective experiences  Not only did this allow them to forget all of the pain that had been suffered throughout human history  it also prevented members of the society from wanting to engage in activities and relationships that could result in conflict and suffering  and eliminated any nostalgia for the things the community gave up in order to live in total peace and harmony  According to the novel  however  memory is essential  The Committee of Elders does recognize the practical applications of memory  if you do not remember your errors  you may repeat them  so it designates a Receiver to remember history for the community  But as Jonas undergoes his training  he learns that just as there is no pain without memory  there is also no true happiness  I really liked this book  When we first started reading it I thought it was stupid but then it got really good and suspenseful  The ending left me wanting more  I read this book to my 5th graders every year  and this year was no different  They loved it  I love it  it s a perfect story  There are so many themes and issues that arise  and it s beautifully written  It s 1984 for kids   This is an great book   it is about young boy living in an   ideal world   where things as good as you would have thought   they seem happy until the unfold a story that ll blow you away   we have completed this book and has a story that you wouldnt believe  I say this book is great   I reccomend that you people should really read this   I don t know what my fascination is with YA literature  I believe that I spend more time thinking about the concepts in the book and how I would discuss them with my children if they were old enough to read these books  I found this book deeply troubling  What troubled me most is that I think there are people today in political power who would look highly upon this progressive repression  I think one thing would be different  Todays politicians would not stoop to the same level of  sameness  just as they have no intention of participating themselves in Universal Health Care  And they do not pay into their own social security like we do  They rely on the tax payers to pay for them   Cynthia ManzoNovember 30  2015Period 2Adv  Magical Realism 9The Giver is a book by Lois Lowry  This book was about a small community where everyone was the same  In this community  there was no pain and no war  The main character in the book is Jonas and The Giver  At the age of twelve  every kid gets an assignment that they are expected to complete  Jona s assignment is receiver and this requires The Giver to transmit memories to Jonas of fear and joy  of happiness and despair  These memories also include colors and emotion  which Jonas doesn t know about considering the fact that no one has feelings in the community  By the end of the book  Jonas is angry about the community he lives in and he runs away into the real world where everyone is different  My personal opinion on The Giver is  it s a great book with good description and detail  I feel this way about the book because there s some suspense added into the book  In the first chapter it says  Jonas lives in a place called The Community  where supplies are brought in by cargo plane   This makes the reader wonder why supplies are brought in on a plan and not trucks like usual  I also think The Giver is a good book because when Jonas is getting the memories  Lois describes his pain so well one could feel how he feels  For example  in chapter 10 Jonas says   It was startling  but he was not as all frightened  now  He was filled with energy  and he breathed again  feeling the sharp intake off frigid air  Now  too  he could feel cold air swirling around his entire body  He felt it blow against his hands where they lay as his sides  and over his back   As I read this line  I felt a chill in my spine as if I had stepped outside on a cold winter day  This book by far has been one of the best books I ve read  I absolutely LOVED this story  I can t wait to see what Lowry does in the next novel      This book was suggested to me  because of its excellence  by someone associated with a children s book review site  http   www sweetonbooks com   When I began the book  I had this question in mind   who or what is The Giver  When I finished it  I had my answer   The Giver is the keeper and disseminater of all memories to the Receiver  the ultimate decider  the holder of all experience  good and bad  pleasurable and painful  the one who enables everyone else to live in a peaceful state  similar to that of drugged contentment  by bearing all of the ills and goodness of the world on his her shoulders  It is the one making a huge sacrifice for the many  I pictured Atlas kneeling under the weight of all this knowledge  It makes for a great discussion  Is this fair  Is it too great a burden for only one person to bear in order that others bear nothing  I highly recommend this book  to adults as well as children because of the timely and interesting issues it brings up for consideration and discussion The book is about a controlled society in which social mores are taken to the extreme and everyone and every act of life is controlled and managed by The Elders  supposedly to provide all that is needed to its citizens without wars or hunger  pain or suffering   Sameness  is promoted as the ultimate end  It is a society without the extremes of true emotion and is intended to be perfect  safe and secure for all of its citizens The population is strictly defined  behavior is modified to conform  marriages are arranged  only two children are allowed per family  children are selected and placed with families after the proper filing and approval of applications  rather than being born into them and there is no extended family  When  placed  children grow up  and are mature enough to leave home and set out on their own  their surrogate parents are moved into communities for the  childless   When they become elderly  they are placed in a community for the old and are eventually  released  into  elsewhere  as are some of the newborns  in order to control the population  In the modern day world of today  these practices could be debated as using death panels All behavior is dictated as are careers and all deviations to the norm are punished  sometimes severely  There is no creative thought or individualism  Deep feelings do not exist  Life is totally without freedom of thought and lifespan is chosen by an outside source  It is what seems like a utopian society at first  then as a  utopia gone bad   because there is no diversity of opinion  no knowledge of the past  no true experiences of joy or deep emotion  no freedom of choice or anything  for that matter  Everything is dictated by a  higher power  but not a G d  rather a group of Elders  There is only the now and a controlled way of life in which all decisions are made by the Elders and The Receiver  for what would seem like the mutual benefit of all but it is apparently more beneficial to the ones in charge  Total control does not allow for discontent  This book provokes tremendous thoughtfulness and introspection about how we live and why  The  newchild  and the elderly are treated as tenderly as if they were the same rather than one who is entering life as the other is preparing to exit   it is the closing of the circle  both are frail and needy The book has great value as a tool to introduce a variety of topics for discussion with 11 14 year olds who are not quite ready for books like The Hunger Games or Logan s Run  On an adult level  it reminded me of The Stepford Wives  Some interesting topics raised in the book include  who has the right to decide life and death for others  what is an appropriate punishment for societal infractions  at what point does regulation and control become oppressive  is it a good thing to remove choice from our lives since it eliminates the possibility of making wrong decisions  is lying acceptable  how would we be affected if we could not feel love  wouldn t we be like wind  up toys  etc  What would our lives be like without individualism  independence and the freedom to make our own decisions and choices  for instance  Is it good to feel intense emotions such as pleasure and pain Although this simple and well written science fiction novel won the Newberry Medal  it s appropriateness for adolescents has often been questioned because the subject matter touches on some controversial topics such as sexual awakening and euthanasia There are a total of three books in the series  Gathering Blue and The Messenger are the second and third  Welcome to the community where every family consists of one man and one women  These couples can apply for children  Two children to be exact  one boy and one girl  The children are born to birth mothers and taken for the first year or so of life to live in a nursery awaiting the day they are deemed ready to graduate to families  Every adult is given a job at their 12 year ceremony  There are no choices  no options  it is a job selected specifically for you  There are no feelings in this world  there are no colors  You live a wonderful life  and then achieve the high honor of being released one day Sounds perfect  To most of our world  this sounds as far from perfect as can be  Imagine those growing up in this community never knowing any different than the way the community is and to them has always seemed to be  To those  they don t know that questioning is an option  as questioning people is rude   Up until his twelve year ceremony  Jonas thought the same as the rest in his community  When he was named Receiver  a special and high honor  he begins learning memories and things change  The knowledge is wonderful  the pain horrific  and the loneliness of not being able to share the information with anyone other than the Giver  brings his perfect world crashing down  Follow Jonas in his world as it privately starts to crumble and what he and the Giver do to attempt making it a better place  A book reminiscent of 1984  by George Orwell and Brave New World  by Aldous Huxley  A community that is molded  into what is deemed to be the definition of perfect including the change of language  1984  and pills for all ailments  Brave New World  including one that subdues bodily urges  asexuality anyone     Just finished this tonight and it was amazing  I never had to read this in school and considering they are now making a film one of my friends loaned me her copy and I m really glad she did  The writing was so simple but so moving and the end really threw me for a loop  And then I found out this is a series and there are MORE books  Highly recommend this and I personally look forward to checking out the others  I think that the Giver is a very good book  but it has a ending that makes you very curious  The book starts very slow and tells you things that you don t get at first  but it will become clear in the future  The author has a reason for this that you will find out if you think about it  The book is one of the best books I ve ever read  but the ending is hateful  I do love the book and all  but the ways that they kill is horrible  It also sucks how Jonas  the main character  is forced to leave his friends and his parents  In all  it is a very good book that makes you very curious  You will love this book if you want to be left with curiosity  awesome A world of question is brought up in this social justice piece  Lowry brings across many familiar questions of individuality and social  norms  but answers them pretty well too  The memories of a distant pass are what is shown here in an unknown setting in some isolated community sometime in the future  The retrospective qualities of the book allow us to realize what OUR day in age is doing wrong or right  good or bad  However  this future community also allows us to realize just how far is too far in the realm of individual choice  For example  the main character Jonas has sexual urges like we do  but is forced to take a pill to make them go away  he has a family with mom dad and sister like we do  but the  family  is formed by a committee  The third person narration of the story focuses on Jonas  as we get to know his thoughts and emotions behind the weird circumstances  So we do get to be invested in the novel s protagonist s life  but I do not believe this point of view did the novel justice  as Lowry could of had the story told in first person by Jonas  making the accounts much more haunting  The science fiction  world gone wrong  story is made to draw you into a world where no choice or real emotions takes over and leaves the reader thinking about the political stance of the early 90s  crazy  world or still  the world WE live in  My favorite part of the novel was that it tells it like it is  no long run ons or ornate descriptions  just the plain and simple telling of how it is   or how it could be   This is my favorite book of all time    It is an extremely easy read and can be done in one afternoon  Lois Lowry transports you into a world where everything on the surface seems  perfect  Another great utopia turned dystopia story  Lowry s emphasis on the importance of emotion and love makes you feel grateful to be able to express all of your emotions  even the bad  Jonas  journey from a naive  simple boy to a complex  adventurous  and confident individual who questions the rules and sets out on a journey to take charge of his own life  The Giver is a book that plays on your emotions  drawing you in after the first couple of chapters until the very end of the book   I had to read this book in class and I was glad I had to  My favorite part about the book was that in the end there was no bad person that Jonas was fighting  Many of the books now there is always the well known menacing government agency that people strive to defeat  The only thing they did was make everyone the same  It questions weather being the same and being equal are interchangeable and what happens when someone becomes different in a world of sameness  It is a little confusing when Jonas starts to see in color and the ending is definitely up for your interpretation   I came to this book with no preconceptions  I read it in less than a day  I absolutely loved it  I ve now read 3 books in the series  The Giver is the kind of book that leaves you thinking  and then thinking about what you thought  and then questioning life s entirety  But this isn t in a negative way  or a positive for that matter  it just is  You are spared of the right and wrong  and learn to see things neutrally  but not in a godly way  because you are aware that whatever you think  it affects you But this is just a book  One about an ideal community  sameness all around  no trouble whatsoever  And you  at least I did  start asking yourself  that the real life should be like this  And then you realize  maybe not that much  or at all  My understanding of this book is that  even when we think everything is as it s supposed to be  and that we re doing everything right  and change  ever slight  would ruin it all  we re wrong  wronger than he who thought people could be killed just because you hated them  wronger than he who ruled harshly over agonizing populations  wronger than she who promoted promiscuity in exchange of money  wronger than an orphan  starving child in the mercy of the desert  wrong about everything  Because  no matter what we think  perfect does not exist  and human nature  the endless struggle between good and evil  will always find a way to be present   Whether you agree or not  it s true  If you think you re doing something good  there s something else you re doing wrong  It s obvious this review is just my personal opinion  and reveals nothing of the sort of things reviews normally do  but take it as you will  reading the book is the only way to know how  good  or  bad  it is  Jonas lives in a seemingly perfect world where every need is provided and every choice  every decision is not his to make  A world that is organised by set of rules and filled with what may seem like happy and content citizen  The person who defies those rules will be  Released   but what this  Release  truly is and what happen during the process is not something known by every individual in this community  On December every year  comes one ceremony that has been happily and anxiously awaited by everyone in the society  A ceremony that is held to celebrate children from one to twelve years old Among all these ceremonies  the Ceremony of the Twelve is the most important one as this is where every twelve year old child is assigned with their specific assignments based on some prolong evaluations  This assignment depicts the person that they will be and the career that they will venture in as they grow up  This is where Jonas learns about his future  where his life drastically begins to change and where he starts learning the truth   fascinating  startling  mind boggling and bone chilling truth   about the world that he lives in  How does he feels bearing secrets such as this  And what can he does with a knowledge this big What more can I say other than admitting that The Giver is definitely a masterpiece  I was more than a little sceptical upon starting this book mainly due to its small size  I let myself thinking that it is impossible for a 179 pages book to deliver much  let alone boggle a person s mind  I was wrong   totally wrong  Lois Lowry has skilfully created this one unique world that closely resembles ours yet when examined closely is different in many ways  I truly appreciate how slowly Lowry reveals the storyline  letting readers munching every detail bit by bit  allowing them to understand this community and churn the meaning of life that they live in One thing that truly fascinates me is how she came out with all these perplexing rules that the community must obey and justify them with profound reasoning  For instance  children are only allowed to start wearing front buttoned jacket at the age of seven  which is the first sign of independence  Before that age  they can only wear jackets that fastened down the back as this will encourage them to help each other dress and learn the concept of interdependence  Another aspect of the book that I found interesting yet chilling is the truth behind  Release   At first  readers are lead to believe that those who are  Release  will be banished and sent to live outside the community  Though the actual event that happens is extremely horrifying and still brings chill down to my spine every time I think about it The Giver is indeed an intelligent book that is full with suspenseful mysteries and packs with unthinkable  plausible questions that will continue raking your brain even long after you finish reading  The book gives an example of how life could be like without choices  love  pleasure and hardship  left readers to wonder if life does have any purpose  any meaning without them  I was not thoroughly satisfied with the ambiguous ending at first though after reflecting back the things I have been reading  I think it was bittersweet and suits this book perfectly  In some ways  the ending reflects real life  in which we take the risk yet there is no way we can predict what will come out of it  Such a splendid piece that I think ought to be read by everyone Taken from my bookblog  The Bibliophile s Journal First read in 2007 or 8 and rated it 5 stars Reread  Kept my five star rating and am giving it a review   Let me begin by saying that I enjoyed it more this time around than the first and I definitely fell more in love with the book  It has a spot in my heart  Now I am not in love with it like I am some of my other favorites  If I Stay for that matter   but I really have a new appreciation  You could say that I liked the book more this time because I wasn t reading it for school  but I didn t have that relationship with books I read in the younger grades  I liked the book or I didn t Beside the fact that I loved the book this time around better  I liked the length a lot  I think Lois Lowry wrote an effective story  not to mention a dystopian story  within 178  which is now unheard of  I thought the writing was fantastic for it being a lower level reading grade  4 5   That is what I love about The Giver  In a sense  it was the first dystopian novel  meaning it was the one I remember reading before dystopians became a reading trend because I am highly annoyed by that  This time around I had a new appreciation  I loved the lack of the cliche  love triangle   It definitely covered a deeper meaning of love  The world was interesting and fresh  It didn t fit into the cookie cutter dystopian worlds of the present  I also found the story to be deeper  This definitely stems from me being older  It inspired thoughts within me and caused me to put myself into the story  Definitely a good and quick read  This is my first Lois Lowry story and I have been informed by my writing group  in good humor  that my education has been sadly deficient  I have to agree  The Giver was a fantastic novel and I find that I wish I had read this novel before I had read The Hunger Games  I think it would have set a better foundation for reading the slough of dystopian novels that are being published for young adults today  In fact  I just read Divergent by Veronica Roth  It s an excellent book  but I don t think that many of the other dystopias I ve read about have had quite the solid feel to them that Lowry and Collins  That is  the worldbuilding seems thinner in other stories  but I felt like the entire universe or community in which Jonas lived was whole and solid  It s a small world  at least it felt that way  and its amazing to me how much punch Lowry packed into such a short story  Very little happens by way of dramatic effect  epic battle scenes or flashing lights  The message is carried across subtly  but with feeling Although this is a dystopian utopian novel  it does share characteristics of science fiction  in that reality  science and technology are real and perhaps enhanced beyond what have now  For example  back and back and back before the story takes place  someone in the community had the job of altering genetics so that they did not see color and created pills that altered human emotion  These work within known science  but take it a step further than our own present progress  It also had a touch of fantasy  with the Giver s ability to transfer memory through gestures that seemed to be magical  One thing I realized as I was reading is that there are essentially only two adults in this book  Or one adult and one child coming of age  The Giver  of course  is the adult  Jonas steps toward adulthood or  coming of age  as he loses his childhood when he becomes the Receiver in training  He realizes that there are choices  that it is bitter when we have no choices but that it is not necessarily safe to let people have free will  He loss of childhood is measured by his growing wisdom about the world and the past  As he loses his innocence  the  unknowing  or ignorance of the community is emphasized  His feelings are fuller  weightier  are tied to experience  even if they are not his own experiences  and consequence  On the other hand  his parents and the other adults in the community  as well as the children  have no forethought  no background knowledge  and are shielded from harsh reality   as well as beautiful  loving and warming memories  Their knowledge and lives are two dimensional  flat  whereas Jonas is learning that there are many ways to live  ways to build and structure communities  traditions   and most important  he learns about right and wrong  truth and lies  and choices  I loved this book  My only complaint is that the ending comes so abruptly and leaves you wanting more  I am sad that this story is finished  There is so much more I want to find out   I love this book 5 5 My first thoughts on this that it was middle grade so obviously there s no ramance in it  that without romance in a YA novel it s going to be completely boring  I took back my words i was totally wrong you have to have to have to read this book  The day I knew that this was going to be a movie and Taylor Swift is going to star as Rosemary the day I ordered this book using my own money  I had took a big risk at buying an unsure book means I m not confident that this would be one of my favs and those  worth wild buys   Yes i was wrong  Sue me  If tou have not read this book I highly recommend this  If your an  omg im not sure if i should get this without trusty reviews and sacrificing my money  buyer like myself  JUST BUY IT  IT S AMAZING  Character development was awesome  I know this society is pretty weird but hey  weird and differences makes a book even better to read  The more unexpected things to occur is most likely to be a 5 5 stars read for me     This book was  in a word  intense  With echoes of George Orwell s 1984  it presented a dystopian society  one that seemed utopian to its inhabitants  Nobody knew the truth  Nobody remembered any other way of life  Except The Receiver  Enter Jonas  just another Twelve entering adulthood  His predetermined path  and the year that followed  would provide the impetus by which humankind would ultimately be forever altered  A story of hope and the power of individuality  The Giver is a thought provoking and fascinating read  What took me so long to finally read this  Who knows  Better late than never  It was excellent  I thought that this book was amazing  The Giver is a truly unique story  I honestly wish there was more  but at the same time the ending makes so much sense  but still leaves me asking question  As I was reaching the end I got the feeling I often get when reading a great book  of anticipation to finish it but not wanting to finish it at the same time  the feeling for me is similar to that on Christmas Eve and the night before my birthday  it s the anticipation of how the book is going to end  I think The Giver is going to be a book I ll give to my sister and brother when they are older  and then to my children in the future  It will probably also become one of the few books I ll re read every now and again too    I absolutely cannot wait to watch the film now that I have finished it  I hope the film does the book justice   D This was one of those books that was so amazing that I had to stop several times during the reading and just sob  overcome with joy and grief and so many strong emotions that it was impossible to process all at once  I thought I had read it years ago  but I hadn t  I was mistaking it for another book of hers  Number the Stars  which won an award and was quite good  but THIS novel    This book is on a whole other level  Lois Lowry recounts in her twenty year reprint intro of the overwhelming reaction she has gotten to this book  The parents who wrote to tell her of their autistic teen daughter with selective mutism who had never spoken to them in her life but spoke to tell them they HAD to read this book  The young woman who had been planning suicide and changed her mind after reading this book  And so so many more  I am a voracious reader and I enjoy MANY books  This book goes beyond enjoying  This goes into Life Changing  A Life Changing book may come along once a generation  It is a thing of Rare Beauty  1984  Fahrenheit 451  The Giver  This is on that level and may be even better than the two examples I cited  If you haven t  read it now  Everything will change  I think The Giver is a great and well written book  The main character is Jonas  an Eleven who is going to be a Twelve  He goes through an amazing  inspiring  heartwarming  and adventurous tale  This is effectively written because it helps you understand that there is not only the present time  but there also is the past too  I think that people would like to read this book  I believe this because it has great points to show people and is very inspirational and emotional  I personally loved it because of how efficiently written and also because I was told it would be an excellent book which made it even better  The book starts in an ideal world where everything is set out and where nothing is ever wrong  But as the plot builds up  one will learn that this  ideal  world  was a place where living happily and deciding for yourself are impossible  Jonas is assigned to be the holder of memories  Why  The people in his community can t  just because these memories contain pain and suffering  They think it d be easier to get rid of these memories  which  to them  are quite hard to bear  What they didn t know is that these memories also have delight and love and joy in them  They re too fondled by the pain that they can t even feel the real essence of memories  and  that is  being happy  I gave this novel five stars because it has everything I look for in a book  a good plot  something that will help the world  etc  It is a warning  almost  to the future generations  that if they get too caught up with the sadness  they wouldn t be able to see the happiness It exceeded my expectations    This book   The Giver   by Louis Lowry  was a book I had been told about constantly in the weeks before I began reading it  After I asked my dad about it  I decided it was a must read for me  He told me that it was a famous book and I would enjoy it  And as he predicted  I very much did   This book is about an eleven year old boy named Jonas  living in a futuristic society that has eliminated all pain  fear  war  and hatred  When everyone gets to a certain age  they get assigned an assignment  Jonas gets assigned to be a Receiver of Memory  This is one of the most honored assignments and it is also a very rare one   One thing that impressed me about this book was how creative the setting was  It was very cool reading about this dark  serious environment  This is the main reason why I gave this book five stars in the rating   After Twelve  age isn t important  Most of us even lose track of how old we are as time passes    Jonas s father  Chapter 1  This quote represents how much one point in their lives can change the outcome of their futures  To conclude  I really enjoyed this book and I would recommend this to anybody who enjoys serious novels   The Giver is a great introductory dystopian novel for young readers  It presents the reader with interesting moral dilemmas that elicit deep thought when questioning whether population control  sensory removal  and the choosing of spouses should be at the mercy of the government  The novel is about a young boy  Jonas  who lives in a very restrictive community that shields its people from  Elsewhere   At the age of 12  children of the community are carefully assigned to their lifelong career  Jonas is given a special assignment and his entire existence in this community is put into question  It is a great read for young teens and a great book to re read as an adult for an enhanced perspective  While this book may seem like fiction on the outside  this book could be a summary of what can happen in the future  That is what I like about dystopian novels  they are written like fiction at first but the events displayed in them could be somewhat possible  In some of these novels  certain plot points might turn out to be true  That is what makes these kinds of stories interesting  suspense  The setting in this story is interesting as well  the concept of living in a safe place with no war or real problems  but certain things such as questioning the government or having a different memory are not allowed  This book also has elements of total censorship in the media  Overall  The Giver will be a great read for not just veterans of the dystopian genre  but people discovering the genre as well  This is a book that everyone should definitely read  Sometimes I find it hard to concentrate and read certain books  but with this one I couldn t put it down  This book illustrates why God gave us freedom of choice  Even though our freedom has resulted in a world full of bad mistakes that cause pain and suffering   choice also results in happiness and uniqueness   The Giver  is easy to follow and keeps you intrigued throughout the whole book  especially with the suspense of the ceremonies and wondering what job Jonas will be assigned    4 5 5 stars I had to withdraw 0 5 stars  because I wish it would ve been longer to leave a bit more room for character development and explanations Nevertheless  I d recommend this to any younger reader who wants to dive into the dystopian genre  What a wonderful book     read for the  5books7days challenge  I love this book  the idea of this perfect community is so cool   view spoiler  No one knows what they are doing is bad  such as when Jonas  dad killed the babies that were in any way sick or imperfect  even when it is bad in the eyes of our current culture   hide spoiler   I recently saw that there are more than just this one part on goodreads and am eager to read them  The cliffhanger on this book was the only part I disliked but now that I know there are more to read I appreciate the cliffhanger  I think Lois Lowry did a great job on this book  This is one of my favorite books if not my favorite book  I am going to read the next books  if interested click link below Gathering Blue This book is completely mind blowing  It seems like every science fiction book is the same  It starts with a little boy with nice parents  Then  either the mother or sometimes both of the parents die  leaving the boy in a horrible situation  You now it goes  But the Giver is unlike anything else you ever had or ever will read   i didn t expect much when i started reading this book but then i enjoyed it Lagi lagi tema dystopia yang diangkat  tapi  oh wow  awalnya saya kaget waktu beli bukunya  saya pikir akan tebal seperti divergent series atau the hunger games series Tapi buku ini cuma berisikan 232 halaman  Tipis untuk kategori novel dystopia Kisahnya mengenai seorang anak berumur 12 Tahun bernama Jonas yang diberi penugasan untuk menjadi penerima ingatan  Pemberi  The giver  memberikan ingatan ingatan masa lalu yang tidak pernah Jonas ketahui sebelumnya  Ingatan ingatan ini memberikan Jonas berbagai macam perasaan  Bahagia  takut  amarah  keberanian  dan kesedihan  Tugas Jonas ialah menjaga ingatan dan perasaan itu agar aman bersamanya jauh dari komunitas Dan  waow  walaupun tipis  tapi rasanya buku ini cukup kaya akan penceritaan tema dystopia yang sangat menarik untuk di baca  Komunitas yang di gambarkan di buku ini  sekilas mengingatkan saya pada faksi abnegation di divergent  2 kata untuk menggambarkan isi cerita buku ini  SINGKAT DAN PADAT  sebenarnya saya mau tambahain JELAS biar jadi 3 kata  tapi sayangnya di buku The Giver ini masih blm ada kejelasan  Mungkin karna masih ada 3 buku lagi yang menanti setelah judul ini  Well  let s see next apakah ada kejelasan di buku buku selanjutnya mudah mudahan saja ya  karena saya sudah tidak sabar membaca lanjutannya    Jonas s world is perfect  Everything is under control  There is no war or fear or pain  There are no choices  Every person is assigned a role in the Community  When Jonas turns twelve  he is singled out to receive special training from The Giver  The Giver alone holds the memories of the true pain and pleasure of life  Now  it is time for Jonas to receive the truth  There is no turning back  The Giver is such an amazing book  I literally couldn t put it down  I got in from the library and I ve had it just sitting on my shelf for weeks and weeks and I kept renewing it  I can t believe how long it took me to finally pick it up and actually read the thing  Every time that I had the chance to read  I would read  This book is filled with so many twists and turns and I absolutely loved it  I loved it so much  that I actually just bought The Giver Quartet from booktopia com How beautiful is that book  I mean come on  it s gorgeous When Jonas and his friends become a Twelve  everyone except for him gets chosen for a job based on the volunteer work they had done over the past few years  Jonas is chosen to become the next Receiver of Memories  which at first sounded like a  great honor  as everyone told him it was  up until he really did experience pain  I hated reading about how he got turned away when The Giver was in too much pain to give him some memories and I almost shed a tear on the train at one or fifteen moments This is one of the books that I had down to read for the Treesof Reverie readathon  and the only psychical book I read for it  unfortunately A few weeks ago  a youtuber that goes by the alias abookutopia  posted a review on the movie  at first I didn t understand why it went from black and white to suddenly going into colour  as I hadn t read the book yet  but now I understand  and I think it s so smart how she did that I m actually planning to watch the movie after I finish writing a few blog posts  and I honestly have a high expectation I love the relationship between The Giver and Jonas  and I understand how frustrated the two of them must be  with no one else understanding colour  and all the memories  I m so excited for my gorgeous copy to come in the post so I can enjoy the rest of the story I strongly recommend this book to pretty much everyone  Although the book has some mature topics such as  releasing  where people get killed for not being adequate enough  and even suicide  I really do think it s a great book for anyone to read Kaylee readerxpro This book takes place in a colorless world  where a 11 year old boy Jonas is about to attend his  Ceremony of 12   where he will get assigned his assignment of the community  or his career  When he gets to be the next Receiver  he is left to the current Receiver who begins to teach him everything he knows  For the first time Jonas learns the thrill of riding a sled down a hill and experiencing snow  from memories that the Receiver transfers to him  In his community  everyone is equal  and there is no suffering nor hunger  but no colors  music or love  But then  as Jonas begins receiving more and more memories  he suddenly begins longing for  Elsewhere  than his community  Some themes in this book are  individual vs  society  In the community Sameness is encouraged  and any individuality is discouraged  but Jonas stands out against everyone else in the community  because of his pale eyes and his ability to see in color  coming of age is another theme because as children grow older  they are given more responsiblity in the community  and then adulthood is forced upon them at a predetermined time   Wow  I just finished this book and I am trying to type out this review despite the tears in my eyes blurring the screen I can t believe I never read this book back in high school or spent all this time unaware of this truly great book  I mean I can see how books like The hunger games  Divergent  and other dystopian books were inspired Despite it being a short book  it still has an amazing powerful and emotional story of being different and wanting to save people from of a lifetime of sameness and greys  This is a book that I want to own and someday read to my kids and or teach in school some day  For various reasons  I missed out on this during middle school and high school  while it seems most teens these days read it then  and hated it  judging from a lot of reactions I received reading it  I was really glad to have read it now  especially with how so many people react to it at younger ages it would have been a shame to have hated it and missed out  This was a beautiful  thought provoking novel that was a lot more emotional than I was expecting  I don t normally react strongly to novels  but this one really had me going in parts because of how well written it is It went from having a fairly robotic feel to it  everyone does as they re told  and follows daily rituals that give pretty much no personality or characteristics to them   to a very strong  emotional  and painful story The ending was nice and open to interpretation  which completely fit the feel of the rest of the novel  Great book  I reread The Giver to teach to my middle school students  and the main thing that struck me as I was reading was how much I didn t remember  how subtle are the themes and currents running through this novel about a Utopian community which has achieved the ideal of Sameness  I enjoyed reading the book  and I m enjoying teaching it  too  There s a lot to discover in this book  Jonas lives in a  perfect  world where war  disease  and suffering have all been eradicated  Everything is in order  everything is under control  The people have no worries or cares  The Community strives for  sameness   in which everyone and everything are the same and equal  To help the Community function as a cohesive unit  each member is assigned a position in society  When Jonas turns twelve  the Community selects him to be the new  Receiver of Memories   Only the  Giver  knows the truth and memories of the past  and now he must pass these memories on to Jonas The Giver is a wonderful book  Lois Lowry skillfully crafted an intriguing and profoundly thoughtful story  She subtly creates an uneasy feeling that something is wrong with this  perfect world   The Community s advisors intend to establish security within utopian society  but they really establish a stifling dystopia  To protect people from the risks of making poor or wrong decisions in life  the advisors plan and dictate the lives of the people  I chose this classic  award winning novel for my Bookish Libraria Blog as a  Back in the Stacks  review book this past week It s actually  unbeknownst to me prior to my reading it  a dystopian novel about the coming of age and the coming to  wisdom and understanding  of a young boy in a futuristic society  A book I missed reading in school  but which my children were exposed to  this is somewhat dated in spots  I felt  but held the same sort of message that we hear and see in our own world and society today  That alone makes it worthy of reading It s a small book  but every page is profound  Lois Lowry knows how to write exactly like my Rhetoric professor wanted us to write   with precision and acuracy  Her every word has a purpose and meaning  And  in that instance  we discover that we need to pay attention  acutely  to what she s telling us This is a serious book with a warning for young and old  alike  I found it most poignant that she wrote  The Giver  for young people at their pivitol ages  It s a book that is meant to make them consider the society they are apart of without a doubt  but it s also meant to make them question the world and the ways of life they ve taken for granted  It hopes to help them shed the scales from their eyes and take the plugs from their ears  For that alone  I found it worthy of the Newberry Prize It seems to me that as adults we fear young people  We want to corral them  to keep them in check  to make sure they don t skate board near the Library  There s alot about them that reeks of uncontrollable power and unhinged disaster  There s impulse on edge  and the half here and there sense of what s going to really damage their lives and the lives around them  and what s not  Because of this  teens and pre teens have this magical quality to them   this freshness of vision coupled with this wildness of vision like the boys in  Lord of the Flies   like those vampires and psychics and witches they  wanna be  in the YA novels  In  The Giver  we see such power in the young protagonist  He is pent up and on the verge of destruction in several instances  We see him risk breaking serious rules only to see him pull back and turn to the side of wisdom to protect those he loves  This is the quality that Lois Lowry is telling the young to emulate  this is the hidden treasure that the Giver has to offer this potential to create a new system lovingly  or simply to destroy mindlessly Ms Lowry acknowledges the terrible strength and power of the young adult to be victorious or to vanquish and offers an instruction of vision  values and valor  In a society where everything is ordered  equal  peaceful and happy   life is not valued  and people deemed less than fit for society are done away with like old newspaper It s a book worthy of literary and humanitarian awards  and it s a book worthy of being the classic it s become I strongly recommend  The Giver  to everyone  young and old  who hasn t already read it   and even to those who have  It s a good time to reread this book  It s an especially good time to read it   Deborah TheBookishDame I thoroughly enjoyed reading The Giver  Sometimes when reading a book the imagery is written so well that it plays out like a movie in your mind  The Giver did this for me  The decision is left up to the reader as to when in our time or even if the events of the story happen in our world  This book had me questioning the very nature of free will and  given the responsibility of knowing the truth  what I would do with that knowledge  Whether to take a stand and have freedom  or turn a blind eye to injustice in an ignorant world  This book held the view that to create utopia all differences expect those that are absolutely necessary must be removed  To remove conflict all good and bad had to be removed from even memories  The ability to make individual choices is the root of many problems and this society removed all choices  Medications were mandated to ensure strong desires were eliminated and the resulting society was orderly but lost its color and music  What are we willing to give up for order and safety  We often as a society and individuals push for safety and security but what is the trade  When things go wrong in peoples lives or tragedy strikes we often ask how can God allow this to happen  Many clergy have attempted to provide an answer some better than others but this book paints a picture of life without free will   The Giver isn t your usual book  though it s suitable for both children and adults of many different ages  I personally believe Lois Lowry did a beautiful job creating this story  I ve heard that there are different ways to view this story  Some simply believe it s a children s tale  others see it as obvious symbolism  sometimes upsetting  sometimes not  The Giver is the story of Jonas  an Eleven  soon to be a Twelve  Upon this special day  he is given an Assignment that will change not only his life  but everyone around him  He comes from a community that believes it is a perfect society  with a few minor mistakes here and there from its people  Jonas is selected as The Giver and is separated from everyone in his community to train with the current Giver  Through this book  you will smile  You will laugh  You may possibly even cry  I have always enjoyed this book  I have read it countless times  I ve always felt a strong connection to Jonas  though I ve no idea why Jonas appears to be far more mature and perceptive than the others his age  When he begins his training to become the new Giver  he tries to be the very strongest that he can be  He knows it will be difficult  yet he continues to go  His training changes him  He is no longer a child  I believe Jonas gives us strength  He decides to escape with Gabriel  a newchild that was scheduled to be released  from the community and free the memories he holds in order to enlighten the rest of his community  I believe he has extraordinary courage in doing so  The Giver wanted change  but never knew how to change the way the community worked The setting is sometime in the future  possibly near or extremely distant  The story is set in a community where there are rules we may find outrageous  but work well for them  The themes of this book are memory and individualism  I read that Lowry was inspired to write this book after a visit with her father  whom had lost his long term memory  This book explains to us that without memory  there is no pain  The Giver is the only one who remembers pain in the community  It is so very important to recall things  even pain  in order to experience human life  Since there was no memory of pain  they didn t wish to ever do anything that could possibly result in conflict creating pain  such as relationships and activities  This also created a lack of nostalgia  Without these memories  there is no pain  But there is also no true happiness  Now  along the lines of individualism  Jonas was seen just as everyone else  He was an Eleven  nothing too special  He became singled out the day he became a Twelve  Throughout the rest of the story  we learn more and more about Jonas  journey to become an individual  His journey shows that it is good to be an individual rather than just like everyone else I have always loved this book  I ve read it countless time  twice over the summer  and I m positive that I will continue to read it  I would recommend this book to anyone  It takes a little time to get used to the rules and phrases of the community  but anyone can soon get the hang of it   This is one of my favorite books of all time I would not care to read this over about a million times I still wouldn t get bored  I read this back in 2013 with my ELA class and I can honestly say I have never regretted it  Of course you can say the movie was a bit on the dull side and you probably wouldn t get it unless you happened to read the book  I rate the book 5 5  Lois Lawry is a top notch writer and I have read a few of her other books she gets into her writing and never leaves any details out once I finished the Giver series my mind was like WOW  I absolutely loved this book  I enjoyed the plot that kept you guessing but also enjoyed how it was such an easy and quick read  The ending of the book had me questioning whether or not I liked the book because it left me with a cliffhanger  But then I found out that this is only the first book of a trilogy  That is the information that really had me loving every aspect of the book  ending included  Since I never read The Giver when it was assigned to me in middle school  I was so excited to continue reading and figure out all the little quirks of this mysterious community that they lived in  I was so interested that I ended up reading the whole thing in a day  I think that this will be a relatively easy book to get middle school students engaged in  With the right active and stimulating introduction activity  I feel that students will eagerly turn the pages of The Giver  The deeper I got into the book  the more I thought about activities discussions that I could have with students  Just the idea of not being able to decide your own future would be plenty to get the classroom sparked with interest  I m looking forward to teaching this YA book to students in the future  I can t wait to continue reading the series to see what becomes of Jonas and Gabriel along with how different the community becomes after so many memories being revealed to them with Jonas  absence   While reading this book I kept thinking of my teenage son and I recalled how for so many young boys the world is literal and their emotions are blooming with little depth  They do not reflect on life or death or why  I asked my son if he had read this book and what he thought  He said yes and then I got the grunt and shrug  Clearly it had not rocked his world I thought how interesting this book would have been for me as an eleven year old  The same age as when my period began  I saw the red so clearly against the white and I thought I was dying  Had I ever really noticed or seen red before this moment  At the same time my emotions started riding the hormonal roller coaster ride  The message from this book that feelings and experiences can be shared and that they allow us to live fully would have made the roller coaster ride perhaps more bearable  It s been a long time since last having read a book I would describe as perfect  The Giver truly is a perfect story  At least in my opinion  I was deeply moved by this short novel  I still can t stop thinking about it  the storyline  the ending  the ideas   The Giver is categorised as a  Young Adult  novel  though I m certain readers of any age  perhaps I should say from 12 and up  will enjoy reading this  and on so many levels  I wouldn t be in the slightest bit surprised to find this on a University reading list  and would be thrilled to discover this as required reading for my daughter when she attends secondary school  After seeing this recommended on the Amazon 100 Books list  then reading the reviews  I knew I must read it and so purchased a copy of my own  This is a very important book  It needs to be read  shared and discussed  Due to some of the themes and storylines  I can understand   though by NO means agree   why this book has been rejected  possibly banned   by some institutions  I would certainly not allow my nine year old daughter to read it until she is a little older  despite the free and fluid language which she would certainly be able to digest  I am  however  going to petition my city libraries to acquire at least one copy of the book so that others may enjoy it too  The Giver is heartbreaking and provocative  open to so much interpretation  particularly in those final few scenes   I am so glad to have read this amazing short novel before being exposed to the promotion and upcoming release of the film  It is by no means a  feel good  novel  but certainly ranks at the very top of my favourite works of fiction   i finished the book and it was good but it leaves you hanging Every time I read this  I m filled with a flurry of emotions  Much to my surprise  I actually really enjoyed the movie and I don t understand all of the negativity behind it  A minha opiniao em video   https   www youtube com watch v r9F_a    The Giver was a very good book  In the beginning it talks about Jonas  a boy in group eleven  In the community he lives in  it is almost perfect  No crime  no lies  and no stealing  Then when people go into the twelfth group  they are given their life s job  Everyone gets jobs that suit them  When Jonas is about to be called  he is skipped  At the end he is told he is to become The Receivers apprentice  The receiver keeps memories for the town  He starts to give Jonas memories  Like a sled ride  A baby that his father cares for  start getting sick and not sleeping  Jonas starts giving him pleasant  gentle memories  Eventually Jonas decides to escape to the elsewhere when the baby might get his father fired  The Giver helps him get ready to escape  Jonas has to then escape early and grabs the baby  his fathers bike with a baby seat   and some food  He then escapes into the cold nothingness  At the end of the book he finds the sled that was from the memory of the giver  He and the baby climb on and as they go down the snowy hill  exhausted  they begun to see lights    Reading this book was very interesting  The thought of people having no feelings is something I can t imagine  In this book  it tells us how these little things that are so ordinary in our lives can be so new and surprising to a person who has never experienced it  The little things include  seeing colors  hearing music  and having the feeling of love  You will learn how the main character will experience these things for the first time  A world with no music  colors  and love is just an impossible thought  I highly recommend this book and you won t regret reading it  Awesome book  sometimes I thought it would never end  but at the end I did not want it to end  Still one of my favorite books ever   I read this when I was about 11 and in love with Sailor Moon  I used to hate books that were not anime  had drawings in it  or were thick  This book made me love all those  This is the book that made me open up to reading different things and made me try new types of books  a decision which I do not regret  I love this book so much   Joseph said it was a good book  and it was absolutely amazing  I think that the lesson in this book is to tell that there could be a world like this coexisting while we live  Definitely not on Earth  but probably somewhere in the universe  in a different galaxy  in a different solar system  No feelings  no color  no music  What should become of us if this happened to our world in the future  And if it should  what would we feel if we asked for a release  Definitely no pain or grief because everything would be well planned and seem like it s meant to be  How could we survive without knowing God  How could we feel no love  see no color  or hear happy songs  And what would the Receiver of Memories feel  Probably weighed down by all those thoughts  We could become like that if we aren t careful and don t use our time wisely  What with all the technology and INTERNET the biggest web of lies that people have woven to catch and manipulate poor innocent people   we could forget to be active and well  we re human  But I do know that God will let us live a life of happiness  love  FREEDOM  and color  Miracles happen and if we serve our purpose in life  we can become the creation that God intended to make of us   Sigh  Wish I owned this book     I hope Mrs  Q likes the book and learns its message  Hope there s a quiz for me to take at school  Sorry Mrs  Lama  I never intended to bring you sad memories of the book  I never would want euthenasia to hurt you or your twin because that s exactly what release is  Too bad Mrs  Q didn t like it      P S  To all those people who have read and are reading this book right now  doesn t the Giver on the cover of the book look like Dumbledore  Jonas seemingly lives the perfect life  He gets to ride his bike everyday  He excels in school  He has two great friends  and he enjoys doing his community service  He loves to reflect on his life  especially when it comes to watching his younger sister  Lily  experience the world  It isn t until Jonas  twelfth year that things take a turn  Jonas  family not only takes in a foster baby  Gabriel  but Jonas is also chosen to be the new Receiver of the community  His new role involves him taking on all of the memories of the entire community from many generations past to the present memories that the Society does not want individual members having  As Jonas comes into this knowledge  he recognizes that the Society is not all it seems to be I personally loved this book and became very fond of it as I was reading it  It is right down the same alley as Fahrenheit 451  1984  and Brave New World  This book instilled in me a motivation to not accept the truths that are presented to me  but to challenge what I am told to believe  Jonas  journey is much like anyone else s  except Jonas quickly recognizes all that is wrong with the world and acts just as timely  Perhaps the intent of this book is to instill that same ferocity in the readers Themes include  abortion murder Definitely a 100 000 000 infinity out of 10  This was so good I loved the whole story so much Lewis Lowry did a fantastic and awesome job of writing this  The last few chapters made me sad and happy all together  and the ending was really good  One of my  1 favorites                                                                                     This novel falls into the category  a book with themes related to those we ve studied in class in the 2nd half of the year This novel relates to the topic of dystopian societies that we have been discussing in class recently while reading Kazuo Ishiguros s  Never let me go   Much like Ishiguro s novel   The Giver  is set in a dystopian community where the government thinks that what it is doing is beneficial to society  While reading the novel the reader begins to ponder if the government s actions are necessary or morally correct  A quote that really fascinating me was  For the first time  he heard something that he knew to be music  He heard people singing  Behind him  across vast distances of space and time  from the place he had left  he thought he heard music too  But perhaps  it was only an echo   It made me further understand the novel and how horrible it would be living in as society like the one the novel has set  I can only imagine what it would be like to never have the joy of hearing the sound of music or seeing in colour which is what the characters in the novel have to deal with their whole lives  It goes to show how wrong the government is in taking away these simple pleasures of daily life from its citizens and made me appreciate how lucky I am to live in a society where I am free The character that most intrigued me in the novel was Jonas  On the outside he is a typical eleven year old boy living in his community  Jonas though is quite different from the rest of his peers because unlike most of them he thinks deeply about the world around him  However the Elders who are in charge of running the community and giving each person an occupation that would suit them at the appropriate age notice this about him  Jonas is chosen to have a special role in society  he is chosen to be the receiver  The receiver is given memories from The Giver who is a wise elderly man who quickly becomes fond of Jonas  Jonas s job as the receiver has given him a great deal of responsibility because he is the only one in his society who can remember what living in the real world feels like  He is the only one who can feel pain or love  He is the only one who has listened to music or seen in colour  Jonas is different from the past Receivers because as he gains all these new memories he begins to question the society he lived in and if what the Elders are doing is morally correct  Jonas makes the courageous yet highly dangerous decision to run away from his community alongside his younger sister  Jonas is a symbol of bravery and has taught me that if you believe that something isn t right than you must stand up and do something about it even if it means you are the odd one out This novel made me think more in depth about the society I live in  The world we live in today is far from perfect but we should be grateful to live in a society where we are able to express ourselves and have basic rights that the characters in this novel had stolen from them  I read this book when I was in junior high and it has always stuck with me  The story is such a beautiful tale of a boy who is just trying to find his place in the world when he knows he s different and can see things that others can t  As soon as he recieves his calling  it is made clear that he was a diamond in the rough the entire time and that it was time for him to shine and be what he was destined to be  Being an awkward pre teen at the time  I really connected with the character and discovering what the secret was turned out to be as fascinating as anything else that the book contained  The small things that we take for granted were such a wonderful gift to this young boy and to relive the first time you had seen any of it in your childhood through his adolescent eyes is unmistakingly phenominal If you liked this book  I would recommend reading its sequel that was released many years later called The Messenger  The Messenger  The same keen and awkward perspective on the world is adopted and set into a different life  Again  absolutely gorgeous  one of my favorites  Jonas lives in a society where sameness could be used to describe just about every aspect of the society s culture  He himself does a pretty good job at fitting in with the rest  never calling any attention to himself  When Jonas is preparing for the ceremony of the twelve  the point in which he is given his assignment  he is nervous of what his assignment will be  Jonas never served all of his hours in one spot he worked all over sometimes with his friend Asher  and other times just exploring the different aspects of numerous assignments  When the time comes for the ceremony Jonas is astounded when he is skipped over  At the end he is told he was selected by the committee to be the assistant receiver of memory  This is the most honorable assignment of all but with it Jonas is told comes great pain  When Jonas meets the Giver he begins receiving memories  all of which to start are happy  As time goes on he starts receiving some of the bad memories and they are a lot to handle for a boy of the age of 12 Jonas receives memories from the Giver for a long time  A week or so before the next ceremony of the twelve s all of Jonas  talk about the nonsense of the job finally pay off  The Giver who at this point has developed a wonderful bond with Jonas comes up with a plan for Jonas to escape with the memories  The night before the ceremony Jonas escaped by bike bringing along Gabe  a little boy who was going to be killed the following day  and of they went  Eventually they made it and they succeeded in reaching safety outside of the society they were once a part of My favorite part of the story was when Lois Lowry was describing Jonas  journey with Gabe  I was really able to visualize the surroundings based upon his description  When Jonas reached the point where he sled down the hill it was a great joyous moment for the reader because as you turned the page and closed the book you realized he did it There were many themes throughout the story such as defiance or maturity but the one that I think had the most effect on the story and the choices the characters made was sameness  Sameness is equality to a whole other level  Not only is everyone treated the same but they grow up in a way that denies the slightest individualism to occur  Sameness also resulted in Jonas taking drastic measures to get away from this sameness because he was the only one who new what was missing  All of this shows how influential sameness was to the story To finish of this report I would recommend this book to anybody  because I enjoyed it very much  The world of Lowry is a unforgettable one  And so are her Characters  Amazing series  D  If you are like me  you are just now finding out that Lowry s classic has sequels  Man  where have I been  In reading the Giver again this fall because of the 2014 The Giver film  I have been able to spark interesting conversations about how this book can represent an artifact that effectively illustrates issues that some people may have with individuals who jump on aboard onto the  I m colorblind wagon   The book does mention how the color or the ethnicity of a person has caused conflict that has lead to great destruction and hurt in the past  and due to the conflicts created by skin tone and other differences of people  the founding fathers of this unique community within The Giver feel that it would be best if they create new generations of residents who are literally colorblind  only seeing images similar to how our grandmothers  grandmothers would see cinema shows in gray  and intellectually naive  But Jonas  or others like Jonas and the Giver  reminds us of the danger of being absolutely colorblind  it creates a hunger  one is oppressing something that does not have to be done away with  This book is still relevant today  The book  The Giver  by Lois Lowry  1993  the dystopian teenage classic is an exciting  engaging  and suspenseful book  but sadly it does not have a very understandable ending  It won 1994 Newbery Medal The book is about a boy named Jonas whose world is perfect until he is selected by the elders to have the job of the Receiver of Memory In the beginning you might think it is a utopian genre  but has you read you may change your mind to a dystopian genre  At first you may think it is a utopian because it says  There is no war or fear or pain   then later in the book you may think it is dystopian genre because it says in the book that if there is twins  one is released  and when you get to a certain age you get released  Also you do not get to pick your jobs The ending makes you want to read the next book  Gathering Blue   2000   then the next book  The Messenger  2004   The ending though  had the disappointing disadvantage of that nobody knew about the next book  but if you read it recently you have the advantage that the other books are out Some of the parts of the book are inappropriate for the book mentions  bathing the old  so maybe its not the best for 11 years and younger  so a better book for teens to adults I hope you enjoy the book  The Giver  or if already did I hope you agree with me  This is one of the only winners of the Newbury Award that I ve thought deserved that honor  My seventh Review Month review  Just learned I might be going on a short vacation so I m trying to get caught up on reviews before I go                                           I read this last year  and it was one of those rare books that lived up to the hype  I had to read this and Anthem by Ayn Rand for an assignment in a class where we were reading classic works of dystopian literature  I came to appreciate Anthem over time because I hated it when I first finished it  but I loved this book as soon as I turned the last page And what better time to review it than now  with the movie adaptation of it coming out in less than a month I m not quite sure whether I ll like the film though  Jeff Bridges is definitely the best one for the part  but it looks like they have created scenarios that are not in the book  And they gave acting god Meryl Streep a role that was minor in the book  and expanded upon it  I don t consider that a good idea The movie also looks a little too action packed  I wish it was like the book  it would be slow and really have a plot that feels like it was being thought up as you read it  a plot so complex it seems almost real I also really don t like the actor playing Jonas  He looks like one of those pretty boy model types who can t actually act  And the acting in a film is what can make or break it  Oh  and did I mention that fucking Taylor Swift is in the film  shudders It s almost certain to be a bonafide mess                                          I was also reminded to review this because I follow the film s Facebook page and this popped up earlier  This seems to be the main thing about the film that Lois Lowry loved I thought that was hilarious  The one thing Lowry loved the most was the baby who played Gabriel                                           Here is the Goodreads description of the book for the two of you who haven t read the book Jonas  world is perfect  Everything is under control  There is no war or fear or pain  There are no choices  Every person is assigned a role in the Community  When Jonas turns twelve  he is singled out to receive special training from The Giver  The Giver alone holds the memories of the true pain and pleasure of life  Now  it is time for Jonas to receive the truth  There is no turning back The true power of this book  along with many others  before The Hunger Games came along and ruined the genre  don t get me wrong The Hunger Games is an amazing novel  it just inspired so many bad ripoffs   is that it deals with the search for your inner identity and self  Before Jonas meets the Giver he is a pretty boring and one dimensional character who blends into his surroundings with ease  which is done purposefully on Lowry s part After he meets the Giver and has his mind opened up  due to these memories he receives  he becomes an entirely different character who finds a purpose in the world  But in this world having a purpose is the most dangerous thing you can possibly possess  And Jonas becomes a threat to this supposed utopia Ahh  there s Meryl  I bet she ll be fabulous as the villain of the film  even if she is a largely made up character Anyway  back to the review  or whatever it is you want to call my ramblings It is at this point in the novel  after Jonas recieves the memories  that he realizes there is more to his world outside this  community  It is also at this point in the novel where he realizes that he has never seen colors  The first color he sees is the red of an apple  and I can t even begin to explain how well written this moment in the book is  Lowry had to describe color as if she has never seen it herself  And she s does it perfectly and makes it breathtakingly beautiful  And she doesn t even really describe the apple  but you know what Jonas has seen  It all happens when Jonas is playing catch with his friend Asher  with the apple  As it flies through the air Jonas sees a change  But suddenly  Jonas had noticed  following the path of the apple through the air with his eyes  that the fruit had well this is the part that he couldn t adequately understand the apple had changed Then it was in his hand  and he looked at it carefully  but it was the same apple  Unchanged  The same size and shape  a perfect sphere  The same nondescript shade  about the same shade as his own tunic See what I mean                                          It turns out that the  government  off this community have been giving them medicine to keep the citizens domicile and make them obey  And to take away their vision of colors because color can inspire creativity  The only reason Jonas saw the apple  is because he quite taking his shots at the Giver s suggestion                                          This book is brilliant and even though some people have reasons for hating it  mostly because of the ambiguous ending  I still think it is somewhat of a modern classic 5 brilliant  shining  golden stars out of 5                                         If you haven t read this book you are missing out  It can really change you    This will forever be one of my favorite books  because of the memories it brings back for me  I read The Giver in my 5th grade class in 1994  The Giver himself reminded me so much of my 5th grade teacher  He was wise  caring  and eager for us to learn everything  the good and bad  He tenderly taught us about both tragedies and joy  He taught us the beauty in learning new things  and the beauty in really living our lives  He was a great human being who lost his battle with cancer 10 years thereafter  I will forever love this book as a memory of the wonderful teacher I was so lucky to have  The Giver is a fascinating dystopia about Jonas  who is an Eleven in his rule regulated utopian community  and he is about to become a Twelve  upon which time he will receive his job assignment in the community  He is anxious about his assignment and doesn t know what his job will be  He is selected to be the Receiver The Receiver receives memories from the Giver of what life was like before the creation of the community  As Jonas receives memories  he experiences joy  pain  sickness  colors  and the gamut of human emotion  He decides that it is not good that everyone should be subjected to the  Sameness  that is present in the community  He leaves the community so that all his memories and experiences can be distributed on the community I loved this book  It is an excellent dystopia which brings up the importance of human feeling  It brings up the idea of opposite  We need to understand good to understand evil  We need to know pain to know joy  Without the opposite  everything is just the same  In the third or fourth grade  while my friends across the hall were assigned The Giver  I was in the other class that was instead assigned some forgettable and obvious inferior book   I am 70  sure it was Johnny Tremain   As I grew up  I would constantly surprise people by saying I hadn t read The Giver  Once the movie came out  the nagging grew  and I thought  why not Did you know that this beloved  controversial book  assigned in primary schools all over the U S   is the first in a quartet  Since YA novels are nice  easy reads  I decided to read them all  Painting an alternate reality from scratch  The Giver is nicely crafted for young readers  It also remains provocative for older readers  Lowry illustrates a post apocalyptic world wherein the highly structured Community assigns everyone their jobs and their families  The quasi liberal principle of Sameness is touted  and daily medications suppress feelings of love  To top it off  a single Receiver of Memory shoulders pre apocalyptic sensations and the knowledge of human history  The Giver introduces many issues including the nature of emotions  relationships  access to knowledge  destiny  and death It s not hard to see why it might behoove primary schools to assign this book  It prompts important questions of ethics like  What would you do if you were Jonas   and  Is Sameness fair   in reading level appropriate prose  with a relatable young protagonist By far  The Giver was the best of the bunch  The Giver is an easy read and a reminder to keep questioning what values shape our society and how we determine our individual and collective futures  In comparison  the sequels are subpar  While Lowry tries to tie the stories of the four loosely connected protagonists together  the result is uneven  Some decisions and details are wrapped up a little too nicely  and a few plot holes are conveniently ignored The sequels are ignorable  They seem like an unneeded attempt to extend the legacy of The Giver  I will say that the second book  Gathering Blue  touches more on death  authority  and fairness  and somewhat broadens the scope of issues examined  Son  the fourth book  drags on but has a fun Faustian character  As for sequels as a whole  the characters are likable enough but they lack development  and the other villages  societies are mildly intriguing but it feels like fanciful plot embellishments Read The Giver if you like easy reads and like to reflect on alternate realities  Overall  the sequels don t add much substance  If you re simply curious  the Wikipedia articles will do  Apparently I need to read The Giver once a decade  I read it for school right when it first came out  again for a college sociology course  and now in advance of the film adaptation  and because I found out there are three other books in the series   I liked it when I read it as a kid  but a lot was lost on me  The first thing that post pubetal me saw in my second visit was a fuller understanding of  The Stirrings  What I got the most from my third visit was perhaps less positive  I pondered on the heteronormativity of the book s community  This is a world where babies come from assigned birthmothers  probably artificially insemenated  The babies are assigned to the families and because all people take pills to put down the stirrings once they hit adolescence  it seems to be a world without active sexual desire or intimacy  If procreation is not tied to the family structure  why a rigid father and mother  with one son and one daughter  idealized nuclear family  I suppose I shouldn t expect a 1993 kid s book to be a trend setter in this and perhaps the fact that this community is ultimately derided for its pursuit of sameness shows that this nuclear family structure is a potential problem  I think this is ultimately where its kid lit ness holds it back from exploring the full nature of its ideas  Of course  this time around I also pondered that The Giver would have sexual memories as well  that these might be very important memories even  but the kid lit ness means these are not even remotely discussed  even in the context of the stirrings The utopic vision of The Giver is great and the first two thirds are pretty great  The ending feels a bit rushed and slightly disappointing  The other thing that stands out this time is that the ending is probably not a happy ending but a descent into memory  It is more ambiguous   In The Giver  Jonas finds the truth about his beloved and disciplined community  Jonas keeps the people protected by receiving all their pass memories  people would panic once the frightful memories return  Jonas getting along like others should in the community  until one day finding out he has to take the responsibility of someone that has access to all the happy and sad memories  The book is similar to Divergent and Hunger Games because the main character lives in a community that they think is perfect  and until something special or big changed their life to get them to realize that there s a new perspective of their community  I personally like how the author puts humor into Jonas  sister  While trying to get into the conflict  the author puts humor into Asher  Jonas  friend  and his sister so the reader won t be bored  This book strongly relates to me  I live in a society that isn t completely revealed  so therefore  I can t really fully trust and understand the community  Like in every part of the world  there will always be secrets  In this book  Jonas also have to make choices that are hard to think about  If you re interested in dystopia  I recommend you read this book  it s very interesting  I guarantee you ll like the author and this book  The book is very tense and fun for those who love plot twists   Have you ever wanted to leave a place so bad you dont care about facing death  well in this story thats really a mentioned part in the story  This book is non fiction and i have a really strong opinion on this book i give it 5 stars This books setting is A foreign country somewhere in the sky In this book a boy has a bad life and dosent really realizes and dosent think much of it untill he recieves a life long job well to sum it few weeks or momths later he has a baby brother  keep that in mind  He goes to his job as ths reciever to get trained to become the Giver he is taught and shown things on the outside world  and in a conversation the outside world comes up and he wants to leave  The Giver tells him a plan to leave  also keep in mind that theres is no color in this boxed out foreign world  So he takes his little brother Gabe and leaves the place and this leads to them getting to a whole other place which has color and things that he was shown in the other place and thus leads to him crying The point of view  3rd person omniscient really helped tell us how everyone important felt and thats really important in books like this that are so heartwarming and sad  The passaye help establish the conflict which is person vs society because the boy was in a war against society and was sought to be diffirent because he wanted to leave so bad  I Think he a brave Beast My opinion on this book is very strong i consider one of the most inspirational books of all time and desrves more stars  The book is so amazing amd i reccomemtpd it to anyone  now if only i knew how to give it stars  The book will make you cry but in a good way  Thats how good it is so great  I think this because of how the story acts and ties into everything else in the story In conclusion i reccomend this story to anyone  I rate the book a 12 5  If you read this book you would wish you didnt so you could read it again  This book IS AMAZINGGG    Hmm  Ahem  What can be said about The Giver that already hasn t been said  I won t lie  it was boring and thick at times  I found it hard to care about the characters at all  However  I also know that s not the point  The message  which is shoved down your throat constantly  is undeniable and originally presented  Freedom of choice is not something to be messed with  I really enjoyed the way Lowry almost demands that the reader apply his or her own frame of reference to rationalize the story  I can t think of another book I ve read that makes me visualize a template or an outline that the author may have been using when writing their novel  maybe Ulysses  duh    With The Giver  it s right there in front of you  almost just the bones of an idea  The bottom line is that it should be required reading in school  It s educational without being preachy  and isn t that the point 2011 Update  Strangely  I found The Giver to be more powerful the second time around  especially the ending  Maybe it s because I have a newborn this time  but the ending was very emotional for me  Perhaps in my advancing age I grow softer around the edges and the middle  Jonas didn t really know what to do  but that changed when he turns twelve  He was sitting on his chair  hands sweating and combing against each other  wondering why the teacher didn t call him on stage for graduation  This upset him and bad thoughts and worry came to him  as he saw his best friends are called and assigned to their duties proudly But then  something else happened  The reason Jonas wasn t called to altar was because he was different than anybody  He was different than any other profession  He can feel I love this book because it gave me emotional attachment to Jonas  and especially the pain The Giver has to suffer for a really  long time  Jonas wondered how bearing all those memories made him weaker  But as the story advances  he realized that it was a dangerous thing  bearing all those memories  without nobody to share I m totally into this book a hundred percent  The prose was clearly made for young adults  but its meanings are rich  Lois Lowry was a true genius  In this dystopian world  there is no pain or suffering  But there are also no choices  no color  no music  and no memories  In the change to  Sameness  the world has been altered to ensure the betterment of humanity  But is it really better  Jonas  a 12 year old boy  has been selected to be  The Receiver   an honored position in the community  who is responsible for personally holding the memories of humanity  to guide future decisions   This sacrifice allows this burden to be lifted from the shoulders of society  Throughout his training Jonas struggles with concepts which have been stolen and hidden from him up to this point  How he reacts will shape the future of his community  and possibly the world as a whole  A great and concise novel  The Giver forces us to examine our own personal beliefs about society  our place in it  and what can should be sacrificed to ensure our survival and happiness    What dates did you read the novel start reading September 12   October 5 yes a British author A boy that whats people in the community to have and feel things that he can feel and have feeling and have kids love their husband and kids  Him feeling that if people in his community can feel they can be regular people  while saving the little infant that they was about to kill   Give me a quote and its significance  Of course they needed to care  It was the meaning of everything   this quote is meaningful because he saying that everybody need to care have feelings  Would you recommend it to others yes i would recommend this to people because it a good book to read and makes you to read the book  The book was great  The only thing I didn t like was that there was no color  Other then that I loved the book  if I were to choose a book out of the series it would be The Giver  So if you haven t read the book I suggest you find this book at the library and start reading   So  the book is about a boy named Jonas and he lives in the most nicest community ever  The community has stricked rules and you need to follow them  They each get picked a volunteer job and Jonas got the most important job  His dad brought home a baby to train him better and Jonas starts to love him  If the baby isn t trained and is to small and hasn t learned anything than they wil kill them and that s what they were going to do with the baby  What will Jonas do to save the baby  Quick read  great story  not that great of an ending  But that was the ending the author wished for  The story will continue in our minds and we will fall back and forth between Jonas and Gabriel dying or they live finally away from the sameness  I never had the opportunity to read this book until now  There are many books written since I was a child that I have missed out on  So between my erotic romance  murder mysteries and best sellers I need to find time to read some award winning children books and young adult  I have  So I would encourage others to do the same  It is worth your valuable time I highly recommend this book  Now I will allow myself to see the movie   The worst part of holding the memories is not the pain  It s the loneliness of it  Memories need to be shared     The Giver  Lois LowryDark and provocative  it is a simple yet profound story telling of a seemingly Utopian world where the Community never knew of hunger  or war  or pain  or death or grief  As well as of colors  of choices  of love  and of life Overnight  I rediscovered my love for words printed on a page   This book  purchased for PhP 5 00 at a garage sale  deserves a reflection paper     This was an awesome book  I didn t realize the civilization was based on  sameness  until it was pointed out by the Giver  It reminded me of a Stepford wives kind of existence  I cant imagine a world where you do not chose your mate or make your own children with the one you love  Children being assigned to couple is just unreal  ANd having your spouse assigned to you is equally unreal  I see that all that was to never have to feel the pain of lose but I think thats so not worth it to not be able to experience love  I was a bit confussed about the ending  When Jonas and Gabrielle went sliding down the hill on a sled towards the welcoming lights  was that real or was Jonas reliving a memory  A great book  I liked it  Wow    this is a real thought provoking experience  Every home library should have this  Monumental  I read this in college and even then it redefined how I look at all books  It proved that  young adult  fiction can be thought provoking  This is science fiction at it s best  The world Lowry creates seems lived in  simple and  for reasons to subtle to define  an unsettling place  This novel is simply a classic  I clearly remember the  twist  in the middle of the book when the main character realizes something is missing from his world  I remember re reading the text  certain that it couldn t be true  but Lowry had ingeniously toyed with my perceptions as a reader  This book is challenging and heartbreaking  It forces the reader to question what is a perfect world  It s an intriguing journey certainly  One everyone should take  The less you know going in the better  But I warn you not to seek a happy ending  Lowry deliberately leaves her readers with questions  Questions we should all ask ourselves P  S  Some of those questions are answered in the sequels Gathering Blue and Messenger  Also  if you dislike this book  I suggest you try reading the sequels as they are the opposite counterpoint to this novel   Lois Lowry s dystopian novel The Giver  takes place in a place called  The Community  a futuristic society where life is perfect  They have converted to  sameness   Which means that nothing ever changes  There aren t seasons  snow  or even hills  Jonas is a normal boy  living a normal life  The eats the same food and drinks the same drinks as everyone else  but on the day when they are assigned their jobs  they skip Jonas but then come come back around to him at the end of the ceremony  They give him one of the most respected jobs possible  Receiver of Memories  The job came with a price though  He won t ever be normal again  He gets the burden of bearing all the memories of everything bad that was replaced by sameness  It really bares down on him and it seems that he can t have fun anymore  One lesson I learned is that knowledge isn t always power  In the rest of the essay  this point is stressed  Throughout the the story themes that knowledge isn t always power appears multiple times  When Jonas is going through the the process of receiving all the memories Jonas is walking by a field by the river on a free day  He sees some kids playing a game of Good guys and bad guys  It says   Feelings surged within Jonas  He felt himself walking forward into the field   Your hit Jonas   Asher yelled from behind a tree   Pow  Your hit again   Jonas stood alone in the center of the field  Several of the kids raised their heads and looked at him uneasily   If he hadn t known about war that wouldn t have affected him at all   Jonas isn t allowed to talk about being the Receiver of Memories to anyone so that is one thing that is keeping him separate from everyone else in this book  Because he can t talk to his friends even though he wants to very bad is making him feels separate  Almost literally  At one point in The Giver that Jonas s sister had a  comfort animal   Her comfort animal is an elephant  Jonas was trying to explain that elephants actually existed a long time ago  It says    Lily  He asked that evening when took her comfort object  the stuffed elephant  from the shelf   Did you know that once  there really were elephants  Live ones   She glanced down at the rugged comfort object and grinned   Right  She said skeptically   Sure  Jonas   He wants her to know that they are actually real  He just wants to share with his family about the dreams he is having and the feelings he is feeling even though he knows he can t   Certainly it could be said that the theme is that some stuff is worth running away from your life for  while this is a good point  it lacks the thoroughness that the real theme does throughout the book  It also fails to account for why Jonas seemed so distraught throughout the book  It also is not as stressed out in The Giver  Knowledge is sometimes not a good thing  Especially in this book when he remembers the terrible things  such as war  when he can t connect to his friends  and also when he just wants to talk to someone other than The Giver about everything happening in his head  He just what s to be normal again  He just want some time to share his thoughts  In this case  knowledge was Jonas s downfall instead of his greatest ally  I picked this up because of the Newberry Medal it received  I m glad I did  Jonas lives in a world of sameness  Everything is the same  the people  the weather  the days  There is no crime  no one different  not even any colors  Jonas  life changes drastically when he is selected to be  The Receiver   This position of honor entitles him to receive memories from the distant past  and burdens him with feelings for the first time  Lowry s tale is reminiscent of  The Handmaid s Tale  and  A Brave New World   Though written for the YA crowd  it can be enjoyed by those who are much older  This was the first time I ve read this book since it was a novel study in grade 5 or 6  I honestly don t remember what I thought of it then  but considering it was a book I was being forced to read  I probably hated it The Giver is a beautifully written and thought provoking novel  Being one of the very first dystopian teen novels I can see a lot of parallels beteen this and most obviously the Divergent trilogy  The idea of passing on memories to a Reciver so that others may enjoy a happy and mostly emotionless life in this controlled environment is a terrifying one  It is presented so pleasantly however that toward the end I didn t want Jonas to be the cause of the radical change that would come if he left the Community Probably my favourite part of the book is how  slowly  Jonas learns what colours are and are able to see them  I honestly don t know exactly what it was  but that part of the novel was the most beautiful to me  The emotion of Jonas as he begins to see the colours and the way it changes his life was fantastic to read Much less of a review  much more of a  Hey  I really liked this book  go read it   I am very nervous about the movie though    The Giver is a book about adventure and experience  It tells about a community were everything is just right  Were everything and everyone is the same  There is no such thing as love  or pain not even the simplest things such as color and climate change  Everyone in the community dresses exactly the same and acts precise  except for Jonas  At the Ceremony of twelves Jonas assemble s a new job  which perhaps can change his overview towards the community  Jonas was living an  ordinary  life as every other eleven in the community until he is assigned his job at the ceremony of twelves  As he is heading home from the ceremony he reads the rules his job consist of and realizes his job is like no other  Along the book Jonas experiences snow and color for the first time  Personally my favorite part of the book was at the end of the story when Jonas and baby Gabriel find peace and joy at a Cheery Christmas home with the bittersweet sound of Christmas carols  I have to say that The giver was one of the intriguing books i have ever read  i honestly believe that everyone who reads it will get a hopeful message out of it    This was a Newberry Award Winning Novel  It s also a short enough  and interesting enough book to read in a day  When I first started reading it  I was immediatley captivated by this utopian future that reminded me of so many of the famous futuristic warning novels  but primarily of 1970 s movie Logan s Run  And my first thought was  whoa   this is pretty heady stuff for your basic 10 and over crowd  It is the coming of age story of Jonas  who lives in the community run by a philosophy of Sameness  Everything done here is strictly regimented  from the number of children born each year  to their assignment to their family units  Everyone is conditioned to be polite and law abiding  and in turn live their lives in complete comfort    free from hunger  pain  or any troublesome negative emotion  Anyone breaking the law of sameness  either by choice or birth  is Released  There is a world outside of the community  but it is mysterious and known only as Elsewhere  Jonas was born with a gift that he doesn t understand  But because of this  at the ceremony of the 12s  when all 50 of the children of his age group are given their adult training assignements  we find that Jonas  gift is the  ability to see beyond  and therefore he s selected for the community s highest honor  he is to be the next Receiver  The Receiver of Memories  Jonas trains with the current Receiver  known to us now as The Giver  who slowly relinquishes his  power  to Jonas  The power of the memory of the world as it was  complete with color  music  sunlight  animals  Christmas  birthdays  love  pain  suffering  cruelty and injustice  It is here that we find out the cost to humanity for it s perceived comforts I really enjoyed the world that Lois Lowry created  but as I got to the end of the book  I realized that it was indeed an appropriate novel for Young Adults  as somehow the ending was not completely satisfying for me  and it didn t delve very deeply into many of the psychological issues it raised  like the Stirrings  But for the audience it was written for  I suppose  that is as it should be  It raised important topics for young people to ponder  and the open ending gives way to many imaginitive thoughts of what might be in the next wave of the future     Jonahs lives an a perfect world  No one makes their own choice  when Jonahs turn 12 he is assigned to get training from a man named the giver  The giver will teach Jonahs true pain and joy of life  This book is amazing  It touches on so many things  This is a thought provoking masterpiece  I love how the book is written and how this world comes alive in the pages  This is one of the few books that lives up to its hype This would be the perfect book to use in a classroom  It s thought provoking and encourages critical thinking  The class discussion alone would be worth it but there are also many projects that could be done with and about this book  This is another book I will definitely use in my classroom if I have upper elementary or middle school students    Spoiler alert   I am really glad I picked it up  Such a slim volume   but such a powerful one  It reminds me in a good way of the film Equilibrium  and it has been written almost ten years earlier than the film   but is placed in a smallish community instead of a megacity and is stripped of the violence factor  the main plot in Equilibrium deals with the rebels who do not take their pills and try to conserve art  music and beautiful things whereas in The Giver no rebels exist   yet  The Receiver is the only person in the community who still knows how life and society were in the times back before Sameness was introduced  People do not even know the concept of generations anymore and are contented with the rules that structure life from being born by selected Birthmothers  being given a Comfort Object  that is taken away at the age of eight  handed over to parents after a year  being assigned a vocation at twelve  getting a fitting mate after application  getting distributed a daughter and a son after three years to moving to the childless adults home in middle age and being Released after spending the rest of their lives in the Home of the Old   all the time taking pills that surpress feelings and the so called Stirrings  of the sexual variety   Nobody knows or even cares what being Released means and where people end up after being Released from the community  The task of the Receiver is advising the Council with the background of his wisdom  when   once in a while   decisions of change are to be made  Jason  the hero of the story  has been selected to be the next Receiver  turning the previous Receiver into the Giver  because the Council has detected in him a personality trait called the capacity to see beyond  As Jason receives more and more of humanity s memory  his perfect world begins to crumble  Is the abstinence of color  love and free will really a good price to pay for a life without pain  violence  hunger and uncertainty  I am sure I will read this book again  I am convinced the The Giver has earned each and every award it has got and I will look out for the companion novels Gathering Blue and The Messenger  mdh lw kn lnsn msyr wlys mkhyr l dyn mkhtlf  wl lwn bshr  mkhtlf  n l khr   mswh kml  mTlq n m  qd ykwn hnk  dl

book This is a story about an eleven year old boy named Jonas who lives in a community where there is nothing  His family has been taking care of a baby boy named Gabriel  Gabriel is very ill and if he doesn t get better soon  the community will release him  Jonas is different from all the others in the community  The community is ran by a group called the Elders  The Elders have control and make all the decisions in the community   When you are the age of twelve  you are given you profession  The chief Elder announces Jonas to be the next receiver  Jonas receives a list of rules that be must obey and one rule is that he cannot talk about his receiver training to anyone  After Jonas becomes the receiver  the current receiver becomes the giver  The giver gives all his memories to Jonas and they are memories of humanity before their community  A world where there was color  personality and feelings  Jonas soon realizes that no one in the community has ever felt these emotions before  The Giver and Jonas decide they are going to tell the community  Their plan fails when Jonas learns that Gabriel is going to be released  Jonas then decides he s going to escape the community with Gabriel  He reaches a hill top and sees a sled he heard about from the Giver  Jonas gets on the sled and goes down the hill and escapes into a new world  Response I thought the plot of the story was almost never slow and keep me interested  Although it was confusing in the beginning  as the story unfolded  everything is explained and makes sense  I hated the ending  it left me feeling tricked  and like it should of been different  All in all it was a great story and that s why I gave this book five stars Concept This story really made the reader think  What if that is really how we had to live  I keep finding that I would ask myself these questions throughout the story  This story made me appreciate the life I get to live and the freedoms we have as Americans  Although not everything is perfect in our own world  you can see that it can always be worse Classroom Connection This story would make a great language arts lesson  After reading the story  the instructor can ask the students to write what they though about ending and how it could have been different  I also think this story can be linked to a social studies lesson  Students can learn about government and its importance to us as U S citizens  CCSS Range According to lexile com  this book is a 760L  This story would be a great read a loud for 5 8 grade  I believe by the 6th grade students should be able to read this story independently  This story isn t appropriate for students any younger than 5th grade due to the storyline and complex issues discussed   This is a Newberry Award winning  dystopian novel about a just turned 12 year old boy who  like everyone else in the community they live in  has been studied extensively and is about the learn what job he will be trained for  Notice he has no choice in the matter  the powers that be in the community decide what he is best suited for There aren t many choices at all in ths community  No one is hungry  so there are penalties to be paid for claiming to be starving  because it s simply not true  No one can ride a bike until they re 9 years old  and if identical twins are born  only one is allowed to stay in the community  The other is  released  Jonas is chosen to be something very rare   Receiver  of the memories from  The Giver   The imagery Lois Lowry conjures up to teach Jonas about cold  snow  sunshine  and warmth  they have none of these in their climate controlled community   and colors   it s just beautiful Soon Jonas begins to question the possibilities of having choices   Beautifully written  thought provoking novel that has a sequel recently released   I can t wait to read it  Todo este sistema de igualdad no es mas que la division de roles entre los miembros de la comunidad  A Jonas se le asigna la maxima profesion  lo cual es un honor solo hay una persona a cargo Ser quien posee el conocimiento pero no el poder se confiere solo a uno  para proteccion de la mayoria pero tambien como medio para tener en cuenta el pasado Jonas Jonas JonasLas decisiones son armas de doble filo  Jonas emprende un viaje despues de conocer mejor la estructura de su comunidad y sobre todo las vivencias que nunca se le han permitido  Todo ese conocimiento lo lleva a una especie de aventura para el pero tambien al comienzo de la vida y de compartir una nueva perspectiva a los demas miembros de la comunidad Pero vivir puede volverse una lucha por la supervivencia y las experiencias se vuelven duras  no siempre lo que se percibe se da en condiciones idoneas  El valor es algo que se requiere cuando se afrenta a lo desconocido  Pero sobre todo los recuerdos nos dan fortaleza   The book  The Giver  by Lois Lowry is about a community that is  a utopia   The community is ruled and completely controlled by the government  They pick your spouse and job  The concept of  release  is big too  A boy named Jonas is chosen to be the receiver of memory  who holds memories of the past and what it holds  The old receiver is really old and wise  Joana s soon relised how corrupted the community really is  Jonas thinks of a way to escape In the giver one big injustice is the concept of release is a big idea in this story  The twin that weighed less got killed  Jonas s father stuck a shot in the baby s arm and killed him This situation was not resolved because the baby was killed  The injustice in all of this is the death  The people  the father  don t know what they are doing  They think that they are putting a sleeping drug in one of the twins or criminals  Then they think that they are going to send the baby or criminal to another place or community I recommend this book to action lovers   mystery lovers  and people that have long attention spans  I say this because for action lovers there is some action in this book  one example is when the planes were coming for Jonas  For mystery lovers the book loves to leave people hanging  For people with a long attention span  the book is really repetitive  This example is when Jonas had the apple and all The chapter talked about is that one apple  I strongly recommend  Ugh please guyssss  read this  YOU MUST READ THIS I read the novel The Giver in the 7th grade with my class  The beginning starts off slow  but towards the fourth chapter you will start to wonder  I loved that the novel had friendships  but their jobs took them on different paths  Knowing the struggles and mystery within Jonas and his community makes you wonder why the community isn t normal  Everyone and everything falls into place when Jonas does the unthinkable to save the his community from what the Leaders have taken from them  without them knowing over the generations  With the help of the Giver  Jonas s life has changed from day one  This book was recommended to me by my 13 yr old niece  I enjoyed it very much It s the story of Jonas  who is about to be assigned to his life s work  He lives in the future  where everyone has a birthday in December  and every year the children are moved up another step in life  until they are 13  After that  no one keeps track of their birthdays very much Jonas is assigned a very special occupation  The Receiver  He is assigned to work with The Giver  who holds all of the memories of the past  The people don t have any memories of past history  the climate is controlled  everyone dresses alike and is extremely polite  This is all for the good of the community  Only Jonas isn t so sure This is a great  short read  and I can t wait to get the subsequent books   Jonas is a boy who lives in a community of sameness    where everyone is treated the same  and no one is allowed to make any choices for themselves  Everyone is assigned a career at age 12  Jonas is assigned to be the new Receiver  He meets with the current Receiver  who is an old man who keeps all the memories  The Receiver  now the Giver  gives all the memories to Jonas  The memories are things that have happened in the past  and things that used to exist before sameness  such as color  pain  and real love  It is difficult for Jonas to receive some of the memories  but incredibly wonderful to receive others  He wishes everyone in the community could experience all the memories   good and bad  He and the Giver make a plan for this to happen  If Jonas leaves the community  he leaves all the memories with the people of the community  The Giver will remain to help all the people deal with the burden and the joy  When Jonas leaves  he takes a little baby with him  because the baby is about to be  released  or killed because he is not strong enough according to the community s standards  I think that this kind of community is Satans  plan  Everything is the same  there is no agency  and everyone is forced to be good  This book really made me think  It made me appreciate the beauty  pain  agency  and love that I experience in life  Well  what can I say about this book that hasn t already been said  I will do my best The book is about a 12 year old boy who is forced to look past his seemingly perfect life and glimpse the darkness behind the facade  At first Jonas s world seems perfectly utopian  No personal choices  everything from your spouse to your children to your occupation is chosen for you  It works because people obey the rules  If the rules are not obeyed the person is  released  from society never to be heard from again  and therefore  no longer a problem to those who live so blissfully in the sameness  Jonas doesn t see life in a dystopian way because he just like everybody else  The world is a bit more controlling than we would be comfortable with  but it doesn t seem as extreme as the world of the Hunger games  Divergent  or the Maze Runner  Then Jonas is chosen to be The Receiver which changes everything  Jonas tries very hard to live with the knowledge of how things used to be in a society that has no idea  There is so much that the people of the community are spared from in this new world  The memories Jonas receives floods him with emotions he has never felt  colors he has never been able to see before  pain and hunger his body has never felt  What The Giver imparts is a great burden to Jonas  but also makes Jonas see the major flaws of the world in which he lives  He is interacting with others and drawing them into his story and trying to find love in an emotionless world  but he will never be able to share that with them because they have never known such things and would never understand without the memories of the past  The story leaves me still wondering about Jonas and his companion  The ending is a bit ambiguous My overall opinion is that the book is wonderful  I love the importance of history and knowledge that this book personifies  I think it is a wonderful book for young adults  and I hope it inspires them to never forget where we came from and the price that was paid to get here  I feel as if we are already in a similar world  as people are all about living in the present and everything needs to be done yesterday  We forget The only problem I had with the novel is that we are talking about a twelve to thirteen year old here  That age lacks the maturity to understand much of their own lives much less that of things past  Maybe it is the wisdom that come with The Giver s memories that make it somewhat believable that a child of this age has the capacity for such understanding  However that is a minor complaint and the book still holds its own  Hopefully the youth of the protagonist encourages younger readers to value what this world is failing to keep   love  history  wonder  sorrow  pain and grief  It is a mixed bag but at least we have the freedom to choose and it makes life worth living  Happy reading  Addendum  Hello young people who are required to read this book for school  I know you will enjoy it immensely  I have not yet seen the movie  but I have seen the trailer  From that snippet alone let me assure you that if you watch the movie to try to fake out the teacher into thinking you actually read the book  you will fail miserably  I had read this book to my 5th grade class almost 20 years ago  All I could remember about it was that I liked it  Well  I really liked it this time as well  The story was compelling and moved along quickly  The characters were well defined  It is a great book for students and adults  It was 5 stars for me  A very interesting view of a Utopian society  clearly examining the pros and cons of conformity  following the rules  and how a society deals with differences  Do you we want someone to control our lives in the attempt to save us from pain and suffering  and is the loss of choice a reasonable sacrifice to make for the sake of living a safe  unpredictable life  I personally do not think so  but this story profoundly depicts the impact of both  I recommend this book to anyone over the age of 12   Exploring this dystopian community was such a blast  the world is so different from ours  and the main character s development was amazing  i love how Jonas interacted with the giver and together they worked out their problems This book is packed with so many feelings and settings from happiness and love to sadness and sacrifice  the books was a bit slow at first but i couldn t keep the book down towards the end  and its filled with surprises  i recommend this book to anyone even if its mid grade book  the ending was so creatively crafted  5 5    I think that the Giver was a great book to me  But it was very shocking when I started reading this I thought that it was going to be a horrible book and that I was going to hate entirly  I do not like that the society has hose weird rules  They are so outragous that they get on my nerves so much  Everything seems so perfect in that society  but only because everything is chosen for them they don t get to chose anything for themselves  Their whole life is planned out for them right before their eyes  They can t change anything even if they wanted to  At first I disagreed with the authors words on these pages but once I got to the end I understood why the author wrote this book in the way that she did  This book really made me think   is ignorance bliss  Jonas has the seemingly perfect life  but something is missing  However  he can t quite put his finger on what it is  It feels as though the initial sentiment is that there is no hope  Nothing can ever change  You make the most with your assignment in the community  You follow the rule books  You can t miss what you don t know    or can you There are many questions and little answers  I think that is what makes this book so beautiful    Spoiler alert  If you have not read yet then stop reading now  The impression that I got when I finished the book last night is that Jonas was The Giver s son  I felt that Gabriel was as well  Each birth mother had 3 children  I felt as though Rosemary  Jonas  and Gabriel  all of whom had the same haunting eyes and is a theme in the book  were descendants of him  He told Jonas that Rosemary was his daughter and that he loved her  He also told him that he loved him  I believe he was trying to tell him  and the reader  much more  I believe he chose Rosemary  i believe he chose Jonas so that he could share everything with them and enlighten them to another way of living  There could be more  However  these are just beliefs of my own about this book  Each person is entitled to his or her interpretation  I could sit and discuss the ending of this book and not grow tired  I would share this book with my children both inside and outside of the classroom and anticipate some really great discussions   Wow  what an amazingly constructed story about a utopian society  It s quite a dark story about how everyone and everything is controlled by the government from their families  behaviour  who they matched with  their jobs and so forth  There are only two people within the society who are able to experience memories  The Giver and his successor  and the Receiver  The story of Jonas is quite a confronting one  leaving you to think what you would do in that situation  It s a world so different from our own that takes away the very notion of free will  The book had a very scifi feel to it from start to to end and felt like a fable  I found some scenes within the book quite difficult to read because they were so terrifying   quite surprising that it is aimed at children  My high rating for this book is to honour how it is definitely a classic in its own right  It is groundbreaking similar to how 1984 was and opens your mind to greater interpretation  If it wasn t for the vague  open ended ending  this book would be flawless for me  I m going to pick up the sequel to see what happens  Check out Happy Indulgence for more reviews  Read this years ago when I was trying to stay ahead of Sasha s book list  Lois Lowry s award winning young adult novel  The Giver  rivets and provokes like a sardonic Shirley Jackson short story  Through the eyes of a  Twelve  named Jonas  we enter a world similar to our own  but with intriguing differences  why is an airplane flying overhead a terrifying experience for an obviously advanced civilization  Why do ubiquitous loud speakers announce reprimands and rules  why are elephants and rhinoceroses extinct  These mysteries begin to unfold for Jonas at the yearly Ceremony  in which every child under twelve advances either to their next developmental level  or as in his case  to their assigned vocational role for life As the newly appointed and honored Receiver of Memory  he becomes one of the only two living citizens to comprehend the true cost of their utopian society  As his daily training progresses  he begins to feel entirely new emotions ranging from ecstasy to horror  With the help of the Giver of Memories  he ultimately faces a decision that will not only change his own family  but could destroy the peaceful way of life for his entire community  He discovers  as hopefully we all do  that love sometimes comes with terrible costs  Verdaderamente me sorprendi en varias ocasiones  y eso que me considero una persona dificil de sorprender  Es la primera vez que leo algo de Lois Lowry y definitivamente quiero leer mas obras suyas  Su manera de describir las cosas  colores  sensaciones  sentimientos es impresionante y definitivamente puedo sentirlas con solo leerlas  tanto las sensaciones placenteras como las dolorosas La historia trata de una comunidad aparentemente utopica  donde todos y cada uno de sus miembros tiene su rol y actividades esperadas de el  no existen los secretos y la gente esta obligada a siempre decir la verdad segun sus reglas  Jonas pronto se convertira en uno de los 12  un grupo de jovenes que nacieron hace 12 anos  aunque su cumpleanos exacto pudo haber pasado ya   y con este cumplimiento se les asigna la actividad que desempenaran el resto de su vida Jonas esta preocupado sobre la actividad que le tocara desempenar  puesto que ha pasado sus horas de servicio a la comunidad en distintas cosas  pero de igual manera confia ciegamente que los ancianos le asignaran el papel apropiado  Cual sera su sorpresa cuando el dia de la ceremonia le dicen que no ha sido asignado a ningun papel  sino que ha sido seleccionado para ser el siguiente  Receiver   desconozco el termino en espanol ya que lei la version inglesa   Su papel  le explica torpemente el anterior Receiver  es recibir las memorias de la humanidad   TODAS las memorias de la humanidad desde muchisimo tiempo antes Mientras que Jonas descubre cosas increibles que nunca imagino  como los colores  la nieve y la sensacion de calor  tambien va descubriendo la terrible verdad de la comunidad aparentemente perfecta en la que vive  y entre mas memorias recibe mas doloroso se le hace seguir viviendo en ella    I have to admit   Sara usually recommends great books to me  She made me buy this while we were at Borders  as she had read it in elementary school and had loved it  what a great book  I loved The Hunger Games  and this one is kind of like its antecedent  It deals with a society where sameness is valued  People don t experience pain or sorrow   but  then again  they also don t experience love or joy  those memories have been relegated to a Receiver  I loved the way the author slowly makes you realize what this society is like  she writes about it impartially  but you come to realize  as does Jonas  the main character  that it would be horrible to live in a world without color  feelings  differences  It actually made me feel sorry for people who live in a society or with a religion where differences in life beliefs are not tolerated  where people are expected to follow rules more out of a sense of tradition than understanding  anyway   I loved the story and think this should be required reading  with accompanying discussion  for kids   Jonas is twelve years of age and he lives in a world of peace hidden from emotion  When children turn twelve  they are assigned a job in the community and Jonas was specially selected to be The Receiver of Memory  With this new job  he is finally able to feel emotion when The Giver passes on memories of the past  When Jonas sees what a terrible world he lives in  The Giver hands him a plan to fix everything  Jonas has to decide whether or not to leave everything behind to make the community a better place  I chose this book because I remember reading it for a grade many years back  so I decided to give it another go and reading it again really opened up my eyes to many new ideas in life  My favorite part is when Jonas shares emotion with Gabriel and they share a loving connection  My least favorite part is the beginning because it drags on so long and it really is boring  it made me want to give up reading  In the end  the book was amazing and anyone who likes science fiction and feel good books should read this  I ve already recommended this book to many of my peers    The Giver  is about a boy named Jonas  His s Community is different  Everything is controlled  The jobs  The Climate  People are assigned Spouses and two kids there is even no color  Jonas s Mom is a judge and his dad nurtures infants  At the age of twelve is when you are considered at Adult  that is when you are assigned your job  Jonas Is assigned the very rare and most honorable job of being the new receiver  There is only one in the community  The Receiver s Job is to Keep all the memories away from the rest of the community so they don t feel any real emotions such as pain like war or any love like a real family  During his training from the Giver  Jonas witnesses the life before the controlled community  the colorful  real family  war filled real world  They both want it t be like it was  They Needed to Release the memories to the people  in order for that to happen Jonas needs to leave the community  In the end Jonas leaves with his little brother Gabriel  The author doesn t really say if the survive or what happened to the community  I Picked this book because in grade 5 my teacher handed it out to read  i started it but i never finished it  i never really understood it because at the time it was beyond my reading level  but i tried again this year The Reason I Finished This Book was because it was a really good book  possibly the best book i ever read so far  i will probally re read it in the near future I would Recommend this book to Niral because it was once again a real great book  i think she will love it like i do  This book is amazing  I am so glad that I have re read it  There is so much that I didn t pick up on when I read it as a teenie bopper  This is a sad and cautionary tale  It criticizes the way societies work and the way that people follow rules blindly  It cautions of the risk of a utopia and the magnitude of people not questioning their actions  It is also interesting because it addresses that even with an awakening awareness of things being wrong  it is difficult to reach outside the context that you are raised in  Especially when you are in a situation that does not allow you to draw upon an outside perspective  What price are we willing to pay to avoid suffering  The book presents a world in which people have given up most of the things that we consider  human  for the sake of peace and comfort  It cautions us that this is not a price worth paying  What is the cost of a single life to maintain that comfort and safety with in a community  There are no acceptable losses  Once we begin to sacrifice each other  we loose all of everything that makes us human and create a place that is empty  That emptiness begins in the heart  the soul  Without heart and soul in our communities we are unable to achieve that greatness that is inherent with in each of us  Is  sameness  something that protects or destroys us  I think the book clearly presents striving for  sameness  as a folly  It may well eliminate prejudice and fear  but it will also eliminate our ability to use multi facet perspectives as a check and balance safety system  This is a book that is difficult to discuss in any depth with out also revealing some of the most interesting story revaluations  I am thinking about writing a blog post that is essay format to really dig into the concepts I ve glossed over here Now that I have finihed reading the series  I wanted to add a bit to this review  I found that this book is more powerful if allowed to stand alone  The books following it subtracted from the weight and depth of this book  It is most notablely the end that suffers from the remainder of the series  This saddened be because I had felt the end of the book was a powerful message that struck the heart  The continuation of the story dramatically reduces this impact  In all honesty  I think reading just this book is enough  What an imagination Lois Lowry has  How deeply she makes us ponder things we have always taken for granted  The world in The Giver  distant though it is from ours  brings up many crucial issues about our own world  The characters push their way into our hearts  And that ending  It taught me a great deal as a writer about taking risks  especially with endings  It taught me to trust my reader  The Giver s ending will wake you up at night and make you think and think about what really happened  It ll make you hope and hope  It might even make you weep  It did  for me   One of my absolute favorites  One of the only books assigned in school that I really enjoyed 3 18 10  Lois Lowry is the guest speaker at a lecture in MA  Since I haven t read this book in a while  I read it again to prepare for her lecture  I agree with other reviewers in that the ending is a bit ominous  I d like to hear Lois  take on the ending  I noticed a theme of snow throughout the book  it s the first memory the Giver gives to Jonas  it s what keeps them from being found after escaping  he made them feel cold to avoid body heat being detected   and it s the ominous ending of the book  Overall  it s an interesting concept and I really liked the book  However  I do wish the ending was a bit more clear 8 19 14  With the movie coming out in theaters last Fri  it seemed a good time to reread the namesake book  Since Ive read this several times already  I opted for the audiobook this time  Still love this story  and the audio book narrator s take on the characters voices  Lois Lowry has such a distinct writing voice that tells this story  It really is a short story  but she captures everything so perfectly in those pages  I d absolutely recommend the book  As for the movie  I haven t seen it yet so I can t comment  I enjoyed the book from cover to cover Such a heartwarming story  I read this years ago  and now it s Maya s turn  She first saw it in her 3rd grade classroom which surprised me  and I was glad she waited until now  5th grade  to pick it up  It blew her mind   she couldn t put it down  and has been talking about it for days to anyone who will listen  I asked her how many stars out of 5  and she said 7  I thought that this book was very well written  It is an awsome novel avout what the world might be like if we continue in our ways   fighting with many contries at the same time  using all of the natural resources  and over all making it to where we would have to have a controlled community  Now this community would assign you to your parents  tell you how to live every day of your life  instruct you on the rules of the community  and even assign the job that you would have in the community after you turned  12   Everyone mudst attend the ceromony of  birthdays   the thing is it isn t everyones birthday  But every year every child gets something that will help them the coming year  or something that says that they are maturing in the community  For instance when you turn  9  you get you re own bike  and one year you get your hair cut  but on you re  12  birthday  you re last celebrated birthday  you get your assignment  This is the job that you will have until you are taken to the House of the Old  The weird thing is not everyone  every year gets assigned a job  This happens to Jonas  but WHY   To find out why you need to read the book       The Giver was awesome  I read it in class  it was really good  I love the whole plot and the idea of a utopia  Jonas is a very strong  easy to connect to character  the ending though    That sucked  I didn t understand it wasn t straight forward  like for example The City of Ember made it clear when the characters made it to their destination     The Giver shows how powerful wisdom is  and how much it can hurt to know things  It shows how thinking about it  our country may not be  as we all say  free  but it gives us choices  Which is what jonas  community did not have any of  The way they released people without them having the least of an idea about what was going to happen to them was just plain cruel  It reminded me of how they killed Marley  in Marley   Me  That was sad  but they knew they were doing it because they HAD to  it s the way you kill an ANIMAL      The Giver really makes you think about how even though in that community there was no pain  no    Love  No nothing  how you would think  No pain  sounds great  No love  ehh   it s like a cousin giving you the awesomest birthday present ever  with the condition of them taking your favorite toy  It s really confusing  but it s great once you get into the book  D Preview  There is only one Receiver of Memory and Jonas is chosen  He is to be trained by the Giver to receive and hold all of the memories that ever existed  Memories that are too dangerous for just anyone to receive  If everyone knew the things Jonas knew it would be the end of his community as he knows it  A community in black and white where there is no love  no happiness  and no humanity  But of course  Jonas is not aware if this until the giver begins to give him the memories allowing him to see what life was like when there was love and music and color and beauty    and  yes  pain and sorrow and anger  Jonas must decide  if it s better for the world to go on living without these memories  or if  without them  it s not really living at all Reader Response  I have always loved this book  It is so well crafted that writing this review and thus adding any words of my own to it s masterful ending almost feels like blasphemy  Lois Lowery is a master of character and plot  The story and the setting unfolds just as it does for Jonas  It starts with what he knows  which feels perfect and safe  and then slowly  slowly we realized that things are just the opposite  I loved it  even the ending which one can t be sure is a happy one until they read the second book Warnings   Violence Gore  Jonas does receive the memory for war in which he and dozens of others are wounded and dying  Also  you come to find out that the community  releases  it s members through lethal injection which is both disturbing and disgusting  Everyone I knew started reading this book when I was in 5th grade  15 years later  I m finally getting around to reading it myself  And suffice to say  the wait was worth it I think this book would have much more impact on someone who is at least 17 years old or much older yet  It hit me much harder   in the best of ways   than it would have back when I was just a child  But sometimes those are the best books  the ones that mean so much when you are younger  but still hold their value as you grow older  I felt the power behind the real moral of the story here  I picked up on the significance of the metaphors and the lessons being taught in a subtle   yet somehow simultaneously obvious   way I knew absolutely nothing about this book before I read it  other than that the general consensus was that  it s really good   Well   really good  is an understatement if I ve ever heard one  This book was incredible  I absolutely loved it  The story was so intriguing and I was hooked immediately  I honestly couldn t put this book down  I had to keep reading  I loved the story   I loved that it was so unique in and of itself  but also managed to have a central theme that was so significant  It s primary purpose was to remind us that the freedom we have to make choices   to love   is what defines us as humans  as individuals  Our choices are what allow us to truly live I don t want to give anything away  I m so happy I went into this book without knowing what to expect  It was   IS   an absolutely outstanding book  Make the choice to read it now  It s a decision you won t regret  Imagine an utopia  now imagine it having people with no  collective  memories Imagine having a job picked out for you  imagine not having the freedom to lie  image a very strict order of things Now imagine a single person  holding inside every single memory of  The World Before   colors  love  empathy  hate  warfare  and a series of other extremely painful emotions As that person nears his age of release  an emotionless euthanasia procedure  he chooses a person to pass on the memories to  The Reciever  and he himself must become a Giver  Losing memories  so that they might be preserved Extremely emotional  well written  absolutely amazing  11 07 2014I enjoyed it very much It was like a breath of fresh air after the atrociousness that is  Delirium Trilogy  This is how you write a novel It was written very well  The concept was unique yes  because at the time  it must have been the most and unique and the most different one  Now  the copy cats are everywhere  I just loved it I would ve loved for it to have a  direct  sequel  too  Because the way it left stopped when  view spoiler  Jonas and Gabe approached the  Elsewhere   was too abrupt for me  I wanted to know if Gabe was safe and sound   of course  he would ve been if the book just stopped there and left Jonas on a happy note feeling   hide spoiler   what happened to the community and how they dealt with it all  what happened and what Jonas found when he reached there    Would ve loved to know all that Oh wait  just found out there IS a sequel    Yay  Apparently  it s the Giver  3  Messenger  that has the answers to this one   23 07 2014I tried to read through the sequels   nope  Nope  Nope  Not gonna bother Majorly disappointed  She should ve either just made a direct sequel to The Giver continuing from where it was left off  or shouldn t have left it off like that at all and should ve explained and told everything in the first one   The Giver  by Lois Lowry swept up nearly every prestigious prize for young adult literature  including the Newbery Medal and the William Allen White Award after its release more than 20 years ago  It s assigned reading in thousands of schools  has sold more than 12 million copies  been adapted into a play  a musical  an opera  and now a movie  But this is no mere book for children and teens  Its message is a powerful one What happens when people find a way to manipulate human memory so they won t have to remember anything bad  feel pain  hunger  suffering  When safety  sameness  complacency  unquestioned living  acceptance of rules without reason becomes the norm  What happens when the world loses its color  When citizens lose their ability to think and question  When animals cease to exist  I wanted to read this book before seeing the movie  I now know I m going to be haunted by the questions it raises  much as I was as young girl after reading Orwell s  1984   This is the first in a series  and I look forward to seeing where Ms  Lowry takes me next   I ve already finished the book and it s so amazing  The way that the author controlled the story led me create expectancy all the time while reading  Jonas is amazing and surprised me with his great heart always being sensible and leading the situation to the best way  I ve seen the movie before  in January  It s good but nothing compares to the book  After reading it I could understand so many things that the movie doesn t clarifies like the scene that the nurtures select the babies  In general lines the book has more details than the movie  as usual  but I liked both   I m a fan of dystopian society literature and this is seriously impressive  It s scary to think of our own world and how we want to always be perfect  Perfect  but at what cost  I know it s part of a series but I am not sure I d like to read the next books  considering how I got so disappointed with how the Matched series  Ally Condie  turned out  However  as a first book of a series  I rate The Giver better than Matched so maybe I still will  In the mean time I will re read this book again before I have to return it to the library  to savour the moments and to make sure I hadn t missed anything   Kind of cool  weird things to think about  Although 16 year old Christie missed out on the new release of this much deserved Newberry Medal winner back in 1993  36 year old Christie was ecstatic that the 2014 release of the movie version of the novel put this literary gem on my radar  I make it a habit to read a novel BEFORE I watch the theatrical release  and was magically  wow ed  in a way as an adult and a parent that I would have missed out on as a first time teenage reader  Upon completion  I immediately gushed about it to my 3 preteen daughters so they would add it to their reading lists This is a brilliantly penned totalitarian novel written before totalitarian novels were chic  I was in awe of Lowry s ability to deal with material permeated with serious issues with a poignancy that is mild enough for children  yet still heard with deafening clarity among adults  As a fledgling writer  I tip my hat and my pen to you  madam  The real tragedy associated with this novel would be not reading it  I had already ordered the next installment in the series before the covers of this novel were completely closed  I had spent a lot of time not reading this book  It s not that I didn t want to read it  per se  just that EVERYone loved it  and I hid from the hype  I am so glad that I got over myself and finally picked up this novel  The prose is approachable and straightforward  but that shouldn t give the indication that it s not a meaningful  perspective altering read  Lowry s subtlety is masterful  and she leaves just enough ambiguity in the characters and ending to allow for each reader to identify with the story  This novel is perfect for the classroom  as it brings up opportunities for middle and high school age students to discuss everything from government overreach to the cost of peace to the meaning of freedom  This book would fit just as well in a social studies classroom as it does in an ELA classroom  Also  it is a great introduction to other dystopian YA literature  which will help teachers put a second  and third and fourth  book in the reader s hands   I love the ideas about the sameness of memory  identity  and experience within the context of these chosen individuals  I find myself in the potential of those philosophies  It s all absurd  but it s beautiful  What else is there  Lois Lowry s The Giver has ineffable qualities  oversimplified yet emotionally appealing  and morally insightful  Perhaps  the setting of utopia is hackneyed in contemporary literatures  However  The Giver is still unique in that it has layers to the book   a layer of  sameness  and ignorance  a layer of pain and fear  and a layer of color and music   describing a boy who discovers the latter two layers when he is assigned as the Giver  84   The different layers are almost like a labyrinth  forcing the readers to make their way out themselves  only those who disclose all the hidden meanings will understand the true meaning of of the novel  Both characterization and settings are the two outstanding components of the novel  in which both play roles as hints for the readers to uncover the themes Lowry is definitely conveying a message through his talent of characterization  in which the characters are so relatable and are able teach us the moral  to learn from the past  Jonas  the main character  being scared of  selection  as he did not know  what he was to become  perfectly resembles teenagers in this society  making us think of who we once were  64   The story then goes on to reveal the Giver  the only man who knows the past  He informs us that we should  choose wisely  and learn from the memory to make a change  98   The contrast between the two characters depicts the importance of memories in decision makings  Perhaps  one may struggle with decisions  However  through incredible characterization  Lowry demonstrates how decisions are ubiquitous and that we should  spend time looking back  to choose the better decision  165  The novel s setting is not a simple utopia  it has layers  as mentioned before  This depth also creates a contrast  and eventually irony  While the community is monotonous and dull  it is also free and safe from the pain and fear of the  carefully made  choices  48   On the other hand  the community is missing the true human qualities  both  real  happiness and sadness  132   Analyzing the setting reveals that society needs a balance between rules and freedom  The perfect balance can make individuals different  which is what makes society interesting  If one wants to understand all of the layers  then he or she must  break  some rules and make decisions by themselves  20   Had there not been a rigid structure  then the citizens would have felt true happiness   First off   The Giver  is one of my favorite books of all time  It s plot and detail squeezed into the story is unmatched by any  and is so unique  Many books try to replicate the greatness of  The Giver   but cannot  This book is amazing for anyone and everyone  You can be hooked in an instant and wont want to stop reading A Quick Summary  The Giver  is about a boy named Jonas who lives in a place called the community where everything is way too organized  The citizens are born and raised like there is nothing else to see  They are limited to a singular job  next to no electronics  all the same things  etc   Anybody in the community is very satisfied though  They think that the world is their community and that their lives are perfect  but they re not  The reader follows a boy named Jonas and his adventures in and out of the community  It is about a boy named Jonas that gets a special job  He sees the wrong of many people  he tries to amend the wrongs  He is in a distopia or utopia  There are many things that are wrong with the world  They have sectors instead of neighborhoods and there is no color  no emotions  no killing  no love  no hatred  and no life  Jonas  job will change the world  he lives in  The reason around the title of  the giver  is because his teacher gives him special things  I will leave the rest to you  So engaging I finished it in three days  Lowry is well deserving of the Newbery for this tenderly written novella  Clearly and concisely  yet beautifully written  you can t help but be caught up in Jonas  life and experience each new experience along with him  Nearly a flawless book  I really enjoyed the book the giver  I thought that the book had a great plot and it was definitely a page turner for me  I liked the way the end was because it left you thinking and wondering and made you think of the ending yourself  My favorite character overall was Jonas because he was brave and selfless throughout the course of the story  My favorite part of the story was when Jonas left with Gabriel and when they trudged through elsewhere together in hopes to save the community  Overall I give this book a 5 star rating  This book stayed with me for days after reading it  The book is well thought out and brilliantly written  and the ending seems open to personal interpretation  The Giver is a treasure of modern day literature Favorite Quotes   It s the memories of the whole world   he said with a sigh   Before you  before me  before the previous Receiver  and generations before him   Jonas frowned   The whole world   he asked   I don t understand  Do you mean not just us  Not just the community  Do you mean Elsewhere  too   He tried  in his mind to grasp the concept   I m sorry  sir  I don t understand exactly  Maybe I m not smart enough  I don t know what you mean when you say  the whole world  or  generations before him   I thought there was only us  I thought there was only now    There s much more  There s all ta goes beyond   all that is Elsewhere   and all that goes back  and back  and back  I received all of those  when I was selected  And here in this room  all alone  I re experience them again and again  It is how wisdom comes  And how we shape our future    pp  77 78 He watched as he man rose and moved first to the wall that occupied a place in every dwelling  but one thing about it was different  This one had a switch  which the man deftly snapped to the end that said OFF Jonas almost gasped aloud  To have the power to turn the speaker off  It was an astonishing thing   p  79  Why can t everyone see them  Why did colors disappear  The Giver shrugged   Our people made that choice  the choice to go to Sameness  Before my time  before the previous time  back and back and back  We relinquished color when we relinquished sunshine and did away with differences   He thought for a moment   We gained control of many things  But we had to let go of others    p  95   And I ve thought of a way to help you with the concept of color  Close your eyes and be still  now  I m going to give you a memory of a rainbow    p  96   But I want them   Jonas said angrily   It isn t fair that nothing has color    Not fair   The Giver looked at Jonas curiously   Explain what you mean    Well     Jonas had to stop to think it through   If everything s the same  then there aren t any choices  I want to wake up in the morning and decide things  A blue tunic  or a red one   He looked down at himself  at the colorless fabric of his clothing   But it s always the same  always   The he laughed a little   I know it s not important  what you wear  It doesn t matter  But     It s the choosing that s important  isn t it   The Giver asked him   pp  97 98  My little brother    he began  and then corrected himself   No  that s inaccurate  He s not my brother  not really  But this newchild that my family takes care of  his name s Gabriel   Yes  I know about Gabriel   Well  he s right at the age where he s learning so much  He grabs toys when we hold them in front of him  my father says he s learning small muscle control  And he s really cute  The Giver nodded  But now that I can see colors  at least sometimes  I was just thinking  what if we could hold up things that were bright red  or bright yellow  and he could choose  Instead of the Sameness   He might make wrong choices   Oh   Jonas was silent for a minute   Oh  I see what you mean  It wouldn t matter for a newchild s toy  But later it does matter  doesn t it  We don t dare to let people make choices of their own   Not safe   The Giver suggested  Definitely not safe   Jonas said with certainty   What if they were allowed to choose their own mate  And chose wrong   Or what if   he went on  almost laughing at the absurdity   they chose their own jobs   Frightening  isn t it   The Giver said Jonas chuckled   Very frightening  I can t even imagine it  We really need to protect people from wrong choices   It s safer   Yes   Jonas agreed   Much safer    Has the typical markings of a dystopian future  with a perfect society created by sacrificing major things for  the good of society   Well written  and I love the idea of memories and a shared history having such power  Not sure if I like the ambiguous ending    and I m never going to complain about my baby keeping me up at night again  Well  at least for a long time  I remember having to read this book in middle school  It is hard to say you  like  this book because it is so sad  I wonder why I childrens book was even made on such subjects  But I guess if Hunger Games is kids killing other kids this isnt much worse  Anyways the book is about a young boy named Jonas  who lives in a weird Utopian  not sure thats the right word  society  Everything about their life is structured and there are no colors  no feelings  no family really  It is very weird  People are matched with their spouses and their jobs  People apply for children  they can only have 2  and then once the children grow up they never see them or their spouses again and they go to a  house of the Old   At the age of 12  which Jonas is  they children get picked for their jobs  Jonas gets picked to be Receiver which there is only one in the whole community and it is very rare for a new one to be appointed  Jonas meets with a very old man who transmits memories of what the world used to be like  Both wonderful and terrible memories  Jonas begins to see how empty his old life was  He finally has enough when he learns about  Release   Release has been a normal and sometimes joyous thing in the community  Many citizens think release means going to a different community  One day a birthmother gives birth to twins and Jonas   father  has to pick which one stays and which one gets  released   Jonas asks the giver if he can watch the Release since he has never seen one before  He is repulsed when he sees it is really just euthanasia  Jonas  family has been helping a baby  Gabriel  to gain strength so it can be ready for adoption at the next Age Ceremony When he gets home his dad tells them Gabe is not progressing enough even with their extra help and that he will have to be released  Jonas runs away in the middle of the night with Gabe  The end of the book isnt really clear   which bothers me  It is hard to tell if they made it to a new community or they die  Overall the book is written for children  but it is an amazing story  Definitely recommend for a quick read  I finished it in like 2 hours  While I ve seen this book on many  many  many  Top xx  lists  I d never heard what it was actually about  and so I had no idea at all what to expect when I picked it up this afternoon And that was probably a good thing  because I don t think a description could have done it justice  I was completely blown away  The environment Lois Lowry sets up is so complete and so baffling that trying to explain it would be doing it a disservice  I was fascinated by the community and the lifestyle described  and am very impressed by how Lois Lowry got so much across in so few pages  It s one of the most simultaneously thrilling and hopeful  alternative future  novels I ve ever read Reread in 2014 I ve read a lot more dystopian novels now  so it no longer comes across as quite as unique  but I still think it s one of the best  and am impressed by how elaborate a world Lois Lowry manages to create in so few pages Previous reads  May 2009 The Giver by Lois Lowry is a science fiction novel about the life of a boy named Jonas  Jonas and his family live in a separated society with a whole community of different people away from everyone else in the world  Everyone in this community at the age of 12 are put into jobs that they will have for the rest of their lives  The job they receive is focused on their strengths and what they are good at  In Jonas s family his father was a nurse that took care of all the newborn babies that were being born  Jonas however couldn t ever really figure out what he was good at and he always had these weird moments in his life that nobody else ever had that made him feel different from all of his friends  On the day that the 12 year olds were going to find out what their job would be  Jonas got the job of being the  receiver of memory   This is a very special job that is only given out when the old receiver is too old to carry out the job  The person who is given the job of the receiver of memory has a special power that nobody in their community has but them  Since they are separated from the outside world the people in this society are shielded from war  pain  or any kind of hurting  They live perfect lives and nobody ever questions it  It will be Jonas s job to take all the horrible memories that the now receiver has  because without Jonas all of these bad memories would go out into their community and be given to everyone in the community  so Jonas s job is to keep all of the painful memories of the real world with him and not tell anyone about it  Jonas decides that he doesn t like that he has to deal with this and finds out there are a lot of good memories of the real world that is better than the small community that he lives in and decides he wants to escape  Which has never been done before  As all of this is happening  his dad who is a nurse has a baby named Gabriel living with them  Jonas realizes that this baby has the same powers as he does and doesn t want the babies fate to be the same as his  so he takes the baby and escapes the community the same way that he dreams about one night  Throughout this book you learn more and more secrets about the community that Jonas lives in  This is why throughout this book things aren t always what they seem to be  This recurred multiple times throughout the book In the summary it talks about how Jonas throughout his life had different experiences that should that he was different than all the other kids he hung out with  There is a scene in the book where Jonas is passing an apple back and forth with a friend of his  As they were playing something happened while the apple was in the air  only Jonas could see it though   But suddenly Jonas had noticed  following the path of the apple through the air with his eyes  that the piece of fruit had  well  this was the part that he couldn t adequately understand  the apple had changed  Just for an instant  It had changed in mid air  he remembered  Then it was in his hand  and he looked at it carefully  but it was the same apple   What had happened to this apple was that Jonas saw the color red  In their community everyone can t not see color besides the receiver and now Jonas  They don t explain why nobody can see color  but it is just another way that shows how shielded off this community is and how not everything is as what it seems  I really liked this book because I am a really big science fiction fan  If you like that type of book this is a must read for you  Throughout the book Lowery does a good job of explaining in more and more detail about the place that Jonas lives and what his everyday life is like  For me it almost made me thankful for the type of government we have and the type of life I had    At first  he had been only fascinated  He had never seen aircraft so close  for it was against the rules for Pilots to fly over the community  Occasionally  when supplies were delivered by cargo planes to the landing field across the river  the children rode their bicycles to the riverbank and watched  intrigued  the unloading and then the takeoff directed to the west  always away from the community   This is a quote in the beginning of the book  I thought it was a cool way to start the book because it raises so many questions about what is the community  Why can t planes fly over the community  As the book goes on it answers the questions you have and I like that a lot  This is a good read and if you decide to read it I hope you enjoy it   One of the best the books of 2014 without a doubt Whether or not it was because I read such a slow boring book before that this turned out to be so good  but I think that it was the book because I found myself that when I came home after school just wanting to curl and cuddle up with it I love the characters and I do know that it is a series but whether or not I would want to read the rest of the books I m not too sure because I think that the book ended on a point where like the character is about to go off and do something abs before they do it the book ends and I love that because its like the characters live on and that they are real and no harm will ever come to them because they are alive when you finish and I don t want to continue on a series where this rare pleasure is abruptly destroyed Jonas is such a strong character and The Giver himself is so mysterious its unreal  Its like he s an entire world alone I like Lois Lowry s writing and how intricate his writing is and how alive and personal his characters are  I really care for them and I m so happy Jonas found what he found but I can imagine the distraughtion in the other place where he left  It must be chaos back there Anyway I think that this is a really good book to go into any time of the year  its shocking in one bit where he watches something from the Hall Of Closed Records  I like the system of the community also  I could not live a life without freedom  I would do a  Jonas  and the power he has saves him and his companion 5 5 no doubt The Giver is a book all children should be made to read  It lets children know that even a Utopian society is not perfect  The Giver is a book that my children and their children will read as it was the very first book that kept my attention as a young child  I can remember the vivid detail in the book even ten years after I had read it  That tells me that the book is essential to life as we know it  Utopia  a perfect world  Everyone here is happy  and all is well in society  When main character Jonas is 18 years old  he s chosen to be the community s Receiver of Memories  He enters into training with an old man called  the Giver  who would give Jonas memories of the  real  world that the rest of the community is hidden from  From the Giver  Jonas learns not only of love and family  but also of pain  war  and all the unhappy truths the world holds  He quickly realizes that his community is fake  Confronted with this reality  Jonas faces difficult choices about his own life and the futures of many people he s become close to This book fits the genre of science fiction because no such perfect world exists  Everything is built around an imaginary world   that s almost believable  Reading level grades 6 8Mentor writing trait  idea  This whole book centers around a very clear  broad  and specific idea  of a utopia and what life is like  This gives students a great imaginary story with a clear main idea Specific themes to integrate into the classroom  creative writing on a students idea of perfect world  or utopia  Have students write an additional chapter of The Giver  Do a real life activity regarding a utopia  every student comes to class and receives an envelope with their role in society   I love this book so much I need to read the second book The Giver is a novel about a Utopian society where everybody is the same and all choices are made by the  elders   This book is important to me because it was probably one of the first books I read where I really thought about the messages that it carried  In the Utopian society where The Giver takes place  the citizens traded individuality for conformity and to ensure that nobody made a bad decision  all decisions were taken away  This book got me thinking a lot about what it means to be human and different  What I learned was that being different is part of who we are and without conflict and individuality life is dull and rather pointless  I also learned that I should never blindly follow and that I should always wonder and ask questions  which might not have been so good for my teacher   Besides the lessons this book taught me  I also just thought it was a great book and I enjoyed reading it  I hate writing reviews for books like this  It s not that I didn t like it   I have lots of things to say about books that I don t like  It s that I loved this book  and it s been around for so long and won awards and at this point   is there anything else I can say about it that hasn t been said a hundred times before  Read Full review here  http   www memyshelfandi com 2014 09     I first read this book at the begining of 8th grade  At first  I was reluctant  It was the story of a young boy  That s basically all I knew  At an age when I wanted to read about people older than me  in their later teens  I would often pick up the book  look at the cover  shrug  set it back down and head to some fantasy books that didn t have a cover involving a swords and beasts created so the author could put in a little pointless violence   I m all for mythical beasts  but I d just like to see one that served a more usefull perpouse than giving the main character something to stab  set on fire  decapitate  ect   Any how    Plus this book didn t have a lot of info on the back and that generally ticks me off  Why invest my oh so valuable time in a book I know nothing about  I was pretty wrong here  Jonas lives in a world missing a lot of things that we take for grantide every day  There isn t a whole lot I can say with out ruining the plot  Let me just tell you that there isn t a lot of stimulation in this little world Jonas lives in  But then  out of the blue  Jonas get s the oportunity to learn what he s been missing his whole  short life   Lowry wove a tale that no one will forget after reading  It s hugely important to today s falling society when we pass flowers by without taking a good sniff  or watch people die without a qualm on tv  We see people suffer without empathy  compassion or understanding  Lowry shows us what we might become if we continue in this manner   Trust me  if you had doubts about reading this book  don t any longer  You won t regret it  But I ll tell you now that you shouldn t venture in without your happy book  movie  I don t know  something that you go to to cheer up  close at hand  It s a story that makes you think  makes you think hard about utopian society and what it means to be an individual in a world were every one wants to be the perfect person  What we do not realize right now is that we can t be perfect in this life  and to be  like everybody else  is to sacrafice ourselves   I must confess that I d never even heard of this  modern classic  before the movie came along   And in retrospect  and having now discovered how popular and influential this book has been  I m quite saddened by my ignorance This is one of the quickest reads I ve ever had  finishing the complete book in little less than three hours  The simplistic language and prose  keeping in mind that this was originally written as a  children s book   do contribute to the ease with which a quick reader can blitz through the pages  But make no mistake   The simplicity of the book s structure does not  by any means  mean that the story is simple  It is anything but Through the chilling simplicity of The Giver s and Jonas s dystopian world  Lowry makes the poignancy of the narrative all the more effective  resulting in an experience that stays with the reader long after we turn the final page on Jonas s saga  A truly amazing piece of work  I love  love  love Lois Lowry   Wierd book but very very good Jonas lives in a perfect world  with a perfect family  in a place where everyone contributes to society and watches over each other with loving care  At the age of twelve he will receive his career assignment  but he worries that he doesn t show any special talents which would suit him for any particular assignment  He receives an unusual assignment  which begins to open his eyes to the reality beneath the surface of his home One of my friends highly recommended this book  and I enjoyed it very much  It s the first in the series  so the slow build up fits not just the book but also sets up the rest of the series  I just wish it hadn t ended so quickly  There are a lot of open questions  for instance  Who s really in charge  Why and how did the civilization end up like this  Are other towns like this   Of course  if you read a copy with a preview of the second book  the third question might be answered already   What happens next to everyone  As a middle school student I m used to plenty of science fiction fantasy cliche books that always seem the same  At first I thought this would be another one of those  I picked it up anyway  and was pleasantly surprised  The author blended modern elements with an interesting story line  At first  I was intrigued by the plot and action  I found myself wondering what would happen next  My curiosity pushed me to continue reading and I finished the book in a day  Or night I suppose  I read it at midnight  Afterwards  the book was constantly in my mind  The lessons  tone  and of course the ending  I appreciate that Lowry didn t write six or seven super drawn out sequels that would never be as good as the first  The fact that there was no strong romance was also nice  In conclusion I would recommend this book to anybody  It isn t super long and the plot isn t hidden with confusing phrases or words that sound like a page out of the thesaurus  One of my favorite books of all time   I listened to this book as an audio book  and I really enjoyed it  I loved the freedom of an audio book  where you can essentially do any other activity while hearing a book  The actual novel is about a community in the future where the protagonist  Jonas  lives  and he is assigned to the job of the Receiver in training  This job means he will receive all the memories from the past  before these strict communities were established  He eventually ends up leaving the community with a baby  Gabe  though the novel is no explicit on whether or not he lives or starves  Overall this novel was extremely captivating and I loved it   This book is honestly a masterpiece  I read it years ago  and coming back to it now I am just as impressed with the wonderful story that has been crafted by Lois Lowry  The Giver is about a boy named Jonas living in a utopic community where choice is virtually nonexistent  Family units are put together by a Council of Elders  who also assign everyone a career path once they turn 12  Jonas is assigned the position of Receiver of Memory  a mysterious job that will help him discover what life was like before everything was forced into Sameness  The thing that makes The Giver stand out among dozens of Young Adult dystopia novels is that I m still not sure if Jonas  community was a dystopia  I don t think this book gives us a clear answer about who is right and who is wrong about how society should work  The Giver is a wonderful example of how a book doesn t have to be technically dense in order to be thematically rich  It only took me one day to get through the entire text  but the questions raised by it will stay with me for years  Warnings  Mild Violence  Mild Sexuality It s difficult to determine that which makes the world perfect  We often ask if perfection is found in a structure wherein we could be at our bests and there is no envy between people  Is it found in a world governed by rules that sets order in a community  Is it found in a world just like Plato s  the republic  wherein all are given through a structure and one never has to worry on what s ahead  Or maybe the perfection of the world is grounded on its flaws and the wisdom that we attain from it  Maybe it is found in a world where it is okay to commit mistakes   in a world where there are uncertainties and wherein we are given the chance to decide for our own  Maybe perfection is found in the freedom of every person to make choices and to be responsible over those choices  We know that imperfection is the absence of perfection but who can determine that which is perfect  In what state can we call life perfect and in which state can it be categorized as imperfect  And who can rightfully claim that a choice is right Lois Lowry s The Giver opens the question of what brings meaning to life and the world  It challenges the experiences and memories that give meaning to each ones existence  It brings us into our deepest desires of experiencing the world in a different angle wherein everything is provided and everything is under control  In a world where there is no pain and sorrow  In a place where there is no dilemma between choices  In a community where everything is provided  But at the same time a place where there is an absence of surprise  a sense of awe to the world and most specially  love   The Giver is now one of my favorite books that I have read  Although it is a short book  it had me on the edge of my seat throughout the whole story  At first  it is a little confusing trying to describe the setting that the protagonist  Jonas  lives in  but once the story starts to pick up  it gets a lot better  Lois Lowry states the importance of memory and uniqueness through the life of Jonas and what he and the Giver goes through to find out the truth about their community  It really surprised me in the end when they showed what the word  release  actually meant in the community  I thought  like Jonas  that it was the release into a place called Elsewhere  The author does a good job foreshadowing and explaining the Giver and Jonas s feelings and what they were going through  I would recommend this book to others who like Lois Lowry s books and to people who enjoy a quick but good book   Probably the single most amazing dystopian book for kids I ve ever read  I wish I hadn t finished it on Thanksgiving  I feel so sad and desolate now  Passing the book on to my daughter  When I first saw this book at the library I thought it was a boring adult book put on the wrong shelf because of its cover  Then I read it and it is amazing and I recommend it to everybody  This book was incredibly good  because it really explains how there s no  perfect world There is no real utopia  We did a project that tied along with The Giver that asked us to create our own perfect  utopia   At first  it sounded very simple  but in the end  we got stumped  since life really wouldn t be the same without conflict and ups and downs  5 staaaaars   Having made her name with wacky family stories  the Anastasia Krupnik books  and won her first Newbery Medal with Number the Stars  a historical novel about the Danish rescue of Jews during World War II  Lois Lowry stepped into speculative fiction with The Giver and won her second Newbery  I m not sure why I ve missed reading it until now It s a bit difficult to tell the plot of this book without  spoilers   suffice it to say that Jonas  the protagonist  lives in a community which  although highly regimented  has no poverty  virtually no crime  and full employment  The slightest twinge brings a  relief of pain  pill  and the very old and very young are well cared for  Only gradually  as Jonas turns 12 and receives his unusual work assignment  do we learn what has been given up to achieve this  utopia   and it is nothing less than free will    not to mention love  colors  weather  and  of course  memory    the collective memory that is human civilization Both my daughters are experienced childcare givers and as such  they have strong opinions on childrearing  which surprisingly coincide with mine more often than not  After reading The Giver  I can t help but think that this book may have influenced their ideas  The current preoccupation of many parents that their children be spared pain  loneliness or boredom at all costs does not seem good to us  Lowry s book takes such ideas to their logical conclusion and posits that where there is no pain or sadness  there can also be no joy  when there is no risk  there is no achievement  In fact  The Giver seems to me to be an extended meditation on free will  Nevertheless  it s also a good story  and there are two sequels which I m planning to read soon  Highly recommended  Unbelievable  This is a setting of a dark  yet sadly true sounding world  Jonas is one of the people who live here  in a  Community   In the Community  there is no color  no fear  no war  no pain  no joy  just prothstetic feelings  In a family unit  there is a mother  father  brother  and sister  Not naturally born  from the same birth family  Every year a child is considered a  first year    second year    third year  and so on until they are twelve  Then they get assigned jobs  houses and forget about their  parental units   Jonas is assigned a special role  Of keeping track of the past  His  Giver  gives him memories of a strange past  when there were elaphants  so called  granparents  and hings seemed dangerous  Jonas thinks   they could get hurt  they get to choose things   What if they make the wrong decision   Then he realizes the truth  his world is screwed up  Each day gets more and more disturbing  People don t actually die  they get released  killed  No feelings  no love  It s hard to take  Jonas runs away  And he never returns  I reccomend this to anyone who likes books and adventure and is over the age of 10  All I can say about this book is Wow  I listened to this in the car  From the first sentence I was hooked  I really had no idea what this book was about before I read it  so I was just amazed by its power and insight  As for the ambiguous ending  so called  I found it surprising but not unfulfilling  I prefered to take a realist approach  suffused with the fact that Jonas had come into his own as a full fledged human being by the end  I also enjoyed the moral ambiguities of this work  What a great booktalk or book club discussion item  The Giver  is  I am now going to read  The Gathering Blue  and  The Messenger   These works were not as well reviewed in the articles which I read in the database Literature Resource Center  But I intend to read them without pre judgement  It would be hard anyway to conjure up a book the equal of  The Giver   so why expect that If you have access to Lowry s Newberry acceptance speech  also in Literature Resource Center  for  The Giver   I recommend that you read it   This was  hands down  my favorite book in elementary school  I was 10 when it came out  and it was probably one of the first books I re read numerous times  I hated the ambiguous ending  which  as a child  I told myself went the happy direction but now  as an adult  I m slightly more pessimistic  I hoped upon hope the Lois Lowry would write a sequel  but in the end I resigned myself the believing this was just one of those books where you d never know  Imagine my surprise when I learned a few years ago that she made it into a quartet  Before diving into the new to me books  I had to revisit the first book  Honestly  even twenty years later  I still found it to be wonderful  and according to the introduction of the anniversary edition  many people from all walks of life contacted Lowry and told her as much  As I re read it  I kept thinking   This is where it all began   No  I don t think that she invented dystopian fiction  but I can t help but feel like many of the current YA authors read this book during their formative years   I decided to buy The Giver when I was at the thrift shop  I think it was only 50 cents or a dollar  I really enjoyed the movie so I wanted to read the book  The Giver is the story of a boy named Jonas who lives in a utopian society  The society believe in sameness so everyone has the same type of house  clothes  food as it s the differences that causes conflict  In the mornings  everyone takes a little pill that helps them remain calm and compliant Life is set out for everyone  Children are born at the nurturing centre by official birth mothers then given to a family  The family units consist of a mother  father  boy and girl  There are no natural families where the mother and father have produced the children  Once the children grow up  the parents quit the family unit to live in the houses for childless adults  They spend the rest of the time working an assigned job until they get too old  When they grow old they live in the House of Old until they die The book starts off with Jonas turning twelve and nervous about what job he ll be assigned in the future  Every child is monitored closely so that the elders know the suitable occupation for a child  Jonas is assigned a very special job  He is to be the next Receiver of Memories  The Receiver learns about the history of the community so that they can advise the council of elders when they face new problems with knowledge from the past Jonas meets the current Receiver who he calls the Giver  The Giver shows him memories not just from the community but life before when everyone was different  He shows Jonas the history of human civilization and concepts such as love and war  Jonas realizes that their society has given up so much for peace What I liked about this book was that it wasn t set in a bleak and grimy future where there are ruined buildings and charred rubble  This book is not action packed like other books in this genre and focuses on how stifling life can be with too many rules and conformity  It was a different experience to read about a world where the people weren t struggling and there is no secret band of rebels  When I read this book  I was reminded to appreciate the small things in life  Jonas found the smallest things like seeing in colour and feeling the breeze ripple through the leaves on trees to be amazing  It was something he never noticed before he became the Receiver The book also explores typical things that people worry about when they are leaving their childhood  Jonas worries about his future occupation  keeping in touch with friends and growing feelings  In the movie  Jonas is sixteen instead of twelve  I think it would have been better if he were older in the novel as being sixteen is more a crossroad than twelve I found this book to be a bit philosophical and I enjoyed musing about it while I read the book  As a teacher  I want to read it aloud to a class one day to see if they will enjoy it too  I think it is a thought provoking book and I would love to have discussions about it with a class  I m a bit ashamed to say I hadn t read this book before now  I know  I m a bad children s librarian  I picked it up  well  the audio book  because I was looking for something to listen to in the car  and also because the movie adaptation is out in theaters and I wanted to read the book before seeing the movie Wow  This book is amazing  I understand why it is taught in English classes and I wish it had been published earlier so that I would have had the benefit of reading it when I was in school  The writing is exquisite and I think the plot  characters  and multiple thematic elements lend themselves to serious thinking and discussion between children  parents  and teachers And let me give a plug for the audio book version  Actor Ron Rifkin reads the book and he does an amazing job  giving vocal changes to represent Jonas and the Giver  as well as inflections to represent certain plot changes  I highly recommend listening to this while you read the book  as it will enhance the reading experience and bring the book to life  Imagine a world with no hunger  poverty  malice  competition  hatred or war  Then imagine that world with no recollection of the past  no colors  no snow  no mountains  no sunshine  and more  Sameness  Complete order  That is how one would describe Jonas  world  Proves to say that there is no such thing as a perfect world   Everything and anything that you do are dictated by a council called the Elders  There are rules even for the puny little things  You cannot ask questions that will make it awkward for the other person  you have to use specific phrases for everything  you cannot ride a bike until you turn nine  you are not to lie  cheat or get jealous  One must take a pill when you reach the time of stirring or wet dreams to suppress the urges  You have a biological mother yet you will never meet her and she will never meet you  Cruel  No because in Jonas  community  they are called Birth mother  it is their job  A world where in you get released when you get old or if a newborn did not meet the community s standard for being healthy  A world where you are given a career at the age of twelve  a career that will be your until you grow old I would have a really strong feeling of dislike for the people living inside Jonas  community if not for their innocence  ignorance  I cannot really describe how I feel  I was so conflicted  The plot was set further into the future where in only one person have the memories of the past and he is called the Giver  Jonas was chosen to carry these memories and is now called the Receiver  It is an eerier version of Pleasantville and a world with a lot of red flags for human rights violation and a community that would sure get swamped with activists of all sorts I LOVE IT  The strangeness  the obscurity  even if their rules were so infuriating  It is a fascinating read  Definitely a classic  Something that you ll read more than once I read it slow and asked many people if they have read it or not  If they have I tell them the story or bore them to death depending on who I talked to  Say example my husband  At the end he told me that it is only a book that I should calm down  LOL  He does not get it  He thinks dissecting a book is silly nor the contents should be given thoughts  This is why I love the bookish community They do not think that I am some weirdo who keeps yapping about books  The Giver is a very good book by Lois Lowry  although it was a little slow at first  I liked it because it was in a in the future and you just want to find out more about it and what it s like there  The Giver is a good book that will make is in a time when all things have gone into sameness  there are no cars and the only ways of transportation is walking and biking  They have nearly no choice as to what you can choose  they cannot choose their clothing  job  spouse  or children  and it is in black and white  In this future they all have stages that go with their ages  Jonas is an 11  wich is what they call that class  and his little sister  Lily  is a 7 and will become an eight at this cerimony  At each cerimony they say their name and give them something that represents their stage in for age  the twelves get their job that they need to do for the rest of their lives until they go into the house of the old  Jonas is the main charictor and he is just like everybody else  but he started to see things change  and during the cerimony of 12 he is skipped and he thinks that there was a mistake of some sort  Then at the end of it he is called up to the front and he is told that he was not chosen he was selected to be the reciever of memmories  He is also given the rules for his new job  and one of them is that he can lie  wich is a crime in the book  and he can ask anybody anything  He can nolonger take any kind of medicine  or participate in the cerimony of sharing dreams  He receives memories of  first a sled ride down a hill then a memory of the sun  Both of these things were taken away when they went into sameness  Then eventually the giver said that he could not protect him forever  and said that he would need to give Jonas memmories of pain  sickness  and sadness  He started off with a sunburn  then with the greif of losing a lost family member  then ended that session with the memmory of a broken leg from going down a steep hill that had some ice on it  Afterwords they talked about the failure of ten years earlier wher a female had been selected and the giver had not known how to start the training so he started with momories of pain  them two weeks into her training she skedualed for release  and all of the memmories went to the people of the community  Jonas wanted to make it so that everybody could see in color and not just him and the giver  After nearly a year of training  Jonas and the giver made a plan and Jonas had to move the plan into action early because Gabriel  the newchild that his family had been takeing care of since before the cerimony of twelve  was going to be releiced in the morning And you will need to read The Giver by Lowis Lowry to find out what their plan was  and more details that I couldn t write  this is my all time favorite lois lowry book  it is probably the only book with no action i actually liked   if you have to have action in a book  dont read it  but i sugest you atleast give it a try  This book captures my attention with the back cover alone  The plot is so beautifully designed  setup  and carried out  With that being said   Jonas has lived in a world of no colors  music  freedom  choices  love  hate  pain  happiness  emotions or real feelings of any kind  for twelve years  Jonas  along with his and other communities have lived like this for as long as they can remember  With only one person in the community that knows better  The Giver  The Giver holds all memories  the good and the bad   the memories of people   from the past  He who holds the memories  holds  not only real knowledge  but real emotions and feelings  However  the Giver will be the first to tell you that this is not a privilege  but a burden  At least it is   until Jonas and the Giver  devise a plan to share the memories with everyone else  This is one of my all time favorites  I love it  Recommend it to all  The ending is up to the reader  Which is something that I loved  Although some did not appreciate it the way I did Cover  Didn t do it justice Plot  Beautifully Twisted Beginning  Interesting Middle  Eye Opening End  Left me in Awe Writing Style  Wonderfully Conservative Educational  This Book Taught Me True Sacrifice Page Turner  Yes Tear Meter  My Eyes Watered Throughout The Book Laugh Meter  Chuckled Drugs Alcohol  Very Mild Language  Mild Sexual Activity  Mild Religion  None   That I can remember  Age Range  12  Recommend it  Yes Final Rating  5 Stars    The Giver  is the kind of book that leaves you thinking after you put it down  The reader is drawn in by Jonas s own curious nature  and then you learn as he learns about the ways his society controls experience and memory  Although there is no firm  resolution  at the end of the book  you do get a sense of satisfaction as Jonas finds answers on his own   The dystopian society that Lois Lowry creates in her novel feels comforting at first  Everything feels arranged  just so   so nothing is out of place and everything is handled  All people know what is expected of them and what they need to do to contribute to their society  They understand the consequences for not following through on these and feel a commitment to participating in the smooth running of their community   The reader participates in this tacit compliance  not fully understanding why things are as they are but accepting that society seems functional  However  as Jonas begins to question  so too does the reader  The reader follows along as Jonas discovers more and more about his society and eventually makes a bold move to change his life forever   Lois Lowery creates a full and complex world in which her narrative exists  Roles  responsibilities  and the physicality of the world are exposed to the reader so that the reader can feel fully engaged with the story  Although the physical layout of every location is not described in the utmost detail  the reader gets the sense that he or she  like Jonas  is fully immersed in the world and  also like Jonas  struggles to come to terms with it   Like Jonas  however  the reader is not able to see all of the world  Some things are kept secret  and it is this that Jonas questions  He makes ripples in a smooth world  finding fault with the way things are organized as the Giver exposes more secrets to him  Jonas is being trained to take on all of the responsibilities of an adult in his community and is being taught what he needs to know for a specific job  However  Jonas ponders the impossible  can he leave his home  Is there even a universe beyond the bounds of his community  The reader is taken along on this journey  learning and questioning as Jonas does   Jonas eventually has to question whether he fits in his community  He cannot  unknow  what the Giver has told him  so Jonas is forced to reconsider what he thought he knew about his life and make bold choices  Although this book does not give the reader a resolution in a traditional sense  Jonas does make choices at the end of the novel that give the reader some idea of where he goes and the effect of his decisions  The reader is left in some mystery  but there are three more books that follow in the quartet  The end of this book will push the reader to pick up the next one and continue on Jonas s journey   The giver is my favourite jovenile book ever  I wish Lowery had not written Gathering Blue and The Messenger as they were a disappointment   Tohle byla fakt

jeste nikdy nevidela  Zachecam do zapoznania sie z moja recenzja dostepna na moim blogu pod adresem  http   magicznyswiatksiazki pl dawca        wow  what an amazing story  i loved all the little elements that made the world feel very real and the slow progression of clues that made you see it in a totally different light  HIGHLY recommend  The Giver is a masterpiece  The sentences flow through your mind as you re reading creating a calmness that most books don t bring you  This book is most likely directed at middle grade children  but I am in high school and I loved it with a passion  It starts out in a utopia and gradually turns into a dystopia as the book progresses  This book will bring you joy  and it will bring you sadness  But no matter what it brings you  by the end you will fall in love with Jonas  the main character   Lois Lowry creates characters so real you can almost touch them  Please read this book  I originally read this book back in middle school  but didn t really remember it  So  I thought it was high time to read it once more as an adult and teacher  I enjoyed it just as much as the first time  I think this was probably the first dystopian book I had ever read  and now I m hooked and I think I have this book to thank for that  When reading it for the second time  I did notice some plot holes and some improbable events  But  it didn t ruin anything for me because I automatically suspended disbelief  After all  who knows what really is possible in such a future  Plus  what may be unrealistic to us may not be unrealistic in this world  as the people truly don t know any better  Really  if you like dystopians  this a classic book you have to read at least once  If you don t think you like dystopians  this would be a great segue into the genre  I will fondly look back on this book as one of the first YA dystopians and an excellent story I listened to the audio book and I absolutely loved the narrator  He has such an amazing voice that is full of emotion  He truly brought the book to life  I also would love to use the audiobook in the classroom because kids could learn a lot about reading aloud from this narrator  Jonas lives in a perfect world  Everyone has the perfect job for their personalities  there is always food and the weather is always perfect  But when he turns twelve  Jonas is assigned his job as the giver  He learns about all sorts of things from the joy of sledding to pain of war and with it  some disturbing truths about the  perfect  world he lives in  Now he s faced with a challenge  what should he do with his new knowledge  Excerpt It was almost December  and Jonas was beginning to be frightened  No  Wrong word  Jonas thought  Frightened meant that deep  sickening feeling of something terrible about to happen  Frightened was the way he had felt a year ago when an unidentified aircraft had overflown the community twice  He had seen it both times  Squinting toward the sky  he had seen the sleek jet  almost a blur at its high speed  go past  and a second later heard the blast of sound that followed  Then one more time  a moment later  from the opposite direction  the same plane   The novel titled  The Giver  is a very good book  It takes place in the distant future  where inferior technology is not needed  The setting is a community where everyone believes it to be perfect  but I m sure you would think quite the contrary  This community has eliminated many simple elements such as animals  climate  and even pain  The characters that are most prominent throughout the storyline are Jonas  The character that the story follows  the main character   Lily  This is the sister of Jonas   Asher  Who is Jonas s best friend   and The Giver  which you will hear about if you decide to read this book  The creators of their community eliminated the simple elements mentioned earlier to make this community  Perfect    Several injustices are shown throughout the story  but I would have to say that one stands out over all of the rest  The injustice that stands out over all of the others is the system of family units  And that s what they are  Units  To become a family  you apply for one  First  you apply for a spouse  Then the owners of the community choose one for you  Then  if you want  you apply for a child  2 actually  a boy and a girl  There is no actual connection in the families  because the community lacks feelings  including love  Obviously  this is the largest injustice in the book  barely bypassing the concept of release in the community  I would highly recommend this book to anyone who loves reading very descriptive and advanced fiction that has aspects of action  adventure  and a touch of fantasy added  I would also recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading about other societies that aren t in our world  However  I would not recommend this book to      Well  I would recommend this book to everyone in fact  It is an amazing novel that I believe everyone should have the chance to read  Hopefully  after reading this review  you consider going out and reading this book  You ll probably enjoy it  Lowry  Lois  The Giver  Boston  Houghton Mifflin Print  1993  Print  The Giver is a story of a young boy named Jonas who lives in a Perfect society where in which everything is the same and decided for you  Everyone dresses the same  eats the same food and takes the same classes  Everyone has their job  spouse and children chosen for them  Everyone is blissful ignorance including Jonas  That is until he is selected as the receiver and starts spending day after day with the giver  The receiver gives him memories of a different time  With the memories come a whole range of emotions including love and pain  Only when Jonas relives what the community does with the weak does he realize that he can t handle living in utopia anymore and flees  In the process helps the Giver become an important part of the community once again  This Newberry Medal Winner is well worth the read  The book makes you think of a world with a new opinion and think if the world of choice and open mindess is right  Also shows you what we have to give up to live in a perfect utopia ad lets you make your own opinion on rather or not what Jonas does is right or wrong  This book is for the late children s literature and early Young Adult literature  best age group would be eleven to thirteen   Whats with all the negative reviews This was the first dystopian novel that I read  I was required to read it in eighth grade  and at first I didn t get it and thought it was lame  Then I went back and re read it in tenth grade  What a difference  This is one of my favourite books now  Reading the sequels makes a huge difference as well  and I wasn t even aware that there were sequels until tenth grade  I m trying to get ahold of the fourth one that just recently came out  and I can t wait to read it As a dystopian novel  it isn t too original  A hero realizes that theres something wrong in the community that they live in  and then tries to change it  He may or may not have made a difference  What WAS so different about it was its ending  The end has gotten me and my friends into arguments  The answer to what happens to him is in the seccond book  but as I said  we didn t know the second book existed in eighth grade  and we weren t sure if he lived or died  I ll leave it to the readers to figure out and decide for yourselves   Oh  I really loved  The Giver   This was exactly the kind of book I ve been wanting to read lately  great worldbuilding  a captivating story  shocking at times and yet still kept rather simple  I think you can tell with how much love this was written  how carefully constructed some scenes and the language were  how the book makes you care about Jonas and his journey so much  I listened to it on audiobook read by Ron Rifkin and I think this was the perfect choice  I really liked his narration and the sound effects with it  I don t think I d have been so immersed in the story if I had been reading it myself  I Absolutely ADORED This book  This is the BEST Book EVER      This is a book that I will read AGAIN and AGAIN     The story line was Fabulous and I think it has some meaning like the lion the witch and the wardrobe Like the Giver is the Atonement and the memories are the trageties that we Do Not have to bear So I loved it I loved this book  It was a bit hard for me to follow at first  but once I understood what I was reading  I loved it  I haven t read this since my junior year in college  so this is definitely a book that I need to go back and reread  Brilliant  As good a case as I ve ever seen for free will  for the freedom to make our own mistakes  for the freedom to stumble through life  Quite powerful  the story lingers on  the twists are simple and merciless and painful  My middle schooler eager to discuss  That means it s good  99    1   za to  ze to bylo tak kratke  RECENZE na blogu     Jonas is a twelve year old boy who lives in what seems to be the perfect society  He is nervous about the Ceremony of Twelve  because he will be given an assignment that he will work in for the rest of his life  He is shocked to learn that he is assigned to be the Receiver  The Receiver ultimately becomes the most important Elder in the community  During his training  he meets with the Giver  and he is given memories that help him learn about the past  Jonas sees color for he first time  he experiences happiness for the first time  he experiences love for the first time  and he also experiences pain  war  and sadness  With all his new memories  Jonas learns that his society isn t as perfect as he once thought I love this book  It has such an amazing message and is written so simply that anyone could read it  Lois Lowry is a great writer and added the perfect amount of detail and explanation in order to make it memorable  It is a book that can be enjoyed by younger children  but has deeper meanings that older teens and adults would be able to enjoy and deeply think about   Divergent and the Giver Comparison  I think we would all agree that virtual reality is the next big thing  Virtual reality stimulates our mind in the form of images  it causes us to be amazed by what we can think of  but what else has that effect  Words  Dystopian books such as The Giver and Divergent lies upon our imaginations  It causes us to think deeper into the meaning of life and human nature  Both authors  Lois Lowy  The Giver  and Veronica Roth develop similar plots and rules  but with different thoughts comes different actions  The Giver and Divergent are similar in the fact that they are both fictional and that the characters try to break free from their communities iron grasp  Both of the communities are ruled by  communists    A group of people who work toward the greater good and harmony of society  Of course  the elders try to limit people s knowledge and freedom  because the less they know  the more docile they are  Even the most simplest things  such as color and music are either ignored or taken away  But as time drew on  ideas changed  Greed  Selfishness  Power  The elders became greedy over the power they had over others  and the people realized started asking questions  We are humans  We improve by asking questions and making mistakes  The difference between successful people and normal people is if they ask why   Why the hawk    Roth 12  Tris asks  She always wants to gain knowledge  and through knowledge comes wisdom  We as humans are innovative because we ask questions and we want to understand  When that is taken away  we rebel  It is human nature for us to get what we want  Jonas did  by leaving the community  a great act of betrayal  he showed the elders their wrong doings  By teaming up with the factionless  the group often shunned by society  Tris in Divergent caused the government to realize their wrong doings   Lois Lowy and Veronica Roth both agree with the fact that rules were installed to preserve freedom  In The Giver  there are rules so that people understand right and wrong  but not when these rules suppress human nature  People cannot leave the community  or they will be banished forever  People cannot say anything bad about the community  or they will be chided  In Divergent  people are forced to wear a specific color everyday  That is why the teens  with still a little curiosity to question the community and the ambition to act  are the ones that can be the change  There might be consequences  but they acted  The authors speak to readers  They tell the readers to always challenge the common things  because like the faction system in Divergent  many elders used powers in self interest  There is unsatisfaction with the way the communities govern all over the pages  Jonas resorts to shame in order to critize his community  On the other hand  Tris uses force to take out the elders  In my opinion  shaming the community is a better way of change because it gives the elders a chance to realize what they did wrong  However  Tris used force to try to change the government  but who will take the spots of the dead elders  The answer is inexperienced catalyst who have no idea how to rule a city  The community would crumble by itself if no one was there to advise them  Unlike Tris  Jonas was smarter  He knew how to change  That is the main difference between the books  Some people may say that shaming a community only makes the elders mad and want to punish Jonas  but Jonas did it secretly  He still respected the elders and trusted them to make the right choice  The elders changed  as at last Jonas  thought he heard music too   Lowry 225  The authors try to express that everyone should be given a second chance to correct themselves  It is better than just killing that person if that person can give back to society  The Giver and Divergent are similar in plots and genre  but there is still a lot of differences between the authors craft techniques and overall ideas about society  They makes us think   what can we do to make our world perfect  But in this world at this time  what is perfect   Jonas is the hero in The Giver  He is also a perfect son  student  and citizen  He is told what job he will hold  who he will marry and when he will die  He is even given pills to suppress his desires and emotions  This society is very controlling  but tells everyone it is for their own good  Jonas learns of the horrors behind his perfect society  Jonas is forced to learn their flaws quickly and brutally  taking on forgotten memories and emotions for the good of society  I will never forget the scene when Jonas watched his father  release  the twin baby  It was horrifying and made me unerstand the horrors of this ideal society   The Giver made me wonder about the euphemisms we use to hide the brutal truth of our lives  What happens if we lose our memories  What is wisdom  When we turn over the hard parts of our lives  war and death and suffering and loss  do we lose our best parts  Without suffering  can we understand joy  Without loss  can we understand love  What makes us human  In giving up our wisdom  do we lose our capacity to make life changing decisions humanely  Is this worth the cost of the hard parts of our lives  What are we willing to sacrifice for the greater good  What are we unwilling to sacrifice of ourselves  This book is thought provoking and poignant   Although it is easy to read  to enjoy the deeper meanings and questions  I recommend it to kids and teenagers who are advanced readers  The giver The giver is about a 11 year old boy who lives in a dystopian future where everyone is equally and the same to prevent all war hatred and Violence  There is no war since everyone looks and acts basically the same and there is very little competition  Everyone is really polite  The society has also got rid of choice when the kids are 12 everyone in the community is given a job based on his or her skills and interests  When their children are grown family units dissolve and adults live together with Childless Adults until they are too old to work in the society  Jonas lives with his father a Takes care of new children his mother who works at the Department of Justice and his seven year old sister Lily  I the beginning of the book Jonas is turning 12 so he will be in the ceremony of the 12 s this year  At the ceremony Jonas is called last and he gets the receiver of memories later Jonas meets his trainer  His name is the giver and he was the old receiver of memories and over time he teaches Jonas things no one else in the town can see memories of what life use to be  I think this was a great book because it had a good story and a good between the characters I think the theme of the story is freedom because in the end Jonas finds out that if the baby s are too big they kill them and Jonas runs away with the baby he saved  I thought this book was very creative  The main characters in this book is Jonas and the giver  Jonas like everyone else in his small town are assigned a role that they must complete to be an adult  Jonas doesnt like this law very much so he sets out on his own to discover what the world is really like  On his journey he meets the Giver  The Giver is the guy that holds all the power of seeing the world as it normally is  Jonas wants so bad to see what it used to be like that he does anything he possibly can to see these thoughts that the giver can see  Eventually into the end of the book Jonas gets a glimpse at the world and why his town is the way that it has become  He didnt like the images or the thoughts at all  and wanted to have everything go back to the way things used to be  Knowing the Giver though gave him the opportunity to have his powers to change things to his own creations  Jonas is scared of all that power and tries to runaway before he gets them  but no one can ever run from powers that they never knew they were given  Knowing what may have happened with Jonas is worth reading this book  Im not very much of a reader myself but this book caught my attention from the minute I read the first few chapters   This book is about how everyone in this town all use manners and are assigned spouses and how many children they are allowed to have  At the age of 12 kids in this town get assigned a person they must marry at that age  Each mother is a mother to 2 children exactly  when these kids are born they are left in a nursery without being able to hear or see there mothers for a year then they are left in this society until they get released  Jonas doesnt like the way his society runs so he decided that he wanted to run away and never come back but before he does he meets the Giver  He gave Jonas powers that no man could ever imagine to have and ends up being released outside of his society  It s really hard for me to find a book that I actually liked but this one definetly caught my attention  This was a very interesitng book  When I began reading and really getting into this book it sort of reminded me of the book  Divergent  I noticed how in a way the people in this book where in their own factions  the Sameness and the Elswhere  As I really began to get into the book I began to picture how the people in this secluded town where obviously in some kind of cult  They were giving specific jobs and titles based on the Committee of Elders and they were also told who to marry and how many children they could have  I just thought this was crazy  Here you have a group of people who had to apply for a match and that request was submitted to the committee  The ones who applied did not exactly know for sure when they would be told that they could have a mate  Then there was the idea of children in which the couple did not actually give birth to their own children but there was a 3 year career for women who had been chosen to be birthing mothers to do it for them  Each couple was only allowed two children which consisted of a boy and a girl  The other amazing thing that really through me for a loop was the way they were chosen for their careers  At the age of eleven or twelve the kids where actually placed in training for their new careers  Basically  they had to grow up fast and become productive citizens  At each stage in their lives they all celebrated their brithdays up until the age of twelve  Not the way we would celebrate because they all would do it in the month of December and it was more of an initation ceremony to the next age  Jonas s parents along with the others in the book were really weird  The mother was some sort of attorney and the father was listed as a  Nurturer   The dad seemed more feminine than the mother and the mother seemed more masculine than the father  When the initation ceremony came in December Jonas was the last to be chosen for his job that he would have for the rest of his life  He was chosen as the receiver and that is when is journey actually began  Now  what I found to be most disturbing was the fact that the people in this community took medicine to surpress their feelings of wanting to have relations  When I read the part about Jonas and Asher going through changes because of puberty and the fact that they had to take pills to surpress it was so controlling  Other things I noticed in this book was the fact that when the people became old they sent them to a place for old people  It was also very cult like when I read how and if twins were born they would basically take the weight of each to determine who stays in the group and who does not  I also found it rather disturbing when I finally saw what they actually meant when they said that they would  release  someone  That was just plain and simple murder  I also noticed how you could tell if two babies were related because Jonas said something about two kids living in two different family units with the same eyes  Which means they were birth by the same mother  What I did not like was the fact that when Jonas was chosen to be the receiver he could not except the fact that he had to carry with him all those emotions because that was the receiver s job to be the burden carrier  In other words the people in that town were basically programmed and had not idea of what it meant to feel starvation  pain and etc  I was very moved when the giver began his training with Jonas and how in the end Jonas was just like Rosemary and could not bare to carry all this with him  Unlike Rosemary he did not request to be released but instead chose to runaway  When Jonas took Gabe I wondered if all that time that could have been his little brother and that is why he felt such a connection to him  Anyway  I really do not blame Jonas because after he witnessed his father killing the twin that weighed less he was very distraught and I believe that really pushed him to the edge  In the end Jonas finally saw that Elsewhere was really somewhere and I am sure if I had to write the ending he discovered that life was more than just about color and pain  I had no idea this book was science fiction  and I was surprised at how fascinated I was by it  Jonas is eleven years old and living with his  family  in a completely controlled environment  When the book opens  he is heavy with concern about the upcoming 12 yr old ceremony  where he and the other Twelves will learn what assignment they will have for adult life  When the unexpected occurs  Jonas begins to learn the truths about his world and those he has trusted  been instructed by  for so long  He begins to wonder if anything can be done to change it I loved how this unfolded  almost like a mystery as we come to understand the ramifications of a lifestyle with complete control  sameness  and predictability  I m almost wishing I had read it for a book club or classroom setting  simply for the opportunity to mull it over a little longer I thought it was wonderful  The headache I had when I picked it up last night was completely forgotten until I had finished and put the book down  That s really saying something   o   I was in high school when this book came out  but I was not aware of it until recently A community devoid of choice  A place where everything is the same color and a group of elders make the rules  In a lot of ways  it is ideal  It is safe  people do not feel pain  hunger and there is no war  On the other hand  a lack of choice is a type of prison  They also don t feel love  joy or pleasure  One person in the community feels everything  He is the Receiver of Memories  he holds all of mankind s memories Jonas is selected to be the new receiver and through his eyes  we see the feelings an choices that we take for granted in our world It was a very thought provoking read and I hope that children are exposed to the level of thinking in this Newbery Winner  i actually really liked this book  i found it really entertaining worth 2 books  With the movie coming out and all my friendlies telling me to go read it  I finally complied What can I say   Short  fun dystopian book with an interesting message  Since the book is intended for the young  adults   it s very simple in writing and story  which SO WORKS for the narrative and makes it better than any adult book I ve read lately  The prose flooooooows so well and descriptions are so minimal which makes the pages turning themselves You keep flippin  and there s no stoppin Highly recommended  quickie Dystopia Go get it  before the Giver takes away this review  Quite a reading experience Long long ago I ve read 1984  and I read Saramago s Blindness  And neither of them felt this alien  Simple concepts  simple ideas piling one over the other  At first it s a serene landscape and then it slowly starts twisting out of shape It s an awe inducing tale  A frightening tale  though there is nothing scary in it The lure of sameness  the promise of safety and acceptance with the underlying terror of being different  ruled Other and then  released   I think the institution of sameness is scary because  arrogantly  we all imagine ourselves vastly individual and different from the rest  I believe this isn t so  But we do  and sameness is scary because feeling our individuality so strongly we feel ourselves excluded from the Many  we feel unprotected from the threat of being  released  I find myself torn between Pro s and Con s over the institution of Sameness  As presented in the novel  I thought it a very controversial system  So many question are buzzing around in my head right now  I m drowning in my own impotence trying to provide answers to myself Memories may weigh heavily  And indeed  carrying them is a great honour   Ok  i m just gonna tell you like it is  Ok  so basicly its a world with no war no color no LOVE no emotion whatso ever     WORLD PEACE  yes  it is     but we miss just as much good things as much bad things  so it pretty much showes that world peace will never be  well perfect  this is just my opinion  don t get butt hurt please  it has no emotion in the charecters but has EXTREME emotion beteween the lines  It makes you open your eyes in a new way and make you apretiate the things you get everyday   Color Difference Love and Freedom    so basiclly BEST DANG BOOK EVER    well one of the best Read this book in school in 6th grade and it instantly become one of my all time favorites  I picked up more things each I read it  I love reading it every time  cryyyyinnngggggannnngssssttttmuch sadnessvery deadwowthis is why I avoided reading this book again for so long  The Giver and I have a love hate relationship  f ck that ending   The Giver  by Lois Lowry is about a boy named Jonas urging change for the  Utopian  society he is living in  In the Community  everything is perfect  or so the citizens thought  Assignments are given to the Twelves in the Community and everybody gets one  It is a way of life  it s normal  When Jonas gets his Assignment  everything will change  I absolutely enjoyed this book and I couldn t put it down  The sensory details are stupendous  you could imagine yourself in the scene  The writing was powerful and beautiful  This book encourages you to fight for what you believe in and to not be afraid to ask questions  I would recommend this book to everybody I know  I am excited to read the next three books in this quartet   This book is simply beautiful   It can be read by a wide range of audiences  Again its a dystopian novel set in a world where communities in America live in black and white and only know what they are supposed to  However  the flip side is that technology was designed to erase the memories of the past  Simple things like modern language  colour  music  dancing etc was erased as well as terrible events from the past are also erased  All this to keep the world in peace  However  one person from each community is the receiver of memory and is the only person who remembers the past while everyone else is oblivious to it  one such receiver named Jonas is chosen to the receiver of memory and he sets a whole chain of events in motions and it becomes his mission to restore those memories  Very fast paced and interesting read  I would definitely recommend it to everyone  its not heavy nor too light  Im kind of wishing their was a sequel to see what happens after the book  or a prequel to see why they had to erase their memories   Jonas is an eleven year old boy who lives in a controlled community in the future  In an attempt to create a utopian society  the Elders have removed anything that might cause pain and suffering  They have also taken it upon themselves to make decisions for each individual in the community  such as who will get married  how many children each couple will have  and what job each person will be assigned  When children turn twelve they get assigned their new role in the society  During this ceremony  Jonas gets chosen to become The Giver  The Giver is the only person in the community who has the memories of pain and pleasure  This story tells of Jonas  thrilling and surprising journey into adulthood and his experience becoming the new Giver The Giver has been one of my favorite books since childhood  Every time I read this book  I catch on to something new or can interpret something in a new way  I believe that adults and adolescents can identify with the story and relate to it  Adolescents might view this novel as an interesting  yet unimaginable  science fiction novel  Meanwhile  adults will be able to see the deeper meaning and growth of the main character  Jonas  Within this story  there are important themes of growing up  taking risks  and making sacrifices As mentioned earlier  I believe that this book can be enjoyed by just about anyone  I think it is important to note that this is not necessarily an upbeat  feel good story  However  it will make you think critically about society and the privileges we have   This book was recommended by DevourerofBooks on my blog  and I happened to hit the library that same night  I checked out  The Giver  and began reading it immediately  I was pleasantly surprised at the ease of Lowry s shift from the familiar  to me  world of Anastasia to this  utopia  where rules have been determined for every aspect of life to eliminate conflict and suffering  The cost  however  is that without those  the people who live in the Community cannot experience love or joy  either  return I cant think of anyone who shouldnt read this book  its simple prose  engaging characters  and intriguing plot have the pages flying by from the first  and I was intensely sad to reach the end   The Giver  by Lois LowryLois Lowry is the fantastic author of the  Giver  quartet  The first book in this series is called  The Giver   and it has haunted many young adult readers for years The first book in the  Giver  series is  The Giver  itself  The book is about a 12 year old male named Jonas  When children in the  Community  turn twelve  they get an Assignment  and Jonas  Assignment was to be the new Receiver of Memory  The Receiver of Memory and the Giver are the only people who can see colors besides black  gray  and white  because in the Community  everyone converted to  Sameness   and that means no one can stand out or be unique and everyone has to fit in with another  As Jonas becomes more and more interested in being the new Receiver of Memory  he tries to learn every memory that the Giver has experienced  good or bad  and Jonas can t handle the training  so he runs away with a newchild named Gabriel that his father was nurturing  watching over    As Jonas tried to save Gabe from being released  he risks his own life  That s how much Jonas loves Gabe  even though he signed a contract saying that he wouldn t get too attached to Gabriel  It was hard for Jonas because the Community is highly secure and has beefed up security because a Four named Caleb got lost and fell into a river and died  and the Chief of Elders doesn t want that to happen to any other kids in the Community  So after Jonas and Gabe escaped  they rode around  looking closely at a world they have never seen before  After a while  it gets cold  and Jonas tries to go somewhere else  but Gabriel is frozen and he won t even move  so Jonas just stops pedaling his bike and holds Gabriel tightly to his chest  After a while  Gabriel heated up  and Jonas just stopped and held him  I personally like  The Giver  because it shows that Sameness can change people  Some people might think this book has a religious aspect  and I agree with them  but I think that this book shows true love for everyone in the Community because everyone is looking out for one another  The Giver  by Lois Lowry is a good book and helps people everywhere understand that love is a true thing  no matter what happens   Now here s something I did not expect   The Giver surprised me  in a very good way  I might add  I liked the book instantly  which is always a pleasure  It s short  which is kinda surprising  considering how many thoughts it provokes  A lot of things remain unexplained  which I don t much appreciate  but it makes you think about it all  and draw your own conclusions The story is original and gripping  Reading about the naive  happy  painless world is   weird  I can see how it might function  but also  the loss of   everything important to us is sad  To preserve humanity  we must abandon it I will admit I didn t get the ending  I m seriously confused about it  and I don t know what to think  However  the book itself made up for any and all confusion the ending caused  and I recommend it wholeheartedly  Update  Never mind  now I get it   no metaphor  no dying halucination   just straightworward stuff    Outstanding book  What a concept  this world of Sameness  No hills  no sunshine  no rain  no snow   No love  or other emotions we experience on a daily basis  A woman and man are paired together  they get each one boy and one girl   job assignments   Another big one is NO color  What happens if you should get  released   Lots of questions will be answered in this book  When you are a  twelve  you get your job assignments  Jonas is so excited  but at the ceremony he is passed over  At first he is embarrassed but then he gets the greatest honor of all  To be a  receiver   Jonas has no clue what that is about  but what it is is  the  receiver  gets all the memories  good and bad and keeps them so that if the community has a question  they can go to the receiver and see if their idea is a good or bad one  because they know everything about why they made the rules the way they are  because of pain  hurt etc I hope I can explain it half as good as the book does  LOVED this story  I won t say any more  but if you haven t read this book YET  order it RIGHT now  You won t want to put it down  I recommend this book to everyone  Even though I m from a communist country  I gotta say the society in the Giver sucks  There are absolutely no freedom everything is controlled  If I live in a place like that I d rather kill myself than to stay there  Well to have a good story there is a need for a big problem  and the problem in this story is this society  There are too much lies people trusting other too much  Jonas was one of them until his training with the Giver  The ending was negative every thing was sad  There are snow falls and search planes  over all it is just sad  I m looking forward to talk about it more with my classmates  It taught me that rights are so important  Once you realize something you lost that is important you will want it really badly  The government is too controlled  there are no way for a revolution  Sometimes rules are meant to be broken  I thought the country will be definitely be better if Janus is the leader  History is very important sometimes it s bad and sometimes it s good  memory is needed  History brings up war and moderation  Without it the race will never improve  If the controllers of the government thons only law ans killing would secure the society  they are wrong  Love could also used for peace  When there are love it s peaceful when there are hate or racism the world will turn to be a disaster  Love could cause trouble at times  But there are no such thing as peace for every  There are always era of war after era love  After the era of war comes era of peace   In the world of The Giver love  emotion  color and choice is thrown out and replaced with sameness  Within the community each civilian is giving their family  house  and possessions without the ability to choose who or what they want to be  Society only sees in black and white and is completely oblivious that the world is full of color and adventure There is one exception in the community  his name  The Giver  The Giver has the ability to make his own choices and also carries every memory of the past or  unknown   When Jonas is selected as The Giver he is introduced to a world he never knew existed  He experiences color  love  pain and the frustration of knowing that no one except for him will know what living is truly like  He is faced with the choice to live life in exile and allow the people to be oblivious or introduced them to the beautiful colors of the world   AWESOME  The Giver was a great read  and it was such a good plot and idea overall  I loved it  and wouldn t mind reading it again  The underlying messages were really very vital to our lives  and Lois Lowry explains the value of our feelings in such a stunning way   This novel really tore at my feels  Not always plausible  but  Beautiful  touching  sad  devastating  shocking  I could hardly put it down    The novel  the Giver  written by Luis Lowry  is a fiction novel centered around the idea of living in a perfect society  A young boy named Jonas resides in a futuristic society in which each citizen is assigned a job  a spouse  and children  Like the other residents in this society  Jonas is assigned a certain job and is also challenged with the release of a child  Jonas is not the same as the rest of the citizens in this society  He has unusual powers of perception  and can see color  while others cannot  This is when he begins to uncover and understand the dark secrets behind his fragile community  In this world  war  pain  fear  hatred  and lust are all eliminated  There is no prejudice because everyone looks the same  and is expected to act the same  Everything is thoroughly organized and planned so that life is as convenient  and easy as possible  Although this story is set in a place that is  a perfect society   it is only perfect for the residents there because they are subdued to the point where they do not even question the decisions that were taken for them  The only object in life in this society is to conform  and not stray from the path of obedience  There was much controversy over two scenes in the novel  One  in which a baby is killed by being injected by a needle  and another where Jonas imagines being intimate with a girl  These scenes have caused this book to be one of the most banned books in the United States and schools around the globe  I find it ridiculous that teachers believe that they must censor this material from kids who are already in high school  and are a few years away from entering the real world on their own  The banning of this book just leads me to believe that the world is moving closer and closer to aiming for this  perfect society    if i know this book is soo good i woudnt have left it waiting for me on the shelf for so long   i couldnt leave it once i started   Imagine a world with no sickness  war  or suffering  A world where people have no worries or cares  To many this may seem as a perfect world  But now  imagine a world where there are no choices  colors  feelings  emotions  pleasures  etc  Not so perfect anymore  For Jonas  the Giver s main character  this is the community he lives in Jonas  community strives for sameness  which means everything and everyone is the same and equal  Because of this the community assigns roles or jobs to children when they become twelve years old at the Ceremony of Twelve  As the ceremony progresses Jonas learns that he was not yet given a job  that is because the community saved the most important job for him  Jonas will receive special training from The Giver for his job  When Jonas becomes the Receiver of Memory  The Giver gives him memories of the past  memories of fear  sadness  sickness  war  pleasure  and love I cannot say much more about the book without spoiling it  While reading it you begin to wonder what it would be like to live in this community  with no fear  sadness  war  etc  However  you quickly learn of what a terrible life it would be to never know the feeling of love and happiness  to never see the beautiful colors of the flowers and the sky  and to never be able to chose your role in life  The Giver  which is my absolute favorite book  touches upon many thought provoking themes and topics that some may see as controversial  but I think that is what makes this book such a great read  I recommend this book to all  It is an interesting  easy read that will have you thinking long after you finish  a stunning dystopic novel for young readers   Yet another book that explores the dangers of regulating society  A true nanny state  except this society seems to have even eliminated beauty and love  5 stars because it is well written and the plot  while a common theme  maintains a unique perspective  And  I became attached to the character  I look forward to reading the remainder of the series  I really enjoyed this book  and I recommend it to all who love a great story with lots of exciting twists and turns  To those who have not read the Giver it is a story of adventure in the life of a boy named Jonas who lives in a utopian society where everyone is the same and people don t have emotions or feelings When Jonas learns of this after becoming the Receiver of Memory and experiencing memories of how the world was before the community went to Sameness  After receiving many happy and some painful memories from the Giver  the previous Receiver of Memory  Jonas and the Giver realize that things have to change  In a daring act Jonas attempts to change the way of of life that people were so used to in their community If you liked the Giver you will also enjoy Freak the Mighty by Rodman Phillbrick a great story of adventure with lots of excitement  Jonas lives in a world where there is order and purpose to everything  In his community  everyone and everything has a place and a function  Everything is structured for maximum efficiency  There is no war  no fear  no pain  no loss  There are no choices or real emotions  Not only so  but due to each person s skills and aptitude  they are assigned a job in the community  There are those who teach  who look after babies until they are given to a family  those who give birth to children  those who govern  labourers  technicians  caregivers  etc  On the day the children are assigned their jobs  Jonas is given a special job  He is to become the one who bears the memories of the community  The history  the pain  the pleasure    everything  Once he knows the truth  it changes everything Apparently this is a book that many people read in junior high  I had never heard of it until recently when I found it in my goodreads recommendations  It sounded interesting  so I decided to pick it up  I m really glad I did  Although it is a children teen book  it lends itself well to readers of any age  It is a dystopian sort of novel  but not in the same way as  say  The Hunger Games or Divergent  It s not an action novel  but more of a philosophical novel  provoking deep and interesting reflections on life  choice  and love  Original  well written  and well paced  I thoroughly enjoyed The Giver I highly recommend this novel   Outra releitura desse ano  E sim  mais um pela adaptacao  E TAMBEM porque eu comprei o box  Eu passei 5 anos sem saber que existiam mais livros e que era uma quadrilogia  e to dando 5 estrelas mesmo  O livro foca em Jonas  um garoto de 11 12 anos  que vive numa sociedade sem cor  onde tudo parece ideal e nao se existem perguntas sobre  o que aconteceu da nossa atual sociedade existir   Mas isso muda quando ele completa 12 anos e lhe e dado o papel de Receptor  eu acho que e assim  eu li em ingles entao nao sei se ficou assim  de Memorias e comeca a ser treinado para receber as memorias do Doador de Memorias  Ao receber essas memorias  ele vai descobrindo os crueis e obscuros segredos da sociedade em que vive  mas tambem de cores e de coisas que ja existiram e que ele nunca experimentou ou viu  Eu li esse livro la pelo ano de 2009  numa copia ja bem lida e batida da edicao americana  mas o amo desde entao  Apesar de nao ser um livro sci fi moderno e com diversos aspectos tecnologicos de hoje em dia  o livro consegue ser atual  mesmo sendo escrito no ano de 1993  Lois consegue nesse livro passar os segredos de uma sociedade onde as pessoas eram  manipuladas  e destinadas para uma determinada coisa  por exemplo nas  profissoes  em que cada um e dado um papel diferente num local diferente e nao e escolhido  mas sim designado devido as caracteristicas de cada um  A escrita e bela e o livro por si so deixou me em algumas partes querendo mais  e eu queria que o final fosse maior  Ainda assim foi satisfatorio ler novamente um livro excelente como esse   The Giver was excellent  It s set in a world with no animals  no hunger  no unemployment  and also no color  music or feelings  The Community is made up of family units  which are only allowed two children  applications must be put in for children   They have pills to suppress sexual urges  The old and very small children who cannot survive the  nurturing process   basically tests for physical and mental abilities  are  released   The protagonist   a twelve year old boy   is selected to be the Receiver of Memory  He receives all the memories of the world as we know it  the pleasure and the pain  and is supposed to bear it so that everyone else can lead an orderly  colorless  pain free life  It s got echoes of Atlas Shrugged all over it  The Receiver   Jonas   is like Dagny Taggart  and he eventually decides to shrug away his heavy burden  What is truly amazing about the book is the fact that the sentences are short  easy to read  and simple even  But the message they carry is powerful  I read almost all of the sentences more than once   out of amazement and disbelief  to allow myself to come to terms with their meaning  Can you imagine a world without music or color or any kind of art  A world in which the experience of sunshine was something to be treasured  Thought provoking and affecting  This is exactly the kind of book that I would want my child to read   at the right age  of course  Re readable  Brilliant   I read a book called the giver by Lois Lowry  I really enjoyed this book  I love books that have to do with a future world I was devastated by corruption of the government  Books like this always seem to grab my attention and they re always very easy for me to read  I always like reading these books and looking about how different their world is compared to ours  The book the giver is about a society free of crime and is in their eyes perfect  In the story A young boy named Jonas is picked to be the new memory keeper  this is the person who holds all the good and bad memories of the world before  I would rate this book 9 out of 10 stars  it was a very interesting story and grabs your attention and it s hard to put the book down  I would recommend this book to a friend especially one who s interested in books the speak of a twisted future  I can definitely see myself reading this again just because of the gripping story line and it is so easy to read  I will definitely be reading the rest of the series regarding this book  Another reason I like this book is the evolution of the characters throughout the story  An example of this is Jonas starts off the story of the normal member of the community but then ends up to find the communities laws in order to do what is write  This was a great book by Lois Lowery and I m excited to get my hands more of her work   I enjoyed  Futuristic novel about Jonas  who seems to live in a futuristic utopian community engineered to eliminate uncertainty  personal choice  Everyone seems very stepford ish  He was birthed by a community  birth mother  and then assigned to his parents when he turned one  as was his younger sister   When he turns 12  he and all of the others who share his birth year are given their professional assignments by the committee  When he learns he is the one and only one selected to receive the  communal memories  from The Giver  including memories from the time before the community turned utopian  he beings to learn how much they have collectively lost by eliminating individual choice  democracy  freedom  religion  etc  At the end  he manages to escape  along with a one year old boy named Gabriel  I look forward to the next three to see what happens next  I usually do not like this genre but I do find myself enjoying these  The Giver  basically  is about growing up  Whether we want to or not  We ll all get to that age where we are not children anymore  And that s how everyone in the community is  they re children  Even the adults  They know nothing  The community chose to live like this  a long time ago  They call it the Sameness  They rejected anything that could cause conflict within their people  They have peace  so for them it s idyllic  Though when Jonas is selected to become the Receiver of Memory things stay the same for quiet some time  Until Jonas discovers something that is too painful for him  The beginning was a bit slow for me but it picked up extremely well  Lois Lowry did a magnificent job of explain the terms  nothing was too or slightly confusing  I loved the way that I felt as if I was experiencing everything along with Jonas  Preco to tak skoncilo    ja sa nikdy nevyrovnam asi s tym koncom    Ale cele to bolo uzasne     This book is so much better the second time around  When I read it in Middle School  I was too young to understand the deeper meaning behind it  The dystopian society  the  community  the  sameness  the  ceremony of release   I don t know if I just wasn t mature enough yet to grasp the   horror of the idea of sameness or if I just didn t care but I enjoyed this book SO much more as an adult  Lowry really masters the subtle art of well  subtlety in this book  You don t think anything s too wrong until  I m not sure of the exact page number  but it doesn t hit you right off the bat that there s something odd about Jonas  world  I think for me  I really started to feel unnerved when Jonas saw that Gabriel s eyes were blue  like his  and only a few others in the community had light eyes like his  I mean  everyone having the same eye color  that s just weird  I remember  when I was younger  yes  I thought that was strange but it didn t have the eerie   Big Brother is watching you   conspiracy   MK Ultra  feel to it that it does now  Jonas and his relationship with the Giver is so much more poignant now as well  When the Giver gives Jonas the memory of Christmas and family and love  and Jonas basically says that he wished the idea of Grandparents still existed and that he wished the Giver was his Grandparent  I basically started to cry lol  This book is just so much deeper and more emotional and terrifying and heartfelt when you re older  At least it was for me  Needless to say  I cannot wait to read the next book   The Giver is one of my favorite books  It starts out with this boy Jonas who has come to age of being given a job  He ends up getting the job as being the next giver  When he meets with his mentor he is given many different images that people in his town have never seen before  His father works in the hospital and is told when to  release  people from their life  One of the little babies was going to be  released  but Jonas wanted to save him  Everytime the baby cried he would give the images that were in his mind to the baby  He ends up being found out that they have the baby  so Jonas takes the baby with him and climbs over the mountain to find a new town and snow  I loved this story growing up  I was never a very interested in reading and then when I got to middle school and was told to read this book I fell in love  The idea made for this story is something that drew me in  It was crazy to think that the people never had a choice in what they wanted to be when they grew up  Also the fact that they were never able to see color and know what that was never seemed like something anyone should go through  I really related to Jonas growing up  because I felt that I would have done the same thing if I had his job  I am the kind of person that is always asking questions  and if I was forced to think a certain way then I would always wonder why  This book would be a great story to read to preteens  and to have an actually discussion about the different parts in the story  I remember when I was told to read it we would have to write a paper on what job we would have liked to have been given  I would always pick the giver   The Giver has got to be one of my all time favorite books  I really love the writing in it  At the beginning of the book I felt like I had such a good idea of what was going on and what things looked like  and then when I found out that everything was supposed to be black and white  colorless and all the same I was amazed  I had to go back and reread some of the book to see if Lois Lowry had really left out those details  She had and I still had such a vivid image of everything  My mind filed in all of the rest  the colors and the differences in people  When I was in about 5th grade I wanted to read The Giver and my mom wouldn t let me  This is the first time she had ever really told me that I couldn t read a book which was weird to me  but reading it now I understand why she thinks this  The themes are a little mature for children  It does talk about the feelings that Jonas starts to have when he is going through puberty  and the medicine that he takes to turn those feelings off  Jonas also discovers that they kill the babies and the old people instead of them going to this nice place that he thinks they are going to  Overall I think that would be the biggest thing is the mature themes   I would have loved to have read this in Junior High or High School  I loved reading it now  The Giver is mentally and emotionally provocative on many levels  I went through it quickly  it s a short book  subliminal notes firing in my synapses  One last not so subliminal bang at the end  and the story was done  Good book  Then those semiconscious notes rose to the surface and I was blown away  So much to consider     As I was reading  some of those notes attempted quick trips to the surface but were pushed back to the depths by the need to know what happened next  To learn more see Maureen s great review and read the comments at http   www goodreads com review show     Before you click the link  be aware you ll find spoilers  Be sure to read or listen to the book first  Like I said it s short   What do you feel about living in a world where everything is under control  a community with no experiences of love and pain  a place where colors never exist  This is the world that Jonas lives in  a perfect society but has become imperfect because of its perfection  But when Jonas turns twelve  he alone was selected to become the next  Receiver of Memory   and to obtain special trainings from The Giver  He is an old man that holds the true memories of the past  As time tickles by  Jonas begins to challenge the community about ways of life   This was my first time reading the book  The Giver  by Lois Lowry  As I was reading it  I could not resist the complex emotions of anger and sympathy overwhelming me  A world with an absence of colors  love and music is so different from the society that we live in  In the story  when Jonas asked his father whether he loves him  the chuckling reply accompanied with the phrase   Precision of language  please   startled me  I couldn t comprehend how a person  especially a father  not understanding the word  love   Love is everything in life  It is the affectionate and care from our parents and them wanting the best for their children  Many times I began to question how someone like Jonas could accept this kind of lifestyle  a life where everyone is brainwashed and only follows a particular set of rules  I was extremely devastated when I realized that these people were missing many important parts of their life that makes them special as individuals  It is like a  sameness  community  however no one seems to realize the lack of freedom they have   However  I was bewildered about the ending  which I think it was too vague  But then I think that the author purposely left it for discussion so we could choose how to interpret what happened to Jonas and his little brother  Gabriel   Overall  I really liked the message of the story  I think it is very brilliant and creative so I highly recommend this book to all people so that they could get a whole insight of what is life without love  pain or anxiety    I have experienced the eagerness in reading I haven t experienced in a bunch of books I have read previously  The Giver is a genius book  Think of it  in order for a book to be interesting  we ought to write something that isn t in the existing world  like  for example  magic  or powers   But the concept of this book  is to lack what we enjoy and experience in our normal life  Which is to be   Feelings  It s vice versa  they made a concept not of what is not existing in this world  but of what the world will be without the important existence of feelings  Genius  Now  for this book not to end tragically  and still considerable great  is another thing  It doesn t end tragically  but it ended with new hope  the hope that makes you yearn for another book  And it does have another book  I just hope that the other book are just as interesting as this first one  Unlike some trilogies in which they seemed to have lose their essence or has become too boring in the middle  I know it had been a challenge  But with the wonder this book have currently given me  I am hoping it is not possible   Another thing  is that this book has proven that even without all the deep and complication of words  the story could still continue to be beautiful  By beautiful I mean  is that it have made itself clear and has given me a rollercoaster of feeling   anger  happiness with its simplicity  It s just amazing  Great book  I just reread this after having read it a few years ago in undergrad for a class  Quick read too  I guess partially because it s written for young adults Quick synopsis  Jonah  the main character  lives in a world of Sameness  Everyone is the same  eats the same  talks the same and dresses the same  Everything is regulated so that no one is different and feels bad because of their differences  When he becomes a Twelve  his age   everyone changes ages at the same time  on the same day  he gets assigned the job of The Receiver of Memories  This is a very prestigious job on the outside  but comes with much responsibility Lowry does a wonderful job making this an easy and enjoyable read  She also only introduces the reader to pieces and parts of the utopia little bits at a time  where  at first  the reader may think that this world Jonas lives in sounds like a great plan  no pain  no sorrow  However  as you read on and discover the other things they don t have in their world  weather  hills  mountains  you see that it s not as wonderful as you may have initially thought   UPDATE  Just re read the book again and still love it  I have a copy of The Son  which is the fourth in the series  but wanted to re read the first 3 again  This is a great book  and ultimately a great series  Wow    this was   AMAZING   Because I found this story simple  but incredibly powerful  I will put my view in simple words Heart wrenching story  A different way to look at the world and the things we feel    I have known about this book for years  because students often read it at the middle school  However  no one really said that I should read it until this year when one of my sophomores said I really should  It s not long and an easy read  but it is loaded with some really thought provoking ideas  It takes place in what some would consider a utopian society where everyone has a role to play and no one goes hungry or homeless  Everyone is uber polite so there are no arguments and therefore no wars  The main character  Jonas  is growing up in this atmosphere and he thinks things are as they should be     until he meets the Giver  Then his whole world is turned upside down   The Giver  is similar to  The Hunger Games  and  Divergent  in that the young protagonist questions the status quo as well as the adults in his life and willingly makes painful sacrifices for the greater good  One interesting concept Lowry introduces is that of  release   Some citizens are chosen to be  released   while others choose to be  released   Jonas s understanding of this concept proves to be a catalyst for his actions  I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys dystopian lit or to those who are curious about that genre but don t want to commit to a longer book or series   GreatI picked up this book because everyone at school was reading it  It s not my normal story line but I gave it a shot  It was really different and I fell in love with the characters Can t wait to read the next one   Jonas is the main character  and it s written from his perspective  This future world has eliminated pain  hunger  sadness  violence  etc  There is almost no difference in persons  therefore there are no prejudices  It is the perfect futuristic Utopian society because no one is an individual anymore  They have given up their identity  Essentially  the  society has eliminated choice   They live in a community in which  the giver  controls the memories of people  and Jonas  realizing the flawed society  seeks to escape and change Really good book  Things I learned  We discussed in class how this story was published before Utopian novels became real popular  and before so many films were released  I disagreed at first  keeping in mind the classics  1984  Brave New World  etc  But  these books differ in that they focused dramatically on communism and fascism  The Giver is unique in that it doesn t deal with those ideas directly  But  intelligently still deals with Utopian societies   but in a very unique way  I really enjoyed reading this book  Highly recommend  Content  has some action violence and peril  Includes some thematic material   Oh My God  what am I going to do now  That ending I was like bahhhh     hhhhh  I know there is a sequell but still  oh my  truly a fantastic book  I was marveled with the story and the meaning behind it  5   it is a MUST READ you guys  read it and you ll understand me xx The Giver by Lois Lowry is a great book  In this sci fi  Lowry explores a futuristic utopia dystopia that strictly enforces sameness amongst its citizens  When the societies thirteen year olds receive their occupations  Jonas  the protagonist of the story  gets a occupation that is like no other which sends him on a quest to find truth and rebel against authority for the greater good  The theme of this book is knowledge and truth  This book would be great to incorporate when discussing global awareness and different types of societies  The Giver is one of my all time favorites  Follow up with Gathering Blue  This is my favorite dystopian novel out there   Great books  like great music  seem to have a sort of inevitability about them  The notes of a Beethoven symphony  once heard  could have sounded no other way  The words of a great book sound like they are simply telling a story that was always there to be told in just this way  That was how The Giver felt to me    like a book that had always been there  just waiting to be written and then to be read The compelling part of this book  which I think separates it from many dystopias  is that the society in which Jonas grows up has a calm  warm appeal to it  One thinks    or at least I thought    well  this seems like a pretty nice place to live  really  Sure  there are rules  but they re all pretty reasonable  and I d enjoy living with these people  But as the story unfolds  you start to see the parts of the society that are hidden from plain view  and you start to understand what the community has given up in order to have this calm  contented world My only disappointment was with the ending   view spoiler  I get that Lowry didn t want to just tie up the package with a bow and a simplistic happy ending  But I m not keen on just how she told the ambiguous ending    hide spoiler   Maybe I will change my mind as I mull it over  though   Or maybe I will change my mind after I read the other books in the quartet   This is the book that introduced me into the marvel of reading at age 16  A very good written book  The story is amazing and unique  The cover may let you think it s old and boring but believe it s not  Many books now in days are not like this book  Now there is a movie of it hope they did not ruined it   Between seven hours of sleep  breaks for snacks and other such things  I have consumed this entire book in a single day  I cannot remember when a book like this last held my attention  At first glance  it seemed kinda boring  Continuing  however  I was wrong  There were very few things I disliked about the book  I don t understand how twelve year olds will begin training for jobs so early    and how everyone but Jonas and The Giver    saw in black and white  I thought the idea of Release for newchildren  the old   others like Rosemary  was oddly perverse  This book made me laugh    made me almost cry  Overall  I d give it a four  I didn t particularly like or dislike the ending  It seemed like any other ordinary ending   would have liked more details instead of the suspense    Were Jonas   Gabriel sent back to their community  Were they accepted into the new community  Would they both be able to see in colors now that they were both away from the  Sameness   Too many questions were left unanswered  I don t know if it was just me that felt unsatisfied  I loved this book  though    can t wait to see the movie    Book review  The GiverBen Haji Sheikh3rd hourJonas is in a futuristic city where everything is exactly the same  But there is only one person who knows about color  music  and other unique things  His name is the Giver  When Jonas turns twelve  he is assigned to a role in the city  He was number nineteen  During the ceremony  they skipped from eighteen to twenty  At the end of the ceremony  they came back to Jonas  He had been selected to be the receiver of memory  His trainer  the Giver  is the current receiver of memory  Now Jonas has to figure out how to keep these memories a secret  These memories include emotions and feelings that no one else knows  There are memories of happiness  adrenaline  and joy  but also pain  war  misery  and hunger  Gabriel  a newborn  won t sleep soundly  so Jonas has to give him memories that the Giver gave to him  But Jonas wants to know what exists outside the community  So Jonas  and Gabriel  embark on a dangerous journey that could cost them their lives  Lois Lowry does a fantastic job on writing the giver  This book is a realistic fiction book because it includes events that could happen  I recommend this book to anyone over the age of ten  This is a great story written by a great author  The Giver won newberry honors and I can see why  This book is one of the best books I ve ever read  Is it very much a children s book  It is  But as such it is magnificent  And yes  I know that the ending is made clear in the later novels in the series   but I guess I will  very much on purpose  not read them   Because I know how the young me would have interpreted the ending   I will definitly recommend this book  the Giver  to whom hasn t read it yet  The give takes plae in the place known as the utopia where they call it  It s very strange how the people who live in the Society has emptions For example  it s very odd how Jonas parents don t love each other   and yet they are still married    Another strange thing is about jona and his crush    Becuase he fell in love he had totake a pill    here s a question  why can t you fall in love  when children reach to the age where they can have a job    jonas gets a special job called the Giver  which has all th memory of pain  love peace  and everything feelings    Jonas slowly understands about the ghetto in the society and why the governmetns are doing these weird changing eye color things    Lasty  someting that really touced me through ot the book was probably the scene where Jonas feels the pain of WW1 or 2 i think also  i usually don t like endings where you don t know the ending for sure and yourself needs to figure it out    however I thought the clif hanging style actually was pretty good thani thought   anyways I don t uauslly like sci fic or mystery books but    this one was REAL good    so  Hope you read it and feel th esame way as i do LOVE THE BOOK 3 Books with a utopian or dystopian setting really interest me  Accordingly  I was sucked in and loved this book  I read it as required reading but it became more of reading for fun  In this book  there is no conflict  they have converted to sameness  When Jonas become the new Receiver of Memory he  along with the Giver  see the problems that have overcome their community and devise a plan to bring the community out of sameness  I love this book  It s mysterious  it s magical  and very  very engaging  It sucks you in the moment you start reading it  This book is great in an middle school level classroom  It invites critical analysis  would you get rid of all the bad in your life if it also meant giving up all the good  This book raises deep philosophical questions  I think a good activity for this book would be to accompany it with a class discussion on what is worth giving up for peace  Lowry  L   1993   The giver  New York  NY  Houghton Mifflin Harcourt  Twelve year old Jonas has been blessed with a gift he struggles to understand in a idyllic society  Others do not have this unique gift and it has lead him to question why he is different  At the Ceremony of Twelve though  Jonas comes to understand his role in society better when being told he will be working with The Giver  a very unique and rare position  However  Jonas lacks the understanding of how intense this role of society really is  The Giver helps Jonas to understand the detrimental society they currently live in and that changes must be made  but  Jonas is the only person who can bring their society to an understanding of this concept  This classic novel has always been a favorite of mine  Everyone can relate to the blindness Jonas feels in the story  however  Lois Lowry allows the reader to live through intense and critical circumstances Jonas must face  Lois Lowry does an amazing job of bringing this story to life and making me feel as if I am the one in it  I love to read stories like this because it allows me to live through an alternate life of intensity  adventure  struggle  that I otherwise would not be able to experience   and finding ones self  The Giver is definitely a book I believe everyone should read at least once in their life and I would recommend to anyone   Excelente distopia que nos cuenta de manera sencilla la historia de Jonas  un nino de 12 anos que se ha vuelto receptor de la memoria de su mundo y en donde al final de se da cuenta de lo diabolico que es el sistema social en el que vive  Escrita de manara sencilla este relato te mantiene en el filo del sillon  y sobre todo la frialdad con la que se cuenta horroriza al ver como a los ciudadanos se les han retirado los sentimientos para crear una sociedad mas organizada Lowry crea una dura critica a nuestra sociedad  una sociedad obsesionada con el bienestar y la salud  que no piensa en el ser humano como un ente lleno de sentimientos y contradicciones  En donde todo el mundo se esfuerza por ser igual  comer igual  sonreir igual y donde lo diferente  lo viejo o lo  defectuoso  se deshecha o se ignora  Una de los mejores libros para jovenes que he leido ultimamente y que supera por mucho a series como Divegente o a Los juegos del hambre por su estilo impecable y su delicioso uso del lenguaje  Cien por ciento recomendada  Found on the floor in my son s room and its been a long time since I read it  Quick read    only 180 pages   so very powerful  Despite some  controversial practices  in the book  you should check it out again          the worst part of holding the memories is not the pain  It s the loneliness of it  Memories need to be shared    It s quite an impressive fable  Though written simply  it is written quite well   even the sentence structures kept me engaged  The story presents some big ideas  but they re juggled with grace and curiosity  Does society function best if people are made to forget extreme emotions  both bad and good  Or are the extremes part of what makes life so brilliant  There is no definitive answer provided  The ambiguity  particularly at the conclusion  serves the contemplative process well   maybe it s a question without an answer  For such a compact story  The Giver really packs a punch    Reviewed by my sister   Jonas lives in the  Community   a supposedly utopian world where everything is flawless  There are no good or bad  there is no hunger  no war  and no pain   a perfect world to live in  Jonas lived 12 years of his life without questioning the system and accepting things as they were  But when he is selected as the  Receiver of Memories  he starts to discover secrets which lie beneath the perfect exterior of his world which he rather would not have known  As he receives more and more memories his wish to explore the world beyond his Community increases  A compelling tale showing the courage needed to go against a set system to bring a change   The characters are perfectly described and none of the characters are bland  Most of the characters are accepting of the system of the  Community  and do not want to change it or are rather scared to go against the system  The main character of the book Jonas on the other hand is unsatisfied with the way things are and wants to see it change  Sometime before he becomes twelve he notices certain changes in his surroundings which he can t explain  When he becomes the Receiver of Memories he starts to understand the change he had experienced  change he which had made him feel free and not bound by rules  His longing to explore the world beyond grows stronger with each new memory he gets even though he knows it s illegal  My favourite character from the book would be the Giver who gives the memories to Jonas  Sad and melancholy in nature  he is the only one who understands Jonas  longing for freedom and even decides to help him escape   The book is a complete page turner and raises issues which force the readers to ponder upon  What if the world was perfect  a world where everything was same and without any conflict  Would we still long for the imperfect world  For the people living in Jonas  world the world they live would be a utopia but for the reader it is a dystopia where all things are controlled by one person  a world where there is no freedom of thought and talk of change is not endured  The people controlling Jonas  world to be perfect even the families are made so that they are perfect  People are made to think what the rules say are right  Even their profession is chosen by other people  This book shows us the imperfect world hidden behind the fake exterior of a perfect world  I recommend this book to all young adults  A book which would compel you to ponder upon the concept of the perfect world which we all wish for  If you liked this book you would also like The Seventh Tide by Joan Lennon and The Time Machine by H G Wells both of which deal with the same concept of utopia and dystopia   A memorable and thought provoking book which cannot be easily forgotten  A compelling read   Der zwolfjahrige Jonas lebt in einer perfekten Welt  Einer Welt ohne Kriege  ohne Armut  ohne Hunger ohne Angst  In seinem zwolften Lebensjahr bekommt jedes Kind seinen zukunftigen Beruf zugewiesen  Jonas hingegen nicht  Er wird erwahlt  Es soll der nachste Huter der Erinnerungen werden  Was das bedeutet wird Jonas erst nach und nach klar  Er lernt die Welt um ihn herum zu sehen  und zu verstehen  Und er erkennt und begreift und distanziert sich somit fur immer von seinen Mitmenschen  die nicht verstehen  nicht begreifen und obwohl erwachsen  doch immer noch unwissende Kinder geblieben sind Jonas Leben ist perfekt  wie das Leben aller Menschen um ihn herum  Wie kann es jemandem in einer Gemeinschaft nicht gefallen  die bis ins letzte durchorganisiert ist und in der alle Entscheidungen sorgfaltig abgewogen werden  Eine Gesellschaft  die auf Logik basiert  in der man immer weiss wohin man gehort und was von einem erwartet wird Als Jonas seine Stelle als neuer Huter der Erinnerungen antritt beginnt er langsam zu begreifen  Wenn alles gleich ist  dann man keine Wahl  Er mochte entscheiden konnen  Er will kein Leben mehr ohne Uberraschungen  in dem nichts Ausserplanmassiges passiert  nichts Ungewohnliches  Ein leben ohne Farben  ohne Schmerzen  ohne Vergangenheit und ohne Emotionen  Aber je freier er wird  je mehr er wahlen kann  umso mehr erkennt er  wie er sich dadurch von seinen Mitmenschen entfremdet  Er nimmt die Last auf sich  sich fur sie zu erinnern  was es heisst Mensch zu sein  Er muss erkennen  dass sie es einfach nicht besser wissen  und dass er es nicht andern kann  Vor die Wahl gestellt trifft er eine Entscheidung und muss erkennen welche Vorteile dieses sichere Organisierte Leben doch hat Eine poetische Geschichte  die 1993 den Jugendliteraturpreis gewann  Wo heutige Dystrophien laut  direkt und mit vorhersehbaren  platten Liebesgeschichten verwassert sind  ist diese Geschichte leise  poetisch und indirekt  Hier wird nicht geurteilt  Jonas kann sich entscheiden  Er erkennt beide Seiten  die Vor  und Nachteile dieser Gesellschaft  Er erkennt aber auch  dass Wissen einen Menschen verandert  dass Emotionen machtiger sind als Logik und das auch Wahrheit Luge sein kann und welche Macht Erinnerungen haben   I can honestly say I remember the entire unit my 8th grade English teacher taught when we read The Giver by Lois Lowry  I remember sitting in class reading this text aloud feeling as though I was actually having fun in school  If a book wasn t Harry Potter I probably was disinterested  but The Giver was awesome  The concept of a utopian society was entirely new to me and I was fascinated by the lifestyle of Jonah and his family   I believe that my ability to reflect on my middle school English class is not because I have an amazing memory  it is because I had a great teacher and I read great books  I truly believe that my experience with The Giver inspired me to teach English  I didn t really read anything  except Harry Potter  unless I had to  However  I read The Giver twice  and once as an Adult  I am able to conclude that The Giver is still and amazing text on its own  but I would have never been able to appreciate its content without the guidance of my 8th grade English teacher  The Giver by Lois Lowry is fun and engaging novel that I would love to teach it in my future classroom  The concept and creativity behind the themes presented in the text continue to engage my attention  I found I was able to interact with the text on a personal level while still evaluating its literary elements  I think that this text could be taught through a multitude of literary lenses and inspire all kinds of unique projects and discussions  Students will have all kinds of opinions on the actions of different characters to which they will have to reference the text to argue  The Giver is a perfect middle school text and I recommend it without reservation   I think I ve just my new favorite book   I liked this book very much because it talks about a whole different society and how they live  Its interesting to read because its something so different from how we live and its something we can t really imagine to live in  Like not being able to see colors  know what your feeling or have memories  Like of snow  rain  Sleds or music because they have never experienced any of those things or know what they are  They basically live in a word thats plain and sameness  I read this book when i was younger and i read it again recently and it still has me fascinated  This book was absolutely breathtaking  This book has ranked my top 10  Recommend to friends  list  Lois Lowry successfully creates a almost Utopian world  At first  I wasn t particularly interested  but a friend forced me to read it  saying  Don t judge a book by its cover  You may be surprised  Now I m going to tell you that you re going to love this book  Read it   This is a really thought provoking book   I plan to see the movie  but not sure how they will portray the author s various scenes  I did not know this is a series  so plan to read the other four  One quote was rather scary to me as a librarian and avid reader   The books in his own dwelling  dictionary  Book of Rules  and community volume with described every office  factory  building and committee  were the only books Jonas had ever seen  He had never known that other books existed   This is a very popular read currently  as I had three people stop while I was reading in a restaurant and offer their opinions   I just saw this movie  last week  on Monday  And I had to get the book  I read 50 pages before I saw the movie and loved it  And I just finished it  Amazing  I think this is my new favorite book of all time  So  Freaking great  I can t even  Amazing    A long time ago  the people in Jonas  community chose to have the community ruled by a Committee of Elders  The Committee of Elders controls everyone and everything  They even take away emotions and colors  afraid they will give their world too much knowledge of good and evil  In order to keep the people from choosing wrong they completely take away any choices  Jonas is selected to be the next Giver and earns of the oppression the Elders have put on them  He then challenges the system  trying to make it so they will not take away anyone s divine right of knowledge  I have read this book a few times and I always gain new insight and feelings towards it each time  It is a great book to teach many different lessons to students  This was one of my first early  favorite books  I was lucky to have a teacher who assigned it in middle school when I was 12  I would encourage anyone with young readers to assign or share this book  to go through it  break it down  It raises some important and powerful questions  even after all these years of being published  It s somewhat short  it keeps things concise  it moves at a decent pace with serious build up starting about mid way  It s not a difficult read but because of the content of the book may be better for readers who are a little older then 9 or 10  I still read this book after over ten years having been assigned it and it still manages to break my heart   A very powerful  beautiful message In a futuristic apparent utopia where everyone is fed and clothed and told how to live  a young boy named Jonas is selected to become the new Receiver of Memories  This job entails bearing the memories of war  hunger  colors  animals  pain  love  grandparents  and choice  Some of the memories are painful  but some are a delight  and together  Jonas and the old Giver of memories decide to bring the memories back to the people This is a remarkable book  and deservedly won the Newbery  I was amazed at the Orwellian language   comfort object  for a child s toy   male  and  female  used exclusively  and so on  In the mouths of children  especially  it had an ominous ring  The book certainly doesn t pull any emotional punches  we see Jonas  father euthanizing a baby that is underweight  and we know the deep evil of this orderly society  But it leaves a lot for the reader to wonder about  as well  What becomes of Jonas  Can the community handle the stress of the memory of freedom and pain  Are Jonas and the Giver right to make that decision for the community  It s a weird  wonderful  ambiguous book  certainly one of the deepest  children s  books I ve read  J G  Keely  https   www goodreads com user show 8     wrote a long rambling review here on this book and rated it 1 star  He opens his arguments stating that  Lowry s book is a piece of nationalist propaganda   Nowhere in his long rambling review does Mr  Keely justify how it is nationalistic nor what propaganda Lowry is trying to push  If one looks at Mr  Keely s bio here  one gleans a clue about his own agenda  He says   I am a critic  which is to say I am in possession of a poetic licence to kill   I think Mr  Keely is more interested in killing via review than in honest appraisal  Further  in Mr  Keely s description of his own rating system  he states that his criteria for rating a book with 1 star are  awkward  badly punctuated  words used incorrectly  cliche  redundant  There are quite simply no badly punctuated nor incorrectly used words in this book  and no where in Keely s long review does he state that the book is awkward  cliche  nor redundant Keely states that Lowry  makes the character act and think like we do  despite never adequately explaining how he came up with such unusual notions   I say that when Lowry makes her character rebel against unjustified state executions held in secret from the constituency  Lowry is not trying to make any statement about our own society  but rather making a good story  And she succeeds very well  in my opinion  I would also like to use Keely s own rating system against his own review  Keely states in the review   Lowry s book ends with the standard nonspecific transgressive spiritual event that marks all monomyths   That by far is one of the most awkward sentences I have ever read  even bordering on nonsensical Rather than a misplaced diatribe about inferred social messages  as Keely has degraded himself by doing   I would rather judge the book by more accepted means of judging fiction  By doing this  I remind Keely that this is fiction  not a philosophical treatise Lowry s characterization is fairly good  although the novel is too short to give many main characters more than a one dimensional appearance  for example the father   The action is captivating  and the enigmatic actions surrounding the main source of tension  vague to avoid spoilers  is captivating and shocking when revealed  I loved this book  and I m excited to have started the sequel One final dig at Mr  Kelly  He states   Lowry s world is not based in reality   No S     Sherlock  It s fiction  and really good fiction in my opinion  I m happy to give it 5 stars  I absolutely fell in love with this book from the first page  Lois Lowry has sun vivid descriptions and such a beautifully intricate plot that I couldn t put it down  I would recommend this book to anyone or anything with a brain  Everyone except jocks would enjoy this book  Throughout the plot there are many sub plots  each one with their own meaning  But the main ideology behind the plot was that  the world we live in is grey  We all wake up  we all go to bed  But sometimes we need someone to say enough is enough and give back what others have taken from us  You be the light to the world that no one else will be  The POV is from an 11 year old boy named Jonas who delivers vivid detail of his routines and adds a sense of wonderment to the storyline  Summary Annotation  The giver is a great book that is placed in a setting which is a very controlled community  In this society everyone is assigned roles which they have to do for the rest of their adult life  The main character is Jonas  It is his turn to be given a role and he goes through with the Ceremony of Twelve since he is matured and turning 12 years old  Jonas is chosen to become a receiver in the society for which he is given painful training  He becomes isolated from family and friends  He will replace the person who is currently doing the role of the receiver so he gets training from him  The present receiver will then become the giver Through his training he first receives wonderful positive memories and then receives horrible memories  The memories come from the past of the community which is taken away from the people  Response  I really enjoyed reading this book  I thought it was very different and very interesting  As I was reading I kept wondering what was going to happen next  I was also wondering why is this happening in this story  This book made me imagine how I would feel if I was a part of a society like that  There are definitely some good and bad things about a controlled society  In a society like this chaos is less likely to happen and yet there is no freedom to express yourself  People also cannot go against the rules  This reminded me of a dictatorship society in some ways because people have no say there as well I awarded this book five stars because I really enjoyed this book  I would love to share this book with everyone because it is a different story that is very well written Classroom Connections  I think this book would be perfect to use in a genre study for science fiction  Students would also be able to relate to Jonas s situation because at age 12 he becomes an adult and has gotten a role which would be his responsibility  Students might feel this way in situations at home when parents give them chores to do and ask them to behave like adults  Through teachingbooks net I found a great link to lesson plans that can be incorporated with this book http   www leasttern com The 20Giver     which include vocabulary  having students write about their own future and thinking about what your role is in your own community  I think this link provides wonderful lesson plans to help students understand the content Text Complexity According to lexile com the measure for this book is 760L and I believe this is an appropriate book to read aloud to students in 3rd grade  By 6th grade students would be able to read this book independently  Depending on the grade level assignments should be adjusted  The book The Giver by Lois Lowry is the story of Jonas  a 12 year old boy who lives in a futuristic community  People there are satisfied with life and the fact that everything is problem free  Because of this  no one thinks to question the rules  Therefore  the community that Jonas lives in is a utopia  as long as you take the perspective of an ignorant citizen   One reason Jonas  community is a utopia is because there are no problems like unemployment  divorce  war  or discrimination  We know from the story that there are rules that are strictly enforced about every aspect of a citizen s life  including rudeness  Because of the rule about rudeness  conversation in the community is quite limited  This is shown in the story when Jonas was thinking about Benjamin and his achievements   There was never any comfortable way to mention or discuss one s successes without breaking the rule about bragging  even if one didn t mean to    minor rule  rather like rudeness    Lowry 34   There are many more carefully thought out rules to ensure that there is no homelessness  no mistakes in marriage  no jealousy  etc  These carefully laid out rules make it so that there are practically no chances of any problems occurring in the community because no one ever thinks to question any rules  Everyone just follows the rules all the time  You may have realized that I said   practically no chance     in the previous paragraph  This hints that there might be problems  However  the community has a way to eradicate any problems that pop up  If there is a problematic person  they ultimately get released  if there is a rule that needs to be added  it goes to the Elders for approval  The process is shown when Jonas and the Giver are having a conversation  Jonas starts by saying   But it s against the rules  The Receiver in training can t apply for rel    Lowry 179   The Giver interrupts to clarify   It s in your rules  Jonas  But it wasn t in hers   When the Giver says that it wasn t in the previous failed Receiver s rules  it shows that the Elders have an effective way to establish new rules  If the Elders can establish new rules  then that means that the government structure was created in a smart way to retain control over the citizens  Some people think that releasing a new child just because they are unhealthy or have an identical twin makes Jonas  community dystopica  An unhealthy new child deserves extra time  money  and care to aid that child  Identical twins should be accepted into the community because they offer some spice to boring everyday life  On the other hand  an identical twin or an underweight child is against the community s rules because they are viewed as imperfect  Anything against the rule makes a problem  and problems in Jonas  community are solved with release  Our society  however  never kills any identical or unhealthy babies because we do not view these as problems Now  if the community still isn t a convincing utopia  look at the effectiveness of job assignments and spouse matching  The community has a process to assign everyone the perfect job according to where one spends their community service hours  which subject one is most interested in  and one s usual disposition  You can see this when Jonas  Father says   I spent almost all of my volunteer hours helping in the Nurturing Center  Of course the Elders knew that  from their observation    my assignment was announced as Nurturer    Lowry 19   As you can see from Jonas  Father  the Elders take various factors into consideration when assigning jobs  This ensures the right job assignment or spouse assignment  which gets rid of divorce  getting fired from a job  or quitting a job   In studying why Jonas  community is a utopia  we can learn that we may be better off in our world  While utopia may look attractive on the surface  Jonas  community shows us that maintaining one requires sacrificing deep emotions  like love  for that opportunity  Our society values our deep emotions  ability to question rules  and independent thought more than living in a world without problems   It only took me a few hours to finish this book since I couldn t put it down once I started and was written I very simplistic language  I m so glad that I read this book because you definitely will see the resemblance here between this book  Divergent  and Delirium  since it s actually THE book that inspired Divergent The society seems perfect  people are numb  their world is in black and white  they live in friendly lies  they have no pain  hardly emotions  no memories  no family related by blood  and even no weather  I am simply amazed by how this community works  even though I have read divergent and delirium before reading this  This is more than a book for twelve year olds as it was labeled  It s also an unique and original dystopian utopian piece for people with maturity  It made me cry a few times  for the loss of Rosemary  for not knowing about love and Christmas  I would not imagine myself living like that  I highly recommend this book to any age group  The Giver In the novel The Giver the main character Jonas live in a dystopian society where everyone s role is chosen by a select few  Jonas is selected to be the giver  Not much is known about what the giver does to the public  Jonas meets the giver and it is revealed that the giver s job is to keep the memories of the community from a long time ago  Jonas begins to learn how hard and important it is to be the giver  Jonas is upset that they oppress the community of their feelings and even color  Jonas begins to find the society unlivable in  He beings to devise and plan to leave the society  as he finds that he can no longer live the oppressed people  The plan to leave is risky  he even faces death if caught  However  with the help of the giver he able to escape the society  After this  jonas s vision fades to white  I just watched the movie for the first time    Oh my goodness  it was incredible  Many people were discouraged because it didn t follow the less than 200 page book exactly  However  I loved it  The extended ending and including Fiona more in the plot was perfect  It fleshed out the story more  One of the reasons why The Giver isn t as well loved as I think it should is because it ends unfinished  The movie gave it more closure  What I personally love the most about The Giver is the fact that it paved the road for all future dystopia novels and movies  most especially The Hunger Games  It beautifully paints the image of a world without pain  a utopia where your lives are perfect and no one goes hungry or feels anger  envy  violence  But this pure joy and simplicity comes with a price  you don t know love  You don t  really  know happiness  The saying goes   You can t taste the sweet unless you ve known the bitter   This quote comes into play with The Giver  Suddenly  what you thought is a blissfully perfect world is not  Your loves  forever controlled  You will never know climate  or color  It s fascinating  but also upsetting  It also makes you open your eyes and truly appreciate our world  This is a must read   Way better than the Hunger Games  Long live Jonas  Lois Lowry composed a moving  eye opening novel that emphasizes the fact that perfection is never pure and there is always darkness and corruption  Ignorance isn t Utopian  Knowledge is Power  as well as Pain  Jonas is a naiive boy but is given the memories of pain and pleasures of the past  and is disgusted by them as well as intoxicated  I highly recommend this book  it s one of my favorites  I personally loved the Giver  I thought it was written so beautifully and I just enjoyed reading it  I know not everyone completely enjoyed the book  and that s alright  I m just one of those people who thought that Lois Lowry s writing in this book is so beautiful and I enjoyed the adventure  Her writing is great in a sense that I could imagine myself being in that situation and I think being able to imagine yourself in a situation is one of the best feelings you could have in a book  The book drew me in  I loved it   I was not expecting to like The Giver  because it was one of those books you had to read for English  and I have always hated the books you had to read  However  my friend said it was amazing  and he is a very good book critic  so I took his word for it  and I read it  It took me maybe one day  not because it was so short  but because I could not put it down  Every part of the book was amazing  no matter what was going on  and I just loved every single page of it The book is about a kid named Jonas  who lives in a dystopion future  where there is nothing that could cause pain  No emotions  no diversity  everyone acts the same  and does what they are told  The elders decide your future  and you basically have no say over what goes on in your life  When Jonas is assigned the position of the receiver of memories  he learns the fallacies of his society  and his whole life is changed forever  I would recommend this book to anyone capable of reading  It is not too long  and it is just amazing  I hope everyone has a chance to read this masterpiece  This book will change your perception of life  and make you really think about the future  I listened to this when I was in 7th grade and was enthralled Re read it in 2009 Excellent writing Captivating and stimulating  Read this in three days with my 10 year old son  Neither of us could put it down  Fantastic opportunities to talk with him about some deep and difficult ideas   Jonas lives in a perfect world where illness  war  and suffering have all been eliminated  Everything is in order  under control  and there is no need to worry  The Community has taken care of everything and converted society to  sameness   making everyone and everything equal  To keep the Community functioning properly  everyone is designated a specific community job when they are twelve years old  When Jonas turns twelve  he is chosen to be the next  Receiver of Memories   All of the memories of the past will be given to him  and he will find that there is much more to life than he thought I loved this book  I found it moving  engaging  eerie  thought provoking  and disturbing  Very well written and a must read dystopia   It s the choosing that s important  isn t it      Lois Lowry  The Giver Eleven year old Jonas lives in a community where all decisions are made for you  your career  your spouse  and even your children  Everything is meticulously ordered  the choices so carefully made  Once you begin to have wants and desires  you re required to take a pill to suppress them  There are no deep feelings  no real sense of right and wrong  and love is meaningless and useless  The Elders control everything and keep everyone happy  healthy  and ignorant  as they are themselves ignorant and must look to The Giver  the person who knows all  for wisdom When Jonas reaches the age of twelve  he s assigned a career based on what he did as a volunteer  Instead of being excited  Jonas is apprehensive about the upcoming ceremony  with good reason  He s selected as The Receiver  a very honorable position  and he must meet with The Giver every day after school to receive the memories of pain  war  destruction  happiness  and love  the memories of man from way back The more Jonas learns  the more outraged he becomes  He wants to make his own choices  and he believes everyone should be able to choose what color of tunic they d like to wear each day  but The Giver quickly tells him there are more complicated choices  and it s safer to protect people from making wrong choices when they re at the age when choices become important Jonas learns that  yes  there is the pain of hunger  death  war  and cruelty  but there s also the happiness of birthday parties  holidays  spring rains  blue skies and sailing  horseback riding  and hugs and laughter  He learns that everyone should be able to experience making choices Even though this novel was written for teens  I truly enjoyed it from beginning to end  Several conflicting emotions surged through me as I read The Giver  at first it was anger that anyone could conceive of such a place  but mostly I was confused because I couldn t decide if the community Jonas lived in was truly a good thing  Part of me thought it was  People do tend to make stupid choices and mess up not only their own lives but also the lives of those around them  But the emotional side of me kept screaming  It s wrong  All wrong  Because I had the gift of wisdom  the knowledge of right and wrong  and an array of emotions  I couldn t agree with such a community  In the end I had to agree with Jonas and The Giver  No one should have the freedom of choice taken from them At the end of the book  you  the reader  are left to determine what fate you think Jonas saw  Yours will probably be different from mine  depending on your optimism  I like to think   well  I wouldn t want to influence your thinking  Everyone should read The Giver  It s a powerful  thought provoking story Review first published at  NightsandWeekends com Amazing book  Really impressed  super hyped for the film  The main character Jonas lives in a very enclosed society that has some harsh rules  Jonas starts questioning some of the thing that go on in the community  like what happens to someone when they a released  Compared to my neighborhood this community is extremely strict and whats every to be in order and have no diversity  In my neighborhood I can do what ever I want I can sleep in make my own food even though I m a kid  I wont give away the ending  but it might gives you some hints on what happens  I feel that the beginning of the end was really negative because I couldn t weather he would make it or not  but once he saw it and the book ended I felt a surge of positive feelings travel through me wanted to think maybe something good happened  This novel teaches me that when you keep people all the same and have no diversity among them a rebel is bound to break the rules or just question weather this is right like jonas did Same thing with government if you keep people confined and not give them and freedom they re going to rebel   Imagine a world that is efficient  safe and painless  Sounds pretty good  doesn t it  No one is rude  crime is not a problem  no one ever goes hungry  Every member of the community contributes in a helpful  organized manner  and life glides along as easily as sled runners on a snowy hill  Except there are no hills  They re too impractical for shipping  And there is no snow  Climate control has eliminated such food production problems  Sameness  in human and object  is the rule  because sameness most benefits the community Still sound good  This is the world Jonas lives in  It s all he s known since his days as a Newchild  when he was given to his parents to begin their family unit  A few years later  when he was a Four  his little sister completed their family  one girl and one boy  as stated in the rules  Each year marked some new development in his training  but now  as an almost Twelve  after years of being observed and monitored by the Elders  he s anxious to receive his occupational Assignment that will determine the rest of his life The Assignment changes everything As the new Receiver of Memories  it will be Jonas s burden to hold the memories of the entire world so others in the community need not suffer them  Because the memories of ages past hold pain  The pain of grief and loss  of hunger and war  Overwhelming memories long forgotten  But along with the pain comes images of color  music  and love  and Jonas begins to realize what his people have given up for the sake of comfort This is a powerful  powerful book  Not one that leaves a reader with warm fuzzies  but truly unique and profound  Does pleasure balance pain  Can there be one without the other  How much freedom should be given up to ensure safety  Should the institution of family be restructured  Should birth limits be enforced  Should we be sheltered from death  Should death be taken on as a responsibility to ensure the greater good  Just how far should a society go when working toward that goal This Newbery winner explores these questions in a very emotional way  Content is appropriately handled  but it can be blunt and shocking  Points are illustrated with some disturbing images including war  poaching  and of the murder of a baby  Like the other books in the trilogy  this one is written at about a fourth grade reading level  but I would recommend middle school as the minimal age to consider such deep social themes  This one  in fact  is the most disturbing of the three  but it is invaluable as a tool for promoting the discussion of a whole host of issues kids will face as they mature into adulthood Highly  highly recommended for readers 12   rereading one of the original YA dystopian novels was a really good idea  recommend this to your teens  they need to be reminded that acts of defiance need not be bloody and the monsters of our fictional futures are sometimes nothing more than good intentions  This is a re read for me  I ve read this one a few time and love it   Longer Review Coming Shortly   Imagine a world where you are living and you just don t know anything about the real deal  You don t know how to feel and you are just living  What would be your purpose if you are living without feeling what you are doing  This is exactly what the society of this book is like In this book the main character Jonas gets assigned a role as being the memory keeper for this society  He learns everything about the past of this society and felt what he know is called  emotions  Sad and happy he can control it and know what the society was like  The story main point is basically that the giver gives him the memory and he wants to share it with his society  Too bad it s illegal to or else he will be released which is death basically This story was really good to me because it made me wonder how can a author even think of a situation like this  It was very interesting to read what will happen when someone commits a crime  It was also interesting because I thought about our society and thought how good it was to be living in our world  We can feel emotions  learn a lot and etc  This book was one of those book where you have to read on till it starts getting really suspenseful  This book I would give a 5 5 to  At first i didn t want to read the book  When I started to read it  it was really boring  but the more i read the more interesting its was and i started to like it  Then i watched the movie and it seemed really weird because  it wasn t like the book  I honestly enjoyed the book more than the movie  The movie confused me more than the book did  But i did love the book  It was the best of the books i read last year  I think The Giver was a excellent book because it was exciting  terrifying  and entertaining  I will say that the book does start of kind of boring but it is an amazing book This book was entertaining because it was weird to see that years from now we might be living like this  I mean we might have all our birthdays on the same day or have our meals and activities planned down to the minute  It is also funny watching them publicly apoligize whenever they do something  wrong   I put wrong in outation marks because their wrong is what we usually do in our every day lives It is also entertaining when they have to volunteer at such a young age and do adult jobs  For example  Jonas is an eleven and on one day during his volunteer hours he is bathing old people  He is doing an adult job but their society thinks that their way is the right way do do things  It is also interesting to see how they deal with babies that do not grow right  extra babies  old people  or people that break the rules  It is very interesting the way that Jonas changes from the beginning of the book to the end of the book  This was an amazing book   You will be faced  now  with pain of a magnitude that none of us here can comprehend because it is beyond our experience  The Receiver himself was not able to describe it  only to remind us that you would be faced with it  that you would need immense courage   In the book  The Giver  By Lois Lowry  Jonas lives in a perfect community where everything is perfectly controlled  weather  pain  feelings  no color  no love  memories  and ones own way of thinking a place where sameness rules  At the age of twelve every single member in this perfect society has a role to play which they are assigned in a ceremony when they all turn 12 from birth mothers to engineers everyone gets assigned a job by the committee of elders  Lois s  The Giver  compelled me with its amazing 1st person story with a unique style   The Giver is a unique book  tells a story of a boy in a perfect community where its ruled by sameness all around  The giver taught me that not everyone fits in a community and that s perfectly normal because you aren t the same as everyone else  you re better  I love the authors writing style mostly because she describes everything so perfectly and how she even came up with this exquisite scenario of a perfect community how she describes every families home stead with no sense of love emptiness  how she puts her self in the characters shoes telling us a story from the characters perspective is something I really enjoyed reading she makes a connection with you through her style of writing that you makes you feel you are living it  When she describes her friends Fiona for example  the author describes Fiona the exact same way a 12 year old describes a girl he likes or is crushing on describes her as a sensitive  quiet polite  nice girl who spends most of her time volunteering taking care of the elderly  The setting in the book  The Giver  is a very dull place very simplistic i would say  What do you think about living in a community  where there is no color  where you have no choices  where everything is the same  where you can t choose your own destiny your own fate   horrible isn t it  Not being able to feel any emotion any pain  any love  Lois does an excellent job of describing the awful community Jonas lives in  Lois describes the scenario to a certain point if you close your eyes you can imagine everything the houses  the people  your environment  you can imagine how sad of a life it is  The author describes a scene where Jonas and Fiona are showering the elderly and they aren t a bit embarrassed or shy about it  they don t see it the way we all see it  As the book progresses Jonas finds himself in the ceremony of twelve where he will be assigned his role in the community surprisingly he isn t called they skipped him to the very end where they announced him to be the next receiver of memory  Receiver of memory is a very honorable role in the community its rare to have that role  As Jonas attend his training with the current receiver of memory  The old receiver shows him the past and how the world was  shares memories with him shows him pain  fear  color  and how everything is a lie in the community knowing everything isn t okay he decides to run away    will he comeback   I really recommend this book its a one of a kind book  I really enjoyed reading this book because it showed be a different way to see the world how fortunate we really are to live the way we live  with that freedom  To feel and enjoy different memories   Una vez en algun momento loco de mi vida pense que tal vez una sociedad parametrada y con los roles firmes seria perfecto  pero luego conoci este libro y todo cambio  Pensar que solo conoces lo que  ellos  dicen que debes saber  que te elijan todo desde tu pareja hasta tus hijos incluido tu profesion perfecta  Al principio de leer el libro crees waoo que mundo ideal pero   no  que de ideal puede ser no tener sentimientos o tal vez los tengan pero no saber como sacarlos a relucir porque simplemente nunca te ensenaron  Pensar que si ya no  sirves para nada  tu unica solucion es la liberacion  muerte   My 10 year old son came home from school and told me that I had to read this book  My children so far aren t really readers so I would have read just about anything he recommended to me just so I could discuss it with him  I loved it  The message was clear  the writing was elegant and although the book was very short the character development was wonderful  It was probably a good book for me to read entering into winter  I may be a little less resentful of the snow and discomfort that the cold brings  I like his teacher a little bit more for reading it to his class  The winner the 1994 Newbery Medal  this science fiction book is filled strict rules that is a world with no color  no memories  and no control  I feel this book makes the readers imagine a world filled with no choice and the sacrifice it takes to save a society  This could be a great read aloud for 5th 8th grade  The book gives the perspective of a futuristic society with no fear or pain  and demonstrates how a society would function if this was the case  I rated this book 5 stars because this is a unique book that ties into many molds of the world and the way it works from a completely new concept of standards   I read this in a day and a half  It was quick and very interesting  I don t usually read books that are this  far out  but in this book the society that is described as idyllic because everything is the same  There is no pain or disappointment  people are not allowed to criticize or point out differences  and on the flip side there is no love and no genuine freedom of choice  Ninety percent of the book is describing this world and at times I had to really pause and think about how this idyllic society mirrors some of the things that the government or other groups are striving to accomplish in this world  total fairness and no room to fail  I can see Satanic elements in this philosophy  and at the end of the book I was far more grateful for the world we really live in where people can speak  uncensored  and fail  uncensored  when they choose to do so  I also am glad I read this as I am on the dawn of hatching teenagers and I might need a good reminder that the ability to make one s own choices must be honored in order to have a civilization that contains beauty and love  Chains is set in a community that is limited to the places they go  things they know  and what they feel  Jonas turns 12 and he is given the job of the Receiver that receives memories from The Giver  that only Jonas and The Giver know  Jonas receives good and bad memories and learns life lessons that the rest of the community might not get to experience depending on a decision Jonas will have to make This book made me think about how some people live in closed worlds and don t know certain things  For example when Jonas starts to receive memories from The Giver he is experiencing things that no one else in the community know and might never  It made me think about if anyone lives like that in our world I would recommend this book because it gives a different view on things  This book made me realize that a society can affect people and that was a really different and cool view on things  I think that people should read this book because of the lesson that it taught  This is probably one of the best books i ve ever read this year  or even my entire life  It reflects how love  courage  and obviously memories  are so important in our lives The beginning was a bit too slow because Lowry took way too much time to explain the Ceremonies and stuff  which didn t really have to do anything with the memories  except the Selection   The rest of the book was awesome  I really want to and I HAVE to read Gathering Blue now  its a demand from my heart    I ve read the blurb  which I was disappointed to know that it isn t about Jonas and Gabe  I ve read spoilers because i really miss Jonas and Gabe  and i found out that they ll come again in book 3  Messenger I love Jonas  aka Brenton Thwaites  Andi  you know i much I ADMIRE him     because he is such a strong character  Love yewww Jonas  3 The society they lived in was so messed up  At first it seemed ok maybe even a little nice but with the turn of each page it became more and more twisted  I can t even coprehend how they can live without sadness  anger  or love    or colors  It was mindboggling   The Giver is about an 11 year old boy named Jonas  Jonas lives in a society where nobody is allowed to experice  feelings   The people in charge of the community give you pills to prevent you from having any type of feelings what so ever so you wont get any ideas to make your own choices  At the age of twelve you will be given a job based on what they notice you have an interest in  This  utopia  is supposed to be seen as the ideal place to live because its all sameness  If you were an adult you would be assigned a wife or a husband and if you wanted children you had to sign up  The most you could have was 2  yes everything was strange   When Jonas realizes that he has a distinct characteristic about himself and that he is not like the rest he is given a very rare and highly respected job to be the receiver of memory  His job is to take all of the memories from the previous Receiver and during this process he finds out a lot he didnt know about this society hes been living in his whole life  After realizing theres more to life he notices the society is very boring and plain becuase they know barely anything and everyone looks the same but what he discovers is other people have different hair color and skin color and more  The reason theres a designated person to hold these memories of the past with them is because they dont want the people of the community knowing about war or even making the same mistakes again as they did in the past  Jonas thought the world he lived in was so great but then he began to question everything and thats when it all begins   I started to read the Giver  yes the book been out for quite awhile  not to mention a movie too  and finished it today  I got it yesterday and finally had the guts to give it try  It s the type of book that is a bit slow pace  in a good way  and have the elements of keeping me glue to the book  My mind starts to buzz with questions and thoughts about how sometimes we take things for granted  Why our human race are keen on trying to change by making us the same so there will be no war  etc  But it s in our very nature to questions  to think  and wonder about life  while staying true as an individual in a society  I highly recommend reading the Giver by Lois Lowry  you won t regret it  Definitely change your view on life and make you ponder about yourself down right to the soul  I absolutely fell in love with this book  it has hooked me II started reading at night before I go to sleep  When I finish the first chapter  I know that I cannot stop myself  So  I kept on reading  I felt frightened thinking that if I were living in such a terrible environment  I can t stand the people s ignorantness  and how they actually know nothing at all  I read this book with many emotions  I felt angry when they release people  and felt sad for them because of their  organized  community The ending seems happy to me  music or color became so hard to get in that world  I wanted to put down the book  when I read how his ather has killed the baby  without knowing what he did  Release to them is actually a celebration  Because they don t know the meaning of death  I felt pity for their thinkings or actions  When I finshed reading it was all ready 1 o  clock  my eyes are bearly open  I almost fell asleep  Anyway  I really liked this book and I wanted to recommand it to everyone who sees this  The Giver e una distopia  The Giver e presentato come romanzo per young adults  Be   questo libro non e nulla di lontanamente simile alle distopie che vanno di moda ora   distopie che in generale apprezzo anche  ho un debole per il genere  partendo dai classici e arrivando ai romanzi piu leggeri che spuntano come funghi in questo periodo   ed e diverso in positivo Il protagonista della storia e Jonas  un Undici  I cittadini vengono infatti divisi per eta  ogni dicembre si passa al  livello  successivo  A ogni livello corrisponde una novita  ho apprezzato moltissimo la cura e le motivazioni che l autrice ha saputo inventare a ogni passaggio  Quando si diventa Dodici si comincia l addestramento per diventare professionisti di vario tipo  Nel mondo di Jonas non esiste l amore  e neppure il sesso  poiche le pulsioni vengono domate tramite apposite pillole e la procreazione e compito esclusivo delle partorienti Per leggere l intera recensione  http   scrittevolmente com 2013 07 04    I enjoyed the book   I get what it is implying  or at least what I think the author is trying to say  and it is something that have often crossed my mind over the years  and becoming more to the forefront of my thoughts as I grow older The simplicity of the book is fine by me  as I was aware when I started reading it that it is presented as a young adult book  Moreover  the further on I got into it  I also realised that this book is one that imagines a life where  sameness  is the only way  where people live in a world that is ordered and planned in a way that there is no pain  no desire  no feeling   for the sake of protecting people from disappointments  from conflicts  from needs This is an imagined world in a sense  but this imagination probably stems from observations of things like Health and Safety Regulations whereby people are not allowed to do many things lest those things result in some kind of pain to themselves  Also how some in the world we live in condemn anything or anyone that do not conform Many places in the world today do let people  by and large  to choose   sometimes choices made are good and sometimes not so  When bad choices are taken  it would usually be at a personal cost And there are many places where  it is not too much of an overstatement to say that anything that is not prohibited is compulsory Yes  this is for the sake of safety and peace It s like keeping a bird in a cage where safety and food is guaranteed  If I were a bird  I would choose to be free to fly in open air  even if this means I would expose myself to the dangerous elements such as predators  and uncertainties like food finding The caged bird most certainly will live longer  but the free bird is the one that is in fact the one with a life This  I feel is what the book is saying  It is conceptual  and yes  a simplification I take this book as a starting point to start discussions and thought process in delving into issues of personal responsibilities based on personal choices and personal risks and the joys and pain that follows suit  An extraordinary novel  first published in 1993 and soon to be released as a film in August 2014  The Giver is set in a Utopian society where pain  suffering  war  differences and choice have been eliminated  But the  Sameness  has not resulted in a perfect world  and a young boy must learn this from The Giver  He must face a difficult choice   a safe  shallow  colourless life or one full of colour  love and knowledge  but potentially dangerous Winner of the Newberry Prize  this novel is a timeless classic and a haunting read  It is the first of a series of 4 novels set in this same future era  It raises important issues resulting from the lack of basic freedoms and pleasures of the community  and sends the reader a warning to guard against letting such a thing happening to their world Look out for the movie to be released later in the year  I think this book starts out boring but then gets really good   I m overwhelmed with thoughts and emotions and I love it  There is nothing better than a book that can make you think and also FEEL things from a different perspective  I ll definitely read this mind teaser again  I read The Giver ages ago and just recently got it on CD to listen to in the car  The book was even better the second time around  It s a great allegory for the Garden of Eden  although this might have been unintentional    a society of no pain  no fear  no choices  no sickness  no misery  no joy  I m glad Jonas  and Adam and Eve  left the comforts of their stable society for a world of more risk and more joy  I ll be excited to discuss this book with my boys when their Language Arts classes read it in 6th grade  Enjoyed this very much  Had a neat  subtle gospel story in it  I liked it  Unlike modern dystopian books there are no extra 100 pages of soppy feelings  Loved this book  My son read it in class and told me I had to read it  I was apprehensive since he s in 4th grade  but I loved it  Also good for your younger readers  I am listening to the book on playaway a small mp3 player I got from the library  This is an amazing story of a strange civilization in a strange time  All of the people are free from choice  color  evil  many of the things that make up our normal world  A young boy named Jonas is apprehensive about turning 12 since he his going to be given his job identity  Every person in their city has a job that was assigned to them  by the elders  at the age of 12  Each group of children from 1s to 6s to 8s each have something special that they can do at each year  The young sister in the story is very excited to turn into a eight to get her bicycle like all the eights do  After the baby naming  Jonas has to sit though a ceremony where all of his fellow 12s are getting their jobs  His number is skipped and then is finally displayed to him  It is a special job called the receiver of memory  Lois Lowery has an amazing mind    I love the inside cover of the story which gives an amazing description of the story  THe story is old a young boy who  experiences something incredible and undertakes something impossible   This is a story for students age 12 high school  It is very deep and is to me seems like a different story from the one I read in 7th grade  I was much more disturbed by the sameness  stirings  and release of old young  But I am much more intrigued by the futuristic storyline    This review does contain spoilers  They were satisfied with their lives which had none of the vibrance his own was taking on  And he was angry at himself  that he could not change that for them  Choices are what matter in the world  they are what make us human  Not just the act of making a choice  although this in itself is incredibly important  but it is the knowledge that you will have to live with the consequences of that choice that holds the greater significance  For once a choice is made  it has eliminated the possibility of other choices When Jonas turns twelve he is chosen to become the new Receiver of Memories  A highly honourable job  but a painful one  It will now be his role to provide the community with advice in times of uncertainty by drawing upon the memories of the past  but he must be trained first  And it is through this training that he begins to see the flaws in his seemingly perfect world The Giver has a long lasting effect on your thoughts  entrapping you in the beauty of a tale that ensures you envy a society that survives without freedom  I found myself believing in the values placed in the community  despite how obscure they seemed  That a designated group of people had decided it was better to live a life without severe emotion  because it ensured peace  was rather mindboggiling perfect at the same time as it was incredibly imperfect  Lowry expertly ensures you as a reader see the sense in both realities Of course being a humanist I see the tragedy in such a world that survives without extreme emotion  It is without pain  anguish  hope and love that we live with the absence of our humanity  We don t progress  For what reason do we have to change anything if we don t have the desire for more  Which is a seemingly common human trait  Yes  as the community showed  there is nothing wrong with living a life without these emotions that drive humanity to do awfully but also great things  because it ensures that everyone is safe and well catered for  However I truly believe that the Elders were wrong in their assumptions that they could make a perfect world  The human race is not perfect  nor do we lead perfect lives  It is with the raw dismissal of anything that attaches us to someone else that we fall flat and I believe are then unable to define ourselves as human  We are after all the sum of others memories I marvelled at how Lowry emphasised the importance of language  Although we may believe simple concepts such as snow or sunshine are easily defined  to explain such things to others without the knowledge of the words we would then need to use to describe the particular term well  it would be rather difficult  Near impossible I would say It was incredibly fascinating to immerse myself into a world where a society that heavily emphasises the importance of precision of language  lives without realisation that they aren t being as precise as they could be merely because they are lacking the knowledge to fully express themselves as individuals  This issue of individuality was another major thinking point  Since the community was incredibly well planned  down to the age that you would stop wearing hair ribbons and give up your comfort animal  there was not a range of individuality avaliable  Which questions the point to life if you are the same as everyone else  If you believe in what they believe  without exception  Despite the mundaneness in the sameness  it again provides little room for progression  Little room for those people who are true gifts to the world  not that everyone isn t a gift but I believe you understand what I am saying  to excel  To change the world The ending did leave me with further questions  so I googled other opinions  as I tend to do  about the rather ambiguous events that happened in the final chapters  In my mind Jonas actually passed away with Gabriel in his arms  Which is a tragedy but it also still makes the ending hopeful  Hopeful in the sense that Jonas became everything that he had wished others would become  Being individuals with the ability to choose and to love  but it was also hopeful because we know that Jonas s memories were returning to the community  Although the idea of the memories fading after you are a certain distance away from the community still feels a bit unexplained  however I accept this plot point as to only not pull apart a novel I loved  We always find ourselves questioning our society  what if it was this or that not truly realizing the consequences  What if we could take away pain  But then love wouldn t make sense  nor joy  What if we were all good people  Then how would we know right from wrong  What Lois Lowry explored in The Giver were these consequences  The consequences of a perfect community  It makes sense at first  even I m like   Huh  wouldn t mind that   But when Jonas receives his place in his community things change drastically  He does not perceive society like the rest  He s restless with varies emotions and circumstances  And there comes a point where he makes a choice  But for once it s his own  As he goes through these emotions the reader discovers along with him  What exactly is family  Snow  Sunshine  War  Color  There s the dictionary definition  and then there s what it awakes in you  But his family wouldn t know  They live literally in a world of grey avoided with anything that can provoke discord  It s a highly reflective book regardless of age  It s profound in the messages  symbolism and themes  The book itself is a Giver  And we are all Receivers  It is our duty as human beings to absorb as much as we can before we die  And also to make change and appreciate a world that allows us to witness and see  To understand  I loved this book  and it makes me emotional  It makes me feel  And makes me learn what I can t take back  Once it s there it s there  It s a memory you can t take away and fortunately  I can share it and still not forget   The Giver plays heavily on the concept that one person s utopia is another person s dystopia The main character is Jonas  a twelve year old boy who was born in Sameness  a place both physical  the town where he lives  and spacial  the time in history   In Sameness individuality was completely destroyed for the sake of equality and uniformity  When kids are born they don t belong to their birthing mothers  they are part of the community and are re assigned to their new  permanent  family   Emotions have been so distilled down that no one in town can truly claim to know what love is for real Education and development is carefully controlled by the town s elders with a highly strict yearly system  For example  when kids turn 7 years of age they are given a front buttoned jacket  Until that time they were never allowed to wear clothing with buttons at the front  When they turn twelve they are assigned their future career  That s when we meet Jonas  when he is about to go through his  and every other  12 year old s  Ceremony of Twelve  As Jonas moves forward on his new assigned job he learns the full truth behind his town  humanity s history  and the high price that was paid in order to achieve Sameness  To a point  the book can be compares to the movie Pleasantville  In fact  the early parts of the story are pretty much in greyscale  and as Jonas moves forward and re discovers emotions his world begins to turn to Technicolor  I loved the juxtaposition of what is right versus what is perceived as being right  Definitively a story I would recommend to any book lover  The Giver is a pure science fiction book set on a dystopian world that forces you to evaluate your definition of freedom  how much of it you have and what are you willing to sacrifice in order to either obtain it or keep it  A utopian society can never exist  It s simply as that  The first tale of the human history tells the same thing  Adam and Eve   the garden of Eden   Perfection  is just a word  in reality  it just doesn t work for our kind  so a utopia just have to be really a stifling dystopia  No one knows it better than the young protagonist  Jonas  Though it s a book which has won a lot of award under children s literature category  I d say  it s more suitable for young adults 14   and for adults  The violence an the sexual passages are not for anyone under 12  Then the book is heavy in its philosophy and I ve not met any children or even teenagers  and I m a teacher  who ll understand the mature themes the novel captures  This is a great book in a very wrong category  So don t buy for your kids but buy this for your library  The 5 star is not for the category of children s literature  for being a powerful story as a novel  everyone must read   This is a great book  One of the first books about the future I enjoyed  I m really not a fan of dystopian novels and even though I gave The Hunger Games a rating of 5 it s because the series deserved it   not because I loved it or anything  though I liked it but not  like like      Okay this part is not relevant to my review so feel free to ignore this  Come to think of it  The Giver Quartet must be the only dystopian series  together with The Hunger Games trilogy  that I ve read in my whole life  But the thing is  this time I liked it a lot This book made me think of things  mostly  what ifs   What if we don t have choices  What if we don t have dreams  Love  Jealousy  Envy  Criticism  What if the only thing we know is contentment  The main thing that I realized and the one thing that opened my eyes is    we can t really know what happiness is without pain  I think  for me  that  yes we can thank God for the things that He gives and gave us but we can appreciate it more if we experience obstacles along the way  Like  earning things that you worked hard for  And although contentment is very a good thing  there are some aspects in our life that need change  Like  our studies or work  Habang buhay na lang ba tayong kontento sa tres  lalong lalo na kung kaya naman nating mag achieve na higit pa don  Or    Habang buhay ka na lang bang kontento sa buhay mo na mahirap  kung pwede naman na gumawa ka ng paraan para makaalis diyan I don t know if these things are correct and if my apprehension of the book is correct  but well  these are the things that I thought of so    I really liked the Giver because it was a very interesting alternate world that could either be pictured as a dystopia or a utopia  It had a very good plot and was really descriptive  I think Lois Lowry did a good job on describing how it is to not be able to see color  I think that it tricks you by having a pretty simple writing style and making you think that it s childish or unsophisticated  You change your mind when you actually get to the more surprising aspects about Jonas s society  like there are no memories  no strong feelings  very few books  and no animals  I enjoyed reading this book and recommend it to anyone who likes dystopia books and adventure books   When you live in a world where everything s taken care of  where there s no pain  no real uncertainty  where people say what they mean and mean what they say  where the job you have is perfectly suited to you  where your spouse s personality complements yours  what possible problems could there be with life As we come to find out  plenty  But that s what makes a dystopia  after all  You take a society that seems perfect on the surface  and you scratch a little deeper and look a little harder  and you see that things aren t as pristine as people would like you to think While Lowry s book was written for a younger audience  it tackles some very deep and hard hitting issues that even make adults uncomfortable  The most obvious of these being the cheerful and ignorant use of euthanasia  known better in this book as Release  which is used to end the lives of people who are getting too old and have reached the end of their appointed time  for people who don t feel like they can or ever will fit in  and  as Jonas comes to learn in one disturbing scene  for disposing of the inconvenient problem of identical twins  Can t have two similar looking people in society  after all  It would confuse people  And the birth rate is so carefully planned that the birth of twins might cause a strain on food supplies and housing  Much better to Release them and send them Elsewhere Other rather complex issues tackled in this book involve the absense of love as an accepted emotion  collective unconscious memory  and genetic manipulation  Not exactly easy topics to cover  or to simplify enough that younger audiences can understand them while still keeping the essence of the issue alive  but Lowry manages quite well Until the time that the final book of the trilogy was published  there was some controversy surrounding the ending  Jonas s escape from his community  and subsequent struggle through the wilderness  wasn t easy to read  but as he grows colder  weaker  hungrier  and in the end sees a sled very like the one in the first memory he received from the Giver  and starts to see lights in the distance and even hear music  many people wondered if this was less a real thing and more of a hallucination suffered by a dying boy who carried hope with him until the very end  Both theories certainly had their merit  Jonas remembers a place he s never actually been to but has familiar and comforting elements  while half dead from exposure  certainly lent credence to the hallucination theory  Others prefered to believe that Jonas finally found the escape that he was looking for  and found a new place that he could live without all the terror that he had come to realize was lurking beneath the surface of his own ordered community The truth is revealed in the final book of the trilogy  For those who haven t read that one yet  I won t spoil it for you  At least not in this review Ultimately  this is one novel that I think can appeal to far more than it was perhaps originally intended  and a real testament to just how much children and teens can actually handle and learn is you bother to expose them to it  This is a book that  if you haven t read it yet  you really ought to  and I hope you can take from it as much as I have  Believe me  it really is worth it   The Giver is a book about a utopian society at an unknown time in the future  Children at the age of 11 are assigned roles that they will fulfil for the rest of their lives  Jonas is given a special role  The Receiver  His role is to accept memories and experiences of those before him  and use them to benefit his society  With each memory  Jonas begins to realise his world is not as ideal as he had once thought I loved this book when I first read it in 7th grade  and rereading it now  I have been able to see much more in the writing of Lois Lowry than my younger self  This book has a lot to do with Individuality  and realising how much broader the world around you is  and how it is not always attached to you  This book represents growing up  and leaving the safeties of childhood behind you  The writer s style is simple and straightforward  making the book all the more powerful I recommend The Giver to anyone who is emotionally mature enough to handle the depth of this book  and all it represents  I recommend this book to anyone who wants something that will make them think and wonder  The Giver is a story about a young curious boy named Jonas that lives in a community that the highest of preciseness  You are put into an age group when you are born and that determines a lot of your life  They have blocked out almost every injustice in the world around them  Even the families are all precise   view spoiler   in a family unit there is one man  one woman  one boy  and one girl   hide spoiler  There are no choices in this community  every step in your life is monitored and chosen for you first  There are so many more injustices that they have themselves but they don t think that it is an injustice  A situation in The Giver is when Jonas asks to see the release of a twin that was being said goodbye to that morning by his dad When The Giver shows Jonas the tape  Jonas feels a horrible feeling of disgust and loneliness  He feels loneliness because no one else can see what the Elders are doing to the people who are up to die soon or do not  fit in  their community  Disgust overrides him because he cannot believe what he is seeing  how the people he has trusted whole life are taking the lives of innocent people and putting them down like animals  This problem is never resolved in this community as we know it  but they could change it if The Giver would just give the community the memories and tell The Elders not to help them I would recommend this book to anybody that is willing to cry because of a book  This story is filled with dramatic events that will touch your heart in different ways  It will touch your heart with love because of the whole lesson of love and caring  Your heart will be touched with pain and anger as well  There are moments where some characters seem like loving people and then when you read on and find out they really do  you are heart broken   I was taken aback by my own realization that the idea of equality is terrifying and that there is a greater purpose behind why this world is unfair  I am a passive activist  and I was used to thinking that the only cure for this world s dilemmas is to implement impartiality  I once agreed with Karl Marx s theory of a  classless society   but then  the book made me change the paradigms that I have  Lowry s got me thinking and the emotions that I have felt are baffling  Perhaps  the book s concept of an organized world  wherein life is so orderly  so predictable and so painless do not simply coincide with my own idea of life and living  We are humans  we are not just bags of flesh who tend to walk around and do things Perhaps  there are just things that are inseparable  no matter how unlikely they are  All in all  The Giver is an epic read I say  this book is a keeper and in some ways it transposed reality      Reviewed on Bailiwick Books  With the movie coming up  I knew it was finally time for me to read The Giver  I had been hearing the title of this book for years  but I never knew what it was about  It wasn t until I learned this book was dystopian that I was certain it was something that I had to read  As a pessimist  I can never turn down a dystopian read You are shown the community through the eyes of Jonas  a young boy who is about to start his adult life as he reaches the age of 12  He is placed into the most important job in his community  finding out he will be the new Receiver of Memories  He starts his training with the Giver  and is shown all the secrets and truths that were held from the rest of the community  Love  pain  and colour are shown to him  taking away the  Sameness  he had been raised to think of as natural The world built for this story is intricate and interesting  There is so much detail put into the world  that you can t help but want to stay in that story as long as you can  This book was a privilege to read  and deserves every bit of praise it has received  What a marvelous  wonderful story this was Although I often wonder why so many of these type of books  Utopia Dystopia  have children as protagonists  Hunger Games  The Divergent series  etc  The kids always seem to go through so much  I get that they might want to target the YA audience but I just myself cringing when I see 13 15 year olds kill and experience all those things  Maybe that s just me  There were some elements in this book that I found myself wishing were in our world  Duh   Stuff like the families really talking about their feelings at the end of the day  And that despite whatever transgressions there may be  most of the times there was such a gentle undertone to the reprimands and scolding  That DOES NOT happen here  I feel like I would be able to talk and express my opinions a lot easier if I knew I m not going to be shot down simply because I m not  old  enough to have an opinion  And the dream telling was really good too  I know  I know  it s a way for them to always know what everyone is thinking and control that stuff et all  But it s kind of nice that they can talk about it  Also no religion  BEST THING EVER I also like the fact that when everybody receives their Assignment it s not on the basis of some lottery system or simply because they have a particular quality that stands out  It s a result of serious  lengthy observation  And the year system is really great too  Although once again I would like to point out that Twelve is too yung to start taking vocational training The book had the a great set of characters that compliment each other and while quirky and individualistic nobody really stands out much which really drives the point of Sameness across  Lily and Asher are adorable I m already excited about Fiona as a possble love interest for Jonas  if he goes back to the community or she comes Elsewhere  I haven t read the second book yet so I don t know what will happen  I also like the idea of sharing memories  Yes  it s sad for the Giver and the Receiver to shoulder the burden but it was almost poetic to read about Jonas experiencing his first sled ride and sunshine and everything  The thing with taking pills for controlling Stirrings  the  releases   no colors  no music  no privacy  no choice  Place for Childless Adults  among others were alarming  And although I kind of suspected what release really meant  I was not prepared for the death of that little twin boy  Poor Jonas  Jonas was a wonderful lad  just the right side of serious  fun  righteous and self conscious  This is one of the books where nothing really exciting or suspenseful or scary really happens or happens all that quickly  It s a slow but steady introduction to the world but that s what makes it believable  That a system like this can exist  Don t mistake this to mean that this is a slow  dull read  It s not  I cannot wait to read the next book My heart went out to poor Gabriel  such as sweet  sweet boy  and Jonas  traveling all alone  starving and freezing with no one to help  Gabriel is but a baby  And Jonas is still a child too  to bear all that responsibility and pain and worry  The Giver  Lois Lowry In this dystopian society disguised as a utopia even to its citizens  everything is perfect  There s no color  pain  choices  joy  singing  dancing  the list goes on and on  The citizens are given their assignment and work in that field the rest of their life  Jonas is chosen as the Receiver  who holds the memories of the life before everything was controlled  and advises the government with wisdom these memories And what a journey he embarks on from there The Giver is easily one of my favorite books  It s a fairy quick read  yet the author managed to convey the story completely  and gorgeously  at that  This book took a new perspective on the topic of dystopia  contrasting the fast paced  intense wartime dystopia stories seen in recent media  Rather than raising an army to take down the government  Jonas chose a much different  and frankly more practical  approach  which one could see for themselves after reading it  In fact  it brought to light one important fact  if you were living in a dystopian society  and it s all you ve known  you most likely wouldn t recognize how bad it was at all until you were shone a better way of living Besides that  the writing was  in my opinion  exceptional  It really made me think  I had to put it down afterwards and rethink my entire life  The only part I was not fond of was how open and inconclusive the ending was  I was quite confused But perhaps  it s just left up to your imagination In all  the book exceeded my expectations in every way  as I wasn t expecting much  It s a speedy read suited for students and adults alike  especially if you re a fan of dystopia  such as Divergent  Read this in a few hours    good read  Syd had to read it for english class haha Eleven year old Jonas lives in a community where everything is controlled  He lives with his mother  father  younger sister Lily  and Gabriel  a child who is temporarily staying with the family until he is developmentally ready for his own family  From the time that children are born  everything is decided for them  including when they get their first hair cut  what they are allowed to wear  and when they are allowed to ride a bicycle  The community believes that allowing its citizens to make choices is not safe  Jonas does not have to worry about making any life choices because they have all been decided for him  even his role within the community which starts when he turns twelve years old  At the Ceremony for Twelves  Jonas is very anxious as he receives the role of Receiver of Memory  which he is told is a role of honor but will require physical pain  The Receiver of Memory holds all of the memories of pain so that others do not have to bear them  as well as happy memories that the community does not want others to experience  From the Giver  Jonas enjoys receiving happy memories of snow  colors  emotions  grandparents  and love  but he soon feels pain from memories of war and death  Jonas soon questions the community and believes that memories should be shared not hidden  With the help of the Giver  they devise a plan for Jonas to leave the community to look for  Elsewhere  This is a reread for me in anticipation of the upcoming movie  The first time I read this book I absolutely loved it because it really made me think about life and how we learn so much by our choices  Do we really know happiness and joy if we haven t experienced pain or love  I don t think so  Living in a perfect world would be nice  but really not worth it if you don t have any choices  The second reading made me question some of the things in the book that were not fully explained  like the not being able to see color  How did they manage to remove that from the population  The releasing of people  especially the babies really bothered me too  and I can t imagine people within the community  especially Jonah s dad being OK with that  How do they not understand what they are doing  A lot of people have complained about the ending  readers are left to decide for themselves what happens to Jonah and Gabriel  I personally like that idea  It leaves you with a lot to think about  I personally want to think they made it and had a better life  This is a great book for young teens as an introduction to the dystopian genre  I hope the movie isn t disappointing  When I first read the novel  The Giver  by Lois Lowry published in the year 1993 I knew it would be a brilliant book with vivid storytelling and leaves me wondering after every chapter with a major twist  This book takes place in an unspecified time in the future where after you turn the age of twelve the elders in your community assign you a job to support your community based on what type of person you are and how you could best support your community  The protagonist of this story is Jonas an 11 year old male who turns 12 and is chosen as the  receiver of memory  the most important job in the whole community  The name is basically what it sounds he receives memories everyday from  the giver   The Giver gives memories from the past to Jonas so that others do not have to remember anything like war or hunger  They cannot even experience color in this  utopia    I think this book is pretty well compared to the movie and there is really no difference but there is one thing in the book and movie that really bothers me and this is the age gap  In the book they are 12 and the movie who knows what age the movie looks like the characters are already in their late teen years but other than that the movie captures the clearly captures the novel  There is also a romance in the movie between Fiona and Jonas but in the novel Jonas only has a crush on Fiona  But these are all just minor changes in the book there is no change in the story line whatsoever  What I like most about the book is its ending it lets you chose for yourself the ending of the book for Jonas  I think that this was an illustrious book and it clearly deserves my full five stars on Goodreads  I read this one in just one day    on my flight up to Boston and then later that evening since I had to know what happened to Jonas   Gabe  It was so hard to put down  and I am honestly saddened that I never was asked to read this earlier during my school years  While the plot  on the surface  sounds somewhat like all of the current young adult dystopian novels of today  there was something about it that certainly was ahead of its time back when it was originally written  I can t wait to read some of the other novels from the giver quartet and see what else Ms  Lowery has to say about her perception of the world    and how we each fit into it  Now I will pass this one along to my 10 year old son to get his opinion on it too Review also appeared  Book Addict 24 7I don t even know where to begin with this book  On the outside  The Giver by Lois Lowry looks like such a simple  thin book  it almost makes sense why young children are told to read this in school  Almost  But the thing about Lowry s book is that it s like reading Romeo and Juliet when you re still twelve and not entirely sure about what s going on  and entirely dependent on your teacher s very censored ideas of the themes and morals told by Shakespeare  The Giver is the type of book  that yes  can definitely be discussed in a young reader s school  because almost any book can be discussed by young readers and their teachers   but it definitely harbors some very dark themes  First  I m going to briefly touch on the religious representation of Jonas  the protagonist  Though I am in no way proficient with bible verses and such  I did come across the story of Jonah  which is pretty damn close to Jonas  and how he  originally ran from God before delivering a message of repentance to the nation of Nineveh   which could be the community that Jonas lives in  which is emotionless and content in its ability to  let people go   Jonas  as the receiver of memory  is kind of like a prophet who receives the wisdom of humanity s past  which I guess  in a way  would be seen as a Godly attribute since it is something that only one powerful person can have  I don t know if that made any sense  but it did in my head  Second  I want to mention the idea that even if we lived in a Utopia  which I think is impossible  especially if Utopia means being an emotionless drone   there will always be one person who sees things differently  Jonas and The Giver are these outcasts who choose to live outside of this supposed Utopia that allows you to believe the world is perfect  The further Jonas goes in his training  the more he becomes alienated  and though the idea of being different than others is exhilarating  it is also terrifying  tiring  and lonesome  In my opinion  Lowry s view of a dystopic society is the kind of view that so many of today s dystopian novels are missing  For example  if what appears to be perfect proves to be something severely imperfect  and you have the power to bring to justice the crimes of this imperfection  would you ruin this dream in exchange for the nightmares of reality  Dystopian should be less about rebellion and more about the human condition and how one or more people start adding colour to their black and white sight  Okay  so it does have some rebellion  but this is more of a personal rebellion  internal struggle between ignorance and knowledge   then a societal one Thirdly  and probably lastly  I want to note that though Jonas s world is marred with the seemingly perfect imperfection  the community isn t the only thing to be ruined by the  sameness  that stripped everyone of individuality  It is Jonas and all of the kids who turn twelve who are forced to relinquish their childhood  Imagine being twelve and suddenly knowing exactly what you re going to do for the rest of your life  Sounds terrifying  Now imagine being completely unaware of the fact that all choice and childhood innocence has been taken from you  There is no privacy  there is no true creativity  there is physical punishment that teaches you to be docile  and there is even control over how you speak  to the point of condescension  After all  isn t the worst kind of abuse the one where you re not even aware of it  This is another way that Lowry s dystopic world works so great  her storytelling tries so hard to convince the reader that this should be the norm  yet Jonas s active fear of his twelfth birthday shows that this is indeed not normal  or standard behavior  Even if society changes to suit the greater need  choice is needed  even if humanity s downfall can be the power to choose  But the idea of choice also plays into the conclusion of the novel  Does choice lead Jonas where he ends up  or does humanity and the ability to feel govern his actions  Is he simply a victim of the emotions the community has forced out of its residents  Or is he being rebellious by allowing himself to choose something for the first time in his life  no matter the consequences See  This is why I m all in a tizzy after reading this book  One hundred and eighty pages and I m completely contemplating every single chapter in this book  Also  let s enjoy the fact that one of the rules is that he s allowed to lie  I loved this rule because I think it s what made Jonas realize that his life just completely changed  It was probably  in my opinion  another huge aspect of the conclusion and how we lie to ourselves when things are beyond our control  I definitely recommend this book to everyone and I don t even know how I went this long before reading it  Will I read the rest of the series  Honestly  I probably won t  I m content with this book and its very philosophical and slightly haunting ending  Happy reading  The GiverA review by Kendyl LoppMurder  violence  and sexual awakening  these are some of the themes included in the book  The Giver  that made it one of the most banned books in the 1990 s  These controversial themes made the book fascinating and one that you just didn t want to put down   The Giver  was written by Lois Lowry and is about a utopian society of the future  It is written from the point of view of Jonas  an 11 year old main character who changes tremendously throughout the novel The utopian society that Jonas lives in has no pain  fear  hatred  war and very little emotions  The society doesn t allow people to have very many choices  People have assigned jobs  assigned spouses and can only have two children  Jonas has been chosen for the job of the  Receiver  and is accountable for protecting the communities  memories from before there was  Sameness   Jonas becomes frustrated when he realizes no one in the community has the power to make decisions on their own and that they are being controlled  He becomes sad when he realizes  released  means to kill and that is what they do to the elders and newborn unhealthy babies  Jonas must figure out how he will handle the power that comes with being the  Receiver  My favorite moment in  The Giver  was when the Giver transmitted the first memory to Jonas  Jonas arrived at the annex and was extremely nervous about his first day of training  Jonas entered a room that looked like his own family units dwelling  but with a few differences  He saw books on the shelves that he had never seen before  Jonas introduced himself to the Giver and asked him some questions about what exactly they were going to be doing  He told Jonas to take his tunic off and lay down on the bed  Jonas did so  a little apprehensively  The Giver put his hands on Jonas s back and transmitted the first memory of going sledding in the snow I really enjoyed  The Giver   The plot was very attention grabbing and intense and some very suspenseful and exciting events happened  An example of an exciting moment in the novel was the Ceremony of Twelve  where all the elevens got assigned a job  The symbolism and themes used in the story make the reader really think about moral issues   The Giver  is very well organized so it was very easy to follow  Some parents do not approve of parts in the book that deal with abortion  murder  and sameness  For the most part I believe  The Giver  is an age appropriate and fascinating book Overall  I would recommend  The Giver  and give it a 9 out of 10 stars It lets the reader discover some very deep moral issues  In  The Giver   citizens have almost no choices of their own  In this novel you will get to see the differences between our community and the utopian community in the book  As it turns out murder  violence  and sexual awakening can be appropriate topics for young adults review from dianne fThe giver was a great movie the author of the giver is lois lowry the producers of the movie was is nicole silvers  jeff bridges  orly wiseman  and neil koenigsberg  The movie and the book is different first you should read the book before the movie to really understand what you are reading  There are parts in the movie that isn t in the book and parts that are in the book that isn t in the movie  In the movie you are in a community that has certain rules like a dress code and even transportation  Some of the characters in the movie  Most important to least The Giver  Jonas  Gabriel  Lilly and Asher  My favorite part of the movie was when jonas started seeing colors like lily s hair and was given memories and he ran off with someone  I loved this movie there isn t too much action and not to much drama  I really recommend watching this movie i give this movie 4 star s the movie is very interesting The GiverA Review By Gracie AckerThe Giver is a very suspenseful book written by Louis Lowry  It s very exciting because you never know what s gonna happen next I personally like this book because of the many mysteries it holds Jonas is a regular boy living in a community with very strict rules  Everyone is to act the same way and nobody is allowed to judge or have their own opinion  This all changes once Jonas is chosen for an important job  The Receiver is someone who holds all memories of the past  and he must pass on these memories to Jonas  Once Jonas finds out the many hidden truths  he is faced with a very serious decision My favorite part of the novel is very hard to say because I don t want to spoil the book  I ll just say that my favorite parts of the book were the  Aha Moments   I loved being able to figure out certain scenarios in the book  Jonas starts to unravel his memories and put together what the community is hiding This book was very unpredictable and exciting  I enjoyed the book and I m looking forward to seeing the movie  I think the author made some good twists in the story  It was definitely worth the time to read this book I would highly recommend this book  I give a 5 star rating for this book  I think if you re looking for a suspenseful mystery  The Giver is a great book for you  The Giver Heather Owen The book the giver is based on a young boy named Jonas who is a twelve and lives in a utopian society  In the book Jonas becomes the receiver of memory which is a big deal because only one person is chosen as the receiver of memory  Jonas receives memories from the giver  There is also only one giver  In order for the giver to give memories he must place his hands on the receiver of memories back  One day jonas requests to see a ceremony of release which is basically where someone is killed and Jonas s dad is the person who kills them  Once When jonas saw the ceremony of release he took his baby brother Gabriel and ran away   The book the giver wasn t really enjoyable for me because it was based on a utopian society which Ididn t really like   The Giver by Lois Lowry is a powerful  beautiful yet effective piece of art  This book has faced many discrimination about how violent and how dark the book is  Over the years this booked has been cherished and passed down from generation to generation using it to make kids like us think more deeply about life  Its about a boy named Jonas who lives in a society where love is not allowed  everything is bleak and boring and everyone follows the same rules  acts the same and wears the same cloths and no one has any heart  His life changes suddenly when the event that everyone in their lives are waiting for when they get their jobs  Jonas gets the job as the giver and becomes the student of the original giver and become close  while starts to realise that the is so much more then what is little world has to offer  and the terrible truths that their council is hiding from them  Some things that people hate about this book is how evil and dark it can be sometimes  There s a part where the giver shows Jonas what the releasing is  and at the age of 12  he gets to see his own dad kill a baby  Other parts that reflect the dark side is scenes of war  people killing elephants for money  Even though this book can be very dark at times  it really opened my eyes to what the world could be and what during this day  Well I mean I would recommend this to a classmate even though everyone in the school read it  The reason why is because it s a VERY powerful piece of reading that everyone should read to understand the world better  It is in fact part of a series that I will continue to read   No choices  Everything that you do is assigned and well thought out  The community s Elders decide everything  who your family unit is  your spouse and even your career assignment  The old live in group homes and after awhile they are  released  to Elsewhere  Jonas  an eleven  was selected for the  assignment of the Receiver of Memory  In this novel The Giver by Lois Lowry  Jonas receives some of the memories from the past  before the  sameness   He is given memories of riding down a hill on a sled  a sunburn  and also war  At first the memories are nice because the Giver doesn t want to hurt him  he had to give him the painful memories though      From the memories  Jonas realizes that choices are good and people should be able to choose what they want  On page 97 of the book  Jonas explains   If everything s the same  then there aren t any choices   he wants   to wake up in the morning and decide things  A blue tunic or a red one   After awhile of comparing his community to the memories from the past  Jonas makes the decision to leave  He and the Giver make a plan  Jonas would leave at midnight when there will be no one on the roads  Before they had lost a Receiver of memory and when she was  released  all of the memories that she had acquired had been returned to the people in the community  Both Jonas and the Giver thought that this would happen when Jonas left  He took Gabriel with him and left early for they were going to  release  Gabriel in the morning and Jonas did not want that to happen  After many days and nights of always on alert  starving  and cold  Jonas and Gabriel finally found what they were looking for  Elsewhere   When I first read this  sixth grade   I hated it  When I read it on my own  I fell in love with it  I re read this recently due to the movie being released  Even though the book s target audience is more geared for middle grade  I believe readers of all ages can enjoy this story  I still love this story  It s one of those books that have great characters and make you think The only thing I don t like about this book is that it goes by so fast and that there isn t much detail on how the world Jonas knows got to be that way  something that really interested me  However  I know there are three other books in the series so perhaps some answers will be in them This is a book that I can probably read in a few years again and still love  a classic  The world is interesting and scary  the characters are well defined and make you care about them  particularly Jonas  the Giver  and Gabe for me   and has situations that make you think The scene with Jonas  father and the twins always gets me every time  A truly horrifying scene  Definitely recommended for all   Favorite book  While it s perceptible from the beginning  the irony of protection and death is exaggerated eloquently  The protection that is given to one by a  government ruling body  can be taken away by that  government ruling body   and at its discretion  Lowry has captured the dullness of monotony that comes about by showing a society that has taken the concept of  freedom from harm  to the extreme  With freedom there is always risk  She also drives home the consideration we face on a daily basis  What does it mean to truly live  If we are free  does that not mean we have the freedom to risk harm and death or having our feelings hurt  After many years  and with the gift of being the receiver  the character  Jonas  becomes plagued with this question and ultimately makes the right choice  The book ends a bit abruptly  I suppose I only wish there was more because I was captured by the story line  Otherwise the book is well written  the dialogue is impeccable to each character  Lowry creates dialogue that forms distinct characteristics for each character   traits that cannot be stolen from individuals easily  even in a monotonous social setting   and the descriptions create a vivid imagery in one s mind  The questions that are brought in throughout the book are answered  which is a craft I can t say writers are capable of doing in some current books I ve read  Recently my husband and I were at the movie theater and saw a preview for The Giver  For years he s been commenting upon and quoting this book  a book that he read back in middle school and still remembers  Interested  I picked up the book and gave it a read  I was not disappointed  Although it is aimed at young adults  the first of it genre to target children and teens  it was an engrossing read  I would have finished it the first night if I hadn t needed to go to work the next day  The future we are presented with  how normal it is to Jonas and how much you begin to question alongside him  makes you hope that one day this book does not speak true  I highly recommend reading this book   Lois Lowry s THE GIVER will stay with me for a long time  THE GIVER is set in a society where everyone is the same  where individuation is anathema  and memories are preserved for only one generation  When Jonas turns twelve  he is chosen to be the new Receiver of Memories  Only The Giver  the previous Receiver  holds the memories of the past  It is his role to pass them onto Jonas THE GIVER terrified me  It is our differences  whether cultural  political  or personal  that make us who we are  Too eliminate them is to       oops  starting to sound like a sociologist  Time to move on  Read THE GIVER  It is not to be missed  Imagine a society where people are assigned a family  have no emotions  and make no life choices  The Giver  by Lois Lowry  takes place in a utopian society where the elders have replaced differences with sameness  Pain  war  hatred and fear do not exist  Everyone in the society follows the rules  Children are assigned a job by the elders when they turn 12 at a special ceremony  Jonas  the main character  is selected to be the receiver of memory  Only one child is special enough to be the receiver of memory  He is not required to follow some of the rules and studies History with the Giver  who transfers memories of the past to him  Jonas now begins to question the society and thinks that the perfect society is not so perfect after all  One of the main themes in The Giver is memory  We learn that without memory there is no conflict  suffering  true happiness  or love A couple years ago I read the Hunger Games and I thought that it was an extremely exquisite book  so then I decided to read The Giver because of its similar utopian society  This book lived up to its principal expectations and kept me hooked all the time  I would recommend this book to anyone who questions societal rules  Lowry is a phenomenal author  and if you aren t familiar with her yet  you need to go pick up on of her books  I first read one of her books when I was 11  and I m pleased to say that at 20  I can still enjoy her reading and find her books to be excellent for both older children and adults as well  The Giver is definitely one of those books that can be enjoyed by a reader of just about any age There isn t anything graphic in it at all  which is perfect for younger readers  and it is in fact Lowry s subtle way of saying things that make parts of The Giver so disturbing  What s NOT said  is even more important that what is said most of the time  Most of us would argue that feelings are vital to human life  without these different emotions we aren t really living  But how often do we wish we could take away painful feelings and memories for ourselves or those we love  Lowry raises the question of whether it s better to have no feelings at all  or at least  ones which are dulled  or to have a wide experience of emotions  some of which may be extremely painful  How far is too far to protect ourselves and others  What s frightening is that we can already see these ideas creeping into our society now  and Lowry examines with Jonas and the Giver just how far we can take these ideas to an extreme   Lois Lowry s book The Giver was super interesting to me because it s really high minded and also driven about a young named jonas who is a very nice 12 year old child who happens to live in a nice place that appears to be a utopia which is supposeldy a nice place to live which is also a futuristic environment In the book the giver Lowry takes the reader s attention into how Jonas a boy who just turned 12 lives his life  the community that Jonas lives in people call it the utopian community which throws a good spin on life without any hesitation  Even though Jonas and his family know that there isn t no knowledge what so ever of life with decisions colors music and also diverse countries and many more experience s that we end up taking for granted which we should  the life Jonas had was all he ever known about since the day he had turned 12 randomly Jonas ends up being picked as the towns new giver  I honestly think this book is really good to read because I feel like if some was to read this book it would improve the life of the reader and also makes people appreciate true freedom and lots of individualism The setting in the book mainly is managed community in a very futuristic place  but the crazy part is that the area he lives in I that literally everything is most likely regulated so that even the unexpected never ever happens  Jonas is living in the best family unit best job and even the best weather anyone could ask for  Later on in the book Jonas is currently waiting to find out and see what will his adult career will end up being like when he gets older Basically the point of the giver is that a boy named Jonas who later turns 12 and lives in a super futuristic community were literally all pain fear war and hatred  since people almost look he same   act the same way there isn t really any prejudice but there is very little competition where everyone is unfailingly nice to everyone  Although the society has erased the choice that at the age of 12 every member of the community is assigned a job normally based on his or her natural abilities and interests  if you break a rule or end up failing to adapt to the right society s code of behavior will end up being released even though in their case it can be a occasion of very good shame and literally everything is super planned and put together to were that life is super convenient and good as possible  May I just say WOW  After finishing this book  I have so many thoughts  feelings  and emotions that I m not certain where to start I guess I d like to start by saying that even though this was a wonderful book full of imagery and emotion  complete with an ending that I could sleep with   I felt as if there were so much more I d like to have known more about  More details about more characters  what happened after Jonas left  what became of Asher  Fiona  and Lily  Did Jonas  father and Fiona realize the reality of the releases they had done  How did they accomplish sameness and keep the rest of the world out  I ll stop there I guess it s okay to leave so much to the imagination when the story manages to leave you torn with emotion  questioning everything including things you didn t even realize you cared about  and telling everyone who will listen about the book you just read I m very happy that this book is being taught in our schools  I m grateful that I ve read it and thankful that it has helped to open topics of conversations with my preteen kids that I hadn t felt were necessary or realized needed to be discussed  I hope one day to accomplish something as profound as this  The Giver takes place in a community that is based on sameness and ignorance  There is no weather  no colors  no music  no animals  and no nature  The people in this community don t even know what these things are  We are immediately introduced to Jonas and his family and we are also given a rundown on the community s rules and traditions  One day while Jonas is at training he makes The Giver realize that love and pain caused from memories would improve the community  This is the day that The Giver and Jonas make the plan  Jonas is to receive as many memories as he can and then run away from the community so all these memories will return to the people of the community  Jonas escapes from the community and travels many days on his bike  Just when he reaches a point of physical exhaustion and starvation  he hears music and singing from a place ahead of him  This gives him a new hope  Jonas also thinks he hears music coming from a place behind him  He thinks the memory of music was given back to the community that he left behind  I remember reading this book when I was in elementary school  and since I couldn t remember much besides that I loved it  I decided to read it again  And BOY  did I remember how awesome this book is   It s a short dystopian novel that captivates the reader from page one  I love the imagery in this book  and the brother brother bond within the story  I recommend this book to all readers  Am I a weirdy for wanting to hear more about the memories that caused Rosemary to apply for release  But mostly  this book was awesome when I was in the 5th grade  it s awesome still   Kool So I reread this book since I knew the movie was in theaters and I wanted to refresh the book in my mind before I watch the movie  I remembered liking this book a lot when we had to read it in 7th grade  Upon rereading it I realized just how much I still love it  The plot is fantastic and extremely original  at least to me  I know we ve got tons of dystopian novels now a days but even if this book came out now I d still argue it s phenomenal originality  because it s just different from all the other dystopian novels  It s a book that uses feelings or lack there of to advance the plot  not excessive violence and gore  Don t get me wrong  I love the hunger games books but it relies heavily on the epic arena fight to the death  It s an intoxicating thought that this book is something so relatable  seeing as it s all about living in a world that is exactly opposite of how we live now  The writing is great  the plot is great  the characters are perfectly presented and the pain and confusion and anger of the main character is so easily perceived when you compare it with the very cookie cutter way of the community in which he lives   This was such an amazing book  I really enjoyed the different outlook on a dystopian society  The Giver is about how a society is ran differently and is supposed to be helpful and peaceful  but when a young boy gets chosen to hold all of the secrets of the earth before  he starts to realize that they should not live this way  He then starts to bring his friends in on how they are being treated and saves an infant from being killed for no reason  It shows the audience to stick up for things that are not right around you and that your voice matters   I first read this book in high school and thought it was a good  thought provoking book then  so I was excited to give it another spin for grad school  I even have my original copy from the 90s  it was just  5 back in the day    I think being an adult and reading it with more learned eyes made me appreciate it even more  even though now it s a simpler read to me and technically aimed at adolescents  Lowry uses Jonas to describe the world of Sameness initially as a world of innate good  but as we follow Jonas on his journey we see the true perils and disadvantages over what seems to be the ideal society  It reminded me that for all the difficulties and harms of the world  to be completely void of those feelings would somehow be worse  It may be a cliche  but the book partially reminds me of the phrase   Better to have loved and lost than to never have loved at all   In short  I look forward to reading it again when I have a spare moment so that I can pick up more references and expand upon my analysis   The Giver by Lois Lowry is written from a 3rd person view by Jonas the main character  Jonas is eleven years old and lives in a futuristic world where they ve gotten rid of war  hatred  famine and everything and everyone is the same and there are very strict rules of how everyone must live their lives  People see with no colors only in white and black and are given tasks at the age of twelve  Jonas is the given the task of Receiver  which is someone who holds all the memories of the past times  While being trained to be the Receiver  Jonas starts to see the world differently because he learns about all the bad things that happened in the past and also received new feelings he had never felt before  like love  My favorite part of the book is the ending  Jonas finds what he s been looking for all along and the book ends with a burst of hope leaving the reader wanting more  If you ve read something along the lines of Divergent  Hunger Games  and other books with dystopian societies  I would recommend that you read The Giver   Incredibly insightful and appeals beyond its intended audience  Some have criticized it for being implausible or contrived  While it is indeed limited in scale due to its intended audience  I think the criticism misses the point  The Giver involves coming of age but also touches on themes explored in other dystopian classics such as A Brave New World  The repressive society in The Giver is a disturbing look at new age social engineering and political correctness  Lowry manages to introduce adult themes in a way that doesn t overwhelm younger readers  while also making a very real point to adults All of us reach a point between childhood and adulthood where we learn about the imperfections of our world  especially the flaws of our parents  authority figures  etc  We learn that life isn t fair  the bad guys aren t always defeated or punished  there is undeserved pain and suffering in the world  and that it is the fault of the adults  i e  our parents  The main character  Jonas  is turning twelve and will soon learn his assigned job  All individuals are assigned jobs by a committee  fitting their skill set and interests  Jonas is chosen to be Receiver of Memories  He is to receive all the memories of the society beyond his own experience or even that of all its living residents  Jonas learns about human history including the brutal  cruel  and painful experiences that people are shielded from in their current lives  He is like a factual  sensual  and emotional historian for the people  Everyone else in the society is protected from profound feelings and experiences  Everywhere euphemisms are used to protect people from the truth  For example  Death is called release  No one ever sees releases  and simply assume the departed merely go somewhere else  Those that are there for it are conditioned to ignore the implications of it Lowry s Community is not far from Huxley s Brave New World  with its use of artificial barriers to human experience  In fact  Jonas takes a pill every morning to suppress his Stirrings  a euphemism for sexual thoughts  All individuals a born via surrogates  similar to the vats of Huxley s world  The sterile  impersonal environment protects them through a strict behavioral code that minimizes the typical risks that an individual may take Today s youth are shielded from risk at an ever increasing rate  Every year there are new laws and rules to protect children from every threat imaginable  from walking to a park alone  to being left in a car  to hurting oneself on a bike  Americans are obsessed with every misfortune that befalls a child and desperately acts to prevent it The problem is that the overbearing preventative measures come at a cost  Lowry actually gives us a pretty plausible endgame for this kind of thinking  No society will ever be able to eliminate all risk  hence the rulemaking and oppressive actions will continue until all citizens  from grandparents to children  will need to carry around rulebooks just to walk to the store Jonas s society certainly is bizarre but there are places where you can find the beginnings of a Community  We see this on college campuses today  now the laboratories for all sorts of social engineering experiments  On some campuses there are special rules regarding sexual encounters among students  There are also all sorts of rules that are designed to protect students from  offensive  speech or from discrimination whether actual or theoretical  A lot of it is done by recrafting language into what we refer to as politically correct language Precise language is essential to the stability of the Community as well  In the novel  Jonas s parents get upset when he asks his parents if they love him  Love is considered an imprecise word  They prefer emotionally neutral language to express the question  Whenever he is rude he must immediately apologize and the victim must accept the apology  even for the most minor of offenses  This is very similar to politically correct language  where the mere utterance of a word can be considered a criminal offense  Jonas s parents believe  like some in mainstream society believe today  that bad words can cause bad feelings  thoughts that can lead to bad actions  Hence language must be strictly controlled to prevent bad actions  It is a subtle form of oppression in that it restricts one of the most basic freedoms we hold dear  freedom of speech or expression What is the cost  Jonas realizes that the people in his town have never felt some of the strongest emotions and feelings that a human can experience  Specifically  he is upset that none of them have experienced love  They therefore do not experience the world as it truly is  In fact  their lack of experience manifests itself in a very concrete way  The people cannot see color  only Jonas and his mentor  The Giver  can  This is similar to the movie Pleasantville  where there town is black and white until two teenagers start breaking rules  Soon colors emerge and fires start While you may eliminate fear and pain  you will also eliminate love and passion along with it  You cannot appreciate something truly unless it can be lost  We cherish life because it is finite  As you take away the fear of loss  you take away an essential quality of life The Giver is an excellent novel  entertaining and insightful  As far as dystopias go  it is not particularly original  Many elements of the society are borrowed from A Brave New World and others  It is original in that it is experienced through the eyes of a child rather than an adult  This sort of soft oppression is an interesting theme that should be explored more  A must read  The giver is a great book about adventure and mystery  This book is very well written and I have read it over and over again  never tiring  This book begins with a boy named Jonas  He lives in a world of no color or choice  They go through the daily routine everyday  exactly the same  But as the kids turn fourteen things start to change  My favorite part in this book is choosing day  It comes with such a shock what Jonas is chosen to do  It makes the whole book make an unexpected turn for the better  It sets the scene for mystery and adventure  This book was absolutely amazing  I recommend it to anyone and everyone  Enjoy  At first glance  the society in which Jonas and his family and friends live seems like it might be a nice place  There is no hunger  poverty  or sickness  everyone has a place to live and a job to go to  and war and fighting do not exist  It is a peaceful and polite society where everyone gets along  There was no rudeness or bragging or saying unkind words  If you were unkind  you apologized right away  Jonas and his family solved problems by calmly talking things out with each other  Everyone s needs are met and they want for nothing  Or do they  When you begin to take a deeper look you see the price that individuals have paid for this peaceful and calm way of life  The society decided years ago to have what they call  sameness   Anything that was not  sameness  needed to be eradicated  It s interesting that the community wants sameness  yet if twins are born  two children who are the same  one of them needs to be euthanized  Did they go to sameness to eliminate diversity  I m thinking that if there are no differences among each age group  like how at each age all 50 kids get the same haircut  or bike  or an identical coat  then there will be no jealousy  no seeing that someone has something they don t have and maybe say   That s not fair     Children received the same objects at the same time  adults with spouses all lived in the same type of dwelling  and everyone got the same amount of nourishing food  Lots and lots of sameness  But what price did they pay for this  They gave up free will  the ability to choose their own destiny  the ability to make any decisions about their life at all  Everything is decided for them  who their spouse is  or if they even get a spouse  if and when they will be given their children  one boy and one girl only   what job they will have  and where they will live  They don t even get to choose what they get to eat or when they eat  All food is decided for them and delivered at the same time each day  I guess if you never knew there was any other way you could live  if that was all you ever knew  then you wouldn t miss the things you didn t have  Or would you  I never really understood who or where the government was  or if there was one  I guess there s no more President of the United States  We don t even know if this story takes place in the U S  When did our way of life as we know it today become this society where Jonas lives  and how did that happen  Does each community or society have its own government  I would have liked the author to have given us some background on what year this story took place  How did this society come to be  Was there a world war  a nuclear holocaust  a giant tsunami  They seem to be in contact with other societies that are run the same way as theirs  How many are there  and where are they  Do they know about the communities that aren t like theirs  like the one where Jonas and Gabriel end up They had some pretty serious rules in this community  especially for those who break them  People who break the rules a third time  the smaller of a newborn set of twins  and the elderly are released to what is called  Elsewhere   As I read I wondered  is this really a place  And what does released really mean  When the pilot made the error and flew where he wasn t supposed to  the voice over the loudspeaker said he would be  released   No one paid much attention to that  It seemed like it was business as usual  I thought it was kind of harsh  like why couldn t the pilot be given more training or something  So Jonas and most everyone believes the pilot is going  released elsewhere   Unfortunately  Elsewhere  is not a place and  released  does not mean what Jonas always believed it does  that he would be relocated to another community  At first I thought  released  meant released from the community  like Jonas thought  But then as I read more of the story and understood how the society worked I knew that was not what it meant  I had a feeling long before I found out what  released  was  that it actually meant  euthanized   Jonas was as horrified as I was when he watched the video of his father killing the smaller of the newborn twins  although unlike Jonas  I knew what was coming  It was creepy how his father did it with his sing song voice  Kills him  puts him in a box  and then into the trash chute  while saying   Bye bye  little guy   Very creepy  Jonas was so excited about seeing his father perform the ceremony of release  He thought it should be in the auditorium so everyone come and watch  He thought it would be a special ceremony  His feelings towards his father changed in a second after seeing what his father did to release the twin Why did Rosemary have to be released  euthanized  when it became too painful for her to receive the memories  Couldn t they have realized that they made a mistake in choosing her to be the new receiver of memories and found a different job for her  They just kill her  just like that  as quickly and as efficiently as possible  I guess if you take one of those pills every day that suppresses all your feelings  including empathy  euthanizing someone doesn t cause any grief  What a horrible way to live  Quite the shock to find out that Rosemary was the Giver s daughter  How heartbreaking that must have been for him When Jonas  mom first told him about the pill he would now need to take after he experienced what seemed to be a sexual dream  I thought it was just to suppress or eliminate sexual desire  I thought maybe they needed to take away sexual feelings so that men and women wouldn t be attracted to each other and have sex  since all babies needed to be conceived by the women who were chosen to be birthmothers  But it was so much more  It was all feelings  the good and the bad  love  passion  desire  joy  happiness  envy  jealousy  pain  sadness  hate  The pills also seemed to take away any creativity  Is that why there was no art  or music  or dance  anything that would be of a creative nature  or be a way for individuals to express passion and joy  Being chosen as a birthmother didn t seem like a great job  Sure  you get to lay around and be well fed and pampered for 3 4 years while having the three children you are required to have  But after that you work at a labor job and never get to have a spouse or children  Maybe that wasn t so bad though  since having a spouse and children in that society isn t like it is for us  People there didn t feel the same way about their spouse or children  or feel at all  like we do  There is no such thing as love for a spouse or children in Jonas  community  Love doesn t exist  When Jonas first receives the Christmas memory from the Giver  he also learns what love is  When he asks his parents if they love him  he is told that the word love is so meaningless that it has become almost obsolete  and he is chastised for not using precise language Why doesn t anyone see colors  Why do only Jonas and The Giver see them  Is it only those born with light eyes like Jonas and the Giver who have the gift  Does everyone else only see in black and white  The Giver said they relinquished color when they went to sameness  How did they do this How is the Giver able to transfer memories to Jonas just by touching him  Jonas is also able to do this when he transfers memories to Gabriel We never get to find out what the Giver s name is  He s just the Giver Why does there need to be a Receiver of Memory if the only person those memories are ever shared with is the new receiver  What is the purpose of having the memories  I imagine someone needs to keep them so that they aren t lost forever  The Giver mentioned something about using those memories of the past to advise the council Why are the elderly released instead of being allowed to pass away naturally  Is there a set age at which they are released It s interesting that stuffed animals are called  imaginary creatures   Why are there no animals  With all the technology they have  including computers  wouldn t they be able to just google the animals to see what they look like  and that they really did exist  or is there no internet anymore  There are thousands of books but the Giver is the only one that has access to them  Why aren t they in a library where everyone has access  Maybe if they knew things about how life used to be they might want to change things  That wouldn t be good  It would mess up their orderly and predictable life  Being the Receiver of Memories is a painful job  He or she has all the painful memories of the past so that everyone doesn t suffer with them  The Receiver alone suffers with them  The Receiver doesn t take the pill that everyone does  but it seems like they re one of the people who needs to take it  since they suffer so much with all the memories of war  death  cruelty  and inhumanity  Not having feelings might be a good thing then Are there any people of color there or is everyone the same  The descriptions of the people in Jonas  community make them all sound White Caucasian  Was that deliberate on the author s part  Or is it just that they don t see color  so everyone looks the same maybe When Jonas and Gabriel escaped and got outside of their community they saw and experienced so many new things that they never had before  Suddenly there were animals  birds  snow  rain  sunshine  waterfalls  and hills  None of these existed in their community  Did anyone besides Jonas and the Giver know any of these things existed  Probably not I liked this passage near the ending   The community where his entire life had been lived lay behind him now  sleeping  At dawn  the orderly disciplined life he had always known would continue again without him  The life where nothing was ever unexpected  or inconvenient  or unusual  The life without color  pain  or past   Not sure I understand the ending  How did Jonas know the sled would be there  He tells Gabriel that he remembers this place  that it s a memory of his own  Is it from a memory the Giver gave him   I had read this book once before in the 5th grade so I knew the basic time line of the story  But after reading it again with a more knowledgable mind  the experience was 100  more interesting  Jonas an 11 year old boy lives in a world of sameness  No one is unique  everything is controlled  At the ceremony of 12 he and his peers receive their life long jobs  Jonas however gets the job as the receiver  in which he receives all the memories from the past  from The Giver  Memories the government doesn t want the people of his world to know about  These memories lead to rebellion against government and a dangerous quest to give the memories back to the people  I really enjoyed reading it a second time because the first time I wasn t always quite tuned in on what was happening  But this time each and every detail really had time to sink in and they really made an impact on the experience of reading the story  I give it five stars because it teaches a few important messages  One  people need to be different  have there own thoughts  own desires  own choices  If we were all the same  why even have a name  It also teaches that the government owes us freedom and is telling the audience that we need to let them know that we are our own people  We all handle bad memories in our own ways but there is no need to run for them  This book made feel emotions  and REALLY think about the future  About how it is a duty to keep peace and order  but to give the people freedom  It made me wonder   Is this my tomorrow   It made me wonder   Is this right   It made me wonder how will my society be shaped one day  It taught me that it is our governments job to keep us under and out of their control  Jonas lives in a society where sameness is required  When Jonas turns sixteen  he is assigned to the job of the receiver  This job requires him to receive the knowledge of the world before it switched to sameness  Once Jonas starts receiving these memories from the Giver  he learns that the government is hiding things from the people  One of these things is death  Once Jonas s father is forced to take care an infant  Gabe  who will be released  killed  if he does not calm down  To save this baby and his community  Jonas runs away with Gabe to the outer edge of the community  Through his journey  he finds himself  and helps other to learn of the past world   I loved this book  This has been my favorite book since sixth grade  Lowry does an amazing job with character and story development  She also uses great imagery that keeps you wanting to read  There is nothing bad I can say about this book  AMAZING   Jonas lives in a world of Sameness  There is nothing to differentiate one person by the other  everything is seen in black ad white with each year relinquishing a little of the individuality you possessed  following like a group of Lemmings  At your 12th year  you are given your assignment  and begin your training to contribute to the community  Jonas is given the responsibility of Receiver  the holder of all the world s memories before Sameness came into being  Jonas learns the burden of carrying around thoughts of war and starvation  but understands the benefits of things like colors  and sled rides  Soon he learns due to others oblivion he will always be an outsider with his new found wisdom and wonders how long he can last    For the first time  he heard something that he knew to be music  He heard people singing  Behind him  across vast distances of space and time  from the place he had left  he thought he heard music too  But perhaps  it was only an echo  And so the story ends  with the question of  was this Jonas  death or his savior  Does Jonas make it to Elsewhere or is it only a dream  There are many themes throughout The Giver  but I think the most obvious and stand out is what if  This society is so closed minded that it is hard to fathom their inability to learn and look beyond to the bigger picture rather than just their sector  What if such a mask was to occur and wipe to a clean slate  True  we could do away with so much hate and hardship but is the risk worth it  or is it better to learn from our mistakes  That s the question I believe Lowry is asking This was one of my favorite books growing up  I think because it was unlike anything I had read before  Even now  10  years later it leaves as just as large an impression  Perhaps The Giver is like a bottle of good wine  it just gets better with age  The Giver a community that follows Sameness  until a boy is chosen for a job that changes his life and the community s  This book is fiction and what I like about it is that it leaves off on a cliffhanger in which the author lets the reader decide what happens to Jonas  In my perspective  my favorite part of the book is when Jonas gets selected as the new receiver  and this reminds me of the book Divergent when Tris is told that she is Divergent  I would recommend this book to people who like adventure  action and drama   When I first saw the cover of this book I thought that it was not interesting but decided to read it At first I thought it was kind of weird how these people have no freedom and live in a society that is ruled by elders and they make your decision for what your job is going to be based on who you are even though you don t agree on it and you feel like thats not the job for you They tell you who your going to marry even though you don t like that person They control everything about you and you can t say or do anything about it  Jonas a yong boy reached 12 years old and is going to be assigned a job at that age At first he doesn t know what the job is  but is soon to find that he is the reciever of memories and can t share any secerts with anyone On the other had his parents have to take care of baby Gabriel and if he is not better soon they will have to get rid of him what the elders want and for me this is really said Jonas doesn t like the enviroment he lives in he wants to feel free  to live in a place that is normal and he escapes with baby Gabriel  To find out more you should definitly read this book  you will not regret it  Reread for book group  Loved it every bit as much as the first time   The way I see the community is a peaceful and non harmful place  The main character Jonas is a normal boy who is chosen out of all the new 13 s to become the new receiver which is the most important job in the community  As the new receiver for his community it is important that he knows the memories of the old painful world our world today   as Jonas continues his training he must make the most important chose of his life  When he didn t hear his number called he was worried  As soon he found out his job for the community he was in shock no one knew what the receiver did only that they helped the community  On his first day he only knew where would go everyday  when he meet the receiver he told him his job  As weeks went by he would notice differences in the world around him   One day his father brought home a baby for them to hold on to because he had night terrors  soon it was Jonas that could keep him calm during the night  One night he herd that they were going to  release  him  Just from hearing that he has to make biggest choice of his life   This semester I was having trouble picking out a book so I thought I would re read one of my favorite books  The Giver  by Lois Lowry shows us another way of living  Where the people can t feel anything  choose their family or career  people basically have their lives planned out for them  Until Jonas gets the career as  the receiver   then his whole world changes  I like this book so much because I like escaping my world and discovering new ones  I like Trying to imagine what it would be like to live in a society like Jonas s  When he turns 13  everyone gets assigned a job to pursue  He gets named   the receiver of memory   Everyone  including him was shocked by that title  Little by little  he started receiving memories of how their town used to be  Knowing everything about this outside world I think puts him in a depression  at least that s how I saw him towards the end  While he experiences good feelings like family and love  he also experiences bad things like sunburns and war  This next quote is him  Jonas  expressing his feelings to his baby brother   I liked the feeling of love    Jonas  confessed  He glanced nervously at the speaker on the wall  reassuring himself that no one was listening   I wish we still had that   he whispered   Of course   he added quickly   I do understand that it wouldn t work very well  And that it s much better to be organized the way we are now  I can see that it was a dangerous way to live      Still   he said slowly  almost to himself   I did like the light they made  And the warmth    After he said these things he left town  not sure where he was going  but he had to leave  Everything was messing with his head  Then  as he was riding away on his bike  the book ends  I personally hate when books leave you hanging  forcing you to infer what is going to happen  I still haven t come up with where I think Jonas went or what happened to him  Did he and his brother make it somewhere safely  If so  what are the norms in the new place they re living in   I can t help but think of all the conflicts that come with living in a society like this one  What happens if you don t like the job you are stuck with  What if people stopped taking their pills  then started feeling feelings  While reading this book  I constantly ask  what if  questions  This is one of those books you will never know how it will end  Overall  I give this book 5 out of 5 stars I really like this book  I read this and another book called Number the Stars by Lowry in 5th grade  almost nine years ago now  and it was great to revisit it  I was encouraged to pick it up after seeing the movie was being released  Lowry s writing takes me into the world of her character and triggers me to think in a different way  I love the concept of this book  the sheltered community  this boy Jonas seeing outside of  sameness  for the first time  I wish I understood the greater metaphor and theme for this book if there is one though  Maybe with some thinking or possibly picking it up again in another nine years  I ll have an even greater understanding  The Giver by Lois Lowry is a great book  I like this book and the characters  I just wish they were more developed  The story line is great and very interesting  As soon as I started reading it  I was hooked  In the book  this futuristic society has almost no conflict at all  Things like war  pain  and hate have been removed  but at the cost of things like love and color  Jonas  a boy that is chosen as the receiver of memory  keeps all the memories of past societies   learns much  Later on  Jonas dislikes the ways of the society and wants to have everything back to normal  He plans with the Giver to find a way to bring everything back to normal  My favorite part of this book is When Jonas starts seeing color  The popular young adult fiction these days involves Dystopian societies and so it would seem that I have binged a bit in that area  When our book club decided to do The Giver  I almost didn t read it  I wasn t sure my brain would want to read another one  but the shortness convinced me it could be done  I am glad I read it and am only beginning to see the layers  I do like the idea of a story that is based in a society that doesn t want it s members to feel pain  with the exception of the disciplining wand  It begs the question what would you give up so you didn t have to hurt  In the quest to avoid these hurts we might lose what brings us our most joy  Provocative  Innovative  and Beautiful  The society is creepy and a little too  advanced  for my liking so as to exclude feelings and emotional connections  I think it s an interesting measure to take in order to control people  but having the  giver  of memories  emotions and all the wonderful things that humanity can bring  calls into question how far will this society go  The book speaks to me on many levels of symbolism as well as plot  As I reader I enjoy being able to make connections and decipher important elements that foreshadow later events and this book is full of them without being a mystery  This book was one of my favorite book club picks  It generates SO MUCH great discussion  Although generally shelved in the teen section  this is a great book for 7th grade and up   I read it a looooonnnng time ago  8th grade   but I remember it fairly well  It really had an effect on me  I remember it as awesome    5 stars      Wow  This book has blown me away  It was the first book I have ever read in one sitting and I am so proud of myself The giver is such an unique and fast read with a few unexpected twists that I couldn t lay it down until I finished it  I absolutely adore Lois Lowry s writing style  It is so funny and fast and the world she creates makes you appreciate your own  happy life The main character Jonas was so adorable  I love the fact that this is one of the first books I have ever read in which the main characters aren t like 17 years old  There are also a bunch of side characters I absolutely adore I wish there was a sequel because I really need to know the ending  Normally I love books that end like in the middle of the story because I like to imagine my own endings BUT in the Giver I really need to know what happens to the main characters after the book ends  I won t write any spoilers  but why couldn t Lowry just write a sequel or add some pages to the Giver  Obviously I got my own theories about the ending but still   I gave this book 5 5 stars because it made me cry and laugh at the same time and I had a great time reading it  I finished this book in one sitting  It is a page turner that shows the importance of cultural memories  I am actually a little sad that I didn t read this book sooner   First Read  who knows when Second Read  Feb 12  2014Third Read  Dec 7  2015 When I read the description on the back  I realized that I might have read this book before  It might have been back in 2003  a year I was so busy reading many short books like this one  However  I couldn t remember what it was about except bits and pieces about the ability to see in colours  But  when I was finished  I was sure that it was one of my favourite books back then and I was as impressed with it as I am now   This book was interesting because Jonas a boy who lives in an almost robotic community is getting to feel feelings in depth for the first time Jonas was selected as the receiver of memory As the last receiver Jonas was shocked and scarred Lois Lowry makes the reader imagine a world with no feelings no and no color When Jonas is picked for the receiver of memory Jonas was already starting to see colors something he had never see before  As Jonas starts to see more colors he starts to understand what the job receiver of memory is for When Jonas finally understands he cannot live with no one feeling love for him or one another Is Jonas going to do something about this or let every one stay how they are never able to feel happiness pain or see colors An injustice in The Giver was none of the citizens got to make any choices for them selves When they put on their tunics they should be able to choose if they want a blue tunic or a red one Finally Jonas has had enough He and the Giver make a plan for Jonas to escape with all the memory The Giver has transfered to him  This book is about a boy named Jonas who lives in a perfect  serene community  He is cared for always  given whatever his body needs and constantly discussing his emotions and needs with his family  The community is there for him  no matter what  It will even choose the perfect job or spouse for you  This story is about when Jonas is chosen to be The Receiver by the all knowing leaders of the community  The Giver  who is the current receiver  gives all of his memories to Jonas  These memories contain color  music  love  pain  fear  holidays  and war  They hold everything that the current generations are deprived of  And these memories and experiences make Jonas into something other than what he was  So all my life I have seen The Giver on book shelves and never investigated it  I knew that it had been around for a long time and I also knew that it was really popular  I never knew how good it would be  I loved this book  It was quiet slow paced and I didn t particularly enjoy that aspect of it  but that was simply necessary  I was pleased with the easy way it was written  how it seemed to flow  Can t wait to pick up the next one some day   Book Title  the giverAuthor  Lois LowryReview  i loved the book THE GIVER because it is about a kid named jonas gets chosen to be the receiver of memories  on the first day he gets his first memory of snow and a sled  the main characters are Jonas and the giver and his mom and dad  i would recommend the book because it has a lot of action and drama   The giver The giver is about a 11 year old boy who lives in a dystopian future where everyone is equally and the same to prevent all war hatred and Violence  There is no prejudice since everyone looks and acts basically the same and there is very little competition  Everyone is unfailingly polite  The society has also eliminated choice at age twelve every member of the community is assigned a job based on his or her abilities and interests  When their children are grown family units dissolve and adults live together with Childless Adults until they are too old to function in the society  Jonas lives with his father a Nurturer of new children his mother who works at the Department of Justice and his seven year old sister Lily  I the beginning of the book Jonas is turning 12 so he will be in the ceremony of the 12 s this year  At the ceremony Jonas is called last and he gets the receiver of memories later Jonas meets his trainer  His name is the giver and he was the old receiver of memories and over time he teaches Jonas things no one else in the town can see memories of what life use to be  I think this was a great book because it had a good story and a good between the characters I give it                  The Giver was about a boy named Jonas who lives in a society where there is no choice and are assigned jobs of interest or ability based  Jonas is assigned to the occupation of Receiver of Memories and while on this occupation he discovers the deep secrets of his bland society  I personally thought the book was great to read because it gave me a whole new perspective on how some societies could end up being after I m gone from this earth  I didn t neseccarily like the way the author wrote it  but the story of the book was great  Great  pretty short  well written  Great atmosphere  Haunting   Lois Lowry s purpose for writing The Giver was to entertain readers with an imaginative story about a dystopian world lacking things such as color  sorrow  joy  pain  and love through the perspective of a twelve year old boy named Jonas  This novel was written in the point of view of third person omniscient  This allows the reader to understand how Jonas feels  despite whether he says it aloud or not  Lowry wrote this novel for an audience who enjoys reading about futuristic societies and dystopian worlds  as well as someone who is very family oriented and values morality  One theme of The Giver is the importance of memory  In the society that Jonas lives in  all memories of the past have been erased  Only one person is allowed to possess all these memories and that is the Receiver  When he turns twelve  Jonas is chosen to be the new Receiver  Once he experiences all the things through memory that society no longer has  he realizes how bland his life had been  Talking about Jonas  Lowry writes   They were satisfied with their lives which had none of the vibrance his own was taking on  And he was angry at himself  that he could not change that for them   Lowry 108   He never thought life was boring before because that s all he had ever known  It s like if people don t have the memory of pain  it s almost as if they had never experienced it This novel is a narration  Lowry shares many details included in the course of Jonas  day to day life  The story is told in chronological order and I think that best depicts the experience Jonas goes through as he becomes the Receiver of Memory  giving the reader a better understanding of how emotional it must be for him  One example of why I know The Giver is a narration is when Lowry writes   Suddenly he perceived the word for it  sunshine  He perceived that it came from the sky   Lowry 107   In this excerpt  the reader can imagine the process Jonas is going through to understand new memories I thoroughly enjoyed this novel and I would really like to see the movie now  The author provided the reader with a deep understanding of the up and down emotions that Jonas went through at such a young age  The conclusion of the novel was very open and optimistic  giving the reader room to make inferences about what could possibly happen next  Personally  I like novels more if they have a more solid ending  so this closing was not my favorite  However  I cannot think of anything else I disliked about the writing or the storyline  Another novel that I could compare to this one would be 1984 by George Orwell  Both are dystopian novels in which the protagonist tries to change society   Publication  1993Grade Age  Grades 5 8Annotation  Taking place in a utopian

 Giver   Jonas suggested   you and I don t need to care about the rest of them  The Giver looked at him with a questioning smile  Jonas hung his head  Of course they needed to care  It was the meaning of everything   Such a great book  with a very powerful message   I really liked the giver  it was a good reminder of how much I value free will and all the small things that people take for granted everyday for example the ability to actually read a book  I also like how it makes people think about the end of the book  spoiler alert  when he reaches the cabin after he wakes up after he passes out  if he is dead or the memories he received actually exist still  Another good part of the book was the theme that society is supposed to be perfect but it s not and the reader realizes that no matter how hard people try there will be flaws  Also I liked that nobody knew that they were killing babies and the elderly and only the giver and Jonas did so it made me want to rip my hair out because people just didn t understand what is wrong   But there were somethings I didn t like in the book as well  For one thing I wished he had gone through more memories because I think it would have added more detail to the story and made it But other than that I really loved the book and I m looking forward to reading the others in the series as well  And if someone would ask me if I would recommend it   I would do it in a heartbeat  I really liked the concept of this book  it was very thought provoking and it made me think about  what if today s society grew up with out seeing colors or didn t know or get to experience love at all  I could not fathom not getting to enjoy the colors that I love or to get to love someone or even know what that feeling is  it would just be awful  I liked the main character Jonas because he was only a child and they gave him the hardest job in the community Even just the thought of a little twelve year old going to a ceremony and having a job picked for them for practically the rest of their working lives seemed crazy to me   I felt bad for the twelves because they don t have any choice in the matter of where they will work  I felt bad for Jonas because his job was the worst one of them all  The Memory Receiver  it seemed difficult for him and it was to receive memories from The Giver and experience all of the things that he didn t know existed memories feelings  and colors and it seemed tough for a twelve year old to take let alone an adult I would have been like Rosemary and ending up giving up the position   yet I would never be able to have the courage she did with being released   While on the released topic that honestly shocked me while the dad had to see which twin was heavier and keep that one  and release the other one into a supposed other community when Jonas watched as his own father kill the other twin  My heart broke and it made me kind of sick to be honest To think of today being like that would be a nightmare and I was glad this was fictional  Then when The Giver and Jonas came up with a plan I was thrilled because I was really wanting the community to get the memories feelings  and colors back  Then when Jonas dad made the decision to release Gabriel I was sad for him  but later happy when I read that Jonas took the baby and made the escape earlier than expected  I am for sure going to read the other books in The Giver Quartet because I want to find out what happens next  This book was a fast read and I enjoyed it immensely   Twelve year old Jonas lives in a very orderly community  Everything happens in stages  Dreams are discussed at breakfast  Emotions after dinner  At at 9 you get a bike  at 12 you start training for your career  But when Jonas starts training with  the giver  the veil on his world is pulled back and he learns the true price of his supposedly peaceful community The Giver was the dystopian ya novel before dystopian ya novels were hip  I missed this book as a kid  but I ve been hearing a lot about it lately After reading it  I realize how big a debt Veronica Roth s Divergent owes this book and Lauren Oliver s Delirium as well The difference with The Giver is Lowry s writing mastery  The Giver s premise is revealed in a way that makes you walk in Jonas  shoes  You see the beauty and the logic as well as the horror of the dystopia he lives in  While the more modern dystopias sometimes skimp on explanation  the world in The Giver is very fully imagined  and therefore  seems more plausible The Giver is a bit slower in pace  and since Jonas is only 12  the perspective is more innocent than something like Divergent  but make no mistake  this is a hard hitting dark  dystopian novel  one that really speaks to that startling time in life when you first realize that the world is not what you thought it was  The Giver has always been one of my favorite books  I cannot say whether this is a dystopian society  or a utopian society  because everyone is only kept in ignorance  and one the Giver and Jonas know what the community is missing  It starts out life as normal  Jonas only nervous because he doesn t know what his assignment will be  He is chosen to be the new receiver of memory  Memories are happy  painful  and some so full of sorrow  However  these memories give Jonas emotions  like love  and let him see colors  He never knew how much everyone else was missing out on  He and the Giver decide the community needs to be made whole  and the devise a plan to ultimately take the community out of the state of sameness they had been living in from back and back and back  I love this book  It makes me have a whole new appreciation for what blessings I have  I can feel  hear music  see colors  make choices  feel love  have a family  and all of those wonderful things that we all take for granted  What if they were taken from us  I wonder how the people felt when they were first having all these things taken away  Did they like it  The community is peaceful  but I feel like I would be like Jonas and feel as though there was something lacking  Excellent read  I recommend to all  no language  no sex  no anything explicit  welcome to all  Just be warned  you will feel differently about your life   but in a good way   The book is about a boy named Jonas who lives in a society where your career is chosen for you once you reach  year 12   Jonas has finally reached year 12  and is very anxious about what career he will be given  Very unexpectedly Jonah receives a rare career of the Receiver  Throughout the rest of the book  His  boss   the Giver  teaches Jonas many things that are truly extraordinary and eye opening for Jonas  This book  written by Lois Lowry  is about a young boy named Jonas who is unlike any of his generation  He has the capacity to see beyond  Jonas is selected to be the next Receiver of his community  He will have to intake many painful memories but he has the strength to get though it  Through the course of a year  he will have to be brave for his community and can never leave   or can he What I love about this book is that Lowry uses so many facts about real life in her novel and that you have to really look hard to find them  The Giver is a great book and I recommend it to anyone who can read between the lines   I did not read this book  but found out  that many people loved this book  and that is amazing  So I read it  and also was amazed  by the book  The Giver  At any time  where I left off  and came back into  I was still stuck to the book  and really enjoyed the storyline  One thing  that really impressed mer  was the character  like the Giver himself  and Jonas  I loved the way they were presented and described throughout the book Characters Like I said previously  I really enjoyed the was the two main characters were presented  Like  right from the beginning  where Jonas had some inner thoughts   It was almost December  and Jonas was begging to be frightened  No  Wrong word  Jonas thought  Frightened meant that deep  sickening feeling of something terrible about to happen  Frightened was the way he had felt a year ago when an unidentified aircraft had overflown the community twice  He had seen it both times  Squinting towards the sky  he had seen the sleek jet  almost a blur  at its high speed  go past  and a second later heard the blast sound that followed  Then  one more time  a moment later  from the opposite direction  the same plane    Lowry  1   As you can tell  this book  was very interesting from the beginning  and I could start to really see what kind of character Jonas is  I also was so amazed by the word choice  and description of each character  and their thoughts  This book really gave me a good time  and made me really enjoy a new world  and the world of Jonas  in which Jonas learns about the true meaning of family  and love  This really made me understand the true meanings of life   I am confident that this is in the top three of my favorite books of all time  I was struck by the characters and drawn in to the storyline  This was the first book that I had read with so many creative and new ideas regarding science fiction  After reading Divergent and The Hunger Games  I came to the conclusion that yes  I enjoyed them  but their themes and events seemed very similar to me and became somewhat monotonous  The Giver was new and exciting and I had no idea what to expect  The ending was what sealed the deal for me  After I read the book  I called a friend and told her what I thought about it  She was shocked at my interpretation of the ending  Neither of us realized that there was more than one way to interpret it  This made the book stick in my head long after I had finished reading it and brought multiple things to mind to contemplate  I would use this book in a classroom because it invites conversation about government control  government secrets  the institution of family  and social freedom  Talking about these issues with students and what they believe is the best way to operate a country and a group of people is important to how they live their life  how they vote in the future  and how they change our society  The Giver does this well  I have read The Giver by Lois Lowry It is a fiction and a science fiction The main characters are Johnas The Giver Gabe Lily Fiona Asher the dad and the mom The book is about a boy who lives in a perfect community were he is given a special job to recive emotions pain and other things that the outside world has and things the community don t have  now his descions can lead to the dimise or the future of the community I would recommend this book to young teens I would recommend this book because this book has alot of twists and turns It also shows what the future may look like I also like this book because of the author who wrote it She is an amazing writer After you read this book you will want to read the other amazing books that she wrote Lois Lowry creates a world so detailed that you almost can see and feel the world That is why I would recommend this book Why recommend it to teens  well because the main characters are teen you might say So what if the main characters are teen You will start to bond with them or say  hey he reminds me of my friend or  she reminds me of my sister that is what i mean Just someone to relate to So for all those teens this is the book to read   I thought the book The Giver was incredible  I loved it so much  It had so much going on  Personally I would want to read the series  It had action  wonder  adventurous  a little romantic  It was an honor to read it  I really liked  It had so much detail and thought  I would probably read it again it was that good to me  It is s little sad I almost cried  I hope you read this book because it is wonderful  I really like how he explained the chaarcters thoughts and how they lived and other things  I loved when the book was sort of in the characters perspective  I think it s a great book to read because I really connected easily to this book  I personally love types of books like this  So I really recommend this one  It had all the things I really truly like in books   I do not have the words to express what this book did to  and for  me  I am so glad my daughter made me read it tonight  She just read it today for her Literature class  Lois Lowry s story  The Giver  is a compelling tale of a boy looking to change a seemingly perfect society  The story revolves around a twelve year old boy  Jonas  who lives with his family in a community where everything is perfectly in order  Rules and organization are part of the regular routine and keeps anything dangerous or unexpected from happening  until Jonas comes along  Jonas  who just turned twelve  recently participated in a ceremony that determined who he would be within the community  This ceremony is where Jonas learns he will be the new receiver  a receiver of past memories that are transported to him from the giver  Throughout the story  Jonas begins to feel the joy  anger and pain that memories such as war  Christmas  and sledding cause  Much of the story relates to the way Jonas feels about these memories and the passion he has in wanting to somehow share these memories with the rest of the community  It isn t until Jonas runs away  in hopes of protecting young Gabriel  that he is able to fully experience the memories he has received  I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it to sixth graders and up  It was a pretty basic read but I think anyone younger would not be able to fully understand the situation within the book  The book is also from a younger viewpoint but I do not think that effects the way older readers read it  The Giver is one of the most esoteric books I have ever read  This novel takes place on a futuristic  community  where individuality does not exist  Every single citizen of this community is equal  people live the same  act the same  and is  assigned  their duties  In other words  the world in The Giver is perfect  Jonas  an eleven year old boy  is about to get assigned his duty in Ceremony of Twelve  Now Jonas is about to face a new life  a life he was meant to live and accomplish  When the ceremony comes  Jonas gets assigned as  the receiver of memory   This job is strenuous and mentally difficult  for Jonas has to receive memories that he has never even dreamed of  Every time I read this profound book  I understand it a little more  Lowry really emphasizes individuality and creativity in this book  I gave this a five star because this book really displays a strong comparison between our current society and Jonas s community and makes the readers understand how lucky we are to live in a society where each individual is respected  Also  I really like the original plot  I think this book would be suitable for readers over 12 because it does involve some aspects of psychology   I m not pretentious enough to believe that my opinion matters when helping others choose what to read or what not to read  I found this book quite remarkable  so much so that I m considering giving it a second read  If you base your decision on the opinions of others you re selling yourself short  Read the synopsis  read a sample chapter  watch the book trailer  Decide for yourself  otherwise you ll be missing out on many potentially life altering books simply because someone else didn t identify with it the way you or another reader could  Are they the same those who know and those who know not those who can see and feel and those who cannot Jonas is apparently living in a utopia a world that has no conflicts and everyone is living peacefully with each other but what is the cost of this peace as Jonas meets The Giver he starts to understand what lies under the surface and he begins to doubt the very invincible system of their community I totally loved The Giver I got more and more into the story as I went on I could feel the protagonist as he kept fighting and going through all the sufferings of loneliness his courage to go on fascinated me all the way it was amazing to see how a boy reaches wisdom in a world with no knowledge and no memory about their past while escaping the real pleasures of life conflicts have to be there until every single person gains wisdom and to accomplish that goal you have to go through everything and forfeit your very own life  I think I am one of the few people who did not read this in school  I loved it   It is a very different take the perfect world  I would actually like to read the second and third book in the series now   The Giver is an eye opening piece of children s literature  One might be able to compare it to currently popular titles such as The Hunger Games  This book also reminds me very much of my favorite book  Brandon Sanderson s Warbreaker  Lois Lowry presents a  utopian society  in which there is nothing to worry about because everything is set for you  Your job  family  and even personal belongings are things that everyone is assigned  There are no choices to be made  meaning there is no freedom to be had  Jonas is a boy who starts to see the flaws within this society through becoming the receiver and starts to break through the system    This book received a Newberry Medal for the most distinguished contribution to American Literature for Children and I think it deserves it  The Giver is news that stays news  When reading you automatically see this society as the future  Everyone has wondered what it would be like to not have to worry about anything regarding how to make a living and live a peaceful life and having a perfect life  The Giver presents this  perfect  world to the reader and brings out it s flaws  Showing that really it isn t what you want    However this book really is about the importance of human interaction  This topic is something that Lois Lowry likes to focus on and it presents itself to children in The Giver  Children will most definitely be able to see the problems with a utopian society such as this but what they will focus much more on are the human interactions in that world and how everything seems like a lie and very much unlike their own  It s a scary world in The Giver  This book teaches  through showing them how the world shouldn t be  the importance of history  friends  family  and love  For without those things they cannot see the beauty of the world around them   I think the author s arguments were very clear throughout the novel  In the beginning her directions were a bit confusing because of how everyone was the same  but you later realize she is proving a point  A point on what life would be like if every person functioned the same exact way  and thought life was just this perfect thing  As of internal and external character development I beyond think the author did a great job  For example toward internal Jonas had to cope with learning all these new emotions and things  As external It would be when he was finally embracing what life truly did mean  Coming from a person who doesn t really like to read the author did an amazing job at the word choice and structure of the novel  making even me want to read more I would say the author of the giver was both a harsh critic and a compassionate mentor  Their tone could have led to either which way  maybe favoring the harsher side more  It was slightly harsh because of the powerful words and visions between Jonas and the giver  This is because the author was proving a very vivid tone while appealing to a younger audience  The tone could be compassionate by how she was proving such an awesome point on what it would be like if people were the same  The Giver to me was a very inspirational book because of the meaning that the book actually holds  The meaning being how not everyone in life should be controlled and act the same  for it takes out the richness of true life  I think this book could be appealing to anyone in the age range eleven and up  The Giver proves points that nearly every pre teen and teenager really should know about life   Great book  It raises so many questions  secrets  loneliness  choice  power  compliance  With my general dislove for series or trilogies quadrilogies  Im still expecting to see some answers in the next books  for example  who are the birthfathers  While this book is a classic  this was my first time actually reading this book  While it is clearly a book aimed at young teenagers the story and deeper themes are ones that can easily relate to adult readers as well  The story of Jonas raises some of the issues with the traditional concept of a Utopian society and how the concept of  perfect  and  normality  is not ever truly achievable  If it were  it would be clouded with an underlying shadow of violence and much of the beauty of the world would be lost  My favorite part of this story was through reading  watching the young character Jonas learn that risks must be taken in life in order to create a life that is truly worth living  This has easily become one of my favorite books of all time  I have heard so many positive things about  The Giver  and with the movie coming out I decided it was time to give it a read  So  I went into the book expecting a quick and enjoyable read  however  I did not expect to be as blown away as I currently am  It completely lives up to  and goes beyond  all expectations  it is thought provoking  powerful  inspiring and generally intriguing  I am now hesitant to watch the film adaptation as this book found its way into a very special part of my heart and I don t think I could cope with a poorly adapted film A massive and very deserving 5 5 stars   Spoilers    Oh the giver  I loved this book because it was really easy to imagine in my head  But when i started to talk to people  there was alot of different perceptions  This book makes you think about how good we have it  It shows that we have alot more freedom  Even though this is a fiction book  you can imagine this happening somewhere else  Just like the hunger games it is about a dystopian  opposite of utopia  city  But instead of people being killed it is about a boy  also called the receiver  taking all of the bad memories in the world so the rest of the city doesn t have to know how bad it could be  But when the boy realizes there are also good things about the memories he is receiving he wants to lash out  and The giver helps  If the receiver leaves the town line the memories that the giver gave him will be released for the whole city to start remembering  The only thing i didn t like about this book was the ending  but no one enjoys a cliffhanger   Where to begin   It begs the question on if it is a dystopian or utopian society  I m not going to spoil anything because I believe this is a must read  I m currently on the fourth book and I believe people need to read the following books as well  Lois Lowry really takes you in different directions and is always presenting something new  I can predict a lot of it but that s because it is exactly where I wanted it to go  It s a good series to reflect and compare and contrast our way of living to theirs  Recensione pubblicata su Cronache di BetelgeuseJonas e solo un ragazzino di 12 anni  ma leggendo la sua storia  dimostra una maturita incredibile  Cresciuto in un mondo senza emozioni  quando capisce cosa si sta perdendo dalla vita  fa di tutto per riuscire a comprendere queste sensazioni misteriose  E  molto coraggioso  nell affrontare l ignoto che lo aspetta  ma non si lascia scoraggiare perche ritiene che sia fondamentale portare a termine l obiettivo che si e imposto La sua societa e tremenda  le famiglie non esistono  l amicizia sembra essere presente  ma e priva della confidenza e dell intimita presente nei rapporti reali  L amore stesso e bandito  una parola senza significato che non evoca nessun sentimento  Ovviamente questo cambiamento ha portato a eliminare qualunque forma di conflitto  poiche non si ha nessuno stimolo interiore per trasgredire alle regole  Bisogna adattarsi completamente al sistema e  quelli che si discostano  fanno una brutta fine  senza che si provi il minimo rimorso a uccidere una persona perche non e utile alla societa Jonas scopre suo malgrado quanto sia difficile ribellarsi  il tutto per offrire alle persone a lui care un futuro migliore  Gli insegnamenti del donatore  chi costudisce tutte le esperienze passate  non solo gli fanno vedere i sentimenti positivi  ma anche quelli negativi  Sara proprio da quelli che Jonas capira l importanza di non ripetere gli errori del passato  ma per questo e giustificato il comportamento che sta adottando la sua societa L ansia che si avverte e crescente e aumenta con ogni nuova scoperta di Jonas  Si allontana sempre di piu dalla sua famiglia e dai suoi amici  che non riescono a capire il suo comportamento  Il divario che li separa e enorme  lui non puo sopprimere cio che prova  come fanno quelli che lo circondano Il finale e terribilmente aperto  puo essere interpretato sia come ottimista sia invece sotto un profilo piu pessimista  The Giver by Lois Lowry depicts a futuristic society which has succeeded in creating nearly perfect uniformity between all of its members  Although people still work at a variety of jobs based on their personal vocation  everything from the weather to procreation is centrally managed by the government  Sameness and conformity are the mantras of the society  while non conformists and the aged are  released  permanently from the world  Despite their efforts to create utopia  there are still moments when the ideal society encounters unexpected circumstances  requiring them to draw on the lessons of history  These memories are exclusively held by one person  the giver The parallels to contemporary society are legion  From Common Core curriculum in education to climate change to strident criticisms of a multitude of gaps between various sub groups in society  sameness is a central objective in 2015  If the current diversity  ills  of society were to be mended  there would be   Consistent  moderate climate temperatures  without fluctuations  No wealth gaps  No differences in educational achievement  No social classes  No racial differences  No gender differences  No conflicts  No prisons  No unemployment  No substance abuse  No sufferingIn short  the Giver depicts a version of society which would seemingly please many idealists in 2015  Despite the pristine order of the centrally planned utopia  the protagonist comes to the conclusion that perhaps the serendipity  joys and miseries of freedom are preferable to planned perfection  Life is richer with its inherent stark contrasts  the full color of life is preferable to monotonous monochrome This is a timeless classic because it speaks to the idealists of every age  If we could eliminate misery  injustice and inequality  would we simultaneously eliminate joy  love and compassion  We must each answer this question for ourselves  and this book helps to frame the question  The quixotic ending punctuates this dilemma While the book is more nuanced than the recent movie  the screenplay is remarkably true to the spirit of the original  Both are highly recommended for any one seeking the meaning of life  I don t know what I was expecting but it was definitely not this  It was so easy to read and so short that it could fool you  But oh  this book contains great things  It makes you  step by step  reflect about memories  the past and how we need to learn from it  A very good book that honestly deserves all of the awards given to it   Interesting short read about a kind of dystopian future where life is secure and bland  Perhaps  most interestingly compared to other books like 1984 or Brave New World  the author doesn t include a menacing and evil entity  Rather she works with the premise that variety and passions cause pain and the best way to decrease pain is to limit such things  I can t say much without too many spoilers  but I ll say that the author did a good job with the main character Jonas  transformation in this book  As the book progresses you get a whole new look at the world this people inhabit  The giver is a wonderful book for middle school students  The giver is written from the point of view of Jonas  who is an eleven year old boy  The young boy lives in a society where all pain and far are eliminated  There is no competition because everyone is basically the same in Jonas s society  Also the society eliminated choice  so when your twelve years old you are assigned a job based on your abilities  When you re allowed to get married you get assigned a spouse  When you want children  you get to have only two  This society that Jonas lives in is very controlled and organized  Everything is planned so that life is as peaceful and enjoyable as possible  This book is written about a society that actually isn t real life  I think that this book is very interesting and intriguing  I think students would enjoy this book and teachers should read it to their stories   This is a story that is set in a perfect world where there is no sickness  no rudeness and no war  Jonas lives there and is chosen to be the Receiver which is a great honor because the Receiver receives the memories that the Giver holds for the community  As Jonas and the Giver begin to share the memories Jonas begins to see color and to see the world as it really is without the perfection  Fighting between what he has always known and what he is learning  Jonas has to decide how to make a difference in this world and how to save the ones he loves  which is a new found feeling that he is slowly beginning to understand  I really enjoyed this book because the story and world were just so inviting  Not saying that I want to live there  but I do think that it was a different spin on a dystopian novel  I definitely would recommend this book to others because it is such a good story that teaches you to fight against the injustices in your life  I think that there is no real age group for this novel because the writing is fairly simple and the content can be either deep or simple  depending on the reader   Way before The Hunger Games  there was The Giver  It s one of the first and most popular young adult novels on a futuristic  dystopian society and after reading it  I see why  A very short read  The Giver describes a society where people feel no pain  no fear and they are all at peace  Everything is decided for them  their career  their partner  their children    When Jonas turns 12  he s not assigned a career like the other children but instead is selected to be the next Receiver  The Giver is to provide him with all the memories of the past generations and this process is an eye opener for Jonas  I can t say more without spoilers so I ll just say I really  really liked this book  I just found out yesterday that after almost 20 years  Lois Lowry has just published the sequel to The Giver  She previously published two other books  Gathering Blue and Messenger  that were partially related to The Giver  but Son is the direct sequel to The Giver and I can t wait to read it  I remember reading this novel for the first time in sixth grade and just being blown away by it  Eight years later  I read  The Giver  again and I loved it just as much as I did the first time around  It s about a black and white world where people are forbidden from feeling  The rules and the system in that world is guaranteed to trip you out  Although it s fairly easy to read  it remains a classic in my heart and it always provides plenty food for thought and conversation stimulation   What I thought of this book The Giver is a thoughtful story that reflects on real issues of humanity  The telling of this story is unique in it s way of revealing the setting  The information is revealed to the reader as the main character collects more information about the past  The story is conveyed beautifully  and leaves the reader sadly satisfied  It evokes emotion from the reader in a pleasant way  which makes this book spectacular  It is quite clean  that only talks about one death of a baby  which can be a bit disturbing What this book is about The Giver is a story set in the future  where everything is calm and orderly  Everyone in this community speak with perfect honesty  and conduct themselves with utmost civility  Jonas has just become a Twelve  and must now be given his career that he will have for the rest of his life  When he receives his career it is something that no had seen in a decade  something that was very rare  When he begins training  he finally knows the injustices his perfect community has committed  Three major themes in The Giver are  growing up  pain or pleasure  individual versus society  and love and sacrifice  Growing up  pain or pleasure appears many times  early on in the novel   It was almost December  and Jonas was beginning to be frightened   Lowry 1   This quote is referring to the upcoming ceremony of twelve that Jonas was scared of   He felt  surprisingly no fear  nor any regret at leaving the community behind   205   This quote shows that Jonas loathed the community so much  he left it without even thinking twice   He hugged Gabriel and rubbed him briskly  warming him  to keep him alive   224   This quote exemplifies how Jonas was willing to save Gabriel at the cost of pain and possibly his life  The most common idea in this novel is change  Whether it s Jonas growing older  or Jonas realizing his community needs to change because it is bland  change is a very recurring idea  The main characters in the book are Jonas and The Giver  Both characters strongly believe that the community s sameness and predictability is not apt for a society and that diversity and uniqueness are required to help a society thrive  In fact  Jonas barely knew of birds before his journey to Elsewhere    After a life of sameness and predictability  he was awed by the surprises that lay beyond each curve of the road   216   Jonas realizes that there is no love and is very encouraged by his thoughts to leave  The Giver further encourages this by helping Jonas make an escape plan from the community Lois Lowry has an exquisite writing talent  The plot lines and how the story all tied in just wowed a reader such as me  For example  the story of the plan was used to describe how Jonas felt about the ceremony of twelve in the beginning of the book  but it was used later on in the book to show the Giver s respect and honor  Lois Lowry composed three other books to form  The Giver Quartet   including Gathering Blue  The Messenger  and Son  Kirkus reviews call it      a richly provocative novel   Kirkus reviews   The New York Times says   Lois Lowry shocked adult and child sensibilities alike with her Newbery Medal winning novel  The Giver    NY Times  Son  by Lois Lowry   It is very agreeable that Lois Lowry  shocked  readers when this book was published  It brought a new perspective of society and changed how look at things today  I personally believe  along with MANY other people  that The Giver is a great novel that highlights utopian and dystopian society s along with advantages and disadvantages of each  why  Every time someone mentions this book  I wonder why I haven t read it yet when  December 2013  I ve been ignoring updating this blog  so I don t have the exact dates  but it only took me three days maybe  how  as an ebook on my iPadthoughts  Great book  I can see why it is so loved by so many  I bought it for my kid for Christmas  her first dystopian novel  She hasn t read it yet  She would have if it were in graphic novel format   review haiku our world but messed updystopias freak me outa few steps away This book was something that I was not expecting because I thought it would be about describing about something that was uninteresting to me  However  I found this book to be very fascinating to me  This novel is about a utopia that slowly forms into chaos and carries lies to keep people from knowing the truth about terrible things  I personally think that this book is outstanding when it was explaining the details  I could just imagine of how the movie is  I also believe that this book is such a mystery once you read it in the beginning and it slowly reveals all of the secrets the community has been hiding  So  I absolutely loved this book and all the high vocabulary used in it  I don t regret giving this a five star rating   This book is about a boy named Jonas  Jonas lives in a community that has tried to make everyone equal and perfect  The community has made everyone color blind  the same race  and even emotionless  Jonas is 11 and waiting to receive his job when he turns 12  He gets the job as receiver of memory and is shocked  A old man that goes by The Giver  must give Jonas memories and tell him how the community was before sameness  Jonas learns disturbing things about his community and what really goes on in it  Now Jonas feels like he must make a change  a big change  A situation in The Giver that shows a injustice is when the community releases baby twins  When a birth mother gave birth to twins  the committee of elders were afraid of over population  They decided that one of the twins would have to be killed   released  The twin that weighs less was expected to grow less so they put it to death  This situation was not resolved  To resolve twin release  the community should make a second area to their community for babies with unexpected births  Half of the community elders and some of the nurtures can also come to the new area to take care of the babies  The release of twins affected Jonas by making him really want to do something when he saw his father releasing a baby  He also realizes that Fiona will be killing old people when they are released  The injustice of release made The Giver realize that it was a good time to tell Jonas about his plan for Jonas to escape  and for him to aid the citizens when the memories come from Jonas like a flood over the people  I recommend this book to readers who enjoy Ray Bradbury s writing style  I would recommend The Giver to them because The Giver has a similar twisted type of style  For example  in The Veldt by Ray Bradbury Peter and Wendy kill their parents like people in Jonas s community do  Wendy  Peter  and Jonas s community both kill people like nothing is happening  The similar types of death make the reader feel spooked when they read both books  If a reader reads The Giver and likes the creepy feeling  they can read a Ray Bradbury story and have the same sensation  The creepy sensation is present in both Ray Bradbury s stories and The Giver because of the abnormal events that seem like nice people wouldn t do   A short book  so I was able to finish it within a few hours  but it is absolutely my favorite book regardless of its length  The way it captures your attention with the details of this alternate world and the way it operates is absolutely fantastic  The emotions it forces from you  from the fear  to the happiness  to the despair and sadness  are more intense than even some of the most emotional books ever written  I would recommend  The Giver  to anyone  However  I would not say this is a children s book  since there are some themes that might be a bit too intense or even confusing for the intended reading age  What  The  Fuck  Also  why hadn t I read this before  A young boy named Jonas lives in a equalized  utopian community where there is no knowledge of love  emotional or physically pain  and his best friends Asher and Fiona and himself are graduating from their childhood  Because of this  he meets an alderman named The Giver  While he visits The Giver  they look at memories of what s not in there community the dystopian life than what they live in  While Jonas shares his memories  he is monitored by the Chief Elder  and gets in trouble  When Jonas visits The Giver one day  he discovers that a infant named Gabriel  will have a forced death by injections  Jonas tries to save him  and try the abilities to see color  pain  and show love  Voila un moment que je veux lire ce roman   On m en a beaucoup parle comme etant LA premiere dystopie pour ado  Comme c est la mode  il a bien fallu trouver le premier  Je ne sais pas ce qu il en est en realite  a vrai dire je m en fiche de savoir s il est le precurseur du genre ou pas  En plus  avant Le passeur  il y a bien eu 1984  Le meilleur des mondes  etc  En tout cas  j avais hate de lire ce roman et je n ai pas du tout ete decue  On est dans un monde futuriste ou la societe a ete totalement uniformisee  Les gens ne peuvent plus faire aucun choix  On decide de leur metier  de la personne avec laquelle ils vont vivre  des enfants qu ils vont adopter  etc  Et bien sur  ca ne les derange pas parce qu ils ne connaissent rien d autre  On annihile leurs hormones avec des pilules pour qu ils ne connaissent pas le desir  ils ne connaissent pas non plus l amour  la procreation est reservee a des femmes designees pour etre mere porteuse  Et quand ils deviennent trop vieux  ou quand ils sont un peu rebelles ou non conformes aux attentes de la societe    bah ils sont    ecartes   Bref  vous avez compris  C est comme ca pour tout le monde  sauf pour une seule personne   le depositaire de la memoire Il n y a plus d histoire et le depositaire de la memoire est proprietaire de la memoire collective  C est assez conceptuel  vous comprendrez en lisant ce roman  mais en gros  le depositaire possede tous les souvenirs de l humanite  ou du moins une grande partie   Il n y en a qu un seul pour la communaute  plus un apprenti  Bien sur  vous comprenez que le personnage principal va etre cet apprenti qui va decouvrir l histoire  les emotions  le Bien et le Mal  Et c est passionnant  J etais frustree a la fin  j aurais aime en avoir plus  Je sais qu il y a d autres tomes  mais ce n est pas la suite direct du Passeur   I want everyone to read this book  The story takes you through a whole new perspective  makes you think and ask yourself questions  like how would you feel if you were in the community within the book  What if you were forced into sameness without even knowing It makes you cherish the details and memories you have Worth rereading every once in a while  ADOREI    Este e mesmo o tipo de distopia que eu gosto  Tem um mundo diferente que nos e explicado de uma forma dinamica e que nao aborrece nada  pelo contrario so da vontade de continuar a ler  Tambem nao tem cenas de guerra  que eu aprecio e quanto menos melhor  E a escrita e muito boa e tambem acessivel  Nao acontece grande coisa no livro mas isso nao me impediu de virar cada pagina com vontade de continuar a aprender mais sobre este mundo  Nao tenho mas palavras para descrever o quanto gostei deste livro mas esta com certeza no meu top deste ano   The Giver  nos situa en una comunidad distopica donde los sentimientos y las emociones estan controladas de manera que las personas no conocen el temor o el amor al mismo tiempo que sus elecciones estan limitadas y  por lo tanto  su vida esta completamente controlada  Creo que la sociedad tal y como nos la presenta el autor esta bien construida y narrada  poco a poco vamos conociendo todos los entramados  organizacion y normas sociales y eso nos va metiendo mas y mas en la historia  De los personajes son muy destacables tanto el protagonista Jonas como el Dador de recuerdos  sus conversaciones eran profundas y hacian evolucionar a Jonas  al mismo tiempo que te dejaban reflexionar El ritmo es bastante acelerado y eso es lo que lo hace tan facil de leer  ademas de sus cortas paginas   Sin duda  entiendo que sea una de las lecturas recomendadas para secundaria en algunos paises  ya que es un libro que invita a reflexionar sobre diversos temas  aunque no entiendo que se catalogara en un principio como un libro para ninos  ya que pienso que ellos no llegarian a captar el mensaje Lo unico que no me ha gustado demasiado es el final que es un poco abierto  pero quizas esto se descubra en el segundo libro  En fin  ahora la espera para la pelicula se hace aun mas corta   Puntuacion final  5 5 The Giver When I started to read The Giver I felt a little bored  but as the book went on I started to get really frustrated because of all the different conflicts that there is in the book  The fact that no one can have any kind of feeling frustrates me a lot because no one could ever have the experience to have any sort of care for other people  When I read that the are couples directed by the community that have to have children all the time  every time they have the tinniest opportunity the have children  and they are the only ones that are allowed to have children because the children they have are not for them  they are to deliver them to the families and they just say   Here  this is your child  take care of him her  These are the kinds of things that really frustrate me from this book  When the Giver talked to Jonas and he already had all this memories transmitted to him  he did not knew what love was  when the Giver talked about love I noticed that he froze  the typical freezing when don t know something  and when he asked his parents if they loved him or not  they said that love is forbidden by the community and all those pointless laws and everything that community says  I personally LOVED reading the The Giver  by Lois Lowry  I had already read it in middle school so I knew the premise of the story  but I thought it was even better reading it for the second time because I was able to point out smaller details and comprehend the bigger meaning even better  I really like the whole concept and setting of the story  a perfect society with no pain or crime  but a colorless society of isolation that deprives the people of color and life experiences  This idea  for some weird reason  was very attractive to me and it caught my attention very quickly  something about the sort of creepy sci fi mood made me want to keep reading   Then there s Jonas  I really like the way the author characterized Jonas and made him seem different from the rest  some people may find his character sort of see through and predictable  but I found it cool to predict how Jonas would think or act  My favorite part of the story was when Jonas  after biking in the blistering cold  actually comes across the sled that The Giver portrayed to him I m the beginning of the story  I thought this was a really good ending  I think part of the reason that I liked the story so much was because I found a connection between The Giver and another series that I love  The Hunger Games series  Something about the futuristic city of Panem and that of The Giver struck me as interesting and addicting  Overall  excellent read  I would highly recommend to anyone  I loved this book  The world created was captivating and the plot kept me hooked till I finished it  This is one of the best books I have read  I am not sure if I want to read the follow up books in the Giver series because there reviews aren t as good but maybe I will     This question I have doesn t concern the book but the movie    why are the actors who play the twelve years old all aged up to early twenties  Also I thought only Jonas  Gabriel  and the giver have light eyes and everyone else are brown but in the movie poster that just came out they are all blue       I m sad now cause Hollywood is going to run another great book        Oh my gosh this was one of the best books ive ever read but the ending is sssoooo sad whats going to happen to gabe and jonas   I hope in gathering blue and all the others there will be more of them  Just reread this before the movie comes out and it s still one of my all time favorites  My only qualms would be that the series didn t continue from the spot it ended and the next books seemed to be only loosely connected  I really wanted to continue Jonas  journey  Did the story come full circle in the 4th book  Anyone know  Also  this book was a little darker reading it with the full knowledge this time  I have ALWAYS wanted this to be a movie though  so I m so excited  loved it just as I did in school     I don t think I ve read The Giver in 20 years  I forgot just how awesome it is  You can so clearly see how much it   Posted by Quirky Bookworm on Wednesday  September 2  2015    I see why this has become a modern classic and is required reading for a lot of high school students  I loved it  I m not really sure how this book is categorized as a children s book seeing as  in my opinion  the plot is a little to advanced for a child to comprehend  With that being said  i do believe this book should be a required read for middle school reading  I believe it could help mold the future adult s morals and ethics and help them to be better individuals  I absolutely loved this book and would recommend it to anyone that I came into contact with  I am just saddened that it took me 30 years to come across this work of art  This was a great book  It brings you into a very different world from our own  but a world that seemed pretty similar at first  Then it strips away the thin layers one by one until you are horrified by the end of the book  It seems so innocent at first as you get to know the characters  Then you slowly discover just how weird the world they live in is  Everything is controlled and regulated  There is no pain and everything works like a well oiled machine in their society  but that s only for the ones who fit in and follow the rules  Everyone else gets released  I wont tell you what that means because wanting to find out was a huge factor pushing me through the story as I read it This is easily one of the most interesting books I ve ever read  The world Lois Lowry creates in this novel is like nothing else I ve ever read  I loved how the world just slowly creeps up on you  The more you read the creepier it is and the more you realize how messed up everything is in the place the characters live  It was a very light easy read but slowly unraveled a complex and cringe worthy story world that leaves you turning the pages faster and faster so you can dive deeper into this world and find out just what the heck is going on I really liked the main character Jonas and discovering the secrets of his world with him as I read through the story  I loved rooting for him and feeling for him  Seeing him react to things that in his society would be unimaginable was awesome  His journey to the truth was a great one to witness  I can t say enough about this wonderful little book and I don t want to spoil any of it so that s where I ll end my review  I was very late to this party  The book seems to have come out the year I graduated from high school  or about 4 years after I probably would have come across it naturally in the last days of my own YAhood  before I returned to reading in the form as an adult  Found it for a quarter at a garage sale last weekend  I m tempted to joke that it s the best quarter I ever spent  but it would also have been the best  insert much larger amount here   This was one of those books where no paragraph or line felt extraneous  and each one built so perfectly to the next  I love how long it takes for the family and community to present as creepy and vile to Jonas  how gradually he arrives at the awareness of how important emotions and extremes are  and how he reaches this conclusion himself  alongside the elderly giver  I loved the details  the gradual  memory  of color  red seeping through first  and the way that there is only one visible act of violence in the whole book  done in such a dispassionate and unthinking way  it s much  much more vile in its banality  It s the rare book that I really think is  ageless   that could appeal as much to a 12 or 70 year old  but this one struck me as one of those books  I read it extremely quickly and then wanted to start right over  to study it as a writer but also just to savor it again  An amazing book  I thought I d read it already in the sixth grade and had hated it  but in fact I d read The Wish Giver and was too scared to pick this book because of the frightening old man on the cover  Now I wish I d had the courage to read it because I wonder what sixth grader me would have thought The story is about a young boy named Jonas who lives in a very orderly world filled with numerous rules for living  As you would expect  the book emphasizes the importance of individuality and choice  but even though this was a bit obviously done  the  Giver  explicitly talks about these things   I was surprised to find that I wasn t annoyed by this all  Actually  Lowry gives her dystopic world some redeeming qualities  which makes you understand why the characters would choose to live in such a way  Of course  the society holds a secret which ends up being pretty horrible  so Jonas can t be happy  but still I also really loved the whole idea of the  Giver  which I feel like I can t talk about without spoiling the book  but the  giving  becomes a method of showing Jonas the flaws in the world which turn out to be pretty surprising My biggest issue with the book  is the ending  I ve read many reviews saying that the end of the book is too quick  and I do agree that there are some pacing issues  But the thing that bothered me more was that I didn t really understand what happened  Now in some ways  this isn t a bad thing  you should be left thinking about a book once it s done  but I kind of wished she had spelled things out just slightly more   Am I allowed to say that  Or does that make me look dumb  Now I m interested to read Gathering Blue  which  thankfully  does not have a scary old man on the cover  On a side note  Lowry s other Newbery award winning book  Number the Stars also has a cover that scared me off  What gives  This book was fascinating by the way it made me visualize everything they were describing or trying to say  I liked the fact that this world makes you in this world feel much smarter because they are in a world where everything seems so perfect  Everything and everyone is the same color  so they don t see actual colorful color as in the world we live in  Their not allowed to use certain words like love  and they have to speak distinct language  They do not know what color is and animals  and you never know if someone is lying to you  I recommend this book to whomever likes to read fantasy type of books and fictional  but really to all  This book will change the way you think and realize things you never thought of  to put yourself in that position  and this book will blow your mind away   The worst part of holding the memories is not the pain  It s the loneliness of it  Memories need to be shared   Memories are forever  worth reading one of my favorite books this year  Taking place in a futuristic  colorless society  Jonas receives a special job which is becoming  view spoiler   the new receiver  Working with the Giver    hide spoiler   he learns more about the society he had learned was perfect  Even without much action  it captivates the readers  It also teaches us the fact that the future might find our everyday life uncertain and unexpected  Some memories that Jonas gains are also taught as history to us  The Giver seems to be giving a constant reminder of what our future might become  I LOVE THIS BOOK  this book was one of my favorite books that we have read as a whole school  i liked this book because it wasn t a super hard read and it was easy to under stand i would recommend this book to all age groups and or grades it was full of mysteries and game changers  every time u think that something is about to happen the opposite happens  i highly recommend this book to everyone  The first time I read this book  it was a couple years ago  It instantly appealed to me and still does now  It s such a simply story of wanting more  When Jonas is exposed to everything that could have been  he feels his life  and everyone else s  are meaningless  Basically  the danger is worth it because it is that freedom and immense risk that makes life worth living  It s such a beautiful message That s pretty much why I love this book so much I do love how it was written so simply  There were no literary tricks or metaphors or crazily profound sentences meant to emblazon the reader  It was just    that s how it is I could read this book over and over again and never get bored  And if you haven t read it yet  go read it  It s a short book so if you love it  yay  If you don t  well it didn t take too long to read it did it Let s see     taps chin  what else do I love about this    I have no idea  You know those books you love just because they re awesome  This is one of those books The Final Verdict Okay  I admit  that wasn t a very cohesive review    but I just love the message this book sends and the simplicity of which it is written 5 starsQuotes  The worst part of holding the memories is not the pain  It s the loneliness of it  Memories need to be shared    We gained control of many things  But we had to let go of others    If you were to be lost in the river  Jonas  your memories would not be lost with you  Memories are forever   For the first time  he heard something that he knew to be music  He heard people singing  Behind him  across vast distances of space and time  from the place he had left  he thought he heard music too  But perhaps  it was only an echo    They were satisfied with their lives which had none of the vibrance his own was taking on  And he was angry at himself  that he could not change that for them    He knew that there was no quick comfort for emotions like those  They were deeper and they did not need to be told  They were felt   It s the choosing that s important  isn t it    The life where nothing was ever unexpected  Or inconvenient  Or unusual  The life without colour  pain or past    Even trained for years as they all had been in precision of language  what words could you use which would give another the experience of sunshine    PLOT   Jonas seems to have the perfect world in the Community  He is turning twelve and is getting ready for the Ceremony of Twelve where he and his friends will finally get their Assignments  The problem is  Jonas is confused and is not sure what he wants for his life  But it seems like the Council of Elders have already laid their plans for them when they selected him as the next Receiver of Memory  the highest honor in the Community  Jonas  as well as everyone else  was shocked by the announcement  But to become a Receiver  Jonas must face all the hardships and pain   physically  emotionally  and mentally  As he trains with  The Giver   he slowly begins to realize what the Community had taken away from its people many years ago  and he plans to change this  SOME QUOTES I LIKED FROM THE BOOK    Sometimes I wish they d ask for my wisdom more often   there are so many things I could tell them  things I wish they would change  But they don t want change  Life here is so orderly  so predictable   so painless  It s what they ve chosen    Memories are forever     They have never known pain    The worst part of holding the memories is not the pain  It s the loneliness of it  Memories need to be shared   PERSONAL COMMENTS   I really love this book  I like the writing style  I have no problem with it being in the third point of view  I can t say much more because I just love it though I didn t like the movie adaptation that much   FINAL RATING  5 OUT OF 5    Jonas lives in a regulated  predictable  colorless world  Language in his world must be precise  meaning that Jonas does not understand the concept of love  When a child turns 12 in Jonas s community  they are chosen for a career that they will serve in for the rest of their lives  Jonas is selected for a very special  honor   but it turns out to be nothing but pain  In the end  Jonas must prove his bravery and strength through a very risky choice   the only choice he has gotten to make in his life  I think it could be interesting  before even introducing the class to the book  to create a classroom of  Sameness  for a day  The children would be treated as a group or community  instead of individuals  They would also be required to use precise language  At the end of the day  children could have an exit activity of writing how they felt throughout the day  and the book could be introduced the next day with a discussion of those feelings  There are also plenty of opportunities for writing prompts with this book  I would like to ask students what job they think they would be chosen for  I would also ask them to choose one memory that they would never want to lose and to describe that memory as vividly as possible   Lois Lowry is the author of  The Giver   a story about a twelve year old boy named Jonas who lives in a community with his parents and his sister  Lily  He was assigned to be The Receiver of Memory  Lois Lowry s book  The Giver  became a quartet of four books   The Giver    Gathering Blue    Messenger   and  Son    The Giver  won the Newbery Medal in 1994  In the book  Jonas has lots of feelings and changes throughout the book  For example   It was almost December  and Jonas was beginning to be frightened  No  Wrong word  Jonas thought  Frightened meant that deep  sickening feeling of something terrible about to happen    Pg 1  Lowry described Jonas s feelings from scared to happy  sad and frightened  Lowry expresses lots of feelings that Jonas felt when he got the memories of sorts of things he never experienced  When The Giver gave him a memory of a hill  a sled  and piles of snow and a memory of a boat sailing in the blue water  He also experiences love and happiness from the memory of a holiday or a birthday party  The Giver had to give Jonas pain because The Giver couldn t take the pain anymore   Sideways  spinning  the sled hit a bump in the hill and Jonas was jarred loose and thrown violently into the air  He fell with his leg twisted under him  and could hear the crack of bone  He face scraped along jagged edges of ince and when he came  at last to stop the lay shocked and still  feeling nothing at first but fear  Then  the first wave of pain  He gasped  It was as if a hatchet lay lodged in his leg  slicing through each nerve with a hot blade  In his agony he perceived the word  fire  and felt flames licking at the torn bone and flesh  He tried to move  and could not  The pain grew    Pg  108 109   There s still more  you can read the book to find out    That part gave me the chills  Lowry described the feeling of that memory when the The Giver gave it to him  He no longer has that pain or memory  but Jonas does  and he felt pain now   My opinion is that  The Giver  is an interesting and a book that makes you want to read more and more  This book to me is a dystopian book because I mean you can t have your own baby or get to name it in Jonas s community  Also  they don t ever get to choose their own JOB  It s just so sad   The Giver  is a great book  That s why it s a Newbery Medal book  Many of you should read  The Giver   It s a story  I mean I can t describe what the book is about  I mean it s like a whole book with genres piled up inside  The end of the book leads you to sit at the edge of your seat until you can find out more    The Giver  is a rare glimpse into a world that Huxley and Orwell imagined in  Brave New World  and  Animal Farm   Although the three are drastically different  the theme of oppression and imagined equality are quite real  The difference with  The Giver  lies within the shared bond between the Giver and the Receiver  Lowry manages to seamlessly attach the reader empathically to several characters  allowing one to become part of a world of sameness  devoid of all feeling  while simultaneously reading with pure human emotion  This volume touches upon gifts bestowed upon us all  the root of all spirituality  the power to see beyond and beneath  and to experience divine love  I never wished for this to end  The need to keep reading beyond what is written is immense  This story is compelling and demands continuation  Excellent  I am very curious what happens in the next book    The main character Jonas lives in a colorless community where there is no warfare  no fighting  all is at peace  as if the world was flawless  All the twelves  which are children that are 12  have to go to a huge ceremony for the community  The twelves walk onto the stage and line up in rows  they pass through all of the but Jonas    they skipped him  But why   Jonas has found that he was chosen to be something unordinary  He was chosen to be the giver  The giver is someone who gives and recieves past memories of  war  love  warmth  and family  Its an honor to be a giver  It shows potential but you are different and separated from the others  During this apprenticeship he goes off to cross the border to free the memories to his community   This book was very nice and full of juice  It had a great punch  and a great adventure to it  At times it was hard to follow from all the things happening at once during this book but overall it was a great story  It had action adventure and it was soothing that I would personally read over and over because its packed with so much punch and flare  I would recommend this book because it had features to it  It kept going and going as if it may seem boring  but all the lines were filled up from all the description  It was something very amusing and always wondering if what will happen next  I will keep reading through the series to see all of the books being put together  and if you think you are going to read it  you should read the rest of the series with me   I re read this for book club and it just reaffirmed why this ranks as one of my top 5 favorite books ever  What a fabulous dystopian novel  before they all became a dime a dozen   This is one of the books that put me onto the genre of post apocalyptic dystopians before they were famous The writing is wonderful  I love the depth of the characters   you feel so deeply for Jonas and the Giver  and in turn feel so empty for the other characters  The story is short  but at the same time it seems so deep  Her ability to create such a meaningful story in such a short time is remarkable  And that this book is accessible to children  teens  and adults is to be lauded  COMPLETELY worthy of the Newbery in my opinion  Two things    I m so nervous about the film  I just hate it when movies ruin books that I love so much and I m afraid this will be that way  Jonas is 12 years old in the book  So  I looked up the cast for the movie and some 20 something guy is playing Jonas  WHAT THE    I think this book should have been left well enough alone and never become a movie    That being said  I ll still see it because I love the book so much Also  I have read the  sequels   except Son   I still need to read that one   And while I liked them and thought they were interesting  I wish they had not been connected to The Giver at all  The ambiguous ending she left for The Giver was extremely meaningful to me  Did Jonas live and find a new place where he could love and live  Or  did Jonas die and sacrifice himself in the quest for a better world  Did he die saving someone he loved  Did he finally find his place of love in the next life  WHO KNEW  It was up to the reader  Why did Lowry have to answer that  She should have left it alone  Sigh      The Giver by Lois Lowry is an intimate and gripping story that will change the way that you think  It s wonderful depictions allow you to sink into the tale  making you feel as though you are experiencing the story for yourself  The book also plays on the reader s feelings  inviting them to know and love the characters as though they were friends with them in real life  Jonas  community is perfect  No pain  no fear  no grief  Yet  there is something missing  Jonas  community cannot see colors  and they have no real feelings  Family and friends do not love each other  and they can t comprehend why something like pain or love or even joy would ever be needed in life  Suddenly  everything changes  At Jonas  twelfth birthday ceremony  he is called to be the next Giver  He will hold the feelings of his generation and many generations before him alone  not able to share his burden with anyone until the next Giver is called many years in the future  Poor Jonas starts to wonder if it is really right to have the memories suppressed from the citizens  Finally  he and the current Giver make a choice and a plan that will affect their community forever This amazing story of a boy who simply wants to have a real family appeals to readers ages 12 and up  It uses a wonderful vocabulary and hides thoughtful and deep ideas between its pages  I feel confident that you will never forget this book and that it will make a positive impact on your everyday life R 2 this book is unbelievable I can t describe it The Giver by Lois LowryThe Giver is a great science fiction book about a boy named Jonas  He has two best friends called Asher and Fiona  He is an eleven  about to turn a twelve  and get s a job  he gets the job of being the Receiver  Being the Receiver is a very important job where Jonas lives  He receives the memories of the past that no one else knows about except for The Giver and The Receiver  From then on he goes to training everyday and receives good memories  and horrifying memories that no one wants to know  He has specific rules that others cannot follow  and knows a lot more facts than anyone else knows about  This book is science fiction because The Giver is in the future using special technology that we don t use today  for example  they live in an environment where they don t have sunlight  and they use medicine so that no one can see colors and so they can never get sick and lots more I can relate the The Giver to the real world now because the Giver contains all the memories  All the happy and kind memories  and all the sad and heartbreaking memories  Everyone in the world has good and bad memories that they can remember doing  An example from the book is when the giver gives the first memory to Jonas  It was an exciting one of him sitting on a sled riding down a mountain of snow  Then Jonas thought it was all good until the Giver gave him an upsetting and heartbreaking memory  It was about a gang of people killing an elephant for its tusks  There was blood all over the elephant  I can also relate The Giver to myself  In the book Jonas was sitting down waiting for his turn to for the Chief Elder to give him his assigned job  He was waiting when suddenly the Chief Elder said Fiona s name who was number nineteen  Fiona came back and then the Chief Elder said number 20  At that moment Jonas realised that he had been skipped  I think that Jonas s feelings were confused and he probably felt left out  Once I was left out in a game  they said that there were too many players so I wasn t allowed to join  I didn t have anyone else to play with  so I sat alone  At that moment I was also confused and I felt left out because I was sitting watching all my friends play An important part of this book is when Jonas get s chosen as a receiver  The reason I think that this is important part of the book is because the receiver is a very  very important and rare job  and Jonas was picked for it  This is the part where the book starts to get exciting because he gets picked for an important job where he will suffer pain  At that part of the book I was very anxious and nervous  I was anxious because he had got this job and I just wanted to know more  I wanted to know why he will suffer pain  and what is this job about  I was nervous because when the Chief Elder said that he would suffer pain  I thought that he would die because of how serious she was  This is a part from the book that shows my point With her hand still firmly on his shoulder  the Chief Elder listed the qualities  Intelligence   she said   We are all aware that Jonas has been a top student throughout his school days   Integrity   she said  Jonas has  like all of us  committed minor transgressions   She smiled at him   We expect that  We hoped  also  that he would present himself promptly for chastisement  and he always has done so   Courage   she went on   Only one of us here today has ever undergone the rigorous training required of a Receiver  He  of course  is the most important member of the Committee  the current Receiver  It was he who reminded us  again and again  of the courage required  Jonas   she said  turning to him  but speaking in a voice that the entire community could hear   the training we require of you involves pain    Physical pain  This evidence connects to my point because I said that how I felt nervous and anxious  Also this part in the story can basically sum up Jonas in a person  The Chief Elder is the person who observes people for their jobs  She is obviously saying the truth after observing him  The Chief Elder said to Jonas that the training would require pain  but Jonas knew that he could do it Another interesting part of the story is when The Giver gives a memory to Jonas  The memory is about color and he showed a memory of a rainbow in the sky  This had me very confused at this part of the book  This is a quote from the book  But I want them   Jonas said angrily   it isn t fair that nothing has color  The reason this had me very confused is because I never realised this until that part of the book  that the Chief Elder makes the humans take medicine to not do some everyday life things  They take medicine every morning  One reason is so they can t see colors  I have realised that the environment they live in is very over protective and that people don t live a very fair life  There lives are happy because they don t know any horrible facts like guns and people killing one another  but they only know their lives and their own lives  Overall this story is a brilliant and very interesting story that I would recommend it to anyone   During my schools years  I read a lot of books for English class  some which i enjoyed and some i did not  I cant really remember the details but all I know that I enjoyed this novel very much  It was defiantly a unique book that revolves around an utopian society  Everything is under control  no war  no fear  no pain and no poverty  Everyone is assigned to specific role in the so  perfect  community  The novel is about a young 12 year old boy named Jonas who receives special training from the Giver  The Giver is the only person who has all the memories of true pain and happiness of life  Jonas must receive the truth from the Giver  Lowry created a very strange world where everything is orderly and perfect  This is an excellent book  well written  and holds many fascinating subjects  I know I was really young when I read this  say in 8th grade  but i do remember that i liked it  The novel is an easy read thats why its taught in many schools  it contains both science fiction and mystery elements   The Giver by Lois Lowry is science fiction dystopian novel about a kid named Jonas who is chosen by his community for a special job  The novel begins by showing us how the community works and introduces the reader to Jonas  family and friends  The society is run like a well oiled machine  There are no inconveniences and everything has Sameness  But  the job Jonas is chosen for allows him to see into the flaws of his community  He soon starts to question everything that he knows  It is a very character driven story that would interest readers of the dystopian genre or readers of futurism genres  I really loved this book  I had read it in eighth grade  but didn t remember a lot about it besides that I really liked it  I had recently seen the movie that was just made and wanted to reread it so I could compare my experiences  While I enjoyed the movie  I liked the book much better  There are quite a few elements that are different and I can see how the movie Hollywoodized the book in certain aspects  I really enjoyed the character of Jonas and the amount of emotional depth that there was for this level of book  For a book that is widely taught in middle schools  I was surprised how well it holds up to an adult reading  I want to now read the rest of the quartet  When I was younger I didn t know that there were three more books and now that I know this I am very interested in reading them  I would say that this is a very quick read  A person could easily get through the whole book in a day  It also grabbed me immediately  The story reminds me of other dystopias like those that are represented in the Hunger games or Divergent series  But this one came first and I think that anyone that has read those  but not this one should immediately pick up a copy and begin reading  I highly recommend it   I loved this book  It was suspensful  intense  intersting  and not predictable at all  The Giver was about a boy named Jonas becoming the new receiver  The Giver  so the original can be with his family  Jonas is having trouble being the new receiver because there is a lot of rule breaking when becoming the new receiver  When becoming the new receiver you must first follow the rule breaking list of being the new receiver  The Giver s daughter Rosemary turned killed herself because she couldn t take the pain of the memories that have to be fed to the new receiver  Will Jonas choose Rosemary s way out or will he continue  You can find out by reading The Giver   The Giver is written from the point of view of Jonas  an eleven year old boy living in a future society that has evoked all pain  fear  war  and hatred There is no descrimination  since everyone looks and acts the same  and there is very little competition  Everyone is excruciatingly polite  The society has also evoked choice  at age twelve every member of the community is assigned a job based on his or her abilities and interests  Citizens can apply for and be assigned compatible spouses  and each couple is assigned exactly two children each  The children are born to Birthmothers  who never see them  and spend their first year in a Nurturing Center with other babies  or  newchildren   born that year  Then they spend their last years being cared for in the House of the Old until they are finally  released  from the society  In the community  release is death  but it is never taken that way  most people think that after release  flawed newchildren and joyful elderly people are welcomed into Elsewhere  a place that surrounds the communities  Citizens who break rules or fail to adapt properly to the society s codes of behavior are also released  though in their cases it is an occasion of great shame Overall everything is planned and organized so that life is as convenient and pleasant as possible Jonas lives with his father  a Nurturer of new children  his mother  who works at the Department of Justice  and his seven year old sister Lily  At the beginning of the novel  he is anxious about the upcoming Ceremony of Twelve  when he will be given his official Assignment as a new adult member of the community  He does not have a specific career preference  although he enjoys volunteering at a variety of different jobs  Though he is a well behaved citizen and a good student  Jonas is different  he has pale eyes  while most people in his community have dark eyes  and he has unusual powers of perception  Sometimes objects  change  when he looks at them  He does not know it yet  but he alone in his community can perceive flashes of color  for everyone else  the world is deprived of color as it is of pain  hunger  and inconvenience At the Ceremony of Twelve  Jonas is given the highly honored Assignment of Receiver of Memory  The Receiver is the sole bearer of the community s collective memory  When the community went over to Sameness  its painless  warless  and mostly emotionless state of tranquility and harmony  it abandoned all memories of pain  war  and emotion  but the memories cannot disappear totally  Someone must keep them so that the community can avoid making the mistakes of the past  even though no one but the Receiver can bear the pain  Jonas receives the memories of the past  good and bad  from the current Receiver  a wise old man who tells Jonas to call him the Giver The Giver transmits memories by placing his hands on Jonas s bare back  The first memory he receives is of an exhilarating sled ride  As Jonas receives memories from the Giver  memories of pleasure and pain  of bright colors and extreme cold and warm sun  of excitement and terror and hunger and love  he realizes how bland and empty life in his community really is  The memories make Jonas s life richer and more meaningful  and he wishes that he could give that richness and meaning to the people he loves  But in exchange for their peaceful existence  the people of Jonas s community have lost the capacity to love him back  Since they have never experienced real suffering  they also cannot appreciate the real joy of life  In addition  no one in Jonas s community has ever made a choice of his or her own  Jonas grows more and more frustrated with the members of his community  and the Giver  who has felt the same way for many years  encourages him  The two grow very close  like a grandfather and a grandchild might have in the days before Sameness  when family members stayed in contact long after their children were grown Meanwhile  Jonas is helping his family take care of a problem newchild  Gabriel  who has trouble sleeping through the night at the Nurturing Center  Jonas helps the child to sleep by transmitting soothing memories to him every night  and he begins to develop a relationship with Gabriel that mirrors the family relationships he has experienced through the memories  When Gabriel is in danger of being released  the Giver reveals to Jonas that release is the same as death  Jonas s rage and horror at this idea inspires the Giver to help Jonas devise a plan to change things in the community forever  The Giver tells Jonas about the girl who had been designated the new Receiver ten years before  She had been the Giver s own daughter  but the sadness of some of the memories had been too much for her and she had asked to be released  When she died  all of the memories she had accumulated were released into the community  and the community members could not handle the sudden addition of emotion and sensation  The Giver and Jonas plan for jonas to escape the community and to actually enter Elsewhere  Once he has done that  his larger supply of memories will disperse  and the Giver will help the community to come to terms with the new feelings and thoughts  changing the society forever However  Jonas is forced to leave earlier than planned when his father tells him that Gabriel will be released the next day  Desperate to save Gabriel  Jonas steals his father s bicycle and a supply of food and sets off for Elsewhere  Gradually  he enters a landscape full of color  animals  and changing weather  but also hunger  danger  and exhaustion  Avoiding search planes  Jonas and Gabriel travel for a long time until heavy snow makes bike travel impossible  Half frozen  but comforting Gabriel with memories of sunshine and friendship  Jonas mounts a high hill  There he finds a sled  the sled from his first transmitted memory  waiting for him at the top  Jonas and Gabriel experience a glorious downhill ride on the sled  Ahead of them  they see  or think they see  the twinkling lights of a friendly village at Christmas  and they hear music  Jonas is sure that someone is waiting for them there   The theme of this book is the importance of memory seeing as this is the whole reason the job as receiver was created and what got the conflict started The tone of the book is bland but powerful as far as the message its conveying The mood of the book is solemn and serious yet rarely happy and gleeful The conflict of this story is the memories the receiver bears and eventually releases  Another conflict is when Gabrielle was going to be released  That in turn causes Jonas to runaway with Gabriele  1st Recorded Reading  January 1st  2003I first read this award winning young adult future world novel back in 2003  when my high school aged son suggested it to me  I have read it again for my Third Tuesday Book Club meeting tomorrow night  July 21st  2015   and I think I enjoyed reading it this time more than last time Jonas lives in a Community with perhaps 2 000 or so other people  their world is one of order  with every person knowing his or her place  A maximum of fifty children are born to Birth Mothers in a year  at the Ceremony at the end of December of the year they are born  they are officially named Ones  and given to parents  At the same Ceremony each age group moves up in an age classification  with each group given some sort of indication of increased responsibility  for example  those becoming Nines get bicycles  and begin doing Volunteer Hours in the community   A young adult who is done with schooling can put in a request with the Council of Elders for a spouse  and in due time is given one  chosen with an eye to making the pair a good couple to raise children  Three years after becoming a couple  the pair can put in a request with the Council of Elders for a child  or  if they have one child already  for a child of the opposite sex   and if approved  the pair are given a child  already named  at the Ceremony for Ones  Adults who are not part of a child raising couple  or who are no longer raising children  live in a dormitory while working at a career  and once retired they move to the House of the Old  Release from the community is granted to the Old upon request  to any citizen of the Community upon request  and is also a punishment for those who have three times willfully violated the Rules of the community  and release can also happen to infants before they are Ones  for various reasons  There is no disease and no dissension  each member of the Community is happy to follow all of the Rules  and so far as each member of the Community  save one  is concerned  the Community has always been  and has always been this way Jonas is an Eleven  his sister is a Seven  and they live in a dwelling with Father  who is a Nurturer of the pre Ones  he recently got permission to bring one newchild home to the dwelling at night  as the child has trouble sleeping  and with Mother  who is an Administrator   The Ceremony coming up for his age cohort is the most important one  based on one s intelligence and personality  and after being observed by the Elders in their school life  personal life  and volunteer hours  one is told what career one will have within the Community  and undergoes specialized training each afternoon after school  Jonas has a pretty good idea of what his friends will end up doing  but he honestly has no clue  as he has never been strongly drawn to any one role in the community  To his great surprise  he is selected to be the Receiver of Memory  a position that is currently held by an old man  to become the Receiver of Memory  he begins training with the old man  who becomes the Giver of Memory This novel won the 1994 Newberry Medal  and is the first book of the Giver Quartet  with the other books being Gathering Blue  2000   Messenger  2004  and Son  2012   I think that we will have a great discussion of this book at my Third Tuesday Book Club meeting  and I look forward to reading the other books in the series  This is a very beautiful story  After finishing the book  I found out that it s the first in a series and while some part of me is happy about that  I m also disappointed  People complain about how this book ends  however  it could end no other way  Yes  it is up to interpretation and that is one of the best things I loved about Lowry s writing   even though her target audience is young  she does not condescend talk down to the reader  She doesn t pull any punches  The writing is easily accessible for all kinds of readers  but there is no upper limit of age and enjoyment  Anyone everyone can enjoy this book  It is poignant  It is brilliant  It is beautiful  It is gut wrenching  It is terrifying  I will never watch the movie  but based on the previews  I noticed that the writers producers etc  made it fit into the formulaic young adult genre that every YA book movie follows   main character smart character comic relief dopey character reluctantly are forced into an adventure  The book is not that at all  It isn t formula  It isn t predictable  at least not to the degree of the onslaught of pop YA fiction right now   The characters are not built from the same mold that all the other YA characters are build from  And while there are archetypal characters and parallels to the hero mythic cycle of Joseph Campbell  think Star Wars  Harry Potter  etc   it s not in your face obvious  Read and enjoy   Was my YA novel to read for my Book Riot Reading Challenge  So glad I read this  Part of a four part series  now a movie  Wonderfully written and to me a page turner  I can t wait to read the other books in this  quartet   So far  the story revolves around James  living in a world without colour  where people in the community all have assigned roles  everyone is taken care of  fed  sheltered  and might appear on the outside to be happy  Children are assigned their adult  roles  in the community during a ceremony  and James  brings him knowledge and information that he is astounded by  Won t tell you anything more  The writing is superb  the storyline inviting  intriguing and thought provoking   I may be one of the few fifty three year olds that had not read  The Giver   Oh  I knew about it  after all  I work in a library and my daughter had tried to get me to read it a few years ago but I wasn t ready for dystopian fiction yet apparently  It would be years before I devoured  The Hunger Games  series   The Uglies  series and others  Frankly  I was also put off by the picture of the old guy on the cover  How shallow is that   Finally  I saw the movie earlier this year because I had free movie tickets and I had seen an intriguing trailer and  as it turned out  I loved the movie  So I had to take my turn at two libraries and finally got to listen to the book  And I loved IT  a rarity amongst book lovers  Of course  there were differences  For one thing  the Movie Jonas is about 17 years old instead of the 12 year old Book Jonas  but amazingly enough  this and other details did not detract from the story  It probably would have if I had read the book first  It was actually helpful to read the book second  then I could comprehend the movie better   although I m still not sure what really happens at the end when Jonas and Gabriel finally reach Elsewhere  But then  I just found out that there is a sequel  Guess what my next book will be    I read this in middle school and I realize now that I didnt appreciate it then as much as I should have  There is so much more to the story than I thought there was and now I am able to understand so much more  The imagery that Lois uses in the book helps you connect to the story and the intense plot line from the futuristic society forces you to really use your mind in trying to figure out exactly what is happening in the story  I have a new love for this book after reading it again and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wasnt a fan the first time they read it because it is much better the second time  Could you imagine a community without feelings  choice  or color  In The Giver  Lois Lowry tells the story of that community from Jonas  perspective  Before anyone can remember this community went into  sameness   where everything that causes disturbances or awkwardness is under control and anything that is unique or different is hidden  When Jonas turns 12  he is selected for the job of The Receiver  where he has to tackle every memory  from war to love  with help from The Giver  This book has many great qualities  It really puts into perspective for us what a gift it is to have the freedom of choice  The author does a great job of portraying Jonas as a dynamic character  In the beginning of the book  Jonas was a carefree boy living day by day  following the rules of the community  In the end  Jonas understands what it is to have feelings and more importantly  what love is  A quality that I did not like about this book is that in the end  the plot never completely settles and you have to infer what happens from the clues the author gives you  I think that the author s purpose for writing this book is to show people that even though horrible things sometimes happen in life  at least we know what it feels like to experience true happiness  I rate this book 5 5 stars because the plot kept on moving and the story never got dull  I recommend this book for anyone who might enjoy seeing life from a different perspective and for those who enjoy reading science fiction books about Utopian societies  Overall  I was very impressed with this book and I hope that everyone who reads it will enjoy it as much as I did  Ok   How did I miss this book when it came out  Just about everyone I know has read it and loved it  It is a quick read   I would recommend it for everyone  I picked it up and read it in one day  Not only is it an easy read  but I couldn t put it down  The book takes place in a Community  where everything is defined  polite  planned  etc  Nothing is left to chance  As the story progresses  you begin to understand the true nature of the Community  and the pluses and minuses of their way of life  I found the book both uplifting and sad  I am especially interested in other readers  take on the end  since I could envision two separate explanations for the conclusion  All in all  this book is very deep and tells us a lot about the human race  Wonderful   I would actually give it 4 5 stars   this was the only thing I could think about when I was reading it This is such an interesting book to read and I think it s one of those books I can read again and again and still enjoy  I really love how Lowry slowly reveals the world that she has created  At the beginning it seems very similar to our own  Children going to school  riding bikes  eating dinner with their parents  It all seems very normal  Yet the further you read  the more you notice that something is slightly off  and you start to see the differences  The slow reveal feels really powerful in this book  because it gives me a sense of security at the beginning  then slowly pulls that away as things start to feel more and more wrong  It s one of my favourite books that feature the slow reveal  especially because it s not obvious what the deeper issues are  The world is not predictable and remains a mystery almost to the end At the beginning of the novel Jonas is very content with his life and the way things are done  and he really has no reason to doubt the world around him  Yet bit by bit he finds faults with his community s way of life  I really appreciate how as a reader I can observe Jonas  growth  because as Jonas learns about the world  I am learning as well  He s also a very smart main character in that when he learns a piece of information  he then applies that knowledge to the world around him and analyses it  He is actively thinking and assessing  and to me he is a very rich character because he isn t passive and he doesn t need to be told what it all means  He s a critical thinker and I think that s part of what makes this book so good Finally  something that really intrigues me about this book is the ending  There isn t one  Generally speaking  when a book doesn t come to a conclusion and tie up its loose ends it drives me nuts  But in this case I love it  The story is about this community  and so as Jonas leaves it  we no longer have a view of the community  Plus the title is The Giver  and Jonas has left the Giver s presence  leaves his own destiny of becoming the next Giver  and so has opened the door to any possibility  I just love that the ending is SO open  that Jonas is traveling Elsewhere  and that almost anything can happen  I find it enriching to the imagination and it left me feeling not frustrated  but thoughtful Obviously I really like this book  I would say definitely give it a try  because I think this is one of those books that can appeal to a huge range of ages and reading tastes  I m really looking forward to reading more of the series and Lowry s other works  because I can only hope for more intriguing stories   This was my second time reading The Giver  I read it once when I was in grade 7 or 8 with my class and I loved it then  I had high hopes that it wouldn t disappoint now that I am older  and I was right  Although this is a shorter book it doesn t lack anything that makes a story great  It still manages to make you think and feel  Oh boy  does it make you feel  I went through a whole range of emotions while re reading this book and I am so glad that I decided to read it as an adult because it gives you a completely new outlook on the story   To me  The Giver  is about choice  The people in Jonas s community were not given a choice of what they wanted to feel and how to react to those feelings  They didn t have to make the hard life choices because they didn t have those hard feelings that come with life  Does that make the society that they lived in better than ours  I don t know  But I do know that without passion and love  life would be meaningless  Even though passion and love makes people do horrible things sometimes  its still what drives us  It fuels our lives and gives us purpose   view spoiler  As for the ending of the book  I ve heard that further along in the series we get more of an explantion about what happened to Jonas  But I haven t read the others yet and so I am going to stay with my opinion that Jonas and the baby died  Jonas made a choice to escape with the baby out of love  and he didn t know how it would turn out  But he had to try because his love for the baby wouldn t let him leave the baby there for his community to kill  Perhaps it might not have been the best choice  but it was his choice and he got to make it   hide spoiler   My favorite book  ever   3 This book is amazing  It was an amazing work of fiction  The giver is a book about Jonah s perfect world  and the giver is the only person who experienced feelings  When he turned 12  Jona is receiving the truth about life and he can t turn back  Many people will absolutely enjoy this book  Wow    this is the first book I have read by Lois Lowry  it was fantastic  In The Giver  Lowry creates a utopian world which lacks basic standards in life  color  music  emotion  and freedom  This life is lived by Jonas and his community  She shows through Jonas  journey of receiving memories what life was like before Sameness took over  Lowry explains how something seeming so perfect restrains everyone from what is loved most  This world today could become as  perfect  as Jonas  is  She brings a new element to the table of how society could be  Throughout the novel  Lois illustrates several themes such as  pain and pleasure and individuality  She describes pain and pleasure as two necessities  One without the other is useless like the yin and yang  Jonas experiences both feelings during his training with the Giver  Individuality is also a big concern throughout the story  A child is recognized for his her unique abilities when they turn twelve with their group mates  In today s society  individuality is stressed everyday to everyone  Lowry shows how opposite these worlds are by the simplest things that are taken for granted   Lowry wrote the novel in a narrative style  It gives an ordered explanation of each event through the story  She also uses symbolism  For example  Gabriel  the newborn that stays with Jonas  family unit  symbolizes a fresh start and a need for change  He is one of the reasons Jonas and the Giver see a need for change  Another one is release  it means to let one go or die  No one in the community realizes what this means beside Jonas and the Giver  Lowry gives everyone and everything a descriptive meaning which unites to form an exquisite novel  This is what makes her work so wonderful  My thoughts on this novel were positive for the most part  Each character was perfect in their way  so it was easy to picture each one  The setting made the story believable as well as the emotion  The only negative comment I had was about the ending  It was not what I was hoped would happen  but it did  Otherwise  the novel was perfect  MAN    The first time I read this book I was so shocked on how great this book was  But now I that I look back I guess this book could be better  I loved how the book talks about a normal teen named Jonas who is given the great position of Giver which will cause a lot of pain  Jonas learns about the real world aside from his controlled environment  When he learns about everything that his community is doing he believes it s unfair and tries to change it  The overall message of this book is that it s okay to be different and we shouldn t hold back on the differences we have  One of the weaknesses of the book was that I expected there to be so much more and I got the short version of it  I think Lowry could have explained the whole community more thoroughly and maybe elaborate on the idea that it s okay to be different  I would definitely recommend this story to anybody who is ready for a heart changing book   I often wonder when reading science fiction if the powers that be are testing new possibilities and how the world at large reacts  Will this be a feasible option  Can they get to this point I enjoyed this book because of the immense creativity  the wondrous possibilities of things that do not exist  Then on the flip side  I abhor giving such high ratings because I hope these events never do happen  they re inconceivable     the thought that humanity could be trained to buy in to these ideas  The same thing happened when I read saw 1984  Demolition Man  Gattica  Elysium  Hunger Games  etc  These are all created  mind controlled environments  Scary but wonderful as you read about the integrity and courage of one person to break the mold  So  that s what this story is  a learned behavior society that has forgotten about choice and is led blindly until a young man has the audacity to ask the questions needed to learn the truth  to do something with his new found knowledge  and to break away from the powers that bind him  Jonas lives in a perfect world  Everything in the world has been carefully planned and designed and carried out to make the world perfect  Each family has exactly one boy and one girl  All children get a bicycle at nine  no sooner  no later  At dinner  each family member brings up the feelings of the day  at breakfast  each family member relates his dreams  All families  Every day Twelve is the big year  the year each child will be assigned his job  the perfect job just for him  Jonas is eager  though perhaps a little anxious  to turn twelve and learn what his role in his society is to be He is shocked to learn that he is to become the Receiver of Memory  the one person in the society who holds all the memories  both good and bad  happy and sad  of the past in his head  He is given special privileges  he can ask any questions he wishes of anyone and he can lie  He studies with an old man  the former Receiver of Memory  a man who asks Jonas to now call the Giver And the Giver does given memories to Jonas  color  snow  the sky  families  pain  and   most powerfully   love  As Jonas learns the black truths behind the perfect world he lives in  he and the Giver realize it is up to them to change this perfect world  I loved this book and could not put it down  Lowry stirred many strong feelings in me as I read  Mostly  she painted a clear picture of the world that we would live in now if Satan had won the war in heaven  Choice is central to God s plan for us  not the lack thereof  Also  feelings are important for us to have and to share whether they be wonderful or devastating  We must understand both sides of all opposites to gain knowledge and happiness   The pill  was very interesting as well  A world with no natural intimacy between men and women is wrong as is a world without birth parents nurturing their children My daughters both read this book at school and strongly HATED it  I think that most people seem to have a STRONG reaction to this book whether it be good or bad  To me  any book that can evoke such a strong emotion is classified as great  I think that my girls just hated the community and its rules and lack of choices  Maybe it bothered them that the ending was left to the imagination  To me it was beautifully clear that inspite of the outcome  it was for the greater good  I am an optimist  however  and have easily imagined a better  Elsewhere  for Jonas and his partner   Synopsis   Jonas is selected to receive all of the past memories of his community from The Giver  The truth of how he  his family  his world came to be  It is an honor Jonas isn t certain he wants as everyone knows that there is indescribable pain involved  However  refusal is not an option  Review   Personally  one of the hardest things about being a teenager for me was the struggle to find happiness  The past  simplistic  childish things that used to provide comfort failed me and I had to search to find other avenues from which happiness could emerge In my teen years  it seemed that as if the joy I d found as a child was slowly being filtered out and replaced with knowledge of how things  things that might have been magical at one time   actually were  There was an awareness that was emerging and through that awareness  that  knowledge   sadness crept in  In reading this novel  Lois Lowry  provides the reader with a clear  detailed description of that illusive  gradual filtering that takes place between childhood and adulthood  Her protagonist  Jonas  has been selected to receive all of the memories of his strictly controlled  freakishly idealistic  well mannered  heavily medicated community  It is a great honor that only one within the society is bestowed with  However  it is in reality something much worse  They call this selected member of society  the Receiver   Throughout the process of receiving  Jonas comes to view his family  his friends  his structured   sameness  world in a new light  Along with giving the positive  delightful past memories of sledding  snow  sailing colors and animals  all things that no longer exist   the Giver must also transfer the darker memories of what it is to starve  break a bone  die on a battlefield  experience pain and great  great loss  This knowledge of what  was  and what now  is  forces a change in both the Giver and Jonas  the Receiver  that readers will turn over in their own minds for weeks afterwards  In the same vein as  A Brave New World  and  A Handmaid s tale   The Giver is a fantastic exploration into what could be if you let those in power continually dictate and make all of your decisions for you under the guise of  protecting you from yourself   Something that teenagers and adults alike will love to grapple with   Critical Reviews   Publishers Weekly found this story  thought provoking   a novel which centers on a 12 year old boy s gradual disillusionment with an outwardly Utopian futuristic society   Children s Literature aptly reviewed this by stating  this is a stunning  provocative science fiction story that will inspire discussion   This book is amazing  I read it a few years back and now I read it again  The first time reading this book I feel I missed out on a lot of the symbolism and the message of the book itself  However  now that I m older I get what Lowry was trying to tell the reader  In our world we crave a place with no pain or darkness  no wars or poverty  But the funny things about darkness is that it is the perfect antithesis to light  So if there were no darkness  there could be no light  Same thing with all the  bad  emotions  if we lose them then we lose a part of what it means to be human  Without our emotions we would have no reason to celebrate or grieve  And then the world becomes gray  as it is in Lowry s book  We have lost the ability to perceive either darkness or light so we settle for the dull nothingness that lies in the middle of both  Additionally  I find the  choosing  of Jonas to be anything but simplistic  You have to remember we are reading a book in a world that is perceived by a twelve year old  What did any of us know at twelve about real living and the pain and joy that comes with it  So Lowry gives us another amazing gift in perceiving the painful awakenings of our adolescence through another pair of eyes  Just like Jonas all of us have sat back and looked at the world our parents gave us and questioned if it is a world we want to claim as our own  And if it s not then it is our job  just as it was Jonas s to change the world we live in and bring it back from the gray   What I knew about this book before reading it was that it was going to be extremely weird and hard to understand  So I tried to keep up with the pace of the book by reading as much of it as I could quickly so that I would not forget anything and lose the entire meaning of the plot  However  I found this book very interesting  I have always thought about what a perfect world be like and this is not what I had in mine  To be honest this book came off to me as sort of a horror because if it were real I don t think it would be bearable to go through what Jonas did  This book seems to be popular because a lot of students read it in middle school and there was even a movie based on this book in two thousand fourteen  I have not yet watched the movie but I prefer to read books rather than watch movies based on books because they are usually much more detailed and give a better understanding of the story  I do not blame this on the producers of the movie because they must find a way to keep the movie interesting and as a result they cut out a few things here and there  But I recommend reading the book  Overall  I really enjoyed this book and I would recommend it to anyone  Especially to those who like fictional stories  I gave this book a four and a half star rating because it was great but it did take a little while to get going  My favorite thing about this book was that it helped me to realize that nothing is perfect and that not being perfect is perfectly fine  This is definitely one of my favorite books and it is fully deserving of all its recognition  It is one of my absolute favorite books to read  I enjoyed reading it  and became one of the characters  went into their world and enjoyed their emotions  A strong  powerful story that made me want for more even when the book ended  In the Community where Jonas lives  everyone has a routine  Jobs  spouses and children are selected by qualified officials  Emotions are discusses and analyzed  colors are non existent and pills are taken to halt the  Stirrings  from taking hold  Everything is controlled  peaceful  uniform and all people are treated the same  When you become of a certain age you join the House of Old and are released as a  reward   Jonas thinks that his society is the perfect place to live  Then he goes through the ceremony of the twelves to get his life assignment  Jonas is given an unusual task that he has never heard of before  He s apprenticed to a man called The Giver and becomes The Receiver  He is to take on all of the memories  emotions and experiences of what life used to be like  without total control  Jonas begins to question the way the Community is run and his place in it s mindless conformity  When Gabriel  an underdeveloped infant that has been staying with Jonas  family  is at risk due to the Community s rules  it s up to Jonas to make a decision  Will he follow the community or give in to the lessons he s learned from the things he s taken from The Giver I have read this book at least six or seven times  the first being around 2001 or 2002  when my sixth or seventh grade English teacher assigned it to my class  I remember being shocked by the ideas and terrifying realities presented in this book  A place that is controlled by the government  doesn t allow for any individuality  and has no romance or family bonding   a place with no color or emotion AT ALL    It blew my pre teen mind to imagine such a horrifying thing  I definitely identified with Jonas  questioning the world around himself and trying to make life changing decisions  mostly between action and in action   In light of the movie being released next month  I decided to re read it again and see how well it held up after a decade of being in my thoughts This novel is definitely more one of introspection than action  The climax near the end of the story when Jonas  SPOILER  takes baby Gabriel and leaves  END SPOILER  is definitely the most actiony part of this book  The majority of this book is Jonas  journey from conformity and belonging  to being on the outside of the Community and becoming isolated when his reality shifts  By gaining the things that everyone else he knows have lost  color  emotion  individualistic though  etc    Jonas becomes an unlikely rebel   Sameness  is a concept he no longer embraces and finds to be pretty horrifying  Probably the most conflict in this book is caused by the concept of  release  for people who don t  or can t  conform for some reason  or are just too old to be of use to society  This is what really causes Jonas to take action  It really makes you wonder just what it would take to push our own world over the edge  into a false utopia  A chilling  but ultimately hopeful portrayal of a world ruled by the loss of everything real  I highly recommend this book  it won a Newberry Award for a reason   as an introduction to the loosely defined  dystopian  genre  It definitely makes you think VERDICT  5 5 Stars  No money or favors were exchanged for this review  This book is now available in stores  online  or maybe even at your local library    Imagine a dystopian society where people couldn t do things their way or have opinions about things  well in Lois Lowry s book The Giver it is a dystopian society  this book has lots of positive things about it first  this book is different and that s what makes this book unique and the dystopian genre unique also this book has lots of great things that happen in it which gives readers more interest in wanting to not stop reading  One other thing this book has that makes it great is that the characters personalities and dialects in the story get changed later when you read the story  I recommend this book to people that like dystopian novels because this is a classic dystopia that will be remembered for a long time   The Giver is a fictional story about a boy named Jonas  This story takes place in a futuristic society  In this community everyone has sameness which means they have the same clothes  houses  and receive the same amount of food  Jonas is fine with sameness until he is selected to receive memories of the past  He experiences love  Christmas  and snow and soon wishes that his family can love him but  they don t know what love is   He then has to make a decision of either staying in the community or leave to elsewhere  My favorite part of the book is when the Giver transfers memories of fun  happy  and loving things to Jonas  These parts were my favorite because I could imagine Jonas how happy or surprised he would be to be able to know what love and Christmas is  I highly recommend this book to people who are looking for a very interesting  suspenseful  and emotional book   I also first read this book as a 6th grader  and I have re read it over and over since  If you have never read it  I would HIGHLY recommend it  It s an easy read  but also one that provokes a lot of inner thought and reflection  I listened to the audio book in a couple hours while cleaning and doing things around the house  Really interesting book that I never read in my youth  now I have to read  or listen to  the rest of the series     The Giver is a science fiction fantasy coming of age book by Lois Lowry and is written for children ages twelve and up  It was written in 1993 and received many prestigious awards including the Newbery Medal  Based on a 2007 online poll  the National Education Association named the book one of its  Teachers  Top 100 Books for Children  It was one of the  Top 100 Chapter Books  of all time in a 2012 poll by School Library Journal   The Giver is also one of the most challenged books because of it s age inappropriate content for middle school children  Some concerns from parents are the inclusion of violence  sexually explicit material and the ideas of drug use  suicide and euthanasia  The novel follows Jonas  a twelve year old boy that lives in a colorless utopian society where  sameness  eliminates emotional depth  Strict rules are followed in every day life and there is a  big brother  watching if rules are disregarded  People are assigned their functions in life by the age of twelve  Life is structured and orderly  controlled by Elders  so as not to cause any pain or allow emotional feelings to disrupt the society s structure  The reader feels that the society is happy with life there  Then Jonas receives his assignment as the Receiver  He is to hold all the memories of past societies  Through this he discovers many emotions  and does not see his society as perfect anymore   Although simply written  The Giver is a complex and thoughtful novel  I found it to be written in a genial manner when covering so many controversial topics  I would recommend this book to anyone over the age of twelve  You root for Jonas to find a life with emotions and color  and the ending leaves the reader questioning  Which I believe is one of the greatest reasons to read  The Giver is an amazing and interesting book  It is said in the book that the world being lived in is a perfect society and where there is strict rules that make it perfect in every way  its all the same and there is no music  no color  nor pain  Jonas on the other hand is a special boy  He can see things that no one else can and it is told that he can see truth about his world he lives in  Since Jonas was special and saw a new insight on the community he lives in he received a special job from The Giver  Jonas being the way he is was assigned the job of Receiver of Memory  The role he revived is responsible for all the decision made based on the past  He goes to see the Giver and begins to learn all about the way things used to be  and how the way our world is now  The more he learns about how the world was and is now the more he begins to doubt what he lives in  Jonas is a great character and throughout the book you can relate it to todays society and how we are pictured in the eyes of other nations  Finally  with the help of the Giver  Jonas leaves the society he lived in seeing all the flaws so many people were blinded of  I liked this book so much and would recommend it so anybody that loves science fiction novels   My name is Susan  and I had never read The Giver until I finally picked it up last week   Hangs head in shame Yes  I call myself a book lover and a librarian  and yes I did attend middle and high school and college and graduate school  But somehow I never made the time for this book  I knew it was a classic  a Newbery Medal winner  and the forefather of the modern YA dystopian genre  which I read plenty from   but somehow I still couldn t muster much enthusiasm for it  And then I went to see the movie on a whim  and I really liked it  Of course  I read that the movie was pretty liberal when it came to making changes to the original  but I was still intrigued enough by its general plot to add it to my TBR list I m so glad that I did  Not only do I feel much more culturally literate now  but I also deeply enjoyed the thought provoking experience of reading The Giver  Here is a story in which a seemingly utopian society   one in which citizens feel no pain  experience no conflict  and never have to worry about difference or individuality   is shown to be far from perfect  As Jonas takes on the memories that are his due as Receiver of Memory  he realizes that there is so much more   pain  but also beautiful things like love and color   than what the others in his community will ever know  Yet there is also something sinister hidden beneath the ideal facade of the community  something that Jonas will eventually discover  The Giver asks us to think about what it means to feel  why it is important and necessary to feel both the good and the bad  the nature of memory  and the importance of choice  and thus independent thinking  and what it means to give up choice  There is nothing more powerful than a book that really asks you to think I particularly want to recommend The Giver to all the YA dystopia lovers out there  If you love The Hunger Games  Divergent  The Maze Runner  Delirium  or any of the many other titles published in this genre in the last five or so years  then you ve got to go back to the early years of the genre with The Giver  The story is simpler in many ways than its descendents  but it has all the same suspense  social commentary  and power   Es una muy buena historia  imposible soltarla una vez q empiezas a leer y con umo de los finales mas abiertos y desconcertantes que he leido  I may write an even longer review later  after I ve had more time to think and process  However  my initial reaction is a swelling of appreciation for this book and for Lois Lowry  I am awestruck by the ease with which this incredibly powerful message was conveyed to me  I was initially taken in by the simplistic descriptions of everyday normalities and actions  such as dwellings  stirrings and newchild  Things that we take for granted every day are completely foreign to this community  I was absolutely blown away by the revelation that colors were muted in this strange commune  And I nearly cried when The Giver shared the memory of Christmas with Jonas  I don t know what I expected when I began reading this story but it has both stunned and uplifted me  I will never stop singing the praises for this novel  Are they reading this in schools  Children should be reading this in schools  This is a dystopian novel set in a future in which all traces of individual expression have been erased from society  In order for all of the ancient evils to be eliminated  war  hunger  poverty  and disease  the people accept to be little more than puppets or wind up toys  They merely exist  the meaning existence is simply utilitarian  All depth of feeling and all imagination has been swept away  Life means very little  Death means even less  If I were to go into the details of this book  it would be spoiled  There are other books in this series by the same author  I hope to read those soon   Short but powerful  I was really excited to read this book because I d heard great things about it but I felt like I never had the time to get to it  At the beginning of my senior semester at GSU  I decided to stop waiting for the right time and to take the time to read it and I am glad that I did  I am glad that I read it because it is now one of my favorite books  The reason that I loved this book is because the author did an amazing job at describing the world that Jonas lived in  Mrs  Lowry also conveyed the feelings or lack thereof of the population very well  I was able to sense the pain that Jonas felt when he experienced snow for the first time and the warmth from his first time feeling sun  It was not just the physical details that made me love this book but the change of awareness within Jonas and his desire to escape a world where everything is planned out and there are no choices to be made by the population  It is definitely a book to use in an older classroom when discussing social justice but can easily be used with younger children when covering imagery  I would choose a few passages to model how Mrs  Lowry described Jonas  experiences with nature and how easily we can imagine what he felt   My first impression of this book was completely and totally wrong  I got it as a Christmas present  so I wasn t expecting it to be great  The cover and blurb just made it sound a bit boring honestly  I was so wrong  Jonas  world is terrifyingly perfect  The kind of perfect you never actually want  Everything is the same  No one and nothing is truly unique  The is except for The Receiver  The very idea that one person has to carry the burden of the whole world s history full of pain and loss and sorrow just sounds horrific  The story was terrific and perfectly portrayed the downside to living in a utopia  I would definitely recommend it if you re into dystopian stuff but not necessarily the violence that comes with it so often I have loved this book since I was eleven years old and we read it in Mrs  Somer s fifth grade class  It was my first experience with the dystopian novel and I have been drawn to them ever since  Jonas is a wonderful  hopeful character and his relationship with  the Giver  is powerful  Read it with your kids someday  The Giver was an absolutely incredible book  There was great detail in the words that the author used and the whole book was so unpredictable  I could never predict what was going to happen on the next page or on the next chapter  The one thing I did not like about the book was that the ending was not very clear  I couldn t tell if Jonas had died or if he was alive and did find civilization with his little brother  the story was very well though out  Not exactly a fast read  but it is hard to put the book down because of how intense it is  Another thing that was really good about the book was the intensity  In the beginning of the book  it is not as intense but when you start to read it more and more it gets more intense and more dramatic  This is definitely a good book for someone who likes intensity and drama   The book was like  totally awesome  The story took place in such a cool and unbelievable place  with all the various jobs of the people and the systems of each community  The book was so gripping  I read it all way faster than I had expected  However  one detail towards it s ending seemed kinda unsolved  since the last thing that took place was Jonas along with a weak  faint Gabriel possibly reaching civilization  or maybe just a hallucination mirage of it   And bammm  the book ends then  Also with no real sequel about the same characters  So that was one thing that seemed pretty vague and incomplete with the ending  but really  the book was amazing  Especially all Rosemary scenes     I loved this book so much  I don t know how I did not find this book in my childhood  but I wish I had  This really reminded me of another of my favorite books  Tuck Everlasting  Both books are wonderful and easy to read while bringing up some serious moral issues  I think this is a great book for anyone to read  but I would definitely recommend reading this to elementary school children  I read Tuck Everlasting in the fourth grade for school  and I feel like it really impacted me as a person and a reader  I m sure this book will do the same for young readers  Even though this is technically a children s book  I truly believe anyone can read this and enjoy it  I honestly wanted to reread it as soon as I finished it  The other books in the quartet are good reads as well  I have not yet read the final book  Son  but I am sure it will be amazing  The Giver is the book that got me back into reading  and reminded me that there is so much that you can get out of books  I had a goal for this year to read 6 books to try and start reading again  After reading the giver  I read another 6 books in a month  This book is seriously so wonderful  I cannot recommend it enough  At first when I picked up The Giver to read during my lunch break  I thought this will be a quick easy read after all it is rated for an intermediate reader  Well  I started reading   and I couldn t stop  This is a unique story even if the people are all the same  They live in a world with no music  or color or differences or true love  They take a pill to make them act like robots  The community assigns them a job  a spouse and a family  They get their jobs in their 12th year  There is peace  but they don t have almost any feelings  Jonas is chosen to be the Receiver  He will have all the memories of The Giver  He will have all the memories of the old times  colors  love  pain  loneliness  happiness      so he can be the Wiseman of the community  he will make the best decisions for the tranquility of the society  But one person cannot handle all these feelings and he grows distant from the others  he feels he can t fit in anymore   He grows too old for a kid of his age and the other kids don t understand him  Then he learns the end of every person released in to the  Community s Elsewhere   But he decides to control his own future  With the help of the Giver  he discovers that there is a different after life for everyone  some place beyond the community  where the past  the present and the future collide  This is a wonderful book that made me smile and cry  I will never forget this book  I stopped reading just for a minute  and look around me  enjoy the colors  the music and the happiness of be free and in control of my own feelings  This book is one of the best books I have ever read  I really love this book and I think everyone should read it  My only concern in the age rating   I believe intermediate is quite young for a story of this caliber 5 Stars I ve been hearing amazing things about The Giver for awhile now  but I had never had the chance to read it  That all changed this year at BEA when I had the opportunity to get myself a copy and also meet the talented author  Now I am kicking myself for not picking this book up sooner  The Giver is hard to describe because it is so weird to try and imagine the world that Lowry has created  It is a world of simplicity and that is safe  The leaders have taken away feelings  warmth  cold   colours and worst of all wisdom  books and memories   I loved Jonas  He was a little rebel  always so full of questions  despite not being allowed to ask or not getting an answer  He could tell the difference between what was done to their people for the better but also he thought things should be done differently to benefit everyone  Although I enjoyed this book I hated the ending  I need more  I have so many questions that I want to be answered  I am so glad that there are more books in this series  I will absolutely be picking them all up and reading them   The Giver by Lois LowryThe Giver is a science fiction story written by Lois Lowry  winner of the 1994 Newbery Medal  Jonas lives in a society where there is no pain  poverty  divorce  delinquency  etc  The community chose to live without concepts of love  color  feelings  and memories of the past  In other words  it is a body and mind controlled community  There is an Elder committee that governs the entire community through the book of rules  When children reach the age of 12  they become adults in preparation since they are assigned to do a job for the rest of their lives  At the Ceremony of 12  Jonas is surprised to learn that he has been awarded the most prestigious honor  His assignment will be that of Receiver of Memories  He studies with  the Giver   a man he comes to love  Within time  he learns the horrifying secrets of his community and must make a decision that will test his courage  intelligence  and stamina  I believe that this is a stunning science fiction story that will inspire seventh and eighth graders with great discussions about diversity  freedom of speech  liberty of choices  and more  I don t read fast  but I read this book in a day I was at the movies last week  and before the previews during the  pre show entertainment   read  ads   there was a little spot about the movie version of The Giver  The actor who plays Jonas said that this is an incredible story  and everyone should read the book  then go see the movie That s usually my instinct  but to hear it voiced out loud by one of the stars of the movie  that seems significant to me  It worked  On Wednesday I had some time to kill and found myself at a book store  I saw The Giver on a shelf and picked it up  read a few paragraphs of the introduction  not even the actual book  just the introduction   and knew that I had to read the book I bought it  I read it  I loved it I bought it on Wednesday and by Thursday night I was done reading That s unheard of for me A few thoughts on the book itself   What a depressing place to live  No real fun  no adventure  no diversity  Of course  they don t have any idea what they re missing out on  Even so  I don t know how any of them can actually be happy   view spoiler  Though  really  this is what Jonas discovers when he starts receiving memories  He wants his friends to see what they ve been lacking in their lives so far   hide spoiler    I very much liked the community s emphasis on precision of language  As an aspiring writer  that was very interesting to me  I think that of all the things this strange community does  that s one of the most interesting  We could use that in our community  Sometimes our hyperbole gets to be a bit much   view spoiler  Leading up to the end of the book seemed a bit rushed to me  It seemed so sudden that Jonas and the Giver decided that things had to change  that Jonas had to run away  I felt there could have been more leading up to that   hide spoiler  It s going to be very interesting to see how the movie adapts the story  I know that Taylor Swift plays a character named Rosemary  view spoiler  who is long gone by the time the events in the book take place  hide spoiler    for example  I have hope  though  At least they aren t trying to fit an epic into 3 hours  Wow  I just finished this book  my sons 6th grade reading assignment  The writing was so thought provoking  I believe I could read this book many times and still get great understanding out of it  I loved the thoughts behind the simple birthday gifts  learning interdependence  dependence  trustworthiness  etc  As a Christian  I often thought of the parallels  I also thought this was an excellent book for the tween and teens  Often  this is the age of suicidal thoughts     I loved that this apparent  perfect  society just didn t know what was missing from their lives  given the broader picture we could see how much more life has to offer  this book gives hope to those that feel hopeless  I love this book  It s a chilling  but entertaining look at the cost of perfection   It is a terrifying world Lowry creates where people can t see color  don t know the meaning of love and have no understanding of any other way of life  He does a good job of writing so that the readers can imagine WHY this society would have been created  We all have memories we d rather dissolve than revisit in our minds  This book takes that concept to the extreme  Life is hard  It is really really hard  But it is also beautiful and it is about balance and trying to find personal happiness  In our world we have war and starvation  We have greed and hurt  But we also have music and color and humor  Hopefully most people in our world who have to see war can balance that with music and beauty  People who see starvation hopefully also get to see kindness and love  In the book it seemed that this was the way the Giver managed to bear his sorrow full life  Although he was racked with the grief of war he also had memories of Christmas  Jones s symbolic journey was a very beautiful ending to the book  He used his memories to get him through danger  5 stars to The Giver  This book is inspiring so much thought about how often we just accept what we ve been told and don t question enough   well some of us  I ve always been the annoying  Why  person    LOL I ve reserved the 2nd installment and I m about to watch the movie    It is good so far and is really interesting  This is one of those books that will forever be fought over by English teachers  Not because any believe it should not be taught  but because from 5th grade on up all want to claim it as  theirs  to teach  and each feels no one else should teach it  In fact  using it with a group of 5th graders I encountered a 6th grade teacher who got angry with me for using it  Oh well  But I believe this is a book that needs to be taught more than once  Like Charlotte s Web  it is a book that can be taught at multiple grades  and each time the students read it they get more out of it  I believe the discussions my 5th graders have had were rich and thought provoking  Do I think they will get more in 6th or 8th grade   yes  That s what makes it a classic   it will forever keep on giving  Avete presente il libro piu sconvolgente  intrigante e commovente che avete mai letto  Bene  cancellatelo dalla vostra memoria perche The Giver di Lois Lowry prendera ben presto il suo posto In breve  questa e la storia di Jonas  Da qualche parte nel tempo e nel mondo esiste una societa che ha scelto come valore l uniformita  Uomini  donne e bambini vivono una realta senza colori  senza sogni  senza emozioni  senza intenzioni  Per loro decide un consiglio di anziani  riunito periodicamente a sancire i passaggi evolutivi dei membri della comunita  Durante la Cerimonia dei 12  che accompagna solennemente gli adolescenti verso la vita adulta affidando loro il mestiere che meglio ne identifica le inclinazioni  Jonas viene destinato ad  accogliere le memorie  di una storia che non ha mai conosciuto Jonas e affidato a un donatore  un uomo anziano e solo che porta dentro di se tutta la bellezza e la tragedia dell umanita  Tutte quelle emozioni negate alla sua gente perche il mondo resti un luogo di pace e torpore  Ma Jonas riesce ben presto a intuire quanto il mondo piatto e omologato in cui ha sempre vissuto sia sbagliato  e cerca di cambiarlo The Giver si rivela essere un libro imponente  E un inno  per contrapposizione all ambientazione  alla liberta  alla fantasia  al libero arbitrio e all inventiva   If you were to be lost in the river  Jonas  your memories would not be lost with you  Memories are forever     After reading The Giver in seventh grade for a literature project  I decided to re read it a little more than a year later with much more enthusiasm and openness  And boy  was it worth it  The amazing dystopian world of The Community invites us into a place of no suffering  no choices  no freedom  But when a boy named Jonas threatens to uncover it all  what kind of outcome will his knowledge bring  Initially  back in seventh grade  I perceived no good things for this book  as it seemed boring at first  But now  it s as riveting as ever  The apple  the faces  Fiona s hair  it all adds up into a magnificent climax between Jonas and The Giver   I loved the character development of Jonas as he begins to understand the truth about memories  about  beyond   about Elsewhere  The story of a near perfect world is discovered to be a not so perfect world with flaws at every corner  The universe Lois Lowry has created immerses you into questions you ask yourself  and the various  What If s   that had crossed my mind while reading this book  This book brought in harsh moments of sadness  How could a utopia have such a blue outcome  Moments throughout the book made me feel for the characters  as if we were Jonas  experiencing the same curiosity and depression he was feeling  Although the ending was a bit vague  it seemed like a beautiful wrap up to such a simple book with provoking themes  This will forever be one of my favorite books  and I can t wait to read the sequel   The book the giver is about a city that is isolated from everywhere  Since the city is so isolated they have like a dictatorship government going on in the city where they get monitored by cameras and a microphone that tells people what to do  SO everyone in the city is assigned a job that they will have to do for the rest of their life  One of the job which is the most important one in the city is to be the giver  The giver a job that only one person gets to carry  The job consistence of a person who is the only person who gets to carry memories of how the world is actually like  For example in the city it is not allowed to rain or snow because its suppose to be a beautiful place but the giver gets to experience those moments  In this book the main character Jonas is chosen to be the giver because the old giver is getting really old and will soon retire  Since the only way to acquire memories that no one else but the giver has he has to go through training which only the giver can give to him  but once the giver gives him the memories the old giver won t remember them anymore  As the book progresses jonas realizes that the city that they he lives in is not great at all  The old giver and jonas then decide to make a plan so that jonas can escape the city and be free because he doesn t want to carry the job as the giver because the painful memories hurt him too much  Jonas started his plan at night because it is harder for the cameras  that the city  has to see him  Once he makes it out of the city without being caught by anyone he makes it to a whole new place and the book ends   I loved the way she writes about such complex ideas  like cultural differences  and socialist ideologies  within the simplicity of a child s perspective  The innocence of the protagonist really makes for a subtle breakdown to her main points  And as Jonas grows with each memory that he receives  the reader starts to develop an understanding for Lowry s main idea   This second time around reading the novel  I actually feel that I understood it better and could be more amazed at how easily she portrayed the importance of individuality  The main takeaway from the story is how pivotal and human the ability to make choices really is  Without that characteristic  we lose the sense of that which makes us who we are  I remember that last time I read the story  I was so hung up on the ending and whether or not it was happy one  This time  I could really be okay with living that possibility open to interpretation  regardless of the fact that other books have built on this story  and instead  focus on what made the  Sameness  philosophy so wrong in my mind   I don t really remember it exactly because I read it a long time ago  but I do remember that it was very good and made me think  Here is a book report I did on it I read The Giver by Lois Lowry  This story takes place in the future in a society that has chosen  sameness   In this society  the people have taken the  sameness  so far that they have gotten rid of color  animals  feelings  and choices  The children in the community are born by women whose job is to have babies  they then spend the first part of their lives in a nurturing center  These babies don t ever get to know their mothers or their birthdays  Couples in the community sign up to receive a child and then are given a child in December when the ceremonies are held  The children are named at these ceremonies and then handed off to a  family unit    Each December  at the ceremonies  the children in each age group earn a new privilege  The ceremony of twelve is by far the most important  At twelve  the children become adults and are given the careers chosen for them by the elders  The children are then required to begin training for that career   Feelings are totally eliminated in this futuristic society  In fact  citizens are required to take pills to eliminate feelings  There is no pain or war  In fact  all of the people basically go through life routinely  being careful to follow all of the community s pointless rules  Because feelings are eliminated  a person has to sign up to get married and the elders of the community choose who they are married to   The Giver begins when Jonas is at the ceremony of twelve  wondering what the elders have chosen for his future  He is nervous  but he knows that the elders will choose what is best for him  After a long wait  it is time for him to be called onto the stage to receive his career  but his name is skipped  Once everyone else s names are called  Jonas s name is finally called and he is told that he is to be the Receiver of Memory  a job requiring intelligence  integrity  courage  and wisdom  a job where Jonas is entrusted with the memories of how life was before  sameness  was chosen  The Giver was a very thought provoking book  It made me ask questions like  Could we ever become like this   Think about it  with all of the peer pressure to fit in  what if we all tried too hard to fit in and became the same  In The Giver  it is considered rude to talk about anything that is different about somebody  That is not too far off from how we re so scared to share our faiths or beliefs because we re afraid it would be awkward  However  if we all act like we don t believe in anything  then we all are the same and there are no differences  What if we all were so sensitive to other s feelings that we didn t express our own  Would feelings be erased altogether  What if we were so afraid to experience pain in our lives that we missed out on all the joy too  What if people became so evil that we had to have elders make all of our choices for us  What if  what if  what if     The Giver reminded me of some other books that I have read  It reminded me of the book  The City of Ember because in The City of Ember  the children get jobs when they are very young and don t get to choose their career  Even more than The City of Ember  The Giver reminded me of The Last Sin Eater by Francine Rivers  In The Last Sin Eater  a sin eater was chosen to take upon himself the burden of everybody s sins  In both books  one person was chosen to go through pain for the sake of everyone else  In The Giver  Jonas was shocked when he learned that the Old of the city and the babies that didn t grow quickly enough were killed  At first this seemed cruel to me  I wondered   What kind of a person would do something like that   Then  I realized that people do the same thing in our society today  You might be wondering what I mean  You might be asking   What do you mean  All murderers go to jail   but countless babies get aborted everyday because they aren t wanted  Once a child is conceived  it is a living being  completely reliant on its mother  The fact that many mothers kill the beings that rely on them for life is heartbreaking  Even people who declare themselves pro life kill  The Bible says in Matthew 5 21 22a   You have heard that it was said to the people long ago   Do not murder  and anyone who murders will be subject to judgment   But I tell you that anyone who is angry with his brother will be subject to judgment    I most relate to the character Jonas  Jonas wasn t allowed to tell anyone about the memories that he received from the Giver  Even if he was allowed to  they wouldn t have understood  This is similar to how I have Jesus Christ  the only source of true joy  and I see people all around me who think that they have joy in their possessions and social life when what they re experiencing is only temporary happiness   I found it funny how preciseness of language was so stressed in that society  For example  Jonas s seven year old sister  Lily said   My Childcare group was at the play area  and we had a visiting group of Sevens  and they didn t obey the rules at all   In our society  it would be more common for a seven year old to say something more along the lines of  The kids from the other town were bad   Imagine how people from The Giver would react to our use of language  where we tell each other that we re starved when lunch is late  Overall  I really enjoyed reading this book  I would recommend it to anyone  even if they don t normally enjoy reading science fiction  I don t usually enjoy reading science fiction either  but this book is an exception  The thing about science fiction that usually turns me off is mythical creatures  spells  curses  and wizards  but The Giver did not have any of that  This book was recommended to me  and so far I have recommended it to four other people  Now  I recommend The Giver to you  It s a great book  It was a quick ad easy read for me I really like it Maybe because It was easy to read for me But at the same time I enjoyed reading it as well It is about a boy called Jonas who lives in a community where everything is the same He doesn t know anything about other life styles except the one he knows Until Giver makes his eyes open to a new way of life This book makes me think that we have lots of things even very simple things in our lives but since we got used to them we don t know how important they are  or simply we don t enjoy them  Things such as love friendship every kind of feeling ability to decide for yourself nature different colors even to be different is very wonderful sometimes  This is one of my favorite books  It follows a boy Jonas who lives in a society of black and white where all jobs are chosen at the age of twelve years old  Everything in Jonas s life seems simple but when he is chosen to be the receiver  he will soon find out that the life he knows is not all good like he has always believed  This is an excellent read for fourth grade on up  I read this book in the seventh grade as a whole class for English and I fell in love with it  As a reread it as an adult  I still think it is a wonderful piece of literature  All teachers should have this book in their classroom library   I loved this book  Somehow  I escaped reading it in middle school  but all of my friends  who were apparently in more accelerated classes than I was  read it and loved it  I did not understand why they loved it so much because it seemed really boring to me  I thought that a book with a black and white photo of an old man on the cover could not possibly be interesting  I literally judged a book by its cover and was happily proven wrong  Right before I read this book  my friends and I saw the movie in theaters  I really liked the movie and so did my friends who had read the book  They thought it was a faithful adaption to the novel and after reading it  so did I  Since I saw the movie before I read the book  I saw the movie s world in my mind s eye while I was reading the novel s text  I do not think this diminished by enjoyment of the novel  It merely enhanced my understanding of the story and filled in blanks left by the movie  But enough about the movie  let s talk about the actual book  The concept was very intriguing to me and felt like a Twilight Zone episode  I found myself understanding why the Elders wanted Sameness  If everything is the same  then there could be no hurt  loss  or pain in the world  Terrible things like wars  broken hearts  rape  homelessness  and bullying would be avoided  Is that such a horrible thing  This is a community that I would want to live in and I stand by that opinion  As to be expected  as the novel went on  I liked it less and less  The more Jonas bemoaned his community and longed for the customs of my world  the more irritated I became that Jonas could not appreciate his life the way I appreciated it  I became less connected with Jonas and even began to feel indifferent towards his story  I have no idea what happens in the sequels but I would love to see Jonas meet a Receiver of Memory who thinks the community is better than the world used to be  Now let s talk about Jonas   family   Why did Jonas love Gabe  but did not love his own family  I know that Jonas is not related to his family by blood  but that does not exclude them from being a family  Family does not mean you share a family tree  It means that you share love  shared experiences  and the various ups and downs of life  My friends are my family  If I am in a play  my cast mates are my family  Jonas had just met Gabe and he was a baby who could not even talk  On the other hand  Jonas spent twelve years with his father  mother  and sister who all enjoyed his company and took pride in his accomplishments  And I firmly believe that they did love him  but did not use that word because they did not understand what it meant  Why should Jonas decide that he does not love his family just because they do not have the same mindset as him  My brother loves me  but does he like me  No  he doesn t  Do I like him  Of course I do  He is my brother and I love him completely even if he doesn t return the affection in the same way Despite this  I still loved the novel  I loved the little things thrown in to describe this world  such as taking pills to control your sex drive and being assigned a family  It was very fun    This unique book stands alone in originality  It is a story of courage  perseverance  commitment  and vision  The reader is left with haunting images and questions for reflection  I can t describe how much I love this book because it isn t just a normal dystopian book  In my opinion it shows us that we have to value the small things in life  While I was reading it  I started to observe little things of which I would normally simply pass by  I wanted to absorb the colours I saw because in the book there are none and I just felt like I had to give simple things a meaning  It is not only colours  but far more things of which I will now give more attention to it For me the plot wasn t that important but I feel like the author just gave me just a new viewpoint of certain things and I hope he did or will do the same to you   In a dystopian universe  Jonas must be placed into a job he must work in for the rest of his life  He s never been interested in anything in particular  and is shocked when he is chosen to be the Giver   the person who holds the memories of civilizations for as long as they can be saved  He becomes apprentice to the current Giver  and uses his knowledge to understand color and love  and to save a baby boy  the weaker of two newborn twins  from being killed This book man  It s a damn classic  Fucking read it  Ay  me parecio hermoso  aunque me quede medio mal con ese final  me encanto  me hizo pensar en cosas muy raras y lindas     I m so glad I reread this before the movie comes out  I think this was the first dystopian book I read  and that was in 2008  I liked it then  but I loved it this time  It s amazing to me to see how many writers have been influenced by this story whether intentionally or not  So many dystopian books mimic this story or themes from this story  But what I find interesting is that over and over again futuristic books create a world where freedom of choice is limited  Choosing to experience life at it s fullest is repeatedly controlled by some greater power  and protagonists fight for the right to feel and be all the best kind of human they can be  and they fight for those same rights for others  I love The Giver and the idea that someone could carry the weight of the worlds memories  good and bad  alone  I love the Receiver  and the idea that life can only be enriching when we share our feelings  hopes  joys  pain  etc  with each other  To bear one another s burdens and help each other live life to the fullest is what The Giver is all about  I highly recommend reading this book even if you ve already read it  This book is pretty unique in terms of children s fiction  because though the story is easily understandable  it s also has a very rich message to offer  Emotion is powerful  but emotion is what makes life worth living  although the pain may be sometimes unbearable  The reader is presented with a Utopia  no one there is unhappy  but it lacks any sort of strong emotion or feeling  There s no war  but every marriage is arranged by the government  and the people support this   Those who say the message is too simplistic and easily found  consider the book for what it is  a children s book  It s not The Infinite Jest  it doesn t have to be mind bendingly complex to reach its audience  The best thing about the Giver is the subtlety used by Lowry to evoke emotion from the reader  She almost never just comes out and tells the reader what s going on  which is quite rare for a book marketed mostly for elementary kids   and her power of description is unmatched  Those who leave feeling confused  maybe try to take the story as more of a parable or fable rather than the typical format of most fiction  many meticulous truths surrounding one lie   Lowry opts to keep things uncomplicated and free of exposition  which is a breath of fresh air in Sci fi  She doesn t need to explain why Jonas is able to hold all the world s memories because frankly it s not relevant  She doesn t need to explain how this society has managed to sequester itself from the rest of the world because it s not relevant  She doesn t need to define just how exactly they removed color from life  but it isn t important  If you re still left confused or annoyed  try to read again  this time trying to delve deeper into the text  rather than skimming the surface and questioning frankly irrelevant details  Wow  What a great way to spend a couple of hours on a Saturday morning  Can t believe I hadn t read this before  Loved it   This book has been on my list for years because of its  banned  status in various places across the country  So in honor of banned books week and because I belatedly found out it was made into a movie  I decided to finally read it  This book is most easily one of the best in dystopian literature I believe for young children to be introduced into this genre  It asks a lot of questions and it proposes that the reader ask even more questions I think anyone and everyone should give this book a chance to open their eyes for even a moment and allow them to ask the tough questions about both our society and our world   To tell you the truth  I cannot understand the 1st part of the story but as I go with the flow I can say that the giver is one of my favorite book  It is an outside world and a very wide imagination of the author Lois Lowry  Their community was really fantastic  I like the idea of releasing somebody to the elsewhere and only one person holds the memory and that is Jonas the main character  I also like the organization of their community life  work  family and so on  But still I don t want it to be happen in OUR real world  And you guys should read this   This book is about a boy who experiences strong  deep  and sincerely felt emotions at a young age for the very first time while growing up in a community that is  literally  devoid of emotions  Beautiful  Listened to this as an audiobook on the drive from Utah to Missouri  Somehow  up until this point I had managed to keep my knowledge about what this story was about to a minimum  I hadn t seen the movie or anything  Based on the picture of the old man as the cover  it certainly wasn t what I was expecting at all  The story was all the things I love  dystopia  learning  adventure  growing  bravery  It added a great appreciation for the simple things in life that bring us joy  which I m sure was the point   The only complaint is the extreme cliffhanger of an ending  but that is what gets us to read on   I do not think I had ever read this book although I am pretty sure it was required reading at some point for my sons  The Giver makes you think  A lot  There are so many levels that this book can take you to  The  Sameness   The idea of  Elsewhere   The  Giver  himself  I think that most likely every person who reads this book will have something different to take away from it  For some it is a clear cut allegory of God and his love for us  To others it would take on a more mystical quality and provoke questions that need to be answered  That  to me  is the proof of a good piece of literature  One that can evoke different ideas and interpretations out of the same reading matter for everyone who reads it  The ended is left open ended    and for good reason  The author wants us to be left thinking about what the conclusion is  And quite honestly   it will be different for everyone  A very thought provoking read and highly recommended no matter what your age  My book is  The Giver  by Lois Lowry it was about this town or city that had many different laws from today in the book at 12 years old they gave you jobs and school was very strict  the book was a dystopia meaning it was an imperfect world  The main characters were  Jonas  Lily  Gabriel  Asher  and of course  The Giver  In the beginning the reader just learns about the setting of the story what happens in that area and get to  dip your toe in the water  at the characters  as the story progresses you learn what really happens there and get to learn the importance of the giver and the receiver The author did a magnificent job creating this story  The story really hit me at the heart later in the story you will have to read to find out  I learned that home is where the heart is and you actually can choose your family  it s who is closest to you and who you care for a lot  I think this book should be read by anybody who is older the the age of 12 because  the plot might be a challenge for some people to catch on to  I would have to give this book a 5 due to the fact that the author really hit me at the heart with the words she used writing this book  I loved the characters they seemed so real  I think the only thing I didn t enjoy  was it not having a sequel  Amazing book  Very reflective  I can feel this is one of the original  distopian  stories and if you like those books like  The Hunger Games  and others that are very popular right now  you should defenitely read this because  in my opinion  this is the basis for all those stories  Would definitely read again  I had started The Giver on Decemeber 2nd and finished on December 5th  I thought the book was just MIND BLOWING  It was so great  I thought it was interesting how the characters in the story were all put into groups like as fives  sixes  sevens and etc  they were being labeled basically and as each year passed they went up into a new level  It kinds of reminds me of when I was in school and you would go up each year into a new grade level until you were all done   Anyway  everyone had a special duty to do but they were given that duty that didn t even get to chose their fate   apparently all the careers they got were  honored  except if you were a Birthmother or Laborer  The highest honor is to become a  Receiver  and apparently that is a very very rare duty to have  The only other  Reciever  is this old beareded man who Jonas  the boy who becomes the next one  calls this man  the Giver   Point is    This book explained so much  and it really makes you think of real life  In the book I was kind of frustrated because Jonas had to carry so much while everyone else was so clueless to what was happening around them and they only did as they were taught and told  The book gets more interesting once you get a little more into it  I really liked it and thought this is a five star rating  You really have to read more into this book to find out what else happens because there is more than I am saying   I m not that good at explaining the  why I like this and that  kind of thing     my review  Jonas lives in a world where everything is perfect   No war   no hunger   no jealousy   The ideal world we all wish for   right   but that all changes when Jonas is chosen to be the new reciever of memory  A memory reciever is someone who can see  things  that are  beyond words   beyond explanations   and beyond our mere imagination   That s when Jonas  see the reality that has been covered the entire time and how he reacts to it all   Cant we have more books like this   like seriosuly this book made me wonder and think for an entire day   I really loved how this story was going and how the events were put together   I really loved Jonas s character and his personality   I can see why he was choosen as the memory reciever   and that is because he is different from the  other characters   He is curious and demands for that life that was stolen from him and his people   You could feel the tense parts   the happy parts   and the funny parts while you re reading   I read that the author wrote this book for all ages   even kids  but then she got emails and letters from teens and adults saying that they liked this book   I do think that children could read this book but i dont think they would grasp the deep meaning behind the story   You can read the rest of my review at http   thebookhunter0 weebly com book    Thank you and enjoy       The Giver has to be one of my all time favorite books  I first read it my freshman year of high school  and at least five times since  I just love the imagery  it just one of the books that you can finish in no time because you get lost in it   The Giver has recently been made into a film  and so  with the suggestion of one of my 6th grade teachers I picked the book up to see what the story was like  and wasn t disappointed in the slightest The Giver is a morally driven and interesting story about a young boy called Jonas who lives in a society free of crime and sadness  At the age of 12  children are assigned their jobs  which they will train for and do for the rest of their lives  Everything is chosen  from your parents to your partner  Jonas stands apart from the community when he is chosen to become the new  Memory Keeper   Society has been kept free of all the negative aspects of life because for as long as it has been formed  there has been someone who holds all the bad and good memories of the past within them  This is both bad and good for the inhabitants because  although they are protected from harm  they are also not exposed to the wonderful aspects of life I thoroughly enjoyed this book because  even though it is supposed to be more of a children s book than young adult  the storyline is complex enough to hold the attention of older readers  I really enjoyed Jonas as a character because his character development from a scared boy  to someone willing to risk his future to save the community  which is an enjoyable journey to follow  This book shows the path of growing up  at first we are scared to accept that there are new responsibilities  but as we slowly get used to it we want to move more and more away from childhood Throughout the book  Jonas  loss of trust in his parents is also important in communicating the morals of the story  At the beginning  when Jonas is a normal child in the community  he trusts his parents completely as is expected  However  after The Giver shows Jonas the tape of his Father  releasing  a new born child  a process in which the child is killed and disposed of  Jonas ultimately loses his trust and admiration of his father  This moment is what forces Jonas to leave the community  even before The Giver has planned for him to  I enjoyed this transition in Jonas because he begins to defy the life which is set out for him  It is symbolic of the change from the innocent mind of a child into the questioning and educated mind of an adult The ambiguity of the ending is also another aspect which makes this book interesting to read  There are two possible meanings behind the ending  either Jonas and Gabriel freeze to death together on the sled  or they have really found  Elsewhere   But  the ending still shows us that  whatever happens  Jonas has made choices for himself rather than being told what to do  Whatever happens to him  it is still better than his life in the community would ever have been The community is a metaphor for restriction and censoring  it limits the choices of an individual until they have none left  removing joy from life  By leaving the community Jonas has already made an individual choice  and this demonstrates to the reader that it is better to live your life the way you would like to  than be held back by others and never really be happy  I think this is an important message for children and young adults today  as experiences such as bullying in schools limit people from being themselves This book was easily read in a couple of days because of its simple but gripping storyline and its interesting characters  The Giver was so powerful because it s one of a rare few young adult books which leaves the ending up to you  The ending of The Giver is powerful because we have a choice in what it means  just as Jonas made a sacrificial choice for the good of the community  you have to decide for yourself too I would recommend this book to anyone who loves dystopian worlds  and well as people who like a book to let them think for themselves  The Giver taught me how important some of the things i take for granted are  I never thought that being different could be a privilege  For example  some of my friends and I wear miss matched socks everyday  It s part of our everyday routine  it s what makes us unique and different from others  If I couldn t have that  or the beauty of seeing color  or  my favorite  hearing beautiful music  I don t know who I d be  The Giver also taught me the power of my choices  and the impact that they make  It made me stop and think about the consequences of my actions  because free will always comes with the burden of our actions  consequences  The Giver was a thought provoking book that I really loved  Lois Lowry did a magnificent job writing The Giver and delivering a story for a young audience that has an impact in whoever picks up the book to read it Is it a dystopia  It seems like one but it s written in such a paced way that when you reach the peak point  when you come across what Jonas has to do and the choices he has to make  it takes your breath away and brings tears to your eyes  It s unlike anything I ve read before  soft but demanding  slow but strong  contundent  even if you re left with the feeling something is missing  or it s not definitive  Summary  The Giver by Lois Lowry is a half science fiction novel about a utopian society  half emotional journey regarding the consequences of living in said society with the main character  Jonas  told in third person by a narrator that is never mentioned  The plot of the novel revolves totally around Jonas  thoughts and feelings  On the outside  Jonas and his family appear to be living in an isolated utopia  a perfect world where there is no disease  hunger  war  pain or sadness  People are unfailing nice  everyone gets along  there is little or no suffering or strife  But on the inside  as we delve deeper into the book  we learn that actually Jonas  community is very flawed  His mother  father and sister are not biologically related to him  Couples are matched together  kind of like an arranged marriage  and as a family unit  may apply for children  which they do not conceive themselves  Grandparents and familial relationships in general do not exist and every person in the community is assigned a specific role as their career  Jonas  mother works for the Department of Justice and his father is a Nurturer  who takes care of newborns  Each year  beginning at age eight  children begin volunteering in different areas of the community to be carefully observed by the Committee of Elders  their government  in order to be placed into their life long job where they  best fit  at the age of twelve  Our main character  Jonas  although he is unsure about where his placement will be at the beginning of the novel  is given the highest position in the community at his Ceremony of Twelve  The Receiver of Memory  As Jonas begins his training as the new Receiver of Memory  he learns about his assigned position from his mentor  an older man who lives alone with thousands of books  that he calls The Giver  The Giver passes down memories  emotions and experiences to Jonas  for safe keeping  which other people within the community have  given up  in order to create Sameness  He does this through a series of sessions where he places his hands on Jonas  back and  transfers  the memories from his mind to Jonas   After only a handful of sessions  Jonas becomes infuriated with the facade that his society is putting on  He feels that they are cowards for giving up their right to think and feel as individuals  but rather letting someone else tell them how to think and act  Therefore he and The Giver combined come up with a plan to deconstruct the lies that The Committee is in place to protect  after a little boy Jonas  family is fostering is scheduled to be  released   killed   Their plan involves Jonas leaving the community for Elsewhere  in order for all of the memories that he has obtained to be transmitted back into the people of his community  Jonas and the little boy  Gabriel  escape from the community but the ending of the book is left to be ambiguous  Response  Although I am aware of the fact that this book is often taught in middle school  I actually read it in 5th grade  I think that its depth makes it justifiable to be taught to highschoolers  This book is so rich and provokes so much thought about what truly  makes us human  that I would love to teach it one day  I think re reading it I got a lot more out of it than I did when I was so young  I couldn t appreciate all of its complicated themes back then  Without pain  there can be no happiness  without suffering there can be no true joy  This may seem like a radical critique of popular culture  but the idea of a utopia where everyone feels and thinks the same way doesn t seem too far fetched from the way the media groups and labels everything everyone in our society today   just a thought  I think that this book is brilliant and it deserves to be taught  It really pulls on all of the strings of the imagination  3 Critical Questions  1  The end of the novel is left to be ambiguous  like I stated above  As Jonas and Gabriel sled towards the Christmas lights WHAT HAPPENS    Lowry really knows how to break her reader s hearts  2  What time period is the book supposed to be set in  Although we are given clues to the fact it is set in a technologically advanced future  we are never really told when  3  Is Rosemary The Giver s biological daughter  or assigned daughter  They both have blue eyes   which is very rare in their community  I like the personality of the main character  Jonas  He gains so much depth when he starts receiving from the Giver  But the world they live in makes me upset because of the lack of everything  pain  color  happiness  music  and love Although I was not a big fan of the ending  I think it stopped kind of abruptly  After such a lengthy story line  which I enjoyed   the end was slightly disappointing  I do wonder where the story takes place  and what would lay beyond their community I also wonder what would have happened if Jonas had stayed for the two extra weeks  Maybe their plan would have been more successful  I do have some questions that will go unanswered Where did Jonas and Gabriel go What happened to the community after they received the memories Did Gabriel grow up Are they the son s of the Giver Part of the whole point of the book  I believe  is to let the reader come up with the answer to some of those questions  Really enjoyed reading this book  This was one that I needed to finish and not put down  Quick  well written book  LOVED this book   The Giver by Lois Lowry is Jonas who lives in a weird little community  where everything is just perfect  Everything is already done for them  like picking the right job  But when Jonas is assigned to be the new Receiver of Memory  he meets his teacher the Giver  Jonas learns about colors  books  and even pain  The Giver shows Jonas a different side of the world that he never knew  He realizes that everything is wrong and is done the wrong way in his community  Will Jonas make a change in his community  Or will he just run away from all of it to find the real world  The main character in The Giver  Jonas was really original  I say this because I have never read about a character like Jonas  Jonas  character was pretty well rounded  Lois Lowry spent a good amount of time telling us about Jonas  family and etc  Jonas was very considerate when it came to Gabriel s releasing situation  Jonas was also troubled when he saw one of the twins  releases  He was also puzzled and frustrated about it  But in the end these were the things that made him more strong and valiant  In the end Jonas also became multidimensional  because he changed from the beginning to the end  The beginning of The Giver was plodding because the first scene was really stretched out and boring  Yet the book was interesting and suspenseful in many parts because it really made me want to read further and it put me on the edge of my seat  I also found the book unrealistic because a community like that can t exist  I thought the story was well thought out but sometimes the book got aggravating because many parts of the book were unexpected  The sub plots tied together well and the ending was pretty decent  The Giver was very descriptive  I could really picture the scenes in my head and everything  For example  the snow memory made me feel like I was inside the story  The book did not have pictures at all  The vocabulary was complex which was good  The style of writing was really original and there were only a few parts where they had plain words  not poetic   Overall  I thought the author did an amazing job with this book and I would recommend it to any person who likes fantasy kind of fiction  Or anyone who likes a mystery and suspenseful book  My opinion changed from the beginning of the book to the end and now this book has become one of my favorites     finished this novel in one day its pretty short but totally addicting a total must read  I was about to write  I can t believe I missed reading this when I was in the target audience    it s a YA novel  but then I realized it was published after I graduated college  I think that excuses me for my tardy reading of this book Loved it  Fairly standard utopia dystopia narrated by an awakening  independent spirit    but very well done  I just realized it s part of a trilogy  so I ll be finding the others  I LOVED this book  read it since I see it everywhere and the movie is coming out  the book doesnt explain everything and the end is a bit open ended  But it was an interesting story  debating on seeing the movie but a bit disappointed that not a single thing in the trailer is a scene from the book except maybe two or three scenes  probably going to be a young adult hunger games theme even though Jonas is supposed to be 12 but maybe itll be better than it looks  plan on reading the next books in the series I loved this boos series   I thought it was amazing I loved how Louis Lowry wrote them all   Once I finished this book I new it couldn t have ended like that without another book   Most people don t know about the others   I would DEFIANTLY suggest the others   I loved how Jonah was different from everyone   That he went against everyone to save Gabe   I feel it showed even though you are grown into a society or believing that everyone has to do something a specific way   That you can be your own person   You don t have to believe in what everyone else does   That you can be your own person   That you should do what you believe is right   She is a great writer   I m so happy I read all of her books   I will say I did get attached to all of her characters   loves the way she described them   As looking weak   making them strong in the end   If you haven t read the other books please do   It all comes together in the end   Jonas  and everyone in his community make few choices on their own  relying on the wisdom of their society s council for guidance on everything from clothing to job placement to marriage and children  The council provided  a life where nothing was ever unexpected  Or inconvenient  Or unusual  The life without color  pain  or past   What will Jonas do when he discovers these things for himself The Giver  which won the Newberry Award in 1994  is a dystopian tale with lasting relevance  Jonas is a well developed character and Lowry s world building is sound  thorough  and thought provoking  A quick read for dystopian newbies who are unsure where to get started  it still has a lot of meat for veterans of more recent dystopian titles like  Divergent  Savvy readers might find connections in Plato s  Republic  or the 1999 cult hit movie  The Matrix  To place

in high school and had passed young adult literature behind years ago  I ve seen on countless summer reading collections  but never knew a thing about it until it was on sale for Kindle for  0 25 a few days ago  This book presents a utopia that asks the reader to decide if life is better if the highs and lows  along with art  color  love  and physical intimacy  could be removed and everything is the same  In the society in The Giver there is no poverty  almost no crime  and everyone has a purpose  but this society is built upon the control and elimination of real emotions and any differences  There are no hills  it never rains  and all children of the same age wear the same outfit  Sameness  I won t go into the plot here  as I m sure it is familiar to most  but I do want to mention the profound emotional connection I had with the protagonist Jonas  especially when he learns the truth of his society and the lie of releasing  I think many people will be disappointed with the ending  but I loved the ambiguity  I m looking forward to reading the following two books in the series and have already submitted a hold on Gathering Blue from the library   The book The Giver is a book describing a society that is heavily controlled by the  Elders   Everything in this small  city  is controlled  The people can t even see colors  They call it sameness Released in 1993 Lois Lowry wrote about 12 year old Jonas who figures out that the Utopia that he lives in is not such a great paradise  Now it s up to Jonas to figure out the reasons behind the Elders elaborate scheme to keep people in the dark about the wonders of humanity  Some things I liked about the Giver was how the Elders literally took everything away from the people to the extent of taking away colors  In the world we live in  this idea would be marked off as outrageous  but it is so cool to imagine about that kind of life  Another cool fact was how he gained is knowledge from his mentor  I m trying to avoid spoilers so I won t say how this occurred  but the way he became aware of the world was another impossible but cool feat An audience who I think would really like this book would be people who liked The Hunger Games  They would like this book because both books are set in a scenario with an extremely tyrannic  government  that controls every aspect of their lives  Honestly  everyone would love this book  It is a truly great book with many great twists and turns and keeps you reading until the last word  The Giver I was about to rate this book 4 stars  but then came to think about it again  this book was first published in 1993  at the time I was in my 2nd year in the elementary school  I was practically about six years old   and then I was trying to picture myself as sixes  just like in the book    then suddenly I felt being transported to the alternate universe described in the book   and it was such a crazy feeling   and I can t for the love of God gave this book 4 stars   it s a full 5 stars read for me  I love how this book so small yet so mindblowing at the same time  It felt I was part of the story  This story made me think more than 400 smth pages other YA dystopian books could  It has all the key elements of great messages for young generation about love  courage  caring  and all those feels incld  pains  I don t know how Lois Lowry could do it  put everything that sometime take thicker book more than 300 pages to describe in this compact 220 pages of tiny book and gave all this thoughts and feels  It was a great reading adventure for me I need to watch the movie really soon   Upon finishing my first reading of The Giver  I now can see what all the hubbub and buzz is about  The story focuses on Jonas  who is the new Receiver  but he becomes a  Giver  at the end  in a sense  by giving his memories to the community  by giving his life for a cause  and by giving memories to Gabriel  In the story  the family unit was an artificial family selected by the Elders  Its role was to raise children by the rules  The children were assigned to each set of parents  and when the children were old enough  the parents were removed to a home for childless parents  Here there were not really any obvious natural connections among family members  or even love in general  There were no grandparents or feeling of continuousness  life just seemed to cut off abruptly  and this aspect along with a few others proved to be difficult to conceptually grasp  In the midst of reading  I found myself catching on to the utopia feeling  or is it a dystopia  Are we reading of the perfect place to live or the worst  These are just a few of many questions I was left wondering  so I might have to read this book again to fully grasp all aspects  I vote for the reading of this book  and I support it  1st read  4th grade2nd read  1 20 2016 1  Junior Novel  Science Fiction 2  This story is about the life and those that involved in the circle of life around 11  turns 12  year old Jonas  Jonas  lifestyle is nothing what we are used to  each person in the community is assigned a specific role when they turn 12 and from there they train in live out their lives in this role  Jonas is assigned a special role when he turns twelve and this is the story of what results  3  Critique A  The setting of this story is very interesting  B  The idea that this world is one without freedom of choice and decision making when it comes to their lives is extremely new and fundamental to the storyline  The setting is important to understand for the readers and Lowry does an excellent job of providing the details necessary for comprehension of the story s perspective and details C  It may be difficult for what Jonas is going through  but the idea of their unique society is always present in The Giver  Even when Jonas struggles with his new job as the receiver  he begins to question the parts of his life and why they are how they are  Jonas is curious about things he has heard about the world like crime and murder  Lowry clearly shows the significant difference a society that is free from all of these issues can have  Also  the different issues that arise  despite the  bad things  being non existant in Jonas  world demonstrates how conflict is unescapable in a world with humans  4  Curriculum Connection This story could be used in early Middle school or even in 5th grade for readers to compare and contrast the settings of Jonas  world to our world  The idea could also be taken to examine the differences between cultures in different countries and even those within the state of Virginia   I never read this book in high school  it wasn t on any of my required reading lists  I have to say  Im sorry that it took me so long to finally read it  What an amazing book  I absolutely devoured it  reading it all in a day  The book is centered around a society decides to give up the memories of their collective experiences  leaving them in one Receiver s mind to preserve and pass down from generation to generation  Forgetting allows the people of the society to forget all of the pain that had been suffered throughout human history and live in peace and harmony  But  at a price  There is no love either  because without pain  the society does not know love and happiness or know to value pleasure  There are no colors  no diversity no beauty  The novel brings up so many questions about life  experience and memory  So  my question about the novel that remains  do you believe that Jonas and Gabriel have escaped the physical boundaries of their society and discovered a new village  or is the his vision of the village is only a hallucination and he and Gabriel freeze to death in the snow   Jonas lives in a perfect society  no pain  no crime  no unhappiness  But when he receives his life assignment to be the Receiver of Memories  he discovers secrets about the past  and the terrible choices that make this world possible  In the perfect future world in which Jonas lives  twelve year old children are given their life assignments at the Ceremony of Twelve  Jonas is shocked when he is chosen to be the new Receiver of Memories  a mysterious position of honor held by only one person at a time  He is trained by the previous Receiver  now called the Giver  The training consists of transferring to him memories of a past  before the imposition of Sameness  that the others in the community can t even imagine  in which there was war  hunger  and disease  but also color  weather  and strong emotions  Gradually Jonas comes to understand  and resent  the choices that had to be made to create his world  and the terrible secrets behind its perfection  Together he and the Giver think of a plan to change the way his world works  but before they can carry it out Jonas is forced to make a decision that may destroy them all  I think The Giver is a wonderful book  I read it in high school and again a few days ago  Both times I couldn t put it down  It is a very thoughtful story  The author creates an uneasy feeling that something is wrong with this perfect world  I love this book  and I encourage everyone to read it  I think this book promotes thinking about issues of free will and choice  I think this book would help kids understand the benefits of our society as they compare contrast the society in the book   I really liked this book  It started as and English assignment  but within a short period of time  I was taking it home and reading it independently  Overall this book was thought provoking and uplifting  as it gave us a different view and ideas of a corrupt society that is reminiscent of other post apocalyptic stories  yet entirely it s own universe  The ending was quite puzzling  but in a fun and complex way  It left you thinking  and I have heard many debates over the way it closed  While I think the characters could have been more in depth  and more defined  I do believe that the author  Lois Lowry  utilized the characters existing traits clearly to demonstrate their abilities and strengths to help carry the story along  There were little to no dull points  I do not think the trailer for the new movie brings this book justice   I wish more of Fiona was explained  but I still think she added to the story  The remainder of the characters were inferior to the main character  Jonas  but they still contributed  The book was quite short  and may only take a little while to read  I strongly suggest this book for someone who is looking for an entertaining  entrancing  and quick story  Loved  loved  loved  It couldn t have been any better  I mean  anything is possible  but this was mind capturing  and that s what I like in books    Tanto e tanto e tanto tempo fa   Significava che niente sarebbe cambiato  Mai  Avevo sentito parlare decisamente bene di questo libro  strano che sia cosi poco popolare  forse perche non e commerciale  altrimenti non me lo riesco a spiegare  Assomiglia un po ai libri di Orwell  certo senza essere a quei livelli si capisce  soprattutto in certi punti sembra sulla scia di 1984  La trama e bella e coinvolgente  carina l idea del passaggio dei ricordi ed in effetti mi chiedevo perche una societa che vuole dimenticare dolore e sofferenza  ma anche amore e gioa tenga quei ricordi vivi dentro una persona  L ho capito quando Rosemary e morta e i suoi ricordi hanno vagato  liberi  tra la gente  allora la figura del Donatore ha un senso Dato che l ho divorato non faccio fatica ad ammettere che mi e piaciuto  molto intenso e anche ben scritto Un velo opaco gli scivolo lento sugli occhi Il silenzio lo avvolse Ma il rumore tutt intorno continuava  le grida dei feriti che imploravano acqua e madre e morte  le strida dei cavalli abbattuti che inarcava no il collo e scalciavano folli contro il cielo In lontananza  Jonas udi il rombo dei cannoni  Sopraffatto dalla sofferenza  resto disteso in quel marciume per ore  ascoltando uomini e bestie morire  apprendendo il significato della parola guerra E finalmente  quando capi di non poter sopportare oltre  onde evitare di invocare lui stesso la morte  apri gli occhi e si ritrovo ancora una vo ta sul letto delle memorie Il Donatore distolse lo sguardo da lui  come se non potesse sopportare la vista di cio che gli aveva fatto   Perdonami   fu tutto cio che riusci a dire  I d heard of the author Lois Lowry  and her  Number the Stars  book  although I hadn t read it myself  I thought this book was something similar  historical   I had no idea it was a science fiction dystopian tale  written before dystopian books became the latest trend   This was a pretty powerful read  While it seems to be a YA book  I think adults seem to appreciate it more  I m not sure what my boys would think  I did mention a few things from the book to them to see if it might catch their interest  I just borrowed this from the library  but I think it s one I might like to own in our personal library  It s interesting how at first  the community seems like a utopia  a perfect  controlled place  I ll admit  I like routine  control  I m not big on the ups and downs of life  Sometimes I think I would prefer a place where life was so easy  The book does a good job of showing the horrific complications I m not sure how the story would stand up to analysis  there has to be some suspension of disbelief  HOW do they take away color      and that BTW reminded me of the movie  Pleasantville  which definitely had some similar themes  I m not sure how I feel about the end     I see that there are more books  but they don t seem to be a continuation of THIS story  I do find I really long to find out what happened to the boys  and also to the town     As a recipient of Newbery Medal  this book surely did not disappoint me  well written with clear plot and personality of main characters  I actually saw the movie before reading the book  which is highly unlikely event  However  I will always cherish the memory of watching thr movie in the pool deck of Royal Caribbean cruise ship in the middle of Atlantic ocean  soooo cold that nobody showed up except for the brave Lee girls  under thousands of brilliant stars    all wrapped with beach towels like mummies sipping hot coco     Memories like that cannot be re created even if I try    Anyhow  as always  book was BETTER than the movie  although movie was well made  I would love to read the sequel and prequel of this wonderful children s literature   I read  The giver  and realized how interesting reading can be  This book features a plot and a setting that I have never read before  The setting of this book is in a place called utopia  A perfect world with no pain and sadness  Each year the leaders of the town assign new jobs to the young adults ready to start their adult hood  But this year is different  This year is the year of a special job for a special person that is the only one that can take on this job  This job isn t like just any other job and it isn t given out every year  Read and find out what happens to the new person assigned the most important job in the community  In this book many moments they experience will be heartbroken but others will be joyful  If you are looking for a non typical fiction book I suggest you let your eyes and imagination experience one of the most interesting books I have read  and I bet I could say the same for others  It is totally worth reading  It didn t take very long to read this book but each time I sat down and laid my eyes on the fine print I really got into the book and felt like I was living in the same community as Jonas  the main character  The plot of this story is very slow pace  Each chapter unfolds slowly  but I think that is what made this book better and more intense to see what was going to happen the next day I m not going to sugarcoat it but this book is difficult  I am a underclassman at a high school  I think that because of the unusual plot and setting this book takes on  you might have to go back and read some part again if you don t understand it  After reading this book I had plot and setting in my head but it was difficult to imagine  I would suggest this book to any young adult or adult looking for a book that they will dig deep into  Also if you are really looking for a perfect visual  I suggest you watch the movie over this book  It follows the same setting as the book but you get a better picture in your head of how the writer meant for the setting to look like  Overall I think that this book was definitely the most engaging and challenging book I have read so far  I truly think you won t be disappointed stepping in or out of your comfort zone and reading this amazing book   This book though  It was one of those books that once I was done reading  I set it down and thought about it for ages   I  as many other kids  had to read this in 6th grade  At the time  I just thought  okay  its another schoolbook   I ve recently re read it  and it is now one of my favorites  There are so many things that I had not noticed at a younger age  However  I think that classifying this book as a children s book is a bit overconfident  More like YA in my opinion  I love how it is written  and how simple ideas make the story what it is  Even though it is clearly dystopian to older readers  it is still presented from the point of view of a child  making it seem more gentle and almost  normal    More information on that below   And yes I found the movie disappointing  but not too awful  p     SPOILERS  For example  the fact that the entire community sees the world in black and white  and that Jonas  the protagonist  notices that he is different because something changes about his surroundings  he starts seeing the color red   We  as readers  do not notice this difference in color until the Giver says  you are starting to see the color red   Then  the book takes on a whole new dimension that changes how we read it  This kind of twist happens very often throughout the novel  you just have to notice it  This is clearly dystopian  but not in the way that many books are today  This seemed more strict in its rules  yet presented in a more gentle way  I found this mix absolutely fascinating  One example of this is when the newchildren  if twins  are weighed  The lightest one would be  released   As a more mature reader  we know that this means the newchild would die  yet they way it is written makes it seem  as I said  more gentle  and somewhat innocent   Lois Lowry s science fiction novel  The Giver  is set in a futuristic  dystopian society  Jonas  a young twelve year old boy  gets assigned as the Receiver of memories in the community  He later finds that his community is living with the notion of sameness and has already given up some essential rights  making Jonas frustrated and confused  The main theme the novel conveys is how individuality is crucial throughout society   Throughout the novel  as Jonas becomes the receiver of memories  he learns that his community has given up their freedom  choice  and individuality  in order to create more perfect society to protect the people living in it  However  because of the experiences of pain have been passed down to Jonas  he learns to appreciate the things in life  He does not understand why other members of his community do not get the same opportunities as he does  Most of the community members do not get selected as the receiver of memories because it takes courage  bravery  wisdom  and being able to see beyond  Jonas is able to see beyond  or see the world in color  with more flavor  a different perspective and a new lens than other community members  Unlike Jonas  the community does not see in color  instead  they see the world in black and white  Later on in the book  Jonas is conflicted society s ways of life  He discovers that society has no diversity since everyone is the same  They do not notice change or even encourage individuality  Throughout the book  Lowry teaches readers how important it is to be unique  have rights to make decisions  and to value memories  This novel could symbolize that people should not always blindly follow what they are told  and should sometimes question society   This book does not take a year to read  My holds for the library kept coming and I had to put the book away  Jonas is a twelve year old in a dystopian society who is about to be assigned his vocation for life which is carefully deliberated by the elders in the community  Without giving too much away he is assigned a very important job that is integral to the balance of the society in which he lives  He becomes conflicted with what has learned in his new role  I really liked this book  There is an honesty to it that doesn t brutalize difficult issues  I liked the main characters and empathized with their situations  The author could have made it more graphic and I am glad that author did not  I think it is a good introduction to the genre for children  There are mature themes and I would suggest it for twelve and up  Maybe a mature eleven year old Since this book is over 20 years old I can see that it would have influenced a lot of the children s YA literature of the same genre of today  Probably on the way to becoming a classic or at least a sentimental favourite of the those born in the nineties or aughts   I feel that I connect with Jonas because he doesn t really fit into the norm or into specific groups of their society  I really enjoyed this book by Lois Lowry  I haven t read any other books by this author  but I am really looking forward to reading the rest of the quartet  The Giver is based in a utopian universe where their community is totally controlled by their government and everything has its own time and place  The story starts when Jonas  a thirteen year old inhabitant of this community  is selected to be  The Giver   The Givers  job is to take memories from our life now and keep them in his her brain until the next Giver comes along and then process repeats itself  Jonas is given all the memories of pain  happiness  seasons  and color  heat and cold  and basically everyday things for us today  In Jonas  home life it is very strict  The household has to speak in a certain way  Jonas  father is a nurse for the newborn children  One day he brings home a little boy to take care of  Jonas really takes a liking in this little boy and begins to give him memories which isn t allowed  One day  Jonas hears that the little infant has to be gotten rid of because he won t be a great addition to the community  Will Jonas try to save him  or just forget about him I really enjoyed this book by Lois Lowry  I am really looking forward to reading the rest of the quartet  I would recommend this book for anyone over nine years old  This is a pretty easy read and not too long of a book  but some large words    The title of the book I read was called  The Giver  and it was written by Lois Lowry  The genre of this book was science fiction  The story took place in what seemed to be a dystopian future  The characters in this story were Jonah and the Giver  There were many side characters  but these two were the main characters  In the beginning you meet Jonah who is about to become a  twelve  in his community  and he has many mixed feeling about it  He lives in this dystopian future  where they have different communities  Even thought they are different communities  they all follow the same rules and do not allow color or music  It is a very strange setting from where we are used to today in time  Jonah is not like the rest in his community  at special times and only for a short period of time he can actually see color  where everyone else sees black and white  In the middle of the book you read that at the job naming ceremony for the Twelves  he was given the position to be the next Receiver of Memories  This job is a very important job in their community  but it comes with a price  This is where Jonah meets the Giver who will train him to be the next Receiver  During the training  the two become very close as the Giver gives Jonah memories about  pain  hope  despair  and love  In the end or the last part of the book  Jonah learns when people get too old or if one is not needed they simply kill them off  This made Jonah insanely mad and hate the communities  So the Giver and Jonah hatch a plan so  Jonah can leave this horrible place  The plan works and Jonah makes it out  He brought Gabe with him because the community decided to kill him at the last minute  Jonah loved Gabe so much  that he took him with him  saving him  In the very end the author lets it up to you to decide if they live or die  since the author did not make that part clear  I would recommend this book because it was a very well written book and easy to understand  Ages from 12 and up will love this book as much as I did and would want to read the others as soon as they are done with this one  The author was very clever while writing this and kept me hooked on the book till the very end  The Giver will amaze you and keep you wanting more and more  I was very sad when the book ended  but also very happy because the book was just that good  I would read this book again and again  it s that good  In this book Lois Lowry is trying to point out through the main character  Jonas  that people are incapable of having a perfect society  This book takes place in an area of the world where everything is controlled  so there is a very bleak setting  They are living without color  Everything is black and white  It is all the same everyday  Their are no irregularities  The story is told through the eyes of a thirteen year old boy named Jonas  The two main character are the Giver and Jonas  In the beginning of this story Jonas turns thirteen  and where he lives  when the kids become thirteen  they are told what their job is going to be  Jonas gets the job of being the next Giver  The Giver holds the memory s of everything  Jonas is told that in this job that he will go through immense pain  This will be the most difficult challenge Jonas will ever face  I personally thought this book was amazing  The reason I think it is so good is because it gave me a good perspective on how terrible it would be to have a complete controlled society  My favorite part of the book was when the Giver gave Jonas the memory of Christmas  Jonas loved it and was upset that they didn t have this where he lived  This is my favorite part of the book because it s when Jonas started to want something more than his life  He wanted to be free to do what he pleases  A connection I made with this book is that one should never try to be perfect  All of a personsimperfections are what make you human  Without those imperfections  the society that Jonas in lived was boring and not unique  This is a must read for anyone because it has such vital information that can make you a better person  Twelve year old Jonas has never known real conflict  unhappiness or pain  His community long ago deemed it safer to eliminate choice and unnecessary variables from people s lives  leaving blissfully ignorant contentment  Animals are nothing more than imaginary creatures  sunshine is nonexistent amid climate control  and even colors are a sight unseen   Sameness  is prized above all else  and daily pills chase away sexual  stirrings  that threaten a system in which spouses are matched for compatibility rather than love  But Jonas  world changes when he is selected as his community s next Receiver of Memories  a great honor with mysterious responsibilities  Jonas learns he alone will bear the whole burden of history  with the titular Giver gradually passing down through osmosis memories from beyond their seemingly perfect society  As Jonas experiences the colors of a rainbow  the pain of sunburn  the joy of love and the agony of war  he begins to see the potential for a richer existence  But when he discovers a disturbing truth about his meticulously ordered community  he must decide whether he dares to take the biggest risk of his life to share his newfound wisdom and stand up for what he believes is right  This thought provoking  third person novel gives readers a likeable  believable and wise protagonist and whose emotional journey provides a stark contrast to other characters  blind acceptance of their controlled existence  Just as Jonas is  careful about language   Lowry too crafts her words deliberately to convey specific meaning through beautifully spare prose  By slowly revealing all that was lost by emphasizing Sameness  she lets readers see that the true beauty of life comes from having a choice in how to live it  and in contrasting the highs with the lows  While younger children also will enjoy the book  middle  and high school age readers may better understand the shifting perspectives that reveal the fine line between utopia and dystopia  Dedicating the book to  all the children to whom we entrust the future   Lowry includes an ambiguous ending that may frustrate some  but will give hope to others who understand that some risks are worth taking regardless of the outcome  Jonas is a young boy who know no different than the society he has grown up in  He is surrounded by perfection  Everyone dresses the same  lives the same  is placed in a job deemed perfect for them  cannot see color  and does not  feel  any emotions  When Jonas turns twelve his whole world changes because he is assigned a role in his community where he receives special training from the Giver  He now knows all of the information the government hides from its citizens and he cannot help but feel like everything he has ever been taught is wrong  He must now learn to find a balance between right and wrong and what is most important to him  I absolutely love this book  I have read it several times and I feel that the older I get the better the book gets  I love the characters in this book because they are so developed and well described that I feel like I know exactly who they are  I also love the plot in this book it is so different than anything I have ever read  I would definitely use this book in the classroom because it is such a classic book and the first one of its kind in the dystopian genre  I think it also addresses a lot of social and societal problems that students can relate to their lives today  Overall it is one of the best books I have ever read   Jonas lives in a perfect world  Everyone in their community is assigned a job at the age of 12  Jonas will be assigned his future job this coming December  At the ceremony of 12  Jonas awaits to hear his selection made by the community of elders  While many of the children know what job they may be chosen  Jonas has no idea  Jonas  title is very important  he is The Giver  The Giver knows the past and everything there is to know about their world  When Jonas starts to notice how imperfect his world is  he starts to change people s opinion  He begins to make a revolution and the elders do not approve  I loved this book  I loved Jonas and his transformation through out the book  This book really makes you wonder if a world could ever be  perfect   The way the characters act  before Jonas starts to realize the imperfections  makes you giggle a little bit  The way they talk seems ridiculous  If Jonas  world is perfect  then I would not want to live in a perfect world  The books ending left me wanting more  I will definitely be reading the rest of the books in this series  I would suggest this book to people who like dystopian utopian books  I m so happy I re read this book  It gives a lot stronger meaning as an adult than it did in the 8th grade   The Giver Lois Lowry  We gained control of many things  but we had to let go of others  There is no conflict    There is no hunger    There is no color    There is no feelings    No Choices    Sameness    Everything is supposed to be perfect  But is it   Jonas s lives in an isolated  community  where everything is controlled  The life where nothing was ever unexpected  Or inconvenient  Or unusual  The life without color  pain  or past   Jonas goes to school  has friends  a family  He is eleven years old which means that he soon will be a  Twelve  and find out what his assigned job is  He is supposed to be the person nineteenth to get his job at the Ceremony of Twelve but he is skipped and then at the end of the ceremony he is told that he is the next receiver of memories  Now it will be his job to hold the memories of the world before they decided to make everything the same  The previous receiver of memories  or now The Giver  should give him the memories of the past  Some are wonderful    Sunshine  mountains  oceans    Some are new tow Jonas snow  animals  birds  Others are scary  painful  horrible war  hunger  pain     Now unlike other people in the community Jonas can see color  has feelings  knows what love is  When Jonas s family takes care of one of the new children for a while Jonas figures out that soon he will be  released  taken away from the community  There is no way Jonas will let that happen  He does everything to save Gabe  the new child  He starts to understand that the community is not really perfect  And was he ever happy living in it  Jonas  the next Receiver of Memories  has to make a very important decision which will change his life forever    The Giver is a fascinating book it was impossible to stop reading it  I wanted to know what would happen the next day  what will happen on the next page  the next chapter  I felt that I was the one receiving the memories and that I lived in a community like that always wondering what  Sameness  would be like  The Giver is the first of four books in a series  The main characters in the books change but the books are still connected   I would recommend anyone who likes books set in an isolated  dystopian community to read The Giver and all the books in the series  Probably middle school or fifth grade is the best time to read it but I think that you will enjoy it at any age especially if you like books with unexpected plot twists  This book is perhaps the best refutation that I have seen in some time of a common philosophy of pain that is sometimes found in the popular media and in some versions of Buddhism  According to this philosophy  pain is the ultimate evil  and so  to eliminate pain and suffering we must give up desire  and individuality  Self is an illusion  and leads to pain  desire and agency are dangerous  so we should give them up and join the cosmic oneness  enlightenment  to find a utopia without pain  As George Lucas unfortunately has Yoda say to Anakin   you must give up all that you fear to lose    The best thing about this book is its lessons  The storyline is quiet and unassuming  Here you have the picture of perfect equality  in a community that is built on the principle of sameness  There is no difference in races  no religion  In fact  the whole world is grey  or completely colourless since the people in the community never knew what colours meant  Jonas  a 12 year old  joins his friends Asher and Fiona in the upcoming graduation ceremony that will assign them their future positions in the community  in other words  their life career  But unlike the normal positions assigned to his friends  Jonas is selected as the Receiver of Memory  An honour  as only one person will bear the position for the rest of his life until the next successor is chosen And that is where all the lessons begin  The plot is in no way dramatic  nor is it a thriller but what captures the essence of the story are the poignant scenes that teach us  or remind us  that there is no wrong in feeling emotions or being different  The most memorable scene for me was when Jonas found out the reality of Release  When I started reading through the Release of the elderly to Elsewhere  and the Release of a twin  in my naivety  I was sure they were actually released from the community to another community that are better suited to care for them  Such ignorant thinking when in reality it is murder  only with another name  In their defence  it was a necessary cruelty to avoid future complications  bedridden elderly  people with similar faces   But is that the life we want to conform to  Where it is okay to  release  people as they outlive their contribution  or newborns who unknowingly been born as twins  Sure  the thought of sameness  following the status quo  stereotypes  etc  without all the complicated and  wrong  emotions like envy  anger and hatred is desirable but what are we sacrificing then  Other emotions like joy  warmth and love  In the world of the book  there is no adventure  no challenge  no obstacles  Everyone goes through life the same way and die the same way  Is that the world that we are striving for   The Giver completely far from what I ever would have imagined  Everything in the beginning seems like a perfect world  but its not  Nothing is as it seems  Jonas a typical teen  growing up and not knowing what he is going to do with his life while all of his friends seem to have it figured out  Its the time of the year again for their towns annual ceremony  and Jonas is terrified of what he will be chosen to do with his life  During the ceremony after everyone has gone and he is called up  his whole life changes forever  He is received the job of The Giver  Now Jonas must learn from the one who knows the most  but its not what he ever thought it to be  His life is tossed upside down and chaos takes over  The Giver is a book that has a lot of chaos and Jonas ends up in a mess of a lifetime    I have found that this book really takes flight when Jonas decides that something needs to be done to change the community  I was surprised that The Giver was actually accepting of that idea because it goes on and on about how this practice of having a  safe community with the sameness  has gone on for sooo long  I was compelely shocked when they described what a  release  meant  It made my stomach turn  I was hoping the entire time that that was not the case  A part of the story that will always stay with me was how well Lois wrote the vivid description of one of Jonas  memories that the giver had passed onto him  the war scene   The boy sighed  His head fell back  his lower jaw dropping as if he had been surprised by something  A dull blackness slid slowly across his eyes  He was silent  This was Jonas  first experience with the concept of death and I thought it was so descriptive of what Jonas saw in his head  The most intense part for me was clearly at the end   as soon as he started racing out of the community I couldn t put the book down  Especially because I knew of his challenge with bringing Gabe  I have talked to others about their interpretation of the ending and am looking forward to discussing it with my group on Thursday        This book is perhaps the best refutation that I have seen in some time of a common philosophy of pain that is sometimes found in the popular media and in some versions of Buddhism  According to this philosophy  pain is the ultimate evil  and so  to eliminate pain and suffering we must give up desire  and individuality  Self is an illusion  and leads to pain  desire and agency are dangerous  so we should give them up and join the cosmic oneness  enlightenment  to find a utopia without pain  As George Lucas unfortunately has Yoda say to Anakin   you must give up all that you fear to lose   And  of course  this is hogwash  Choice  agency  adversity  love  desire  and real pleasure are dangerous  they can lead to pain  but without them life has no purpose  Love could lead to the loss of that which we love  but life without love is empty  Purpose comes from choosing  Purpose comes from overcoming adversity  Yes  you could choose poorly  and that could lead to pain  choice is dangerous  but without it  life has no meaning  it is colorless  Greatness in life is found by overcoming adversity  not by the absence of adversity  Without opposition  there is nothing to overcome  and thus there may be no bad  but there is also no good  there may be no pain  but there is also no joy    Spoiler Alert   The book s ending mirrors this ambiguity  Although some later books answer some of these questions  at the end of this book we are left to wonder  Did he die  Did he live  All we really know is that he was made free  and he made a choice    was it the right one  Did it lead to happiness for him  Did it lead to happiness for the community who will now have his memories  Will they destroy themselves  or will the Giver be able to help them find true purpose and happiness in life  We don t know  because that is the way of all choices  We can t always know the outcomes of our decisions  and therein lies the danger  but the risk is well worth the rewards  This book made me look at life differently when I was in middle school  that s a difficult thing to do  My 10 year old son read this book and then asked me to read it so we could discuss it  At first  I was hesitant  assuming that it would feel childish to a middle aged mom  It s not  Similar to Brave New World  the book explores what happens when we choose to live in a world devoid of pain    a world that has no hate  no anger  no sunburn  no cold  no hunger  no illness  no differences  no disorder  no anger  It s a world where everyone lives by hundreds of daily rules    rules that are all designed with the greater good in mind  to be polite  to not ask invasive questions of others  etc   but that remove personal choice  In the quest for order  there is no personal freedom  leaving the reader to ponder  Perhaps freedom  love  and true happiness are worth the war  loss  longing  loneliness  hunger  confusion  disorder and other problems that arise when humans make  bad  choices  It s thought provoking  and led to one of those rare wonderful discussions about which world we would want to live in  We both  by the way  chose the world of color    the one with cold snow and warm sun  anger as well as patience  hatred as well as love  pain as well as joy   I loved this book  Everything from the characters to the setting was just perfect in my opinion  I wasn t crazy about the ending  but that was mainly because I read reviews on here  I considered the ending happy until I read that others didn t have the same view  Then  I started rethinking my initial reaction and it made me like the book less  Books are so subjective  like any art form   I now stick to my initial feeling about the ending  I recommend this for readers of all ages  although it s a YA book   One can learn much about life through this story  I don t know why I m so crazy for dystopian society books  but I am  and this is one of my favorites  It has taken me an extremely long time to read this book  I heard about it in grade school  but never once took it up  again in high school and again nothing  in college I was prompted to read it by multiple people and still nothing  Finally  seemingly on a whim I picked the book up and started to read it  that was the day before yesterday  The book was a surprising gem  even with all the glowing accolades and critiques from people who d urged me to read it before  with such acclaim I usually go into a book expecting to be disappointed after so much build up   Yet this book was surprisingly deep and conveyed a lot of complex emotion for such a simple narrative  The book had a great deal of depth to it in the way that it construed scenes that helped one to understand the turmoil in our every day lives and does so in a brilliant manner by giving us the human experience of an outsider to our everyday feelings and happenings  It is a wonderful tale told with excellent pacing  the right dashes of human emotion  and a mysterious ending that leaves you with more questions than answers    I look forward to reading the rest of Ms  Lowry s books in this world  What would life be like with no violence or pain and everyone spoke the truth  That type of life is called a utopian society  I wonder what a life like that would really be like  A life so simple there are no emotions  No hard choices or differences would have to occur to live a life like this  Lois Lowry s  The Giver  is a unique and brain turning book around this different and unique society  The theme Lowry shows in this book is the significance of memory to human life  If you cannot remember the past than no emotions can effect you  At a point in the past the community The Giver decided to eliminate all pain from their lives by making them give up the memories of their society s collective experiences  This allowed them to forget all of the pain that had been suffered throughout history  Everything was also the same  two parents and two children  same house  same everything  Lowry s style is very straightforward  That is what I very much enjoyed about it  you won t get confused of complicated vocabulary or too much figurative language  Now that doesn t mean it is boring  it is still a well writhed book just more straightforward and easy to understand Lowry gives all the character a somewhat well description  He mainly pays attention to the character Jonas  From the start Jonas  the protagonist  is somewhat odd and has strange powers that he doesn t understand  Because of these powers Jonas is chosen to be the new Receiver of Memory for his community  After his training begins  Jonas s new look upon strong emotions  colors  and suffering makes him very passionate about the world around him and the doings of the people he loves The setting starts out at a minimal  small town with strict rules  It turns out all the houses are the same and the town is part of a collection of different towns where the people of that town must stay there unless if there are business relations or field trips  Throughout the book  the readers start to discover more and more about this unique town  We learn about the rules and people like how no one sees color and no one has ever heard the sound of music The giver is written from the point of view of Jonas  an 11 year old boy living in a futuristic society  Everyone in this society is overly polite  Everything is under control  there is no war or pain  there are no choices  because every person is assigned a role in the community  When Jonas is 12 he is chosen to receive special training from The Giver  The Giver holds the memories of the true pain and pleasure of life  Jonas then becomes the receiver of memories and discovers the horrible truth about the society in which he lives Lowry has a truly unique idea that she created into a beautiful story about life that includes pain as well  She leaves many thoughts and questions in the readers mind about how much would we give for a perfect society  I recommend  The Giver  by Lois Lowry to really any age because its is all quite appropriate and yet still is very interesting to everyone  One of my favorite books of all time  Lowry wrote of a dystopian society before it was trendy  A beautiful story about all the wonders of life and of the world that we give up when we decide that technology can make things better  When people lose everything that makes us individual and everything that is potentially  dangerous  is taken away  we are left with empty shelves of life  Jonas  through his selected occupation  begins to see what the world was once like  and he decides that the  perfect life  his society creates for its citizens is no life at all  Can he change things back  This short novel packs a punch  It transcends the boundary between young adult and adult with an engaging story that generates more in the readers mind than on the written page  The author invites the reader to ponder what he or she is discovering throughout the book and think of implications in our real world  Comfort and security vs  sensation and risk  Societal needs vs  personal needs  the stressfulness of caring vs  the completion of love are all vital topics here  But most important is the importance of knowledge being shared broadly and not narrowly  The use of color as an analogy for reality is very effective  The characters are all believable  even those reduced to a superficial actuality by the world in which they live  By following Jonas in his journey through the story we understand that any in the society could blossom to some degree  even if not to the extent that his sessions with The Giver allow him to grow  The ending is appropriately hazy  This is a story that should leave the reader asking questions and finding their own answers  The Giver by Lois Lowry By Yu Jin Jung October 23  2014   Tianjin  China     This book is a fantasy and scientific fiction about a eleven years old boy named Jonas  who s living in a  community  that eliminated inequality  or any pain  instead of not having any individual s feelings or thoughts  Every December  eleven years old children receives life assignment  Jonas named as the new  Receiver of Memories   Everyday Jonas goes for training from The Giver  who has memories of society filled with both pain and pleasure  Then  Jonas realize the disadvantages of his society that doesn t have any emotions of individuals  Finally he runs away to release his memories back to the community The theme of the book is rules  Rules are portrayed negatively through this book  They are used to take away freedom  choices  and individualities of citizens in the community  However  people who are living in the community doesn t realize that rules took their freedom away  To them  rules makes their life easy and safe  However  rules are the factor that made Jonas ran away from community  because it took individual s freedom and choices away  which is a disadvantage of society for Jonas  One of the rules in the community was only fifty babies can born in a year  However  there was a twin that made nurturer to decide to release one of newborn baby  Jonas s father was a nurturer  He was responsible for release one of the twins  Jonas saw his father was releasing the baby  but he saw his father actually kills the baby  This is the climax of the book  because Jonas s frustration about community made him cannot accept insensitivity to the value of lives of society  which determines him to change the society  The main conflict of the story is inner conflict of Jonas between himself and community  Jonas is receiving all the memories that reveals disadvantages of community that he grown up with  so he is struggling to decide what will be the best for society  Jonas was growing up with believing that his community was perfect  so Jonas decides to leave community and release all the memories that he received   I basically enjoyed this book  There are lots of inciting incident that builds tensions and made me to guess what will climax be  The author made me to think about how wonderful is the world that I m living in   I highly recommend this book to people who wants to live in a world without any feelings  or people who are interested in learning about future life  or people has dissatisfaction of now day s world who doesn t know value of freedom  thoughts  and feelings  This book is about a boy named Jonas who lives in a community where they must follow the rules and if they don t they will be released in the community which is a big punishment  In the community  the people are rated the First  Second  Third  Fourth  Fifth  Sixth  Seventh  Eight  Nines  Tens  Elevens  and Twelves which is like an age for them  When you become a Twelve you get a job that the Chief Elder told to do  Jonas becomes a Receiver of Memory which is a really really important job and when he was receiving memories by the Giver  he came to know that there were colors  snowflakes  sleds  music  etc   and also knew that when you become release  they kill you with an injection  not sending you to Elsewhere  Jonas didn t know any of these because the Chief Elder didn t want to give to people in their community so that there will be no war and people will respect each other and follow rules  Jonas got shocked knowing all this and he wanted to make a plan to change the rules and make people see the beautiful colors  etc    So the Giver told him to escape the community at night   which is a really big risk because if you get caught  you will be released   and go far away to Elsewhere so that the people will panic and the Giver will change the rules  While escaping  Jonas brought a toddler with him whose name is Gabriel  because the baby was going to be released and finally he arrived at Elsewhere This book is related to me because we must follow what adults say and we can t do anything and if we do we will get punished  So it can t make us free to do what we want which is related to the book This book seems boring just seeing the cover but if you read it  it s really really interesting wanting you to read more and if you finish reading it  you will want the book to have another volume so you can keep reading it  Try reading     The Giver  by Lois Lowry is one of my favorite books  It is a fictional book  The Giver is about a boy who lives in a society where memory is all swiped away from the past  Every December you are chosen to a job  you may not pick your own  He was skipped over in the ceremony and then given an extraordinary position as a Giver  You are not allowed to make a mistake or you will be put to death  Every morning before you leave you are injected with a serum that only allows thought the leaders allow  In this adventurous book a boy figures out using an apple instead of his hand enhances memory  I rated this book 5 stars because it is a very fun and action pact book  It shows emotion in ways people can relate  All in all this is a great book for some one to read   I can say with full conviction that this is  by far  my most favorite book I liked all aspects about it  The concept  characters  setting  and conflict were vivid and marvelously executed  I enjoyed it very much  I perceived the world Lois Lowry created was sort of dystopian  which I love because they fascinate me   I feel like it was just a tad rushed  The  plan  was explained too briefly to me  The book could be longer than it is  And the ending leaves an open ended question  which causes me to become more delirious  but it s understandable  Overall  it s a remarkable novel  This book is the first part in a four part series  This first book is about the future community and how they have coped with some of the things that have happened in the past  When we first start to read the book we see that this an ideal community  We are learning how perfect things are  We see that everyone is happy and caring and polite  They are fed  they have routines and no pain  Soon Jonas  the main character  is assigned his future assignment and career and he is not sure whether he would be able to do what they want him to do because he can t be sure that he will like what they pick for him  At the ceremony he is assigned something that has great honor  He is shocked but soon realizes why he was picked to be in this particular position  When he starts his training that s when we really start to see how the community really works  We realize that they have been completed sterilized from any feelings  urges  anything that good be bad or good  from seeing color  And this list goes on  That s when we realize how imperfect this world is  Jonas is selected to receive the memories of the past and to hold on it for the community should something rise and his wisdom needed  At first he receives some good memories but he soon gets memories of war  famine and other horrible things that he cannot understand  As he starts to receive these memories  he becomes more and more isolated from the rest of the people and children around him  He is able to see color and realizes he knows too much now to really enjoy life without having others around him enjoy it with him  At this same time they have received a baby in the house that has the same color eyes that Jonas  His name is Gabe  And that eye color is seldom seen  Soon he figures out that the baby is able to receive memories like Jonas is and he starts giving him memories to soothe him to sleep As his training goes on  he learns too many horrible things about the community and this is starting to weigh in on him and he can t understand how people can live this way  As he is contemplating these issues  he sees his father do something that is completely wrong but he does it in such high spirits  that Jonas cannot go home for the night  Soon him and the giver come up with the plan for him to runaway to a place and when he does all the memories that he has will be transferred to the people in the community and the giver would stay to help them through the crisis and maybe change some of the rules But their plan does not go according to plan when Jonas finds out that Gabe is set to be released  meaning they will kill him  and he decides to run away right then and there  And he does so successfully but ends with mystery because we do not know what happens to him and whether he is safe or taken or dies  So in the end you have to read the second book and then the third to actually know more about Jonas  Quite possibly the greatest young adult book ever written  although I am a bit biased toward Lois Lowry   This book about freedom of choice and free will should be read by all young adults  as well as adults  I really liked this book  It was a thriller and it was just fascinating  I really recommend this book to reader of older ages  The book was full of mysteries  My favorite character was Jonah he was brave and witty  He wanted the world to be the way it used to be  I think that in the end he and gave made it to heaven  Ok  I do not know why it took me so long to read this book  I know it has been around since  I  was in grade school and was a Newberry Winner even then  I guess I never read it because I was never that interested in  Science Fiction  under which heading this book was probably considered until recently with all the newer dystopian fiction becoming so popular  I d even venture to say that I m not a big dystopian fiction reader either  but that books like  The Hunger Games  have at least encouraged me to be more adventurous in reading that type of book  That being said  I m sorry it took me so long to read this book  I thoroughly enjoyed it but wish it hadn t ended when it did  I want MORE     I m currently already reading the following book in the series  but was disappointed  a little  to learn it was a whole new story and not the continuation of the first  I want to know what happens          A true hallmark of a good book  in my mind  So now that I ve read this great book  I want to encourage young and old to read it  SO interesting and so well written  Of course  my own daughter won t read it because I m suggesting it to her  Still  I think I will pick up a hard copy for my bookshelf of Newberry Honor and Award books  Definitely belongs there  Oh  el mundo debe temblar  le puse  Cinco Estrellas  a un distopico    O jajajaj Nah  en serio  me gusto mucho esta historia     Originally conceived by Lowry as a way to explore memories of her aging father  this original dystopian novel has inspired a slew of modern literature and their subsequent films  How this finally became a movie after decades of trying is an interesting story too  see DVD special features   The Giver by Louis Lowry takes place in a dystopian society where everyone is the same  Where no one feels emotions or can see color  except for one boy name Jonas  In this community once you turn twelve you get your job in the community  When Jonas gets his job assignment he is told he will feel unimaginable pain  He is given the job of Reciver of Memory  he experiences love  joy  sadness    joy  He now does not know if he should stay in a world of sameness or should he go  My favorite part about the book is the ending  because the author lets you interoperate what you think happens  I would recommend this book to anyone who likes suspense or heroic adventures  Although this book has the lexile level of a middle school book  this book is terrific about how one should think about making decisions  I surprisingly liked this book I am not usually a science fiction person I loved how they created a entirely different and new society I liked how it was futuristic but I was confused because there was no technology I liked the character Gabriel because he seemed so hopeless and scared with everyone except Jonas I also liked how sad it was about when Jonas realized release meant death I liked how the book made you think and it was probably one of the only books that has ever truly made me think I recommend this book to anyone who hasn t already read it This is definitely my favorite book so far  I really did enjoy this book      This is hands down my favorite book of all time  This is the one book that I remember reading in grammar school to change my life forever  This book made me a reader and English teacher  hands down  Before reading this novel I had already been an avid reader  I was voracious for children s novels like Judy Blume s novels  Babysitters Club  Sweet Valley High etc   but this is the book that made me realize what writing could be like To this day I read this novel once a year  and I force feed it to friends who haven t experienced it  I think it s a great reality check for humans  while taking a break from reality altogether  This fictional world painted by Lowery is terrifying and surreal to try to picture  yet I feel  not too far fetched from where this world is headed  Books like The Giver  1984  and Brave New World  really make me think about what could be  and even if some of the specifics of each novel are way out there  I feel the general idea and feeling of governmental control  the dissolution of life as we know it  and the feelings that the characters in these novels have are so identifiable to me  Maybe it s because I m a paranoid conspiracy theorist  kidding   but I really can see a bleak society like the one depicted in The Giver  In preparation for the movie  I decided to give this book a re read as I do for a lot of upcoming adaptations  I must say that I loved this books so much more then when I read it for the first time during high school  I wish I had picked it up so much sooner  Jonas and The Giver are such interesting characters  I love baby Gabe to death  ironic if you have read the book before  and am glad Jonas did what he did to keep him safe  I like Fiona and Asher  but I wish they had been more involved in the story since they are Jonas s friends  The thing that compels me to keep reading books like these is that there is a problem in the society that needs to be fixed  aka Realeses  lack of emotion  Stirrings  and know one can have books   Jonas has to deal with all this stuff at only age 12  I don t know what I think of the ending because it was sort of dull and confusing  but I think we will get more answers on that in the future of the quintet  The short of it is  I loved this book way to much  It made me think to much  which is the sign of a well thought good story  The Giver changed the way I thought about  books   Up until I read it  I saw reading as a chore  something I was forced to do  I didn t enjoy it  I had not yet found a story that made me appreciate the written word That changed after Lois Lowry s beautiful  simple  harrowing  uplifting tale In some crazy way I could relate to Jonas  I could feel what he was feeling  See what he was seeing  As ironic as it is to say  Lowry paints this colorful image of this town and this people  that end up being   well  read the book  It was breathtaking and mindbogling and pulled me in When I was younger I don t know if I appreciated all the societal issues being dealt with  but I appreciated the fact that in the  order  of the community Jonas wanted to belong and give his fair share  but he also was seeking for freedom  Who doesn t want freedom  What price are we willing to pay to have freedom  To have a life of our own choosing Just sitting here  typing  thinking of the premise  it sends chills up my spine  That s good writing   and why I keep going back to it  I thought this was pretty amazing   I didn t know it was a classic or that they made it into a movie until after i had read it  The whole  everything is organized and everyone has a job  reminds me of the divergent  hunger games  and city of ember series  Interesting that they probably spawned from this book    it was really good  i liked the length of it it was a nice length  and also it s good bc you don t realise how much you ve read  i think this book is a lot deeper and has a lot more meanings than i can comprehend in my tiredness right now  but i think a lot more of it will filter through when i have to actually think about it in english  it was really good though and i really liked it  it was funny when he was like fionas p nice tho              omg and the    stirring    talk was sO awkward  i also didn t think jonas liked gabriel that much  bc like he always said oh idc bout him as much lily or mum or dad  omfg the dad  he made me so mad when he said the bye bye thing like you don t have to be that much of an asshole      you asshole        he made me mad with his releasing in general though ohmygod  it was also sososo sad when  mad and sad describing words A  precision   when the giver was like my daughter  rosemary   I read this in school and thought it was amazing  I think I could feel myself identify with the character as well as a child but the world and the over arching story was very absorbing  Plus the benefit of reading it in school was that we got to analyse all the elements within it Having just re read it after watching the film it hasn t had quite the same effect on me that it did at 14 but the ideas are still real enough  Reading the authors prologue sort of took some of the enjoyment away in some respects  As she talks about how she did not write the book to have any deeper meaning  she just wrote it as a short story of sorts  Even so I enjoyed watching Jonas come to grips with the world and where the book fails to make it clear the book almost excels  The moment the Giver tells Jonas he must go and let the memories flood back into the populace has a reason to it  But the reason for me could be clearer  or at least his motives in the dramatic build up could be clearer  It is a shame the film does away with most of this and re writes what is effectively a more subtle piece of work  I am currently reading the sequel Gathering Blue  which is supposedly set in the same world  It will be interesting to see where all four books lead  Read this for banned book week and discovered an excellent young adult novel about a future world that has been designed to be  safe   a world of sameness where your career is picked for you  your spouse  your children  where questioning is rude  where troublemakers and law breakers are  released   euphemism for killed  Jonas is selected at 12 to be the Receiver of Memories and through these  he learns what it means to be fully alive  to see colors  to feel happiness  pain  sorrow  love and yearns to escape  Well worthy to be read by adults too   Wew  ini buku pertama sci fi yang saya selesaikan sekali duduk saking ringannya cara bertutur naratornya  Ketika narator menceritakan masa lalu ataupun rutinas yang berulang dilakukan Jonas  terkesan diceritakan padat  tidak bertele tele Buku ini memang tidak membangun emosional pembaca dengan cepat sehingga memang tidak ada efek dramatikal di cerita ini  Makanya saya dan ada beberapa teman juga bilang  novel ini memang bagus  tapi saat membacanya tidak merasakan emosi apa apa  ya karena menurut saya novel ini bukan bertujuan untuk itu  justru sesuai misi penulisnya  novel ini berusaha memberikan kenyamanan pada pembaca dengan permasalahan yang mengusik  Berbeda dengan filmnya yang terkesan dramatisir Membaca buku ini  saya lebih mensyukuri hidup dengan segala perbedaan yang membuat hidup ini terasa berwarna  tidak terasa berwarna sama tanpa emosi dan rasa seperti apa yang dialami komunitas Jonas  Memang apapun yang hidup yang kita pilih  konsekuensi selalu ada dan kita harus berani menghadapi konsekuensinya demi rasa yang ingin kita dapatkan  The book  The Giver  is about a futuristic society which is full of  communities  which are void of color  feelings  families and freedom  The main character Jonas is selected to be the new reciever of memory  and he begins him training as the reciever of memory by recieving memories of the past and Jonas becomes dangerous as he is now exposed to the truth about lif before   sameness    Jonas becomes enfuriated to realize that they had so much more    The Giver   was published in 1993 and won the newberry medal thet same year  It is an amazing piece of literature and anyone of any age would enjoy Louis Lowry also wrote many other newberry award winning books My personal favoraite part of the book is when Jonas recieves the memory of love and family  two memories that are vital to life as we know it If you enjoy books about futuristic societies such as   Hunger Games      Divergent   and others like these  i highly recommend this book to you  it was one of the first about the future  i gave it 5 stars because it made me think about life and how lucky we are for the small  simple things such as sunlight  color  seasons  freindship and true feelings overall  the giver is simply amazing   The Giver by Lois Lowry is a fantastic book that plays around with human memories and suffering  It takes place in a community that no one is allowed to leave The story starts with a boy named Jonas walking home from school  He heads home to his family for dinner  During this you start to notice a few   off  things  For one  Jonas and his parents refer to Lily as a female Nine instead of saying she a 9 year old girl  They also mention that all newborn children are named by a  Namer  and are brung to  family units  that all have to have 2 children and 2 parents  Anyways  Jonas is turning 12 and has to go to the Ceremony of Twelves to receive his job that is chosen for every Twelve by the Committee of Elders  Jonas  unlike the others  received a special job as the Receiver of Memory  His job is basically to receive memories of the past for the previous Receiver who is now called the Giver  Only the Giver and Jonas know about this memories   remember that it s going to become important  For the first time The Giver gives Jonas memories of nice things like snow and rainbows  but then you realize Jonas has never experienced any of this memories before  As the book goes on  you start to find that things like snow  war and even COLOR don t exist in this world anymore  The Giver has to bare all the good and bad memories of those times  This is what I like about this book  It makes you think about how the world would be different without choices of what to do and everything pretty much the same  Jonas thinks this is unfair and hatches a plan with The Giver to give his memories to everyone  The plan is Jonas would go  Elsewhere  which is a place where no one ever goes  The Giver would tell everyone that Jonas has died and would have to give his memories to them because there s no Receiver  What happens to Jonas when he goes to Elsewhere is so mind boggling that I m not going to spoil it  it s that amazing  I recommend this book to anyone who is into mysteries or people who like books that really make you think  Let me start out saying first of all that I really liked this book  I read it within the span of a day  I couldn t put it down But then again I really like dystopian type novels  This is like a kid s version of The Handmaid s Tale  Fahrenheit 451 and 1984 all mixed together  I didn t realized when starting the book that it was a part of a series  so I will definitely be reading the other 3 books  So about the story  it s about a boy that realizes that he is different in a world of  sameness   He is chosen as The Receiver  so that he can hold memories for everyone else  He holds all of the love  all of the pain  all of these feelings for a society that doesn t want them  The story changes as he realizes that he has the power to give those memories to others  and that feelings are powerful  This book was really good  but just ended   we don t know what happens after  So if you plan on reading this book  make sure you have the rest of them  so you can get some answers  My wife read this back in grade school and suggested I read it now  For a small book  it held so much controversy surrounding a totalitarian community  I loved how  edgy  it was  so to speak  Wish I had read it when I was younger  but my perception of it may have differed then  I cannot imagine living in a world such as Jonas had to live in  but he did not know of all the pains that had been  nor of love  Such a two edged sword  he was spared of feeling any pain  yet he wasn t unable to grasp what it meant to love and be loved  I would have certainly done the same as he had in the story  Anger would have came first from me  to know of the truths of his community  as well as the truths of the memories from  back and back and back   At the same time  the sadness was thick  I feel he felt love for Fiona  and I am sure that is what anyone else could see when they read it  as well  The book had a strong depth to it  and such a feeling of love and determination in Jonas  He certainly was a hero in that book     I read this book in grade 7  but after reading it again  my thoughts about the book changed    The Giver  is a profound read that has captured the hearts of many since its first release in 1993  Unfortunately for  The Giver  it has also been one of the most controversial and banned books throughout the years   The Giver  has been banned by many schools and other institutions because of some of its themes such as euthanasia  infanticide  suicide  and also some of the violent and sexual passages that many thought were inappropriate for young minds  I disagree with the banning of this book because it is one of the more inspiring intellectual reads out there  I believe that many  young people especially  could learn and benefit from the themes that are taught in this book Lois Lowry uses the premise of a utopian society to introduce to its readers the lifestyle and cultural differences that could be faced  while still having a subtle undercurrent of deception  This Let the reader know that something was seriously wrong in this seemingly wonderful lifestyle  I really loved learning about this secretive world and discovering along with Jonas that not everything is as it seems and that some rules were meant to be broken   The Giver  by Lois Lowry is a though provoking and delightful read for readers of all ages and personalities  I finally read the modern classic  The Giver  and I m so glad I did  I bought a pretty edition with all four books in the quartet and can t wait to read the rest  Kinda surprised to read that Lowry didn t think there needed to be other books after this one  The ending is the perfect setup for a sequel PlotEvery page was like a sucker punch  Just when you think   Okay  maybe this society isn t so bad  Look at how nice they all are to each other  look at how they care for each other  aw  isn t that nice    wait  they do WHAT   Yeah  pretty much the whole time  Wanted to kill a few characters  but I guess you can t really blame them when they literally don t know any better CharactersOf course  I loved Jonas and the Giver  A wonderful relationship  much like a grandfather would be to him  I loved watching Jonas s transformation as he  receives  and the world around him changes drastically  I m interested to see what happens with the girl in the next books and the baby Writing QualityBrilliant  Lowry writes simply  but powerfully  No wonder it s won awards  Perfect for all ages  Well  maybe not  like  infants and toddlers  but you know what I mean EntertainmentLet s just say  I am super excited for the movie because I couldn t put this book down  I hated to leave Jonas in the hands of his crazy world  I had to know what would happen next  I d say this book  on top of all the sucker punches and whatnot  is a slow burn that gets hotter with every page  So much builds by the end  it kinda made me want to scream  Okay  so I did scream  Many times  It was enough for me to give it 5 stars and that happens rarely  A book really has to move me to get 5 stars  And it did  If there ever needed to be a better argument for individuality  this is it See the full review in the Land of What Ifs  I think The Giver is a wonderful book because of the interesting features  The things about it are amazing and the way it was told  This book  started slow  but toward the middle of the book it started to become more adventurous  I feel great that I read this book because it made me think about other things that the characters also wondered what it was  Also  it made me think that it s not only us and it s not only now because even though you don t think about the other things that are around us you only think about what s next to us  People are thinking that we live in a utopia  but we don t because there are so many bad things that are starting to happen that not a lot of us know about because we aren t being aware of what s out there  It made me think about a lot of things that go on around me that I don t ever wonder about  Imagine a community where all citizens are assigned to a certain division based on their age  Now  just imagine living in that community  In the book  The Giver   by Lois Lowry  all citizens live in this society  Growing up in this community was pretty simple  That is  until Jonas reaches the twelfth division  When one reaches division twelve  they get assigned a permanent career  Jonas has been extremely anxious just waiting for this day to come  This day of decision is one of the most important days because it determines and shapes your entire future  During the ceremony  Jonas waits very impatiently to be called up to the stage and be granted his placement  However  the ceremony comes to an end and Jonas is still not called  Eventually  Chief Elder summoned Jonas up to the stage and granted him with the position of a Receiver  Now this position was very rare and was only given to people who carried the right attributes  These were intelligence  integrity  courage and the most essential  wisdom  After being assigned receiver  Jonas realizes that he knows more than anyone else does  This becomes a problem for him  he suddenly does not fit in with his community like he used to  Jonas can no longer take what is happening  He can see things that has happened that he has never even experienced or seen first hand  In order to escape this  Jonas must leave his community  But will he get away  This is a really good book  It has you constantly guessing about what will happen next  There is lots of action in this book and it makes you wonder what it would actually be like to live in a community like the one in the book  I strongly encourage others to read this  I promise you that it is worth the read  An absolute must for young and old alike  I thought that this book was really good  First  Jonas is in a community where you don t get any freedom  He lives in a utopia that doesn t allow you to see color  choose your family or choose your job  He soon later is picked to be the receiver of memories  This allows you to see the world different from everybody else  You see memories of the past like a holiday or a sled ride  But these doesn t mean there are not bad memories  He soon gets a memory of warfare and suffering  HE soon runs away before Gabriel s release and is never seen again I thought that this book was really good  I would recommend this book for people who like kind of a creepy feeling to the story  Over all I thought that this book was really good and everyone should read it   The book the giver by Lois lowery  was about a boy named Jonas  who lived in the perfect community with little to no problems  at the ceremony of 12 Jonas was given the profession of being the Giver  the person in the community who remembers all the memoirs of the community  Jonas meets the Giver who give him the memories and they devise a plan to have the people of the community change there ways  My favorite part of the book was when they skipped Jonas at the ceremony of 12and then he found out he had a very important job in the community  I recommend this book to someone who like to by inspired by a story or even a little adventure  1  I read this book because the movie of the book is about to come out and I wanted to read the book before the movie came out  I also heard it was a good book  and many friends and family members had recommended it for me to read  I also love dystopian books so I thought this would be a great novel to read 2  I found the character Jonas the best character because he was so determined to get everything back to the way it was before everything had changed  He is also mature  knowledgeable  and selfless  Although he is only twelve  he knows more than the typical adult  He has the knowledge of most of the human race for generations and generations  while the average adult mostly only knows about what they have experienced  It s no surprise that he flips out towards the ending of the novel because of all the pain and frustration he has been through  It s easy for us to talk about freedom  but for Jonas  he doesn t quite know about freedom  and when he does experience freedom  he realises it s nothing but dangerous  Although he made the wrong choice I believe he had lived in the moment and made that decision based on the facts he had  Jonas is the clear hero of this book  but at the same time exposed to danger enough to seem human  3   If you were to be lost in the river  Jonas  your memories would not be lost with you  Memories are forever   I like this quote because it tells the readers that memories last forever  therefore we need to make the most of our lives and create the happiest memories  but we also have to acknowledge that pain and happiness go hand in hand  therefore after the good stuff  the bad stuff begins  4  I learnt that if you can make a difference in the world then you should at least attempt to try because if you don t try  you don t get a chance to succeed  Jonas put his life at risk to try and make everything better  and in the end  it paid off for him   It was a really good book  The story is interesting and the characters are likable  I have always enjoyed Dystopian books so I may be a little bias  I will say I have a personal preference of wanting futuristic worlds a little more explained  As in  I like it when by the end of the book I have a good idea of how the society came to be how it came to be  whether it is explicitly written in or you are able to assume  I felt like this book was a little short on that  It left the how and why a little vague  I suppose that is good because it is up to the reader  but I guess it is just preference  That is why I didn t let it affect my rating of the book  It is a good book though and I recommend it to anyone  You do have to read it with the knowledge that it was written for kids and young adults  or least with the idea that it is more of a tale than a realistic representation of what a dystopian society would look like  That being said the characters are plenty real and believable  but the plot gives the feel more of a fable than a  real  account  I will also say since this is the audio book version  I listened to the first few chapters and didn t really like the performance and so I read the rest in an actual book  The guy who reads this version is good  and he does a good job for Jonas and such  but a lot of the other characters just don t fit with his voice  and he can make some things sound a lot cheesier than they really are  He kind of sounds like Christopher Walken though  which IS and upside no matter how you see it   I know this book seemed like it took forever for me to read  I agree with that  The reason behind that is that I saw the movie at the beginning of starting to read this book  It is always hard for me to read a book after I have seen the film  I am glad I continued to read this book  I absolutely loved it  I don t ever remember reading this book in school like others I know  The author surely knows how to write  Once I got into it  I couldn t put it down  I love reading books like this and Hunger Games  It makes readers really think of what could possibly happen in the distant future  Books like these makes you really think about a lot  It makes your appreciate life as it is now  it shows  for me  how truly blessed I am in my life  To be able to be your own self is a luxury that others don t have  I am sure I will continue to read more books by Lois Lowry cause loved this one so much  If I had read this in my younger days  I think I wouldn t have appreciated it as much as I do now Happy Reading       Jonas lives in a community based on sameness  This community is futuristic and different from ours   One day at the ceremony of 12 Jonas gets an unusual job is separated from the other 12 s  Jonas is now becoming the new receiver   Many events and reoccurring shocking things happen throughout the story  What would Jonas do and how will he save the community  This book has been given a John Newbery Award for the spectacular story  The author is Lois Lowry  she has written other great books such as Son  Messenger  and A summer to die  Most of her books are written for young adults  so I would recommend this book for 6th 12th grade  Consider this spectacular book  as a choice because it is very addicting   Giver by Lois Lowry The Giver is about a kid named Jonas  He lives in this perfect community at the ceremony of 12  When you turn twelve and get a job by the community  Jonas finds out he is the new receiver which only rear people get the memories of the people in his community  Jonas will go on this crazy adventure to let all the people in his community get all their memories back  So they can remember things they forgot or feelings that they did not have in a long time  Jonas gets in some trouble on the way to his crazy adventure  You will have to read the book to find out what will happen next  I like this book because it is so interesting how there community is different to ours  I also like it because it makes you think how great your life is here and should not feel sad about it  The thing that will get most kids interested about this book is that the book takes you on the adventure of this young kid and how he is serving his life in a boring place  I recommend this book to all young adults because they will enjoy this book It also is a Newbery Medal  I like this story  it is short and short is usually not my thing   but this was good  a world where there is no color   no changing weather  your job picked out for you  you apply for a spouse and you receive one that is picked out to match you  I don t think I could live a whole life like that   but to visit would be nice  I was captured by Jonas and his amazing love  he has a good heart  but I want more story  I want to know what happens to the giver and the village when the memories are released  I want to know what happens with Jonas and Gabriel when they reach elsewhere  I want to see the giver reunited with his daughter  I give this 5 stars but I need more  please say there will be more  If you could always be healthy and well fed  would you sacrifice all freedom This is the question that you ask yourself while reading this touching  heart wrenching  interesting  amazing book  I cried  I smiled  I laughed  I debated freedom and feeling with my mother  This book was so moving as so amazing that I would say it is the best book that I have ever read  for its message and writing style  I would recommend it to anyone  as it is entertaining for people of 8 to 90  I loved it and even if you didn t  whatever  nothing will change that  I think it is the best book I have ever had the privilege of reading As close to perfection as you can get  This book was published in 1993  when I was already in high school  so it wasn t required reading for my class  I have heard nothing but good things about The Giver  Every student who saw me reading it told me they loved it when they had to read it in Middle School  As far as the book  I really enjoyed it  It is most definitely a dystopian and a fairly disturbing one at that  Jonas is a well rounded character  The reader understands his struggle to fit in with his world and his family unit  I don t want to do too much of a review because I don t want to give away the plot details  As much as I liked Jonas  that feeling turned to amazed love in the last couple of chapters of the book  I had to continually remind myself that he was only 12 years old  I have said that the ending of Saint Iggy by K L  Going was the worst ending of a book that ever was  I was wrong  The ending of The Giver was the worst ending of a book that ever was  Calling it a cliffhanger doesn t do it justice   This was one of my favorite books  I got so wrapped up in the characters and the story line  My favorite aspect of the book was how many surprises you got as you progressed through the book  This book was also very easy to read  One of the strengths of the book is that it is a series and this is the first book of the series so in order for you to read all of them then you might feel that you have to read the first one  It is also award winning so you might see that and want to read it  I will probably continue to read the series because there is such a cliff hanger i was left on and the series tells of other people in his community  The character development was also very well done being able to see how much Jonas changed throughout this book  I strongly suggest that everyone reads this book because it will be appealing to many people  QUESTO LIBRO  Un libro de verdad HERMOSO La gran ensenanza que nos deja  el por que necesitamos los sentimientos  es maravillosa  Inmediatamente quede atrapado por la historia  no podia parar  Son pocas las palabras que puedo escribir para recomendarlo  por que me ocurre lo mismo que a Jonas  la multitud de sentimientos que tengo son dificiles de plasmar en palabras  Jonas y Gabriel se quedan en mi corazon  El final me ha arrebatado muchisimas lagrimas  One of the very best books that I ve read this year Imagine a colorless world  where everything is the same  everyone thinks the same way  talks the same way    they call it Sameness  Each year as kids grow older they receive something that marks their age  a jacket buttoned from the back  to learn to help each other   then a jacket buttoned from the front  to learn to do it themselves   then a jacket with pockets  to learn to keep their belongings   then a bike  then they start volunteering  and then when they finally turn 12  they get to know what they will be doing for the rest of their lives  their career job  depending on the results of their volunteer work and the observations of their instructors  Jonas turns 12  but he doesn t get a job  Not an ordinary job at least  He gets the most honored and most respected job there is  to be a Receiver  But it s also the hardest and most painful job there is  To learn that everything that you had been taught was a lie  or not the whole truth anyway   and to be given the permission to do and say things you d been prohibited to do or say  and the most important rule is never to discuss anything you learn with anyone  ever There can be only one receiver   the previous receiver before Jonas had been chosen becomes the Giver  and Jonas the new Receiver  Receiver of what  You ll have to read the book to know  I absolutely loved it  5 perfect stars  Since its release  in 1993  Lois Lowry s The Giver has been extolled  vilified  honored  winning the prestigious Newberry Award in 1994  and banned  It has been noted that some critics place it in the 100 Best Books for Children and  notably  the Christian Science Monitor was referenced as stating   Lowry s powerful book  simply and directly written  offers an inspiring defense of freedom  Both adventurous and skillfully plotted  this book is recommended for young readers 8 and up  The American Library Association lists the Lowry trilogy   The Giver  Gathering Blue and Messenger  among the most frequently challenged books of the 1990 s  coincidentally  it has been included   and remains   on junior high and high school reading lists throughout the country  What does one do when confronted with such strongly felt divergence of opinion and review  I don t know what  one  does  but I immediately sought out the first book in the  original  trilogy  The Giver  In 2012  the fourth book of The Giver series was released  Son  I intend to read them all  Highly recommended  this book is so good    it s about this boy  he lives in a special place  and he gets a job that s really special  so he works with this man   I must be the only person ever who got through elementary school without reading this book  I m kind of sad I didn t get to read it as a child  but now  as an adult  I still enjoyed it quite a lot I liked the simplicity of the storytelling  the matter of fact tone of the narrator  I loved Jonas and The Giver and their relationship  as well as    other relationships that I won t mention so as not to post spoilers just in case someone else made it through school without reading this book If I have a criticism it s that I wanted more  More of everything  I wish this book was longer  I wish Lowry would have taken her time developing Jonas and his relationships with everyone  especially The Giver  I wish we would have been given even more by way of contrasts between the  before  and  after  parts of the story   Again  I don t want to say too much here   Mostly  I wish the ending was more resolved  I d probably fit in well into the community of Sameness because I like order and predictability  hence the ending falling so flat for me  Don t get me wrong  it s a wonderful ending  but I wish  once again  lol   that there was MORE  I wanted to be inside Jonas  head more as the story reached it s climax  I wanted things to be more clear and defined But I understand that this is children s literature and needed to be made simple  I think this is a wonderful book for teens and pre teens to read and think about  It s more emotional and not as tedious a read as 1984 or Brave New World  so I can see many young readers enjoying this book as much as I did  Jonah grew up in a utopian society where everything was closely regulated and a feeling of  same ness  existed  In this society  when a group of children turn twelve they are given their job assignment  As Jonah s group nears the Ceremony of Twelves  a feeling of anticipation feels Jonah as he is unsure what his job assignment will be   or even what he d want it to be  However  when the day comes  he could have never guessed his life would change so drastically  He is selected to be the next Receiver of Memory  Not knowing what all this selection entails Jonah accepts and he soon begins his training with the current Receiver  I can t really explain why this book is one of my favorites   and has been since I first read it in 6th grade  There is something about the power of knowledge and the dangers of  same ness   Though some may feel that such strict regulations  no disease or sickness  and no knowledge of individuality is good   it is  safe   However this book teaches of the dangers and wrongness of such a society  I also love the characters   especially Jonah and the Giver  As I am reading this book I feel like I can step in their shoes and really feel as they are feeling  This is such a powerful book and I think that there is much that can be learned from it Science Fiction  The Giver is a really good book  I would recommend this book to anyone  It kind of shows how people don t get to make their decisions so it shows you how important it can be to make your own decisions  This book was amazing  One part that I loved was when Jonas was scared because he wasn t called up  The only reason that I like that part is because he ends up getting a better job then all the other kids  I didn t like when Jonas found out what release meant because that basically told him he lived with a killer which is why he didn t want to go back home  At the beginning it starts out slow but starts to pick up and gets interesting  I now understand the front cover better than I did when I first picked the book  Jonas makes some pretty big decisions in this book  If that was me I don t think I could have done some of the things that he did  The book actually taught me a few things  It taught me that in this world it is better to be able to make your own decisions than for someone to make it for you  It is also better to not have to follow guidelines that are a little over the top  I also know that it is better to live then be released  Jonas towards the end made his own decisions though which really surprised me  I just think its weird how for some jobs are better than others like you get to have cooler things than others may have  Like what Jonas gets towards the end of the book  I hope that others can read The Giver and realize how great this world is that we live in instead of the one that they do in the book   This book should be required reading for everyone with the emotional maturity to handle it  I believe that blindly labeling The Giver as a children s book is neither realistic nor necessarily wiseVery few things leave me mentally stuttering as I struggle to put my thoughts into words  but  somehow  The Giver has done just that  It will take me a while to be able to make sense of  not the story  but my response to it The Giver is a deftly crafted work  both stunningly beautiful and deeply disturbing    Finding myself being intrigued by the peace  order  safety and serenity of Jonas s world  This story is haunting and powerful  It s a raw portrayal of the presumed moral sacrifices that a person would have to make in order to create and maintain a Utopian society  and the acceptable naivety of the horrors that would accompany it Perhaps what is most frightening to me is the way I so easily assumed  at first  that Jonas saw the world as I do   that the words were being used in the way I understood them  The realization that his newly deposited knowledge gives him is almost terrifying  definitely unnerving  This is not a happy ending  feel good read    although I suppose it could be for those who read books without truly experiencing them  but I don t know how to do that  so for me it was a painful experience  I m glad I read it  as it s made me think about things in a way I wouldn t have otherwise  and I appreciate that  I don t know that I would have read it had I known how real Jonas s and the Giver s pain would be to me  I first read The Giver when I was in eighth grade and it quickly become one of my favorite books  It was my first introduction into Dystopian Fiction  a genre that I have grown to love over the years  I have since reread this book several times  as I have experienced one of those full circle moments   I am now the teacher sharing this wonderful novel with my students  Each time I read it  I find something new  I am struck again and again by the idea of a Utopian society  On paper it sounds great   no war  no crime  no poverty  no disease  every need met  everyone has a place and purpose  complete harmony  That is until you start to consider the cost of that perfection   the loss of freedom  free will  individuality  etc  It s these conflict desires that make the story so intriguing  I loved experiencing the awakening of Jonas to the truth behind his community and I love watching my students experience it as well  I love the relationship between Jonas and the Giver and Jonas and Gabriel  The one thing I don t love about this novel is the ending  I am always left with a desire for more  What happens to Jonas and Gabe  What happens to the people they left behind  What affects does Jonas s decision have on the community  I know there are sequels to this novel  which I have not gotten around to reading yet  although I have decided that I will get to them this year    but I don t think any of them will answer my questions  Perhaps that is part of the brilliance of the novel  Perhaps Lois Lowry wrote the ending the way she did so that we  the reader  would be free to imagine our own  I ve read some dystopian novels  but not a lot  Of the several that I have read  this is probably my favorite  Lowry s world building is superlative  and she drew me in quickly and completely  The book demands some suspension of disbelief  but Lowry even made that easy for me  I liked the book s ambiguity  You can take it as a political novel  for example  but there s no reason why you have to  Likewise  it wasn t clear to me whether the dystopian society is located on our planet  in the distant future  or on our planet  in the near future  or on some other planet  or even in some kind of alternative universe  Again  this ambiguity did not bother me  but  in fact  I liked it  Perhaps some of this ambiguity is cleared up in the sequels  but I hope not  Lately I ve done some light reading and thinking about the nature of disorder  and have decided that chaos is a bogeyman that we don t have to fear  Yet we do fear it  and that is central to this book  It calls the reader to ask himself  or herself   What am I willing to surrender in order to achieve order in all areas of life  How much order do I really need  You can scratch out order and pencil in safety if you want  Because I ve also been doing some light reading and thinking about how power corrupts  I saw that in the The Giver  too  especially in how easy it is for powerful people to do evil  or how easy it is for people to overlook evil done by the powerful  because  I m just doing my job  or  I m just following orders   Again  the book s ambiguity allows the reader to think about any number of issues  It s also a great coming of age story  with a lovable  interesting  and admirable pre teen hero  Hard to identify an antagonist  really  yet that didn t bother me somehow  All characters are fully developed  Main plot is interesting  creepy  disturbing  and entertaining  More than anything  it s utterly original  If you re a parent giving this book to your child  be aware that its themes include infanticide  euthanasia  and suicide  I never read it as a child  so I can t give it a child s review  I can only say that as an adult reader  I loved it   The Giver is a novel about a dystopian society  where everyone has converted to  Sameness  and can t feel love or pain  or see in color  The main character  Jonas  is assigned to be a  Receiver  who receives the memories of life before  Sameness   He meets the previous receiver  the  Giver   and is completely confused when he first starts learning what the Giver needs to convey to him  As Jonas learns more and more about the truth of society  and gains knowledge about life  he struggles with whether he should stay in his community or pursue a potentially dangerous life elsewhere  with this new knowledge  This is an example of science fiction  as it occurs in another time and place  it also delves into moral and social issues about society and the rules we live by This would be a good book for older elementary  likely 6th grade  It d be an excellent book to develop vocabulary  and to use graphic organizers to discuss the plot in each chapter of the book  It d also be a good resource to use for writing tasks  developing prompts to have students write persuasive letters  asking the leaders of the society to demolish  sameness    opinion papers  which choice would you have made if you were Jonas    or descriptive writing to re imagine parts of the world in The Giver  This is to me what a classic book should be  It is easy to read  the language sufficient for the material but not dumbed down or showy  It presents Important Ideas  things that makes you think  but isn t preachy  And    something I ve been missing of late in  great books     a page turning story  I read this practically in a single sitting  and in the moments when I couldn t read  my thoughts were never far from the book and trying to guess what was going to happen  or what the explanation was behind the dystopia portrayed in the book I don t want to give away what happens because the suspense was one of the big attractions for me  but I will just say that the one drawback for me was the ending  It wasn t entirely clear what happened  or what it revealed about the protagonist s community  And I was left with a ton of unanswered questions  like how certain technologies worked  what the rest of the world was like  and what happened with the Giver  In terms of the book s message and story  these are not necessary to have answered  but I was so drawn into the world that I felt a bit cheated at being left with an incomplete picture of it  Still  this is the best book I ve read in a long time  and even though it s catalogued as a Young Adult book  it s by no means only for children  In fact  there are certain themes that I feel are too adult for pre teens  not with sex  other things   and I wouldn t recommend this to my 10 year old daughter because there are things that would make her cry and probably give her nightmares  But then she is very sensitive   This book was very dark  but that s what I liked about it  The world that Lois Lowry creates is very dull  and grey  No color  This book would be really good for someone who is very interested in books that are kind of sad  I didn t realize that the world in this book was actually colorless  until Jonah starts seeing color  I didn t really get the aging ceremony  they didn t really explain it very well in the book  Something I really would like to ask Jonah is what happens to him at the end of the book  As I said before  this book would be amazing for someone who really likes dull grey books  and it s a super interesting book  I loved reading it  I got so hooked  Science FictionJonas lives in a utopian society devoid of fear  pain  color  weather  and more  and when he turns twelve he gets his special job in the community  He begins to train to be the new Giver  a job that consists of learning about and keeping the memories of real life  a  The author s excellent use of descriptions helps to develop the characters  explain the society  and help to detail the Giver s memories The details of the society allow the reader to imagine what it would be like to live in a world where everyone gets their first bike at the same age  where you only have one sibling  and you know where your future lies at age twelve  Her tone and almost factual way of describing the community at the beginning of the book even implies that the characters are simple people  living a satisfying life  with not many strong or negative emotions  When Jonas starts to mentor with the current Giver  the language and descriptions of the book change to show more emotion and complexity  The details of the simple things in life  such as snow or the  bright  whirling torrent of crystals in the air   p 81   make you think of all the amazing wonders of the world that we take advantage of  Other descriptions of everyday things in our world  such as an elephant  a  towering  immense creature   p 101  or falling   his face scraped along jagged edges of ice   p  109   Curriculum Connection  This science fiction novel detailing a perfect society would be perfect to teaching children about current communities  utopian societies  and allow for great discussions about why a perfect society would not ideal    In The Giver by Lois Lowry the theme of the story is that even though one may love something or someone they may have to give it up to do the right thing  In the novel Jonas  the main character  abandons his family and his community for the better of the world  The Giver takes place in a distant future  and is told in the point of view of third person omniscient narrating Jonas s life  Jonas lives in a perfect world  He lives with his family  and hangs out with friends  He lives in a community  where roles are assigned  no choices  no fear  no pain  and no war  It s time for Jonas and the other kids in his community who are turning twelve  to be assigned a role in the community  Everything goes as planned until Jonas doesn t get assigned  At the end of the ceremony  the council member explains to him and the crowd  that Jonas has been assigned the most respected and honored role in the community  The Receiver of Memories  Jonas begins his training with an old man  called The Giver  The Giver gives Jonas  piece by piece  all of the memories of the world  Such as sledding down a hill  and sitting in a boat that is floating in a lake  Not all the memories are peaceful like this  and with these memories comes dark secrets  I enjoyed The Giver a lot  I couldn t stop reading when I first picked it up  I thought the book could have been longer  but it was written so well by Lois Lowry that it made up for everything  One of my favorite quotes from the book is   The worst part of holding the memories is not the pain  It s the loneliness of it  Memories need to be shared    154  I like this line  because even though this happens in a non realistic setting  I feel like some people can relate to it  Other people and I can relate to it because sometimes if someone keeps all their emotions and memories bottled up  they might begin to feel like no one understands them  that they are all alone  This book can relate to the reader in many different ways  I recommend this book to any readers who are looking for a short  but great story to read  The Giver by Lois Lowry Book Rating 5 5Lois Lowry has given her young adolescent readers yet another thought revoking piece of literature with her book The Giver  The story is told from the point of view of her 12 year old male protagonist  Jonas  a uniquely  wise young fellow  He lives in a utopian town  where everyone follows  the rules   each member of society has an assigned role  no person is different  and no one feels anything  Sounds pretty twisted right  Well  that s just the first few chapters  The storyline is so complex and mysterious  Jonas and the other 12 year olds  The Twelves  are given their  assignment  or role in society  While his friends are given interesting roles  he is given the most difficult of them all  He is chosen to be the Receiver  which is the person that holds all the memories and dark secrets of their perfect little town  Jonas is at first thrilled with being able to experience feelings of happiness and love  but soon terrified by his feelings of pain  pity  and secrecy  He is torn between keeping his assigned role and escaping to Elsewhere  Being that this book is for a younger audience  I believe Lois Lowry presents her readers with a very controversial text  It allows the reader to explore emotional  social  and political issues  Lowry leaves the imagination of the reader in amazement with the ending of story  The Giver is a puzzling  yet delightful read  If you re looking for a book that leaves room for interpretation  this will do it for you   Masterpiece  bkl m

n tbrh mslman bh bTryq  fj   rwy   Zym   shk  nny s  yd qrth    Really and truly amazing  The Giver is such a short book but there is so much  I never read it as a kid  when it was published  so I have an adults perspective  Astonishment  A little humor  Grief  Joy  It s all there and I was able to read it in one day  Not in one sitting  but I picked it back up as soon as possible  It reminds me of The Hunger Games in a way  the total control as the result of the past  I was also reminded of City of Ember  the occupations assigned rather than chosen  and I have to mention the low view they have of Birth Mothers   though I have only seen the film adaptation  A perfect world  Because it avoids all possible problems by absolute control and swift punishment  Painless perhaps  but lifeless  The only point would be continuing the human race  but to what end  The continue the human race  strictly controlled of course  all hormonal influences are controlled  but they don t really live  experience the world around them  Yes  it is worthwhile to feel the pain if that allows love and joy as well  Incredible   I can say that The Giver by Lois Lowry was one of the best books I have ever read  I have never been a big fan of books  until the moment that I started reading The Giver  I couldn t spend a day without reading as many pages as possible  The emotional tension and the different reality of the book kept me fascinated  The idea of an  inverted  society in relation to beliefs  relationships and ideals made me want to know more and more about it  The fact that  The Giver  is a Science Fiction book  but still having a concept of society  made it an unpredictable plot  I never knew what could happen next  because inside the idea of Science Fiction stories anything can happen  But after all  the book has its limit to imagination  the main subject is not about aliens or monsters  but a society made of strict rules and different concepts  which was the fact that kept me entertained the most    Do you love me   There was an awkward silence for a moment  Then Father gave a little chuckle   Jonas  You  of all people  Precision of language  please    What do you mean   Jonas asked  Amusement was not at all what he had anticipated  Your father means that you used a very generalized word  so meaningless that it has become almost obsolete   his mother explained carefully  In this passage  Jonas ask their parents if they love him  Which in  our lives  it is a normal question to be asked  It is really interesting how is the level of intimacy and relationship between people  even relatives in this book  While reading this book  I could compare the difference between their reality of life and  ours   The discoveries made by the main character Jonas about  our life  made me imagine myself living without these certain basic things  I would recommend  The Giver  to anyone who hasn t read it yet  Mainly to the ones who likes Science Fiction books  people who are tired of expected plots and also the ones that are interested in comparing the  real life  reality and the book s narrative  Enjoy it  Jonas is about to assigned a career for the rest of his life  He s nervous what the Chief Elder has in store for him  All his life  he s lived in a society where he must speak proper and precise language and have mandatory family discussions during breakfast and lunch about their dreams and day  When Jonas receives the honor of being selected as the Receiver of Memory  he starts seeing his society in a different perspective and believes it would be a better place if the people knew what he sees during his training  After seeing and understanding what life used to be  it becomes difficult for Jonas to go back to what society wants of him This was a quick read and I thoroughly enjoyed it  I like the idea of how each age group receives something new each year up to the age of 12  However a lot of it is ridiculous because the people can t make decisions for themselves because they believe it ll end in chaos  No one can decide to marry  what career they want or how to cut their hair  This society would ve been bland and boring if the narrator wasn t Jonas since he starting to  see beyond  everyone else  It was great reading how Jonas changed from being one of the 12s to becoming an individual throughout the book  Before the ceremony  he listened and done everything he said like when he had the  stirrings  and was at the age to start taking the pill  When in reality  it s normal for kids his age to feel that way  Then after the ceremony when he s been doing his training he makes the decision himself to stop taking it  Jonas starts questions everything and makes decisions for himself  This is such a great book for a thoughtful reader  The idea of  sameness  and not giving people freedom of choice  or freedom of anything  for that matter  is so foreign to most kids teens who might take such things for granted  The idea of removing color  love  and affection from the world in order to also spare people from pain  war  and death is powerful  and will make for some great conversations  Jonas is brave and amazing   Rating  5  5  E foarte riscant Dar ori de cate ori un copil deschide o carte  el impinge in laturi poarta care l desparte de Altundeva  Iar asta ii da de ales  Ii da libertate Sunt lucruri magnifice si minunat de nesigure    p 205  Astazi am terminat de citit prima carte inceputa in 2016  Ma bucur foarte mult ca am ales ca Darul de Lois Lowry sa fie prima carte pe care o citesc in acest an  deoarece mi a placut extrem de mult  Am sesizat ca aceasta este prima din seria The Giver  insa nu cred ca este musai sa citesti si urmatoarele carti pentru a intelege mesajul autoarei Cartea  publicata initial in 1993  are o idee originala  cu toate ca unii ar putea o compara cu usurinta cu distopiile care au tot aparut in ultima perioada  Diferenta majora dintre distopiile clasice si aceasta este mesajul din spate  un mesaj de care am fost profund miscata Actiunea il urmareste pe un baiat pe nume Jonas  care locuieste intr o societate destul de ciudata pentru noi  Un loc unde totul pare perfect  nu exista suferinta  abateri de la reguli  toata lumea este civilizata  amabila  cu un loc de munca pregatit pentru viitor  Toti sunt ca niste marionete care sunt dirijate generatie dupa generatie in baza acelorasi reguli Cu siguranta ca de multe ori ne dorim sa nu mai simtim durerea  suferinta  foametea  si multe alte lucruri neplacute ale vietii  Insa  dupa ce cititi aceasta carte  va veti schimba parerea cu siguranta  Lumea creata de Lois Lowry este o lume perfecta din anumite puncte de vedere  dar este in acelasi timp o lume monocroma  in care sentimentele practic nu exista  fiecare personaj avandu si actiunile si cuvintele aproape programate in memorie In momentul in care Jonas isi descopera viitoarea slujba  toata cartea are sa se schimbe  Am aflat raspunsuri la intrebari care mi se formasera in minte  si am fost de multe ori terifiata de adevaruri dureroase  care l au afectat emotional si pe protagonist Nu va puteti imagina ce frumusete se ascunde in spatele acestei carti  Cuvintele lui Lois Lowry par ca o poezie care curge firesc asemenea raului pe care aceasta il mentioneaza la finalul cartii  Raul in care au venit mici firicele de apa ce i au creat lumea pe care mi a expus o  O lume in care   numai noi si doar acum   pare sa conteze  insa in care Altundeva capata un inteles special  fiind locul unde pare ca viata este ceea ce ar trebui sa fie Am incercat sa nu va dau prea multe detalii despre aceasta lectura  dar cred ca am reusit sa va transmit cateva lucrusoare care mi au atras atentia  Cartea este absolut superba  si v o recomand cu mare drag  Stilul autoarei va va cuceri  si va va transporta cu gandul Altundeva      Citate    Poate c a avut aceeasi Nascatoare ca tine Jonas ridica din umeri si i urma inauntru  Insa fusese uimit de ochii noucopilului  Existau putine oglinzi in comunitate  nu erau interzise  dar lumea nu prea avea nevoie de ele  iar Jonas pur si simplu nu catadicsise sa se priveasca in oglinda  in situatiile cand ajungea intr un loc unde se gasea asa ceva  Acum  vazandu l pe noucopil si observandu i cautatura  isi aduse aminte ca ochii deschisi la culoare nu numai ca erau rari  dar le confereau posesorului o expresie anume   dar ce  Profunzime  hotari el  ca si cum te ai uita in apa limpede a unui rau  pana pe fund  unde stateau la panda lucruri inca nedescoperite  Nu se simti in largul lui cand isi dadu seama ca si el avea aceeasi expresie    p 30  Pedaland repede pe carare  Jonas simti o mandrie ciudata la gandul ca li se alaturase celor care luau pastile  Cu toate acestea  pret de o clipa isi reaminti visul  Ii provocase placere  Desi nutrea sentimente confuze  isi spuse ca i placusera acele sentimente pe care mama lui le numise Tulburari  Si si aduse aminte ca  dupa ce se trezise din somn  dorise sa le simta din nou Pe urma  la fel cum propria locuinta i se pierduse din vedere si ramasese in urma dupa ce cotise pe bicicleta  visul ii disparu din ganduri  Timp de cateva clipe  simtindu se vinovat  Jonas incerca sa si l readuca in minte  Dar sentimentele disparusera  Tulburarile incetasera sa existe    p 48  Se uita mai departe si o aclama pe Lily  care urca mandra pe scena  deveni Optara si primi haina de identificare pe care avea s o poarte tot anul   de data asta o haina cu nasturi mai mici si  pentru prima data  cu buzunare  ceea ce insemna ca era suficient de matura ca sa aiba grija de propriile lucrusoare  Ramase pe loc si asculta cu un aer solemn indrumarile ferme cu privire la raspunderile pe care le aveau Optarii si la efectuarea in premiera a orelor de voluntariat  Insa Jonas isi dadu seama ca  desi parea atenta  Lily se uita cu jind la sirul de biciclete lucioase care aveau sa fie daruite Nouarilor in dimineata urmatoare   La anu   Lily billy    ii zise el in gand    p 54  Daca li se indicase tuturor  Poti sa minti Gandurile i se invartejira in minte  Acum  din moment ce avea voie sa puna intrebari extrem de grosolane   si dar fiind ca i se promisesera raspunsuri     putea  teoretic  desi i se parea aproape de neimaginat   sa intrebe pe cineva  pe un adult  poate chiar pe tatal lui    Tu minti   Insa n avea cum sa si dea seama daca raspunsul pe care urma sa l primeasca era adevarat    p 79   The Giver by Lois Lowry is the first novel in a series  The Giver is the foundation of dystopian literature  The Giver introduces what seems to be a perfect world  No pain  greed  hate or inequality  However  the community is hiding a darker nature  Jonas a twelve year old boy takes on the job of receiving all the memories from before the community  This is where the novel gets it s title as The Giver transfers memories to Jonas  The events that transpire next expose the community and send readers on a deep and personal journey The Giver is a quick read  With little over a hundred pages it packs a punch  This novel makes you look at how vital memories are  Better yet it shows how even our most painful memories are important  As Jonas discovers new emotions and memories I felt like it made me think about my own feelings  The Giver helps show just how important out ability to feel is  Jonas discovers love  and this really resonates  Is a  perfect  world really worth sacrificing love  Should we do away with difference  Or is difference what makes us more human  These are just a few bug questions the novel placed at my feet  Even after I finished the novel I still caught myself rethinking the plot and the moral questions it had imposed  The Giver does something I think other dystopian novels still cannot do  The Giver makes the journey a moral in depth exploration  As a reader it makes you really look at the world around us  and realize we have bad experiences  but also wonderful experiences  Sure other dystopian novels capture action and other ethical questions  However  The Giver did it first  Not to mention that The Giver never had a series laid out  The ending was originally just a cliff hanger  The Giver made a powerful in less than a hundred pages and a single book at the time it was written  The Giver was honestly a one of a kind novel  It has stayed with me every time I have read it and I have read it eight times  The message is so powerful I feel like it is a must read  This is easily my favorite novel of my short career as a reader  I highly recommend the rest of the books in the series    I read The Giver by Louis Lowry  I believe the theme of this book is growing up  I believe this because as the protagonist Jonas becomes older he is able to hear and see new things  The setting of this book is a little town where everyone knows everybody and nobody outside of the town  Jonas is a 12 years old and in his job he is able to hear memories from another character named the Giver  The Giver is an older man who tells Jonas these memories  when Jonas hears these memories he is very surprised to hear these memories and he is eager to tell people but he promised not to tell anybody   In a specific part in the book Jonas was told what his dads job really was and he had not known this before  I can relate to Jonas because as I have become older I am able to hear things I never knew before  I really liked the giver but it did have its cons  There was a lot of parts and words that were very hard to understand  Also The Giver had its pros  there were so many great action and exciting scenes in this book   I read this book kind of fast but it was really good  It s definitely a very interesting dystopian society   one where your life is controlled so that you have no feelings  Everything is basically assigned for you  your job is determined when you are 12 years old  and you don t feel love for other people since your significant other and children are assigned  Then  after your kids have grown up you move to the center for the old  and your children basically forget about you  There is no hunger  war  or sadness  but there is also no love and excitement in life The main character  Jonas gets the special assignment of Receiver by The Giver  who gives him those feelings of hunger  war  and sadness  but also those of love  happiness  and color  He begins to feel distance from his parents  his sister Lily  and his friends Asher and Fiona  And he also receives a shocking realization that people who are  released  from their community for not fitting the mold are actually killed  And then he and The Giver make a plan to run away and save the world   although I don t really get the science of how him leaving the society will transfer the feelings to other people  I think I m taking a little break from reading  but I ll have to read the next book soon   A quick read  yet still a thought provoking book  One of my favourites   As Clear as CrystalIn The Giver  Lois Lowry narrates the story through a very direct  concise and clear writing style  which builds a great amount of suspense as the plot develops and the reader s viewpoint on Jonas s community slowly but drastically changes  Her directions are not confusing  with each  episode  in the novel holding very clear descriptions of the setting and logically following the previous episode  creating a very clear and vivid mental picture inside the reader s mind throughout the story  Lowry describes the  ordinary  lives of the citizens in Jonas s community in such detail and clarity that  at first  makes the reader believe that they are living a content and happy lifestyle  Due to this impression that everything seems so perfect and well structured  the reader is not prepared for the horrible reality that lies beneath this peaceful surface  building a perfect amount of suspense that will keep the reader hooked on the novel  Jonas s internal character development and external action are perfectly balanced as he  and the reader  learns from the giver that life in his community is not as mellow as he thought it was  and decides to secretly leave his community  Overall  this simplistic writing style is perfect for the story and makes the reader constantly want to read more  especially in the end As Old as TimeAlthough the reader is at first led to believe that the author uses a basic writing technique  Lowry implements a very open ended plot structure that gives the reader freedom of interpretation  which is most apparent in the ending  Lowry appears to follow classic plot structure in the beginning of the novel  using  copycat features  such as an easily identifiable exposition and initiating event in the story  However  as the story progresses  her originality begins to shine through  with a climax that is not very  exciting  or  intense   but still very important   contrasting those of many other novels directed at young adults  However  the most unique part of the novel is the resolution  which does not hold any  definitive  ending  Instead  Lowry decides to end with Jonas and Gabe sledding down a hill together  they were starving  cold  and scared  but had each other  and their bond of love  It is not known whether they make it to another community  or die happily together  Lowry leaves the  definitive  ending open for the reader to decide  which perfectly meshes in with one of the story s major themes  which is the value of individual choice  This  open ended  writing technique makes The Giver one of the most unique and interesting novels of the genre  breaking beyond the limits of classic plot structure   This book is talking about there is a disaster in future world  In that world  people choose to forgot the path  And there are also some few new rules that we also have now  but people now doesn t follow the rules exactly  For example  no lying  There s also a new law in the future world  when people reach a given age  they are going to get a job  but they doesn t make a decision about what they do  only the elders will make the decision for them according to their attributes  So the main character of this book named Jonas  he didn t get sign for any position  he had been chosen the next of the  Receiver of Memories   The  Receiver of Memories  are also the  Giver   They pass the memories to the next generation of receiver   People choose to forgot the path  people s memories from the old path had been erased  but only the elders will know this  And the job of the  Receiver of Memories  is actually keeping the memories from old path  Every morning  people will get the vaccine to remove their emotion  so there will be a world without colors  music and most of the feelings   So the first day of Jonas  job  the  giver  pass to him a old memories to Jonas  There s color  music and a world full of love  In a few weeks of times  Jonas start knowing that the vaccine that they take every morning it s just to remove their emotion and he find a way to avoid from taking vaccine  He start seeing colors  knowing the rhythm of music and love  But he start thinking why people will choose to forget these beautiful world  So he start his journey to make everybody else  wake up   Feelings it s just a surface but emotion is deep from inside  I suggest everybody to read this book                    A wonderful story which unfolds at a quiet yet confident pace  The tale follows a a young boy whose life has been defined and directed by others since his birth  Every decision made by others  even the very job he will be doing now that he has come of age  The dystopia which Lowry creates is one of unique and outlandish quality  yet the antagonist fights this oppression in a most unusual manner  Breaking out of the action packed roller coaster rebellion  Lowry highlights the very things in life which we love laughter  love  music   colour to name a few   by removing them from society  to demonstrate the consequence of a perfect world with only peace  no pain   sorrow  I found the book gripping and thought provoking  with an intelligent ending that will throw many readers off  I did however find there was a bit of a gap between me and Jonas  the main character  in terms of being able to connect with him  and his place in the is clinical world which Lowry has created  Wasn t a big enough issue though to knock off a star and I would highly recommend this book to anyone who appreciates alternative ways of exploring human nature and society  But why can t they keep both of them See  this book is strong  There s some things that don t make complete and total sense such as how long has the Community been in existence  I got to admit a sadder ending sucks  but it makes more sense  It s probably better to pretend that the rest of the books in this series  including Son were never written and to just focus on this one  It is hard hitting and still shocking  The other books are    not so strong Also  continuity  It s needed  Lily was supposed to have her plush elephant taken away from her after becoming an 8 Another thing is  just how does this work  One person holding all the memories ever  How long would it take to give someone all the good memories and all the bad memories  Probably ages if you have every memory in the entire world  I love this book     This must have been the fifth time I read this book  The first time I read it  I was in sixth grade  and it was one of the few books that I actually enjoyed reading at the time  Throughout the years  I have recommended this book to countless people  all with them returning to say that it is an outstanding Utopian novel  The whole idea of Sameness is outrageous  especially to those who express their individuality all the time  Jonas  even before his training as the new receiver  he was different in his thoughts  He always made sure that everything had a name  always more curious than his peers  He didn t even fit in because his eyes were light  pale in comparison to everyone in the community except for the select few  Although the Giver  who is training Jonas  is tired and carrying a heavy burden on his shoulders  he still insists on taking the training easy because of what happened to his daughter  Rosemary  There are many twists and turns how the community functions and how the people of the community are completely brainwashed in their thinking  Jonas  who watched a releasing video of a newborn twin  he couldn t grasp the concept that these people  especially his father  actually murder the ones they are releasing without grasping the concept  Releasing is a time of joy  but loss is something harder to comprehend  The people of the community don t even understand colors  which is something absurd to us  The book has many compelling aspects  and it s hard to believe that people live in this way  They live this way because they want to prevent pain at all costs  They don t want to starve  overpopulate  freeze  or overheat  Everything is controlled including children  families  spouses  feelings of lust  and climate  There is no choice in anything that happens in the community  and that is what Jonas couldn t grasp  He wants choice  and at the end of the book  he is presented by the choice that he made by saving the young child that his family temporarily adopted from death and also leaving  so the community could have the memories that he received from the Giver  There is no small detail in this book  and it is enjoyed by all ages because of the many grasping concepts inside the novel  This is a must read  so enjoy the sled ride through the snow  a world shielded from a painful past but deprived of knowledge of love and life  I love Pleasantville  When I saw the trailer for The Giver  the transformation from black and white to color was enough for me to dig into this book  I wasn t dissapointed This book kind of represents a bridge between classics like 1984  brave new world and modern ones like divergent  matched and uglies The interesting thing about the book was the simplicity of it and still managing to deliver a good reading experience  The climax was more like a plan layout and then a spoiler to let you know how it turned out  I am not sure but that is not a proper climax  I mean yes we could have learned the plan but at least don t tell me the outcome right after I read about it  It kind of made a sedating effect  It s like the author wanted this  Well  let s say if climax was a hill  it wouldn t take much time to slide down to the bottom of it    Also I expected a lot more trouble before the plan  A little stirring would have made a great community soup  I ve read a bunch of readers wanting to know more about the community in this book  I liked the way it is  not too much information  I don t like to many details  I didn t notice a lack of substance while understanding the mechanics of this world  It s not like a whole new world  The futuristic elements were un sci fi ly scarce  It even felt like it s before our time Why I liked this book It was like a rebellion against all YA out there  Like it says  I am not gonna follow the rules  I won t count on your adrenaline  I won t try to impress you with mumbo jumbo and fancy words but you ll still love me   It is weird and I like it On a note  a creepy old dude on the cover was a really good choice for a children s book   _  In the first book of the quartet  Lois Lowry has written The Giver  This story follows Jonas as long as the rest of the community s way of life  Jonas s world was perfect  There is no fear  war  or pain  There are no choice  everything in their life is controlled  There is no real emotion  Everyone has a specific role in the community  When Jonas reaches the age of twelve  he is assigned a job in the community  along with the forty nine other kids that turn twelve  This year is a special year because they are picking a new Receiver of Memories and Jonas is the chosen one  After a unique ceremony  Jonas starts his training and learns all the secrets of the world  nothing that he has ever experienced before in his life  He learns and experiences war  real happiness  pain  and his favorite  love  During his days of training  he begins to realize a lot of things around him he didn t before  One of these things was death  He and his family had gotten a temporary guest because the little boy was having trouble functioning right  They called him Gabe  As Jonas connected with Gabe  and was hearing the things they had to do to him  he panicked and ran off with him  Jonas didn t want to lose his only friend  As they escape out of the community  they struggle to survive  and they can t turn back I would recommend this book to anyone who like futuristic stuff and suspense because even though this a fiction book  it could easily become real  I would also recommend it to anyone who likes a quick and easy read   A book with a great story line I read this book as a child  in school 12 years ago  and then decided to read it again as an adult  Although  the language is very child appropriate  I find the theme of the novel very complex for a student to grasp  While reading this book  the ideas of  Enlightenment  and  Buddhism  never once crossed my mind  I actually saw more Christian views  than buddhist  But as I read some of the reviews  one mentioned how the book reflected the buddhist idea of enlightenment  and now I see how those ideas could relate  I always thought of Enlightenment as a state when one becomes free  in total bliss  Because Jonas was receiving both happy and sad memories  the word Enlightenment just didn t come to mind  However  I suppose while he was receiving the happy memories  that he was in a state free  in total bliss  therefore Enlightened  And with out the understanding of the degree of painful sad memories  feelings  the happy ones would be less meaningful or maybe not meaningful at all  So you need both  one feeling whether  happy or sad can not exist with out the other  If the feeling did not exist the world would be left  similar to the community that Jonas lived among  boring  ignorant  meaningless  colorless   Enlightenment  became when Gautama Buddha sat under a  bodhi  fig tree  near Benares  After seven years searching for the cause of suffering suddenly   in a flash   he saw the light  In ways this could be similar to Jonas when he begins to see the color red  but still not knowing what red is   There was nothing remarkable about that apple  He had just tossed it back and forth between his hands a few times  he had thrown it again to Asher  And again  in the air  for an instant only  it had changed  When Buddha began to see  he became Enlightened  When Jonas became the Receiver  the old Receiver became the Giver  Jonas  the new Receiver  received memories from the old receiver who gave them to him  Although  Jonas had already began to see the color red  with out the Giver s help  he wouldn t have known what it was or called  Through the exclamation of the memories the Giver was able to teach him  While receiving the memories Jonas became Enlightened  He then carried the wisdom that no one else had  Once he obtained more memories his black and white world became colorful Because Buddhists believe in reincarnation  Enlightenment is also described as a state in which one can view their past lives  When Jonas receives memories from the Giver  he is viewing the past  The way life once was  A world full of color  emotion  peace and war  hot and cold  pain and pleasure  A world full of options and choices   It isn t fair that nothing has color    Not fair   The Giver looked at Jonas curiously   Explain what you mean    Well     Jonas has to stop to think it through   If everything is the same  then there aren t any choices  I want to wake up in the morning and decide things  A blue tunic  or a red one   This statement  reflects the Christian idea of free will  It is the reason why humans beings are more superior than any other being on the Earth  Without the option to choose  human beings become less powerful  and their lives less meaningful  In the novel  The Giver  Lois Lowry creates a community  of SAME  In this community there is no color to choose from  The climate is controlled  meaning there is no cold or hot  no snow or rain  There are family units  They exist with a father  mother  brother  sister  One does not fall in love with another  Love does not exist  One does not choose his her spouse  if one desires a family unit then they will apply for a spouse  The family unit is only allowed two children  one boy and one girl  When the spouses are ready for a child  they apply for one  Women do not get pregnant naturally  There are women that will be assigned the job of birthing mother  They will be given three years to have three babies and then they will be assigned as laborers  The babies are taken from the birthing mothers and put in the Nurturing Center where they are cared for until they are one year old  They are not given names while in the Nurturing Center  but rather called by number  They will be given to a family unit in order of their number when they turn one  and at that ceremony they are granted a name  If the baby is not developing properly in any way  the baby will be released  If one is born a twin  the smaller of the two is released  This community is totally controlled by the elders  They provide food  clothing  everything  They make the rules  The rules are obeyed in order to keep everyone safe from suffering  from pain  The rules protect and shelter  But they also dehumanize  and limit ones potential to grow  emotionally  and mentally Not being able to choose your spouse  Birthing mothers being a job  Babies being separated from their biological mothers  No biological fathers ever mentioned  Babies being called by a number  Babies not adapting or developing on time are released  Identical twins are separated and the weaker of the two is released to avoid the feeling of confusion  All of this seems like an dehumanizing out rage  But in the eyes of the ones who created the community and its rules sees it as the only way    to eliminate pain and suffering  But are they really People of the community do not have individual birthdays  but rather a ceremony for everyone in December organized by their age  This is dehumanizing because it eliminates identity and individuality  For example  all of the children turning 9 receive bikes  All of the children turning 12 receive their assignments or in other words their careers  Once again one does not get to choose what they want to be  but it is chosen for them  And as for those older than 12  there are no ceremonies to celebrate at all  It is interesting that the birthday ceremony celebration takes place in December  In ways this is similar to Christian ideas  for December is the month that Christians celebrate Christmas  the birth of Jesus Christ   It is quite sick that those who run the community  even has control over one s lust and sex drive  When Jonas shares the dream to his parents about desires and attractions he has for Fiona  They call his dreams stirrings and says they are natural and that now he must take a daily pill  They talk about being released several times through out the book  The old get a celebration and then they are released  Babies that don t adapt properly are released  The smaller of the two twins are released  Those that breaks the rules and commit crime  are released  While reading the book I kept wondering what released meant  whether they are released into Elsewhere  or killed  The ceremony of release is always very private  but everything is recorded  The Giver allows Jonas to watch his father release one of the twin babies  That is when the true meaning of released is revealed  as Jonas  father gives the baby a shot in the forehead  The baby crys  but then goes limp and lifeless  Those that run the community  not only have control over life  but also over death  Jonas felt sick when he discovered what being released truly meant  Did his father realize that he was a murder of innocent babies  Or was he ignorant to the fact and just following the rules of the community  In a way  Jonas  father seems brainwashed  as he does exactly what he is told  Brainwashed  powerless  Rosemary  although hardly mentioned through out the book and never mentioned in the community  is one of the most important characters  She was assigned the position of New Receiver ten years before  but failed  If one does not like the life in the community  then one can ask to be released  Rosemary couldn t bare the pain of the memories  so she asked to be released  Did she know the truth behind being released  She asked to give herself the shot  and they allowed her too  Was she committing suicide  Or was she unaware  ignorant to what the shot was Because released meant murder  Jonas knew things for the community HAD to change  The Giver had wanted change for a long time now but couldn t complete it on his own  He knew that once Rosemary had been released her memories had been released from her into the community  Jonas would have to leave the community in order for the community to obtain the memories the Giver had given him  Together the Giver and Jonas came up with an escape plan  Jonas would leave the community and the Giver would stay  Baby Gabriel is a very significant character in the book  He was a baby that was not developing well in the Nurturing Center  so Jonas  father was allowed to take him home with him for the remaining year to keep a close watch on him  Gabriel continues to have sleepless nights except when he sleeps in Jonas  room  One night when Gabriel was restless Jonas placed his hand on the baby s back and gave him a peaceful memory to sooth him  Jonas discovers a new power he has  the power of passing memories on to others  But can he pass memories on to everyone or is Gabriel and exception  I find it interesting that all the people that are capable of being Receivers have pale eyes  It is pale eyes to the community who can only see black and white  but it is most likely blue eyes to those who see in color  Something that  Gabriel  Jonas  The Giver  and Rosemary all shared Jonas wanted so badly for the Giver to come with him  But the Giver refused  He cared about the community and knew that they would need him once Jonas left  But at dinner that night  Jonas  father reveals that everyone voted on Gabriel s release  This sickens Jonas and he decides that he will not escape alone  but take Gabriel with him  Because his ultimate goal is to save Gabriel  he no longer cares about himself  The escape is hard  but he is able to transfer memories to Gabriel to keep him warm when things get cold or cold when the search planes are above  While in the woods he sees birds for the first time  and wild flowers  He begins to loose some of the memories that the Giver had given him and he begins to create his own  The Giver s first memory that he transfers to Jonas is one when he is in total joy on a sled  The story ends  the way it began  Jonas with Gabriel on a sled heading to their destination  Elsewhere  As Jonas  and Gabriel approach Elsewhere  he remembers the Giver s favorite memories about Christmas  about love  He hears their songs  he sees their lights  And there in Elsewhere are people celebrating Christmas      were waiting for him  and they were waiting  too  for the baby   In ways this again can represent the Christian idea of the birth of Jesus Christ  In ways baby  Gabriel can symbolize Jesus  the son of God  Jonas in ways can symbolize Jesus as well  Jesus came on to the earth to save human beings from sin  and open the gates to heaven  Jonas came on to the earth to save his people from sin and to open their eyes to a new way of life  possibly a heaven on earth  The elders that created the community   SAME   desired a place safe and shelter  perfect  But it was more ironically it was not perfect at all but did more harm then good  As for Buddhist views  Enlightenment comes essentially one step before nirvana  Jonas was awakened while everyone else in his community was not  Now at the end  he has finally escaped from all pain and suffering that the community had brought him  He is now free  The Giver told Jonas that he did not see beyond but rather heard beyond  He was able to hear music and wanted to give some of that music to Jonas  but Jonas refused and wanted him to keep that joy for himself  At the end  Jonas hears song for the first time  It was such joy to his ears  It completed him  The story ends with   Behind him  across vast distance of space and time  from the place he left  he thought he heard music too  But perhaps it was only an echo   He saved himself  and Gabriel  but it is possible that he saved the people of his community as well     view spoiler  a dystopia with a 12 years old  child  as the protagonist takes place in the future in aperfect society governed by strict laws and when people gained the ability of controlling every thing and most importantly the memories in this  community  all people are similar in one way or another no feelings no differences and most important no choices every one has a specific role chosen for him by the elders after close observation since birth till the age of 12 when you are given your task at a special ceremony  Jonas will turn 12 in 2 months and he has experienced some odd events already at the ceremony he ll be honored by the role of the recipient who will carry all the burden of ancestors  memories and will be trained by the current giver to carry on his role and during this journey he will discover all the hidden truth and the ugly face of this alleged utopia  Jonas and the giver after a year of training and many wondering questions  will come up with the plan to help the people develop and retain their own memories but a misfortunate event will ruin the plan  hide spoiler  a simple story with a deep concept even though lowry left some matters unsettled about that community and no background of it or what events led to this the ending was foggy and you can think of it as you like I d like to think of Jonas as the true giver as he set the community free and gave them the choice again he also managed to save gabe which symbolize the future and for me this is the ending that i prefera movie adaptation of the novel will be in theaters this year starring Jeff Bridges and Meryl Streep i hope it wouldn t suck as usual and it would carry the core concept of the novel  The Giver was written by Lois Lowry and was published in 1993  The book won the Newberry medal  This book is about a boy named Jonas who lives in a perfect society  In his society there is no danger and no one is different  The people of the society have never experience pain or love but later on Jonas will know what it is when he finds out he would be next receiver  I really loved the book and I recommend this book to whoever loves a thriller and a mystery book  My favorite part was when Jonas takes Gabriel with him so he would not get released  You guys should see the movie even though its very different   I absolutely love this book  Lois has a perfect style of writing  Not too old fashioned or complicated  but not boring and simple  It is a book for all ages that I suggest you read it if you haven t all ready  The way that he put the plot together just made so much sense  I loved it because of the way that Jonas was different from everyone and he didn t even know it yet  Jonas was the perfect receiver of memories though he had no clue if he was good at it or not  Although a book where there s a perfect world isn t my favorite kind of book  it is still perfect to do a review on  I can t wait to read some of the other great books by Lois  I hope you liked my review  Thank you for your time  Movies are made all the time based off of young adult novels   and they always seem like the same thing  There was one book  however  that was never made into a movie  and may just be the only young adult book I ever wanted to be adapted for the big screen  and that was The Giver  I remember several years ago when Jeff Bridges was interested in the film being made  but for some reason or another  it never was  Well  it was made into a film this year  and to prepare myself for the film  I decided to re read the thing and see if the book itself still held up to all of the hype I myself gave it as a kid  The short answer to that   is yes We are introduced to young Jonas  who is just about to turn twelve years old  which basically means he is about to be chosen for an occupation that he ll keep for the rest of his life   but the role chosen for him was unlike the others   he was given  Receiver of Memory    one of the most respected roles in the community  His sessions with an old man named The Giver were quite a spectacle  as the Giver had the incredible ability to transfer memories of the world as it used to be   a distant world full of colors  animals  family  and love   a world where people could decide for themselves  Through their sessions  they decide that what s going on in the community now wasn t right  and they had to change that This is one of my all time favorite young adult books  It s not because it s an easy read  or that it s short  it s because it s written so well   and covers a very unique concept that is both captivating and centers on more adult themed topics than you would originally think  It is short  but the interesting thing is   in my opinion  it s written better than Divergent  It keeps the standard pacing and strives away from just summarizing things  In fact  one of the strongest attributes to the writing is the attention to detail Lois Lowry apparently has this incredible ability to describe feelings and altered perception really well  How in the world do you write a book and define a world that s black and white  I don t know  but she did it  How do you define going from your world into the memory world the Giver gives  I don t know  but she did it fantastically  It wasn t just   boom   he has the memory  it s a gradual process from one perception to the next   and every little thing that manipulates in his senses in order to get there  For such a short book  you wouldn t think the details would be there  but they are  The details and the pacing are perfect  It does feel short because it ll only take you a day or two to read  but it s worth the read ten fold Those are all basically technical perfections  but the concept itself is also unique and original  The trailer to the movie doesn t give the story  nor book any justice  I haven t yet seen the movie  so I haven t seen their interpretation  but the book itself is a story that absolutely bogged my mind as to how it was never a movie   and why it took nearly 20 years to get there  I guess the same applies to Ender s Game  which came out as a novel in 1985   yeah  This is why I have faith in Hollywood   because not every movie is based off of a newer book   they do dig in the past to see the forgotten  but phenomenal and worthwhile stories  How could I give this book anything but 5 stars  Truly compelling  This story has so many messages about the dangers of conformity  sameness and building a culture that suppresses individuality  It is a voice for freedom  It mirror so much that is wrong with our own society  and how people ignore their rights and freedoms as they are slowly stripped away  until they no longer remember what it was like before when they had them  This should be a required reading for any child in school  and any adult who has never read it  Brilliant  I loved the book  I liked how it ended with Jonas leaving the community and taking Gabriel with him  But they left with the help from the Giver  He left the community and after so long alone dying of hunger and cold he found a home with a family and everything in the normal world  The Giver is a very fascinating book about the struggles of an organized society  As Jonas  the main character   lives in a society of order and without misconduct  the leaders of the society  known as the  Elders   hide from the community the wrong doings they conduct to keep the society in order  On his twelfth birthday  Jonas is mandatorily chosen to become the new Receiver  which means he has to bear all of the memories from before conduct  provided to him by The Giver  of spring  rain  snow  and worst of all  war  And Jonas slowly learns the dark secrets about his society  I believe The Giver was a very esteemed book  that had me reading until the very end  I came to the game pretty late on this book  so I don t figure too extensive of a review is required  I wavered between four and five stars for several days  I wish I could rate a book 4 5 stars  but since I can t  I figured I would round up to five  I think Lowry had a brilliant idea for this story and did a wonderful job of putting it on paper in a concise  understandable way  There were a couple of times in the story where her writing gave me chills  made me gasp  or ALMOST  only almost  get off my case  brought tears to my eyes  I ve read enough fiction that physical reactions like that aren t evoked by just any tale  so I definitely tip my hat to this book  The only thing that kept me on the fence and made me hesitant to rate it as  amazing  was the length  I know this is a children s book  I understand that  I just wish it wasn t  I wish Lowry would ve tripled the number of pages in this book  I want to know much more about all of the characters  about the community in which they live  about the history of how their community came to be as it is  and about the world surrounding their community  Again  I understand why all of this was left out  and I compliment Lois Lowry on doing as wonderful of a job as possible in telling her story in such a concise format  Most of you have probably already read The Giver  but for those who haven t  pick it up sometime  Very quick read  very worth the minimal investment of time   The giver was an amazing novel which has a different way of life than we live  A world where everything a chosen for you can be a relief but  also can cause many issues in which way they live  I have learned from this novel that be grateful that we have the power to speak our mind and to choose because one day we might not have that oppertunity    It s the choosing that s important  isn t it   Originally going to be 3 stars but then kicked into over drive into 4 5 stars Imagine living in a world that is completely perfect  everything s controlled  even colour is gone  this is Jonas  world  I ve always heard many things about this book but never got the chance to read it myself  It wasn t until the movie is coming out that I found a copy it somewhere in my house  which surprises me considering i never knew we had one lmao   My brother instantly nagged me to read it  stating it was one of the few books he read and loved  and I can see exactly why that is  Despite it s slow and somewhat confusing start  you get eased into Jonas  world relatively quickly  especially when he s announced to become the Receiver  Now being a Receiver in this community is the highest honour possible  This is where our story truly begins   Before I knew it  I was hooked and sucked into this colourless and emotionless world that is Lois Lowry s The Giver  At first I was concerned because it was interesting but felt a bit flat to me  but that s exactly the kind of world these people live in that Lowry illustrates  Now I have another Dystopian novel to add to my very small list of good Dystopian  and let me tell you  I ve read LOADS of them Now the most intriguing and favourite aspect of this book are the memories  This is truly something different from what I ve expected  I m just glad I held out   The worst part of holding the memories is not the pain  It s the loneliness of it  Memories need to be shared    I have no idea how I have a high school and undergraduate degree without having read this book  It s one that you always hear about  and it s always described as a Good Book  you can even hear the capital letters in the person s voice   Most people claim to have read it during school  If I was ever assigned it  I must not have read it because I don t remember it  It has recently become popular again because they are making a movie out of the novel  or they already have  I guess I m not really up on things  The story is beautiful  captivating  and one of those sorts of tales that you read in a day or two because every fiber of your being wants to return to the story to find out what happens next  I found that I had so many questions about the world that Lowry had created  and I could not wait to return to finally get some answers  When I finished the book  I wanted more because I still had unanswered questions  Luckily for me  this series is a quartet  And I can t wait to explore a little bit more  I re read The Giver by Lois Lowry for the umpteenth time  just because  The Giver is one of the first books that had a remarkable impact on me as a child  I remember reading it in the fifth grade and becoming so absorbed in the transformation of Jonas from a naive 12 year old boy into a hardened  self aware teen determined to find his own path  The whole concept of a dystopia was new to me and I fell in love  A world without color  A world where every child was treated exactly the same  Every person was assigned a career without any choice in the matter  One person held all the memories and feelings of an entire community  I had never read a book like it I also felt a certain affinity for Jonas that I d never felt for a fictional character before  I ve always been a hoarder of emotion  both my own and that of people around me  Even as a child  I often felt overburdened by unexplainable feelings and it seemed like nobody ever understood  Meeting Jonas was the first time I felt like I wasn t alone  Even today  re reading it for the millionth time  I still find comfort in Jonas  quest Now as I read the book from the perspective of an aspiring children s author  it s become clear what all my favorite children s books have in common  Stellar Writing  The books that have stayed with me may have been written for children  but they were never written in a childish voice  They give credit to the reader and am I am still awed at Lowry s use of language and story telling techniques Sometimes I think our standards have lowered since I was young  The Young Adult market has become so flooded with poorly written  condescending crap  But then again  my parents would probably have said the same thing about my generation  and their parents before them In any case  The Giver did not disappoint  It is  and will always remain  one of my favorite books of all time  I had to read this book for English class last year  but we never got to read it completely  Anyways  when I read half of the book last year I didn t quite like it  but I kept on seeing VERY positive reviews here and there  so last night  I continued where we stopped  It was a very exciting and interesting point of the story where I continued BRIEF SUMMARY Basically  in The Giver we view a futuristic view of our everyday world where everything is controlled  When everyone is equal  where there s no rich  poor  or middle class person  It is set in a world where a person should not feel negative or uptight  It s always about being satisfied and neutral What s interesting about this story is that every age group of boys and girls is assigned for a job  There are different types of jobs  Our protagonist is Jonas  and he is selected to be a Receiver I won t tell you anymore about the plot in this book since I don t want to spoil This book is generally for kids  but the message in this books is very much aimed to adults The book is beautifully written and I recommend it to everyone  It s an amazing read   I am in awe of this book  This is my first dystopian novel that I have ever read and let me say that it did NOT disappoint  It was so amazing being able to see a world so different from out own  where  free choices  and  feelings  are not welcomed into the society  Only  order   This book makes you realize that what we have is truly a blessing and reading this book about not being able to do what you want really opens your eyes to a whole new world of possibilities The world that Lowry has created is a unique one  She did such a fantastic job in describing the  rules  and the  order  that was set in place a long time ago in this dystopian world  I love her writing style  It is very simple yet flows so smoothly and she has this gift of knowing her words which makes things in her story more vivid to the reader  I know I had an easy time getting the clear images in my head thanks to her writing The characters were the big thing here  The are very much the same which is the point to the whole book  To get the feeling of the  Sameness   There really wasn t any depth to them except for Jonas and The Giver  Since they were the only ones who knew of the memories of the past  they were the only ones who knew of actual  feelings  not allowed to be known to the others in this  community   As the story progresses and he starts to learn more about love  anguish  sorrow  hunger  and the like  he starts to grow more as a character and he starts to question things in this world where quesitions are prohibited  The Giver is another character you love right from the beginning  Because of the fact that he knows a lot  he is able to comprehend things other characters in this book are not  You feel a sort of connection to him because he knows what we know and you want to help him help others realize what they are missing out on  Like colors I must congratulate Lowry on a fantastic job done with this book  It s fairly old in its time but I know it is going to go on for all of time as one of the best dysotpian novels ever written  I really love this book and I am so glad that I decided to finally listen to my friend and pick it up  It makes you really want to appreciate all the liberties we have  There s no way we would EVER want to live in a world where we have no say in the matter  I love this book and  though it s a sort read  I feel it will take an entire lifetime to get over the message of it  I highly recommend this book  The Giver  By Lois Lowry  The Giver  in my opinion was a spectacular book to read  I couldn t put it down  I enjoyed reading this book because  Lois Lowry has a certain way of making you feel like you are you are living the story  that it is your life  I loved how  The Giver  grasped my attention and made me feel every emotion that the characters were feeling  The setting of the book is a futuristic society where everything is a certain way and you follow certain rules  It is a flat land  vacant of hills  with no rain  snow  heat  or cold  It is a temperate temperature constantly  In this community everything is regulated so that nothing new or unexpected ever happens  It is a place of rules and restrictions  A place of no lies and no secrets  In this community you do not get to pick your job  spouse  or even bear your own children  Instead  everything is assigned to you  In this place no one knows true pain or suffering  or even true happiness and bliss  There is not even color  The main character in this book is Jonas  Jonas is very intelligent  courageous and has integrity  When Jonas was a twelve he was selected to be the new receiver instead of assigned a normal job  The receiver holds all the memories of the past where everything was filled with happiness  pain  suffering and much more  Jonas  cannot tell or show anyone any of these memories  not even those he cares about  Jonas  is the only one who knows the truth besides the Giver The other main character of this book would be the Giver  the Giver is the person who held all of the memories before Jonas  He is Jonas  mentor  He is the person to transmit the memories to Jonas  He is the one there for Jonas as he becomes the next receiver of memory  He is filled with much wisdom and knowledge  The Giver is an essential character in this book The main conflict in this book is simply how they are living and how Jonas believes that everyone should know and have all the memories  He believes that everyone should know the truth about everything  The problem with wanting everyone to remember is that none of these people have ever known pain and suffering  so for them to receive all of the good memories and the bad memories all at once would throw their entire community in chaos  Another conflict in this book is how people are released  They literally are released of life and Jonas think that it is not fair for people to be released  especially the babies that are released   Basically in summary is that the main conflict in the story is that people do not know the truth Without a thought I would definitely recommend this book to other people  The appropriate age to read this would be starting at i believe middle school age through around high school age  Although  I also think that adults would enjoy reading this book as well  I would recommend this book to the middle to high school age group because the story line definitely will grab their attention  Also this book is appropriate so you don t have to worry about reading anything gross  I also would recommend this book to this age group because  the use of vocabulary is not incredibly challenging but instead has a vast use of vocabulary that middle schooler  high schoolers would understand In conclusion I think that  The Giver  was a phenomenal book and I definitely would rate this book at five  This book has definitely earned all the awards it s received  Brilliant work Lois Lowry  I definitely plan on reading your other books   The Giver  written by Lois Lowry depicts a futuristic city which appears to be a utopia  but is actually a dystopia  We follow a boy who is assigned his job at the age of 12  This boy is soon revealed to be different than the other kids  and is given a special job known as  The receiver of memories   This job of his leaves him in a unique situation where he ultimately decided to take matters into his own hands  Jonas  the boy  decides to leave his civilization  along with a young baby  to release the torturous memories because he did not agree with the systems in place  I liked the book because the world looked nice and orderly  than realized later that the people were limited from their choices  I think the people made the right choice to leave his city because the way the people were being controlled  seeing in black in white  no music  not being able to choose their jobs  etc would make it hard to live there  Both my mother and sister have read this book  and they both thought that Jonas and the baby froze to death  while I had not  I heard from my sister that there are new 3 more books which I look forward to reading  and to know whether I  or my mom and sister were correct  A very interesting tale that gets your mind working not only within the story line of the book but how it relates to the life you live everyday  The characters are given a very set structured lifestyle and can only abide by the rules given and they know no other way  This is until the main character is introduced to a whole new perspective  He is given an opportunity to discover new mysteries and be taught new things from an elder known as  The Giver   The book is paperback and a reasonable size  It will spark intrigue and make it very difficult to put down until you learn more  Ce roman se penche sur la destinee singuliere de Jonas  un jeune garcon de 12 ans  qui vit dans une communaute ou tout est    parfait      danger  douleur  faim  malheur  pauvrete  divorce  guerres  chomage   n existent plus  Mais en contrepartie l environnement est aseptise  sans relief  sans debordement et tout est maitrise et savamment orchestre de la naissance a    l elargissement     Un monde ou l individualite n existe pas et ou prime l identique Tous les ans jusqu a leur 12 ans  les enfants participent a une ceremonie  qui va definir leur comportement pour l annee a venir  par exemple a neuf ans  chaque enfant a enfin le droit a un velo   A douze ans  ils se voient attribuer le metier qui leur correspond le plus  Mais pour Jonas il n y aura pas d attribution   un destin exceptionnel l attend  Il a ete choisi pour etre le prochain depositaire  le gardien de la memoire des generations precedentes  A partir de ce moment Jonas va poser un nouveau regard sur ce qui l entoure et commencer une remise en question de la societe dans laquelle il vit A la frontiere entre la science fiction et la fable philosophique  c est un roman initiatique avec un message puissant qui n a rien a voir avec les dystopies plus recente qui sont clairement faites pour divertir  La plume de Lois Lowry est fluide et simple  les mots choisis sont les bons  tout s imbrique parfaitement  Le message passe  L auteur nous amene a prendre conscience des imperfections d un monde parfait avec une monte en puissance au fur et a mesure de l avancement de l histoire  Les emotions s intensifient  tout comme celles de Jonas jusqu a cette fin quelque peu abrupte mais qui nous laisse finalement de l espoir et qui nous permet de continuer la reflexion Un veritable coup de coeur  qui doit etre lu par tout le monde  jeune ou moins jeune  I ve read this book in exactly a day  I couldn t put the book down  it was so intriguing and infatuating  The way Jonas differs from all the other members of the community the courage  the bravery that Jonas possessed is extremely motivating I wasn t the person to personally like the idea of Literature  but after this book  I ve realized that Literature is not as bad as it sounds  It s beautiful  The way words are used in Classics hold meaning behind  they make you feel slightly different The Giver is a very good book  In fact  its one of my favorites  There is a movie for this book  but i do not suggest it  I felt it was rushed  and un detailed  Though  the actor that plays the role of Jonas is extremely hot and breathtaking     The Giver is not a sappy romance novel  its a story about reality  I recommend this book  because not only is it intriguing  it s amazing  Reread this for the class im teaching  Loved it this time around as well  however  having read the Hunger Games series and then The Giver back to back  I find myself rather aware of the fact that the dominant race in these societies is  well  white  And the whole  pale eyes  special thing in the Given has always rubbed me the wrong way  consider readers of color and consider how often this trope of  pale eyes  or  blue eyes   special is used in YA literature  and the problem is obvious    At least that s how it came across to me  I need to marinate on this  My issue is not with the books themselves  it s with the collective and lack of diversity within the collective  In other words  the usual problem   I recommend The Giver to everyone because it is a great book  It is an  old timed  book with a modern twist  There is this boy named Jonas and he is about to turn twelve  And these days they have a ceremony for the twelves  In the ceremony these groups of people get to decide the jobs of these children  Jonas becomes the giver  The giver holds the memories of the true pain and pleasure of life  There is no turning back now  I really like that the author put a little twist in the end  The author should have made it a little more itneresting in the end  IN the end  Jonas is put to something he is not sure he can handle  In the beginning Jonas gets the memory of winter snow  He is forced to lie and lying is very bad for the community    You ll have to read the book to get more details  In a perfect society governed by order  free from pain and suffering  lives a twelve year old boy named Jonas  Everyone has a role in the community  and once children reach a certain age they are assigned a specific role  Jonas is specially selected to be a Reciever of memories given to him by The Giver  They are memories of the pleasures and pains of the past once forgotten  Most importantly  Jonas learns the truths about his own community in the here and now  which will change him forever It s a very short  and simply put novella  but a powerful one  I first read this book when I was in junior high for required reading  I was the exact same age as Jonas at the time  I only had vague memories about the story  just that I enjoyed it  I guess a Receiver got to me Still this book left me with some unanswered questions  for example   view spoiler  Who was the first Giver  What is the source of their power  and how are they able to do what they do   hide spoiler   and  view spoiler  Why do the memories return to the community when Jonas leaves   hide spoiler   I didn t really need those questions to be answered to enjoy the book  but perhaps they can be played off in a magical realism sort of way  On the other hand  I only recently learned that The Giver is part of a series quartet  so I guess I ll have to pick those up The Giver was a cool book in the Dystopian genre way before it became the popular YA subgenre it is now  and dare I say it represents what a true Dystopia is  I remember reading this book in the sixth grade  we then had to do a project on it afterwards  This book was an amazing book  definitely an eye opener  When I first read through this book I found it very depressing and made me almost want to never read another utopia or even a dystopia again  But once reading it again when I was older I realized this story is about the fight for life and a boys  journey to protect that life  This is an amazing book if you d like to take a peek into the  What ifs    of a  perfect  world  this book is very sincere and this book makes me relize that our lives aren t as hard as we think it is when you read a book like this   Questo libro e stato una dolce sopresa  Premetto che di solito amo libri con molta azione e con molto romanticismo  quindi lo trovo un po  diverso dalle mie solite letture  The Giver e un libro molto facile da leggere ma stranamente ci ho messo piu di due giorni per finirlo  forse perche volevo assaporare per bene ogni singola pagina di questo meraviglioso capolavoro  Racconta di un mondo distopico dove seguiamo le avventure di Jonas  il protagonista  un ragazzo scelto per essere il nuovo Accoglitore di memorie  Praticamente tutto e gestito in un ordine rigido e controllato  e le persone non hanno sentimenti  il governo decide per loro la famiglia  il lavoro  lo stile di vita    in parole povere i cittadini non hanno scelta  sono burattini e poiche non hanno sentimenti non se ne accorgono nemmeno  Jonas ha avuto l onore di essere Accoglitore  che accoglie tutte le memorie dell umanita  la guerra  fame  odio ma anche amore  felicita  la neve   Cosi inizia la trasformazione del ragazzo che inizia a capire com e il vero mondo  con i sentimenti e i colori La lettura mi ha veramente incantata  lasciandomi dopo ogni capitolo emozionata e curiosa  e mi godevo a mangiarmi le parole dell autrice  dallo stile fresco e semplice  Questo libro fa pensare e non riesco a crederci che in passato l hanno vietato nelle scuole  Se odi puoi amare  se hai paura puoi avere coraggio  se sei diverso puoi apprezzarne le diversita o il contrario  Quindi se c e uno c e il suo contrario  Ma la domanda e  siamo pronti a sacrificare tutto questo per una comunita pacifica  Ne vale davvero la pena  Mi ha fatto partire molti punti di riflessione e consiglio tutti questo libro perche e veramente bellissimo  Leggero sicuramente i seguiti     I remember reading this book a couple years ago and not liking the ending  Reread it again and absolutely loved it   a fast read and makes you think how our world  could  be   This is a very thought provoking story of a young man who is given his assignment in life to be the bearer of the world s memories both painful and joyful  Basically it s a world of people who live without war  hate  and pain  Though at the same time they also live without joy  pleasure and love  This tells the story of Jonas who is given a gift  The gift of truth that the rest of his world as he has come to know it has chosen to forget  I read the last chapter twice  Not because I didn t get it but because it was just so profound  This book is labeled for young adults and children but honestly it can appeal to all ages  It s thought provoking and beautifully dark  Plus it s a very short read  While it is 23 chapters long they are very small  I finished it in a day   This book was one of my favorite reads of all time  I begged my teacher to teach this book  This book changed my reading experience  First of all  the book is about a Utopian society and about one boy who wishes to change it  The book is kind of slow at the beginning  not explaining anything to the reader  But this is natural to a book of this genre  The book gets intense at the ending because  view spoiler   We have no idea of what happens to to Jonas and Gabe after they go off the edge   hide spoiler   I recommend this book to readers who like Utopian Dystopian books and like mysterious Sci Fi books  Over all rating   Epic   I need the next book now   3 Lowry  L

Jonas receives the assignment of Receiver of Memory  which is the highest honor in his society  While Jonas s society is one of sameness  where no one feels or even remembers emotions  the Receiver of Memory is allowed to remember the past and feel emotions in case the society ever needs those memories  As Jonas receives the memories from The Giver  he learns that life in a utopian society that has no pain  fear  hunger  war  or hatred is not what is appears to be  In the end  Jonas must decide between continuing his life of  sameness  or escaping and releasing all the memories back to Community Content ConnectionThis book can be used in language arts classrooms and can be paired with more challenging classics like Brave New World  The Novel  The Giver by Lois Lowry is a fiction Dystopian novel about a boy named Jonas  It is set in a dystopian society where Jonas lives with his  assigned  family  The novel goes on to tell about Jonas s special job assignment that he receives for his 12th birthday  His assignment is to receive all the memories from The Giver  this job is the most important job in the community  These memories are the memories of the way the world used to before there was  sameness   In the society that Jonas resides  there is absolute order  There are set jobs for everything and everyone  climate control  no color  assigned children  families  spouses

order to be placed in a home  Jonas soon discovers that the child  Gabriel  has the ability to receive memories  Soon after Jonas finds out the disturbing fate that Gabriel is inevitably condemned to and he plans to change it  This book keeps you on the edge and I recommend it if you enjoy Dystopian genre books  It has romance  adventure  and excitement  The book is a short read  but extremely interesting and detailed making it a very enjoyable book with an amazing story line   Jonas is almost twelve  The elders are watching him and other elevens very closely and taking notes  Jonas knows

his community  Jonas wants to go and live in ELSEWHERE  Will he find ELSEWHERE  Will he survive  http   isha borade blogspot com 2014     At first  I would have rated this book 4 0 on its own  But then I did something I rarely do  I read the bonus material at the end of the book  I read Lowry s excerpt from the 2012 Book Expo American Speech and I read the author Q A  After getting a brief but deeper understanding of her characters and the whys behind plot I ended up closing the book just saying   Wow   Now don t get me wrong  I fell in love with Jonas and I felt for The Giver  primarily during his story of Rosemary  before I read the extras  And the message of the book moved me before I reached the last page  But something about Lowry s explanation and feeling of love for her characters put it all together for me  I look forward to continuing the quartet  Imagine a world where you have no decisions to make  From the moment you re born until your last breath  someone else decides for you  What you wear  what you eat  what your profession will be  who your life partner will be or whether or not you re allowed to have one  or children  which aren t biologically yours as all children are produced by the women whose job it is to create them  All emotions must be examined and discussed so they can be smoothed out of existence  The people s lives have become so flat that they don t even see colors anymore In this world  everyone has enough and being the same is the rule of the day  Everyone has the same hair cut  wears the same clothes  When you reach the age of twelve your occupation is chosen for you  Everyone is peaceful and contented  no one coveting anything that they don t have  Strong emotions are gone Sound like Utopia  Not so fast At the age of twelve  children are given their occupations and Jonas is to become the Receiver  the repository of all memories  While working with the Giver  the old man who is slowing turning the memories over to Jonas  he begins to see the reality of his world and it isn t pretty Without giving spoilers  I can t say much more  but this is a terrific story  one that makes you think  I m not sure why it s been considered controversial or why some places tried to ban it   http   vanillamoonbooks blogspot ro 2   In Darul lui Jonas  Lois Lowry ne prezinta o lume utopica  unde fiecare individ are parte de cel mai bun start in viata  alaturi de o unitate familiala si un acoperis deasupra capului  o lume in care nu mai exista durere  boli  foame  razboi  violuri sau alte forme de violenta  unde batranii sunt bine ingrijiti  iar cand un individ ajunge Doispear  acesti Varstnici intelepti care au urmarit evolutia lui si a celorlalti copii  il distribuie pe fiecare in meseria sau profesia in care stiu deja ca i se potriveste cel mai bine  Oare cati dintre voi cei care cititi acum va doriti deja ca o astfel de lume sa existe Dar daca v as spune ca aceasta lume e una lipsita de culoare  sentimente si viata in adevaratul sens al cuvantului  ca oamenii trebuie sa urmeze un set de reguli stricte  iar daca refuza sau nu reusesc sa se integreze in societate sunt pusi pe liber Suntem martorii acestei lumi aparent utopice  in realitate distopice creata de Lois Lowry prin ochii lui Jonas  un Unspear care se pregateste de momentul in care isi va afla destinul in aceasta comunitate  Pe masura ce trec zilele si clipa mult asteptata e din ce in ce mai aproape  aflam detalii despre ce inseamna viata acolo  Fiecare descoperire face deliciul acestei carti  vor fi deopotriva atat elemente pe care ni le am dori in lumea noastra  cat mai ales diferente de care sa ne bucuram ca exista  Treptat  se vor naste intrebari referitor la cum poate functiona o astfel de societate sau pur si simplu curiozitati  iar raspunsurile vin pe parcurs  parca de fiecare data la momentul si in modul perfect Pe Jonas nu am putut sa nu il indragesc si sa traiesc alaturi de el fiecare sentiment  fiecare    dar nu pot sa va spun ce anume  pentru ca v as strica bucuria descoperirii Daca la inceputul cartii poate ni se pare ca lumea din Darul lui Jonas este una ideala  la final ajungem sa o detestam din tot sufletul  Mie  uneia  mi se rupea inima la gandul ca s ar putea ajunge vreodata intr un asemenea punct in realitate  Lasand la o parte anumite aspecte care mi se par improbabile din punct de vedere al tehnologiei  au mai existat tentative de a fi toti egali  toti angajati  toti sa avem mancare  haine si locuinta distribuite  toti controlati si urmariti sa respectam regulile  Va amintiti macar din manualele de istorie sau din povestile parintilor si bunicilor despre comunism Finalul este incert  interpretabil  iar daca unii l au perceput ca pe un sfarsit fericit al povestii  desi pot sa vad perspectiva aceasta si sa o accept drept posibila  atunci cand am citit ultimul capitol  eu am vazut cu totul altceva Ce mi a placut iarasi foarte mult  a fost interviul autoarei de la final  unde am aflat franturi din evenimentele care au stat la baza ideii cartii  mai ales faptul ca am aflat identitatea barbatului de pe coperta primei editii a cartii in SUA  un pictor pe nume Carl Nelson pe care autoarea l a cunoscut personal si despre care a aflat mai tarziu ca a orbit Cartea aceasta a fost  este si va fi in continuare discutata  regasindu se pe lista lecturilor scolare in America pe buna dreptate  Cred ca ar trebui citita de fiecare om  fie el copil  adolescent  adult sau batran  I really enjoyed this book  The utopian dystopian society was unique in the way it appeared  with the concept of sameness  It s crazy to imagine a world without the things we take for granted  like colors  deep feelings  snow and hills  And free choice  probably the most important of all  I can t imagine having someone choose my spouse for me  Blah  This book made me realize how fortunate we are as a society to be able to experience all of the wonderful things in our world  most importantly  free choice and love  Jonas is such an insightful young boy   it was good to see that in a young person who was the protagonist  Jonas grows emotionally and spiritually throughout this book  and it is enlightening to see that transformation take place  My friend at work was a former teacher and mentioned that this book is frequently taught in high school English classes  and that the kids all seemed to really like this book  I can see how this book would be a good one to teach because of the many questions it raises about our current society and other cultures in other countries  I also understand why the kids like the book so much because I enjoyed it myself  It presented a very different view of the world and how things would be if we didn t have free choice and some of the wonderful aspects of variety that exist today  Oh  man  The Giver was my favorite book that I was forced to read in school  I definitely was very happy that I had to because I m not sure I would ve otherwise  It s one of the best books I ve ever read and I m dying to see the movie To think only one person holds the knowledge of an entire history of people is insane to me  I don t know how I would feel seeing colors for the first time  It would definitely be a shock to the senses  Seeing every thing in grays would be pretty strange I just love how the book makes you think about how society could be if it were socialist  It makes you think  sure  it sounds like a good idea but nothing is perfect  Everything can be flawed I think my favorite part was when Jonas takes his foster brother  who was only his foster brother because of his father s line of work  and escapes his community  I don t blame him  They were going to do something horrible to his foster brother This is one of my all time favorite books  You will love this book too  I think THE GIVER was a really good book over all  It had a little action and a little mystery mixed in  I found it really interesting to find kids my own age do such bold things  because this is the age they are given their jobs to do for the rest of their lives  I found Jonas  town routine a little strange  It also was really cool to read about a town with no hills  or color  and for every house to have the same shape on the outside and inside  it makes me think about how much I do have compared to these people  Overall THE GIVER was a really good book and I think the people who enjoy action and mystery will enjoy this book too    Contains Spoilers This book is wonderfully written  I had a difficult time putting down I know Lois Lowry is known for her up for interpretation endings  but I wasn t a fan of  The Giver s  ending  Basically Jonas and Gabe freeze to death on their journey from the synthetic  totalitarian community into nature   elsewhere   The memories that the Giver gives to Jonas are to be released to the entire population when Jonas is gone  Memories cannot be lost  only contained  This release of memories happened 10 years earlier by accident when a female Receiver of History was released aka died and the community had to bare pain  The Giver s plan is to be more thoughtful and helpful with the town s acquisition to memories on this the second go around  What I don t understand is why the town wouldn t just wait for the six year old girl  Only six more years and they could give her all the memories  After all  they waited 10 years with painful memories for Jonas  I know Jonas had many  many more memories  but I don t think that necessarily means that the whole community is going to be any less keen on passing the memories off as soon as possible  I think a better ending would be for Gabe to be released as planned and all the beautiful  happy memories Jonas gave him to spread to the people  The people would be so pleased with all the beauty of memories that they would want to eliminate the Receiver position altogether and hold their own memories  Jonas would not have to freeze to death  and the ending would feel more complete   It was a great book and had a good storyline and good characters but it was kinda complicated for me  There are many themes included in the series of The Giver  science fiction  friendship and rebellion  The book takes place in a future world with a different look at life and a different culture  thus the book is science fiction  The Giver and Jonas develop a strong and binding friendship  they share memories  find they have some things in common  and are the only one s who know of society  protecting  the people from  danger   So the theme friendship can fall into the category  Finally The Giver and Jonas decide to start a some what controversial rebellion  Jonas flees his country to find other societies   which causes all his home people to see the bad things of the world  famine  war  etc  Through the theme s  the author tries to convince the audience that  there is terrible suffering in life  there are horrible effects to most actions  but without suffering there comes no beauty  In this story Jonas sees war  hunger  abuse  injury and pain  but he also sees color  love  joy and hope  This story does have many forms of symbolism  I believe that the people of the society represents the fear  They hide from the outside world because they fear of the consequences  Jonas could represent the bravery  and The Giver represents the hope  I truly enjoyed this book and most people would to  Why  Because it reminds people that without the bad things in life  the good wouldn t be that great   I remember being oddly drawn to the cover of this book  staring at the old man for long stretches of time  memorizing his beard  his wrinkles  his eyes  It was the first time I remember looking at a picture of someone and knowing that they were out in the world somewhere  or had been  and at some point in their lives they sat down with a photographer and this picture was taken  This old man was somebody s grandfather  or had been  and he was immortalized on this cover  forever associated with this book  long after death  It was an important moment for me  age 8  and it started it all My third grade teacher read this book aloud to my class the year it was published  Out of all the nominees for the Newbery Medal in 1993  she chose this one to read  and I have been forever grateful I do wish the book had been longer  I didn t want it to end  I wanted to experience more transmitted memories through Jonas  point of view  and I wanted to hear more about what the other community members didn t know  I wanted Jonas to read one of the books that only he and the Giver had access to  I wanted MORE  I felt a little robbed when the book ended  because I love Jonas with all my heart and I wanted to stay with him  I love that Lowry took us inside his head the way she did  because I loved his thoughts  and his realizations  and the destruction of his innocence  I loved every part of the book except for the ending  because I like to know things  I don t like to guess  Some people are of the opinion that Lowry got lazy with the ambiguous ending  but she is a brilliant writer  with brilliant messages and characters  Maybe I will learn more about the ending of The Giver when I have read its two companion books  Gathering Blue and Messenger   This book was AMAZING  I was enthralled from beginning to end and I ve been thinking of it ever since I closed the book  I experienced so much emotion while reading  I can t believe how much the giving of memories touched me  It really makes you think about what is really important  A society without feeling  pain  love  color or basic choice is really not acceptable living  While I m reading  I m thinking how I d love to make this required reading for my 11 year old son  Then I get to the part where Jonas figures out the real meaning of  release   and I begin to get a little disturbed  I LOVED this book  but I felt that maybe the actual explanation could have been left out  I had already come to my own conclusion about what the release probably signified so I didn t really need the ugliness of that brought out  particularly by using an infant as the example  I realize it needed to be included so that Jonas would know what was coming to his poor little friend  but   this was the only part of the book that bothered me enough that I would have to think twice before handing it over to my 11 year old  As I say that  I also realize that it is this gush of feeling that moves you  that which makes a good book truly great  one that you can t forget even if you wanted to  So  negative remarks of the infant episode aside  this is a book that I will always remember and love  It is extremely rare that I would reread a book   it had to have been something I loved in a big way  This book I feel like I want to read again immediately in case I missed even a tidbit of it the first time I SO RECOMMEND this book to   well  anyone  I m not big on sci fi but even I found this book CRAZY GOOD   This is easily one of the most influential books that I have ever read  if not THE most influential  The Giver is a story about a dystopian society where life is structured by the government  and personal choices are few and far between  Within the community  a person called The Receiver is held responsible for every memory that is had by each and every citizen  At the end of The Receiver s life  he or she chooses someone in the community to be the new Receiver  Jonas  the main character in the book  is chosen to be the new Receiver  The old Receiver takes upon him or herself the name of The Giver because he or she is now responsible for transferring  or giving all of the existent memories to the new Receiver  hence The Giver  and hence the receiver  Jonas experiences memories that he s never dreamed of  never dreamed of because strong emotion is suppressed  There is a part in the book that could be seen as horrific to some  but because emotions and feelings were suppressed in the citizens  the people were so desensitized to such a horrible act  Jonas  ability to perceive helped him to rescue someone he loved The reason why this is the most influential book that I ve read is because I was able to see that if you are in the right mindset  you can learn something from anything  no matter how unsavory the topic may be  This book made me think of broadening my perspective and learning about and understanding other people s perspectives  It blew me away how Jonas  eyes began to be opened to new emotions  new feelings  and new possibilities with the ability that he had to feel for other people and the ability he had to empathize with other people  I have always wanted to read this book because of all the talk about it  I really like fantasy  it is very engaging and makes it very interesting to read  you re always on the hook  The fact that this book takes place in a dystopia society takes me out of my comfort zone and into a place that is a lot different than I am use to  I really like how we got into the life of Jonas and get to see how this society is structured  I think that this type of story line would keep the students engaged and thinking through out the whole story  There are so many topics to discuss that are so much different than normal  I think this book would make a great read aloud and discussion book I couldn t imagine the world if there was no color  no feelings  and love did not exist  In this world you have no choices and no one has their own individual life  I don t know if I would like living in a place where my job  the number of kids and their names are chosen for me  I am so happy that we live in a world that we do and are able to do whatever we want to make our selves happy  This book really makes you appreciate the world we live in and all the choices we get to make with our lives  I really enjoyed Jonas and the givers relationship in this book I think that is a reason I liked this book so much  Jonas has the unbelievable task of taking over as The Giver  who holds all the secrets  feelings  love  and violence for the entire town  Jonas  unlike every other person in the society doesn t want or understand why they decide everything for them  He has a mind of his own and I think that is why you connect with him so much  I loved this book  It takes me to a place I couldn t get with a lot of books  It also makes me think and ask questions  The end of the book is so open ended and lets you decide how you would like the book to end  I would recommend this book to everyone  it was amazing and I really enjoyed it  The Giver is a fictional story that takes place in the future  Jonas only knows sameness and is blocked out from violence and love  It all begins when the main character  Jonas  attends the ceremony of twelve  When he is assigned as the Receiver of Memory for the community everything changes  After Jonas becomes the Receiver of Memory he realizes that there is love  war  and real family  Now Jonas is determined to change things for his community  My favorite part of the book is when Jonas is given the memory of love because it is something so different and unknown for Jonas  I recommend this book to anyone who likes a good cliffhanger and who likes to incorporate their own ending Jade Gamez  Miss Darney Upon looking at reviews of Lois Lowry s The Giver  I m surprised that people could have rated this book anything less than 5 stars  I ve read this book probably 3 times now  I decided to re read it when I found out that they are making a movie out of this  and let me tell you this book never gets old  The concept of the world that Jonas lives in is so absurd yet Lowry makes it seem so realistic  Imagining a world where you have no rights and your whole life is controlled is hard enough  but add in that they can t see color or feel anything makes it downright outrageous  I found myself wondering the same questions that Jonas would ask the Giver  and the fact that Lowry used that method to answer the reader s questions is genius  The book keeps you on your toes  more so towards the end  but even the beginning keeps you engaged by making you soak in the incogitability of the whole setting  I will admit though  the cliff hanger at the end is a huge let down because who doesn t want to know what happens to Jonas and poor little Gabe  I also was pretty confused by the last 3 or 4 paragraphs  Jonas is extremely weak and hungry  as is Gabriel  and then he pulls a memory forward  His very first memory of riding a sled down the hill  but Lowry describes it as if Jonas is actually riding the sled  He very well may be riding that sled  I just happen to be confused by that part and ambiguity at the end of a book isn t my favorite thing  This book DID leave me feeling sad that it was over and sad for the recent happenings in the book  but not a surprise as most books do that to me  I read this book in 2 days  loved it    The day after I finished it  my English teacher announced we would be reading it in class    I treat this book like a novella because it s so short  but it was very good  I like that a lot was left open to interpretation and self reflection  the story wasn t laid out in black and white for the reader to just  digest   Rather  there was a lot left unsaid that you had to read between the lines  or use your own imagination to fill things in  This wasn t done in a way that left me aggravated and wanting more details  but it allowed me to think about this world  how it was presented  and if it really was all it s cracked up to be There were also some parts that I think fall under unreliable narration   which I LOVE   because it causes the reader to go  oh hang on a minute   is it really like that  Can I trust what this narrator is thinking or saying  or is something else actually happening  I wish more books went that step  that actually caused the reader to think and dispute the information presented I also LOVED the ending  Unlike modern dystopias which all have a very formulaic 3 book scheme and storytelling arc  this is a stand alone book without a finite resolution  We are left to interpret ourselves how this world ends up  and it s so refreshing knowing there aren t two more books waiting in the wings  which will lead us patronisingly by the hand to a happy ending This novella is really creative  smart  and well written  Parts of it reminded me of George Orwell s 1984  I don t think it s purely a YA book at all  if you read between the lines  there are many adult themes and questions of morality and choice presented  Utopia isn t all it s cracked up to be  I really enjoyed this book  I give it the full five stars      This book not only made me think about the life that I live and the life that Jonas lives  but also how mysterious and interesting the characters and plot was  Though I wouldn t prefer to live in a community like that  the way they live interests me a lot  and it is a very unique community The plot of the book was for Jonas to grow up as a person  from his birth to him becoming an official adult in the community with a very special  gifted job  He has to make decisions for himself and do what he wants to do  The theme of this book is to follow your heart and enjoy every moment of life  whether it is a sad moment  a happy moment  a moment of thought  or any other kind of book  At the end of the story  Jonas runs away from his community and his job with Gabriel  a baby  and the story ends with the reader s opinion on what happens to them next  I can connect to this book because online I have seen many communities like Jonas  community that anyone can join  Also  when I visit places around the world such as Israel  their lifestyle is very different than mine WHO HOO  THE GIVER             Everyone thinks that having to wear what they tell you and work were they tell you and do things that the group leaders tell you is the right thing to do  and that is what Jonas also thought  but ones he turned 12 he was sent to training to become the new giver  But had never even heard of that job so he was scared but ones he knew what is was about he got more into the training and now it was to late to go back Now he had to go through so much pain for the sake of everyone else in the community  The theme of this book is how memory is very important to all of us humans  The theme of this song that i know from aventura about this little girl that gets hurt every night but in the morning she forgets until one night it happens again but in the morning she remembers  That song telling is telling you that is very important to remember things that could be very important to you  I really do love this book because of the things that happens from begging to end  It has me reading late at night and not want to drop the book   I found the characters well drawn and engaging and the story both thought provoking and engrossing  I could never fault Ms  Lowry s talent as a word smith and creative story teller  However  I did have some problems with the world building  A lot of the realism was well drawn  and I really could feel what it was like to be trapped and pigeon holed in such a society  yet I also thought she just jumped from the natural human story into the paranormal without adequate connection or explanation  leaving me scratching my head  Like how did the community take away people s ability to see and process the concept of color  Just how was the laying of hands supposed to transmit memories  and by just what means would the death or departure of the Receiver of Memories transmit those memories and feelings to the general population  I found the  they did  cause they did  cause I said so  explanation to be kind of a cheat that departed from the depth and humanity of the tale and  for me  these jumps felt like big holes in the plot  Awalnya lumayan kaget  sejarah buku dystopian yang pernah ku baca ngga ada yang kayak gini  Aku juga tadinya mikir buku ini tentang komunis  berhubung nama koloninya Komunitas  Ternyata jauh berbeda  Di setiap Komunitas terdapat peraturan  yang mengharuskan setiap orang untuk mematuhinya  jika tidak  akan kenakan sanksi tentunya  dan jika tiga kali melanggar peraturan utama maka akan dilepaskan Semua hal dikomunitas dibuat serupa  semua orang mendapat jatah yang sama dalam makanan  jatah yang sama dalam mempunyai anak  jatah yang sama dalam segala hal  Dikomunitas  terdapat aturan mengenai usia  bukan usia asli  tapi lebih ke arah kelas  Kelas Satu  Dua  Tiga  sampai Dua Belas  Kelas yang ku maksud bukan kasta  tapi hanya untuk membedakan golongan dari anak anak hingga dewasa  Setiap anak akan naik kelas pertahun dan setiap bertambah kelas mereka akan mendapat hak istimewa yang hanya didapat di kelas itu  Misalnya  Sembilan mendapat sepeda  Delapan mendapat jaket berkancing depan dan berkantong  jadi inget bapaknya ikal dan baju safarinya   Kenaikan kelas menandakan mereka mulai beranjak dewasa  sampai akhirnya kelas Dua Belas  Dua Belas akan diberikan penugasan atau pekerjaan di komunitas yang dipilih oleh komite tetua  Dua Belas yang sudah ditugaskan akan memulai pelatihan mereka sampai mereka lulus sekolah utama dan pelatihan  kemudian baru bekerja dengan sungguh sungguh  Masa ini lah yang disebut kedewasaan  Setelah membentuk unit keluarga di masa dewasa  dan setelah anak anak mereka telah mencapai kedewasaan  mereka kemudian tinggal di Rumah Dewasa Tak Beranak  aku agak lupa namanya  sampai mereka dipindahkan ke Rumah Lansia  setelah beberapa waktu baru mereka dilepaskan Aku dari tadi ngomong dilepaskan  maksudnya apa sih  Mungkin harus dibaca bukunya  berhubung hal inilah yang bikin aku shock setengah mati Jonas saat ini Sebelas dan sebentar lagi ia akan mengikuti upacara Dua Belas  Tapi tak ada yang menduga bahwa nama Jonas akan dilewatkan di upacara  Jonas ternyata mendapat penugasan khusus  yaitu menjadi Penerima yang akan dilatih oleh Sang Pemberi  Dari Sang Pemberi  Jonas mendapat banyak pengalaman  pengetahuan  dan perasaan yang tak pernah ia tahu ada  Dan Jonas serta Sang Pemberi ingin mulai merubah komunitas  Tentu  Komunitas adalah tempat yang sempurna  semuanya teratur  semuanya disiplin  semuanya sopan  tapi semuanya juga tidak memiliki perasaan yang sesungguhnya  Ada hal yang diambil oleh setiap pil yang diminum warga  Dan Jonas bertekad untuk merubah segalanya Ada hal yang mengganjal waktu selesai baca buku ini  oke banyak hal yang mengganjal  dan malah banyak pertanyaan yang muncul dibanding jawaban  Mungkin memang Lowry inginnya seperti itu  tapi KURANG   Aku mau tahu apa yang terjadi di Komunitas  apa yang terjadi selanjutnya dengan Jonas dan Gabe dan Pemberi  Aku mau tahu sebenarnya settingnya itu tahun kapan  Kenapa bisa ada Komunitas  Di mana sebenarnya Komunitas itu berada  Ada berapa banyak Komunitas yang terbentuk  Apa yang terjadi dengan negara negara lain  Kenapa malah mandeg di tengah jalan  Oh iya  ada yang tahu kapan buku keduanya terbit  Please don t tell me that it will launch just before the second movie out    Secara keseluruhan  buku ini bagus  Lowry menempatkan karakter dan plotnya sangat pas  Dan twist endingnya juga keren meskipun aku ingin lebih tapi well  that s the point right  Twist  Karena karakternya abu abu  aku tidak mengharapkan pengembangan karakter yang gimana gimana  Dan I am sorry for your lost The Giver    Imagine a world with no fear  pain  or suffering  That is the world Jonas lives in until he receives his community assignment  The Giver is a dramatic telling of what it is like to know nothing to soon know everything about the world around you  It Follows character Jonas in his journey as become the new receiver of memory  Jonas quickly learns that the utopia around him is not quite as it seems  Jonas must learn to cope with all the information flooding in to him with the help of the current receiver known as  The Giver   Together with  The Giver  Jonas formulates a plan that will change his society forever  Lowry has crafted an excellent read here  This novel leaves you wanting more  The story really makes you think about what life could be like in a utopia such as the one depicted in The Giver  This is the kind of the novel that anyone can enjoy since its not a difficult read yet provides a great story  To pick a general demographic for this novel would be for early teens  The length of the novel is appealing to those who aren t looking for a long read  Its relative simplicity also appeals to the younger audience  Generally this book is truly a good read  It satisfies the need to read a short novel yet has incredible depth  I enjoyed the read and the sequel to The Giver is just as good I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a quick read   Wow  this book was fantastic  I am glad Lois Lowry decided to write sequels  even if she hadn t originally planned on doing so  I m not ready to give Jonas up yet so I ll definitely be reading the rest of the series  Jonas was raised the same way everyone else was and he didn t expect to be different from everyone else  Everyone else was the same  There were no differences  not in his community  However  as Jonas steps forth on his graduation day to receive his assignment from the elders  things begin to change  With his assignment comes responsibilities to the community and these responsibilities are things that not even the elders understand  Only the Receiver understands and as Jonas is taught about these responsibilities he begins to question who he is  questions that will lead him down a path he may not be ready for This book deals with some pretty tough realities and concepts but Lois Lowry does so in a way that helps the readers understand and come to terms with the reality of Jonas  world  I truly loved this book  its imagery and symbolism are absolutely amazing  The words themselves make you experience the feelings and emotions along with Jonas  so intensely sometimes that it is hard to remember that you are not part of his situation  Not directly  anyway  Lowry is a wonderful writer and I look forward to experiencing more of her work Warnings  violence Pretty confused by the ending  I need to know more I wish I had the second book    I really enjoy reading this book  As a 14 year old  I find this book really fascinating  It makes me view society today differently than how I used to  This book is based on a utopian society  so if I have to guess  it is during the future  In this society  no one has ever experienced fear before  except for one person  The Giver  The Giver holds all the memory of the past  aka  society today and before   When people in this society turns 12  they will get assigned a job  Jonas was assigned to be The Receiver of Memory  In this book  the author will bring us through JOnas s journey  him receiving memory that would happy  sad  or even hurt  What would Jonas do if he can t handle the pain any longer  You have to read and see   This book made me think about many concepts that started to vanish in our society  Life is so simple  but we make is so complicated  We don t know the importance of love  and gathering     till we lose them   Ignorance is bliss  At least  until that ignorance is shattered  For Jonas his ignorance ends at the tender age of 12 when he reaches the age within his community to receive his role among them  However  instead of being assigned a position like others his age  Jonas is selected to receive the position of The Receiver in which he will be taught by the Giver  What he learns and what he sees will change his life forever The Giver is a fantastic dystopian novel that brings to life a world you never could have imagined  This novel will bring you to appreciate the beauty of the world around us and the courage it takes Jonas to leave behind all the things he once thought to be true  Jonas lives in a community where there is no such thing as fear  pain or choices  When children arrive at a certain age  they are assigned a role  When Jonas s time comes  he is not assigned a role  but is selected to be the Receiver of Memory  His work consists of training with the Giver  the only person in his community who knows of fear  pain and loss  The Giver s task is to pass all the memories of these unknown feelings over to Jonas  When Jonas begins to learn about these things  including love  something that is unheard of amongst the people he is closest to   he learns that his  beloved  community is not as great as it seems I really loved this book  The author appeals to the reader by portraying a possible dystopian society that seems both extremely realistic yet far fetched  This contradictory tone had me hooked from page one and I definitely recommend this book to any fantasy readers  I m reading this for the first time as an adult as the first printing was well after my high school journey and impressionable stage had completed  I devoured this book from first page to last and was slightly saddened when it had ended  A somewhat shocking  tale of a dystopian society and the rebel antagonist who learns the truth and takes action  I found the ending to be rather optimistic  but time will tell  Looking forward to the next book in the quartet   Book Review by  Sharon Powers NOTE  If you would like to see this review with all the graphic images and the movie trailer  you can see them on my blog at  http   sharonsloveofbooks blogspot com  No sooner had my daughter arrived home from sixth grade telling me that her teacher was very mad at her because the book she had taken to read during the  free reading period   wasn t acceptable  then the phone rang  Answering it  I was surprised that my daughter s teacher was the one calling  She expressed great disapproval at my daughter s book saying it was inappropriate for a sixth grader to be reading a book that was beyond her grade level   I asked her to please hold for a minute and then spoke to my daughter asking her to show me the book she was reading  I was somewhat surprised when she showed me the book and again asked her if she was sure this was the book the teacher was unhappy with her having  She assured me that it was the book  Going back to the phone the teacher again asked why I let her read a book inappropriate for her grade level  For a moment  I was dumbfounded at her disapproval of my daughter s book and my parenting  I composed myself  and told her I approved of the book   I also told her that I had read the book when I had been in high school as part of my school curriculum  She said that it wasn t the book but my daughter s age that she was just too young  I told her that I know my daughter  and that though in sixth grade  she had been tested and was reading at high school level speed and comprehension  I told her that I permit my daughter to read whatever book she was capable of and interested in reading  of course  barring those which were sexually explicit   I told her my daughter didn t have to secretly check out books from the library and that she always showed me what she was reading  The teacher  in fury  hung up the phone  My daughter ran and threw her arms around me squeezing me tight  I told her not to worry  that her book was a good book and that I supported her reading choices  Society and its views of dystopian society have moved forward since my daughter was in grade school  Young Adult novels abound with dystopian settings and themes  in fact  in 1993  Lois Lowry s book  The Giver was published and subsequently received the Newbery Medal  1994 by the Association for Library Service to Children   In addition to the prestigious Newbery Medal  the book also receiv  ed the Regina Medal  1994   and the William Allen White Award  1996   SHORT BOOK SYNOPSIS  Eleven year old Jonas lives in an idyllic community with his mother  father and sister  In this idyllic world  no suffering exists  no war  no disease  no pain  Jonas waits in anticipation for the December celebration where he would  with the other eleven year olds  celebrate the  Ceremony of Twelve    Jonas will officially become an adult and receive his assignment in the work he will do as he grows into adulthood  and the training that will begin immediately after the ceremony  When the day arrives  Jonas  and everyone else  is shocked to learn he has been selected as the next  Receiver of Memory   When Jonas begins his training from a man who calls himself  The Giver   Jonas begins to see things in a different way than he did before his selection  Jonas begins learning the shocking and troublesome truths about the idyllic world in which he lives  He is confused and at first doesn t understand  but as time goes on and Jonas receives more and more memories from  The Giver   he tries to come to terms with his life and what it all means in this false community  Who really pays for the pain free society in which he lives  Is it  The Giver    The Receiver   or is the cost really laid upon the community at large MY FAVORITE QUOTE   This quote is taken from the  Ceremony of Twelve   just before Jonas receives his selection as  the  Receiver of Memory   The initial speech at the Ceremony of Twelve was made by the Chief Elder  the leader of the com  munity who was elected every ten years  The speech was much the same each year  recol  lection of the time of childhood and the period of preparation  the com  ing responsibilities of adult life  the profound import  ance of Assignment  the seriousness of training to come    This is the time   she began  looking directly at them   when we acknowledge differences  You Elevens have spent all your years till now learning to fit in  to standardize your behavior  to curb any impulse that might set you apart from the group   But today we honor your differences  They have determined your futures    p 51  I really enjoyed this quote  and loved that the differences in the elevens turned twelves was what determined their futures  a wonderful foreshadowing of the changes to come  Jonas had something uniquely different about him  something that  in the end  would set him apart  entirely  from even the community  I like this idea  From a struggle to be  a part  of the community to a struggle to be  apart  from the community  Just reciprocally beautiful ABOUT THE DYSTOPIAN NOVEL  First  a word or two about Dystopian novels  in general  At the beginning of the book  The Giver  it appeared too good to be true  A community where no pain existed  no unemployment  no war  no crime  just peace and sameness  However  we soon began to see a community in which people were controlled to the extent they had little individuality  were given pills to prevent passionate emotions  and  released  if they didn t fit into the community     a euphemism for death     DYSTOPIAN SOCIETIES are those societies that have qualities of being somewhat undesirable  harmful or perhaps unpleasant  The unpleasantness is usually due to a dramatic decline in society  for example  an apocalypse  In our book  The Giver  the decline had come before the present time  war  death  fighting  disease  etc  prompted people to give up their uniqueness and individual liberties to attain peace  and oneness  However  harmful or unpleasant side effects of the dystopian society usually result  Characteristics of a Dystopian Society  Propaganda is used to control citizens  Information  independent thought  feelings and or freedom are restricted  a  figurehead  or concept is worshipped by the citizens  Citizens are under constant surveillance  just like in our novel  today  The Giver   Citizens have a fear of the outside world  sometimes citizens live in a dehumanized state  the natural world is banished and distrusted  Citizens conform to uniform expectations  individuality and dissent are bad  again  just like in today s novel  The Giver  and the society is an illusion of a perfect utopian world  or wants to appear so  Stratification of Society  Hallmarks of literature utilizing dystopian structure in a book s plot usually includes the stratification of society  In Brave New World  Aldus Huxley created groups called Alphas  Betas  Gammas  Deltas  and Epsilons   in Divergent the groups were called Amity  Erudite  Dauntless  Abnegation  and Candor  In this book  The Giver  Lois Lowry creates groups based on a person s age  ones  twos  threes  fours  fives  sixes  sevens  eights  nines  tens  elevens  and twelves  who are considered to be adult  and finally the elderly or old  and retired persons   Every year the rules change for each age group  for example  at one year old you get your name and a family  at eight  like Jonas s sister  Lily  the child gets an  identifying jacket  with pockets and smaller buttons as well as being required to start doing volunteer hours  nine year old girls can remove their  childish  hair ribbons and put them aside  and all nine year olds got their bicycle  Moreover  once assigned a place in society after the Ceremony of Twelve  your career is yours permanently  supposedly assigned to your best abilities  like fish hatchery attendant  recreation assistant  birth mother or  Receiver of Memories   like Jonas  Family is also a critical piece of dystopian society  The government seeks to destroy or control social interaction by exerting rigid controls on the family  In The Giver  you must apply to be married  and even if approved  your spouse is selected for you  you are only allowed two children  moreover  birth mothers never see their children  The children are taken away and assigned to a family requesting a child  Individuals must report their dreams every morning  and when old enough to develop  stirrings   you must begin taking a daily pill to suppress the  stirrings  that you are feeling  Other hallmarks of dystopian novels  and movies  which use PROPAGANDA TO CONTROL CITIZENS of society through use of the following  Politics and Government  The Hunger Games   Economics  see  V For Ven  detta   Psychology  Brave New World  Religion  see  Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep  The Handmaid s Tale and A Canticle for Liebowitz   issues of Identity  see  Gattica   Violence of fighting  war  or other oppression  see  Judge Dredd  Mad Maxx  or The Running Man   Corporate Control  Minority Report and Running Man   Bureaucratic Control  Brazil   Science  Blade Runner   Technology  R U R   I  Robot  The Matrix  and Terminator   and finally  Environmental issues  concerning pollution  not enough food  etc    see  Logan s Run  Avatar  Soylent Green  and Wall E   It can be seen in other famous dystopian novels as follows  Nineteen Eighty Four  and Farenheit 451  of course  there are many  many more  This is just a small sampling    Undoubtedly  since novels  and movies  following dystopian themes are so popular and prevalent in society  right now  we will visit this issue again in the future  Because dystopian themes are seen in everything from television shows  like The Walking Dead   to video games  Fallout   as well as novels and movies   I m sure we will be looking at dystopian themes in new novels as they are written and come into the publishing and reading world  Until then  I hope this quick little nutshell version of dystopian society helps you to appreciate this genre of literature more WHAT I THINK ABOUT THE BOOK  THE YA CONTROVERSY  Some reviewers and bloggers are totally against YA  young adult  novels  in general  as reading material for adults  Apparently  the view is held that adults should be  embarrassed when what you re reading was written for children    15  I feel quite differently about the matter  I have loudly proclaimed from day one of my blog posting that any kind of reading is wonderful   I want to encourage everyone to read  not just children  Personally  since I m beyond my YA years  I choose YA books every now and again to keep my spirit young  And   parents especially  should know what their children are reading  parents NEED to stay abreast of the most current trends in literature for their own children s sake  For other adults  if your tastes don t run to YA literature  don t read it  find something to read that you enjoy  That s what you should do in any event   Personally  I choose to mix it up  I read YA  but I also read comics and graphic novels  I read classical literature  romance  Pulitzer Prize winning novels  non fiction and historical  militaristic sci fi  fantasy  biography  self help  spirituality  psychology  horror  non fiction  etc  I read them all  I think it makes me a more well rounded person with a more flexible and agile mind  I simply find all this looking down one s nose at any given genre to be both snobbish and short sighted  I am not embarrassed in the least   Nuff said  Second  YA books are  indeed  written for the teens  The difference in YA versus adult books is that the story is all about the teenage perspective  Teenagers are not adults and have not learned the critical thinking skills that mark adulthood  nor should they be expected to try and read from an adult perspective  Teen readers plunge themselves into the emotional life of the protagonists  in part  teens are learning empathy and gaining understanding of how to handle problems  deal with life situations  and what mistakes to avoid  among other things   I know some adults who might benefit from reading YA fiction   Even adults that have grown into an adult mind and experience a more critical perspective and analysis of reading material can learn new things and  as I mentioned  above  keep their spirits young at heart  To learn that teens  while they may not read with the adult critical mind  are people  too  with cares  desires  and a willingness to learn about life and grow into the people they are becoming  That teenagers deserve to be admired and applauded for their interest in reading  growing  and becoming more  is something they truly deserve  JONAS AND THE GIVER  Told entirely from third person narrative  we are put into the perspective of the 11 12 year old boy  Jonas  We have no others injecting thoughts or information into the story  This tends to help make the experience of reading the story immediate  present  and intimate  Lowry s us of simple language helps us to regress down to Jonas s age to see things simply  and uncritically  choosing  instead  to trust the adults in his life  namely  his parents  and the elders  until he learns that he should not trust them  The language is instrumental in conveying the powerful concepts contained in the novel  The Climax of the book is a heartbreaking scene when disillusionment is complete for Jonas as The Giver plays a video of a newborn child being euthanized by Jonas s father  whose role in the community is that of a nurturer  Jonas realizes that all the people whom he has known who have been  released   have been killed  not transferred to other communities  their bodies then dumped down a chute like so much refuse  Jonas and the Giver then resolve to change the situation  Rule Breaking  In this strictly run com  munity full of laws and expectations  we also see rules broken   1  When Jonas s father gets permission as an exception to the rules to bring home the baby  Gabriel  for additional nurturing   2  when the nines  9 year old children  teach their younger siblings to ride a bicycle  everyone turns their head in blindness at their violation of that law   3  Jonas s father breaking a rule to obtain the name of the baby  Gabriel    4  Jonas s father permitting the family to break the rule of calling the baby by its name before it had officially been named  such   5  Jonas s father admitted knowing his assignment  Nurturer  before it was given at his Ceremony of Twelve  Children who see adults condone rule breaking are subtly influenced to believe that they  too  may break the rules and get away with it  It may be one way adults  unknowingly  are fostering a rebellious child  After Jonas begins receiving memories from the kindly Giver  he learns to see colors  feel joy  and even love for the first time  and also pain  He experiences sledding in the snow  death on a battlefield  and the physical pain of broken bones and injury  He also is shocked to learn that he has been given permission to break certain rules  like lying and rudeness  Jonas s  mind reeled  as he realized that other Twelves  other adults  could have received the exemption from lying  how often had he been lied to  Symbolically  Jonas s father  The Nurturer  seems to nurture a son conditioned to break rules  Jonas cannot live in the oppressive and feelingless society  Moreover  the society doesn t seem to recognize that the  Releasing  of the elderly  young  misfits  or failures  as a horror that harkens back to Nazi like practices  e g  youth camps  extermination of undesirables  etc    Finally  to save Gabriel  an angelic little child from death   Jonas steals him and leaves the community  fleeing into the unknown  Jonas must draw upon his own courage and resourcefulness to evade search planes with heat seeking devices  face the cold and freezing weather with the small boy he carries as a symbol of the welfare of his whole community  Jonas places Gabriel next to his skin to warm him  becomes a Giver and gives Gabriel warm memories to help him survive  Like the first Giver  the old man whom he has grown to love   Jonas has moved from being a Receiver to a Giver  His hope is to save the child and the community by giving  releasing  back the memories he received from the Giver so that the community members can once more have feelings  The ambiguous ending does not reveal how this is to be accomplished THE MOVIE  As I indicated in the title of this post  the book to movie is coming to theaters on 08 15 14  so if you are reading the blog post the two weeks before the movie  you still have time to read the book before the movie comes out   Directing the movie is Philip Noyce  cast as Jonas is Brenton Thwaites  Jonas s father is Alexander Skarsgard  Katie Holmes as Jonas s mother  Emma Tremblay as Lily  Jonas s sister   Jeff Bridges has been cast as The Giver  Taylor Swift as Rosemary  Meryl Streep as the Chief Elder  Odeya Rush as Fiona  and Cameron Monaghan as Asher  Writing Credits go to Lois Lowry  Book   Michael Mitnick  screenplay  and Robert B  Weide  screenplay   I sincerely hope the adaptation of the book to movie is successful  This wonderful books deserves nothing less than to be successful MY RECOMMENDATIONS AND RATING  The movie s MPAA rating is PG 13  I would  likewise  rate the book the same  as the book s target audience is for those students of middle school  For all the above reasons  I rate this wonderful book as 4 5 Stars out of 5  Because Goodreads does not have half stars  I round up to rating the book 5 stars  Thank you for joining me this week as we looked at Lois Lowry s wonderful novel  The Giver  Please join me next time as I review another new book  Pick up any book this week  or e reader  and read for a while  Please don t forget to share  post  tweet or pin this blog post so others will be able to have access to the information about Lois Lowry s wonderful book  My love to you all Until next time      many happy pages of reading Sharon  Everyone should read it  Gives meaning to being different  Awsome  but uber sad The GiverThe Giver is a great book about a strange world with strange people  This is a dystopian novel which means that the society is unpleasant and dehumanizing  However the society is supposed to be a utopia but because of the way things are run there and what they do  it s not even close to one Jonas must conform like everyone else  but Jonas isn t like everyone else  When he is in the ceremony of 12 he gets skipped over and he wonders whether or not he will even get a job  but then they tell him that his job is the most important of all  He has been given the job as  Receiver  and will have that job until the rest of his life  He is then taken under the  Giver s wing to learn all that there is to know about his job of being a receiver  Jonas is also struggling to conform  he starts doing things that just aren t what he is supposed to be doing  I won t spoil anymore of the book but this is very action packed towards the end with lots of page turning suspense  I could hardly put down the book in the last few chapters  just waiting to see what happened drove me crazy  The storyline is amazing with such a unique plot and characters that seem like they should be real people  This book is a little weird but I thinks it is just weird because it is different from most books  For instance Jonas gets  the stirrings  which is basically puberty and must take a pill because of it  But when he doesn t take the pills  he gets feelings for a certain girl named fiona and starts having dreams about her  The society is very nonsexual and noncommunicative  Overall the book is really eerie and unique which makes this a must read book  Have you ever wondered what a world without feelings or pain would be like  Unfortunately  it would not have color or freedom of choice  At first  the society that The Giver takes place in seems wonderful  Each family is perfectly picked and medicine can be taken to immediately cure any sort of pain  Everything is laid out in order that nothing will be messed up or go wrong  But citizens of this society cannot experience music  color  feelings  or choice  When Jonas is chosen as the new Receiver  he discovers how dull and bleak this society actually is  But does he have enough courage to change it for the better The first time I read the Giver I very much disliked it  Now that I am older and better understand the meaning of this book  I absolutely love it  It teaches readers to appreciate the world we live in and accept our imperfections  Since it is a science fiction novel  there is a possibility that the world as we know it could become just like Jonas s world  I feel that the action of  release  in this book can be closely related to the effects of abortion in modern times  In The Giver  releasing is seen as a normal  routine thing  but readers find it horrid and sad that it is done to babies  Abortion is doing the exact thing to innocent babies and it happens every day in our world  If only The Giver enlightened readers to have a different aspect on the severity of abortion  The Giver is a fantastic book and I plan on reading the rest of the books in this series   I recently read  The Giver  by Lois Lowry  I chose to read this book because I heard it was good from a friend  The Giver is about a boy named Jonas who lives in a Utopian society but gets a look into what life used to be Jonas is a normal 11 in the community  he goes to school and does volunteer hours The ceremony of 12 is approaching quickly though and all of that will change  Jonas is chosen to be the receiver of memory  a great honor in the community  but this will come with many challenges and his first real pain  He will learn feelings  Finally after receiving a lot of memories he realizes that he is lives in a society without feelings  With the help of The Giver he sets out on a journey to find a world with feelings and love I really enjoyed this book and would definitely recommend it to anyone because it applies to everyone s life and really has great life lessons  The Giver by Lois Lowry was the 1994 Newbery Award Winner  in addition it has sparked controversy and remains on the banned book list  In a community completely controlled by the  Elders   Jonas finds himself on a journey in discovering the joys and sorrows of life  The idea of  Not missing what you ve never had   plays a significant role in the story line  Each member of the community does not experience emotion on a deep level  lack of feeling provides protection from painful circumstances  However  it also means a person can not experience the pleasures life may bring  Once Jonas turns tweleve he is assigned the responsibility of being the community s  Giver   The Giver has both honor and burden in experiencing the pleasures of life such as love family and heartache including death war  Jonas makes the decision to live deeply  experiencing emotion on all levels  in doing so he must find a way to escape the traps of this programed community and begin life elswhere When I first started  The Giver  I was a little uncomfortable with the direction of the story  For example  taking medicine to prevent  stirrings   But as things moved on I was able to grasp the idea of the Elders controlling every emotion and natural stimulus  I also recognized controversy with the  ceremony of release   Upon completing the book I thought it was well done  I believe it should not be banned but rather used for discussion on subjects such as death  murder  respect for life  individuality  authenticity and human emotion  Questo libro e di una bellezza disarmante  ti cambia inevitabilmente   The Giver by Lois Lowry is one of the best books I have ever read  It teaches bravery and friendship  Jonas s world is perfect and it has been since he was born  There s no pain or suffering and no choices  His world is dull to prevent choices and difference  Everything has been planned out for him since the day he was born and assigned a family unit  Jonas is soon to be a Twelve and he will be assigned an Assignment that he will work at until he goes to the House of the Old  When the day comes  the Chief Elder assigned Jonas Receiver of Memory which is a huge honor and is huge shoes to fill  The training causes unexplainable pain  but there is no turning back now   The easiest way to describe this book is as Nineteen Eighty Four for children  but that would be selling it short  Although written for children  this book easily engaged me  Jonas is a likeable character  and I couldn t help rooting for him One of the rules of the community in which Jonas lives is that all members should speak with a  precision of language   This precision of language is refected in the tight  spare prose used to tell the story  Not a word is wasted  and it is a delight to read  The images evoked are vivid and the weirdness of a near emotion free community is quite unnerving at times  as is the whole idea of Sameness  The story made me grateful for all the freedom of choice I have  even taking into account all the pain and suffering that can come with it  A world without choice  without colour  without music  without love would not be a world that I would want to live in I ll be keeping this book on my bookshelf so that I can pass it to my own children  both for their enjoyment and their education   The Giver was a very light and enjoyable read  It was a quick read yet packed with many memorable lessons  It was a book that really made me think and question  and I do not believe that is found to such an extent in a lot of Young Adult books  It touches on a lot of real life issues but is dressed up in an inviting fiction tale  Instantly  upon reading the first chapter I began to assume that the book would have a lot of twists and turns  The word  released  alone triggered questions and built up a mystery   One of my favorite elements of Lowry s writing is the smooth entrance of not so easy topics  For example  when  stirrings  were first introduced with Jonas  dream about Fiona  It was brought into the story with ease  but that is a heavy topic  but a common and natural one for young adults  Small parts like that really come together to make a classic book for adolescence and also adults  Another important topic that was eased into the novel was the topic of learning disabilities  The mention of Asher s struggle with speech and the horrible way that the teachers and community handled is a great starting place to discuss differences with students and future teachers  Subjects like Autism  Dyslexia  and ADD ADHD can be discussed further because of the mention of Asher s struggle  The book shows the way not to handle students that with more upfront differences  and that gets the ball rolling on how to properly act with diversities such as these among students   Another strong point in the book was how vividly the story was told  It tugged on almost all my emotions throughout the entire story  I was just as ecstatic as Jonas when he had his first memory of sliding in the snow on the red sled  I was deeply saddened when I found out what Rosemary went through and that she was the Receiver s own daughter  Then I was angry and upset as I witnessed the smaller identical twin being killed by Jonas s father  Lowry did an excellent job at providing the readers with just enough to fully understand what it would be like to have to endure sameness like that   The only part that of the book that made me shake my head at the author was the ending  I hated how open ended it left the readers  Jonas though very brave was just a boy and it hurt me not knowing what happened to him  and the baby Gabriel  it killed me having all those questions about their safety  After finding out that there were other books I was able to calm down a little  and give credit to Lowry because the ending was great way to get readers eager to read the other books  The Giver  by Lois Lowry  is a great piece of literature  It is about a boy  Jonas  who faces the difficulties of a Utopian society with a dark past  Jonas is forced to remember the happy and horrific memories of his community when he receives the job of the new Receiver  giver   At an age of 12  Jonas and other 12 year olds are given their future job  Jonas  as the new receiver can see things that no one else can see  He sees color  feels happiness of snow  and warmth  but along with those memories come bad ones  He faces the reality of the Utopian society  unfair laws are in place and no one has control of their own life  After Jonas  father gets a child named Gabriel to take care of  Jonas quickly develops a strong relationship with him  When he realizes that Gabriel was going to be  released  Jonas makes a decision to save him  With the help of the old receiver  he makes a plan to escape the Utopian society  When his plan is executed  he doesn t know where to go because he has never been out  It is a whole new world  alone with just Gabriel  There are many struggles during their journey but Jonas gives Gabriel all of his happy memories  Lois Lowry leaves the reader with skepticism about their survival  the reader is left to decide the fates of Jonas and Gabriel  Even though it was a pretty challenging book to read  it was still amazing  It is a mysterious book  and very interesting  This story is about growing up  and confronting the world  I would really recommend reading this book  I read this book twice  and I ve discovered things I didn t before  I read this book when I was 9  so I didn t appreciate it as much as I do now  First off  this book made me feel sad  The thought of no art  music  color  or freedom  Not even the right to know  Keep in mind that I haven t read the other books in the series  Has it occurred to anyone that this may not be the only  community   What if Jonas  at the end of the book  just found himself in another community just like his own  All of his work to escape would ve been for almost nothing  Also  his relationship with Fiona I found all the more adorable this time around  This amy be due to my more mature nature or my just having read some contemporaries  but his attempts at her and her wittiness was prefect  Now  The Giver  Talk about looking outside the box  That s literally what he does  His memories and knowledge of the truth inhibit his ability to interact with others in his community  leading to his complete isolation on The Edge  Lois Lowry gives us yet another witty  ironic  thought  an old man doing nothing  living his life on  The Edge   Oh  how lovely  Overall  I felt this book was five times better this time around than the last  and I highly recommend another read or a first for everyone   The Giver is about a young boy named Jonas  The story develops in a tightly controlled community that is lacking in choice  identity and freedom all together  The start of the story seems simple enough  the people of the community seem complacent in the  sameness  of their community  It isn t until the age ceremony that things begin to change  Jonas  as a new twelve year old  is assigned his role in the community  his job   He is the community s new Receiver  The Receiver s job is an honorable role that is ultimately the memory holder of the community  Jonas s new assignment is filled with pain  love and many feelings that he never new existed  As Jonas s training progresses  he learns that what he thought was reality was truly a lie  With all the new memories that Jonas now possesses  he cannot continue living on as he had in the past  He must escape from this lifeless community in which he has lived in his whole life  for now he knows that there is life with feelings  freedom  and most importantly love  This book pulls you and forces you to wonder what s next  The story is well developed with strong themes that can easily be related to  even in today s society  The themes of government controlled communities and the lack of freedom are real topics that are thought provoking and very important for discussion and growing in any classroom  Middle school students can really give a voice of their own when looking into this book  The Giver is a great learning device that illustrates the power of freedom  feelings  privacy  and all the things that students may take for granted   This book was a very well written  descriptive  and heartfelt  The Giver was written in 1993 by Lois Lowry Both adventurous and skillfully plotted  this book is recommended for young readers 8 and up When you start to read this book picture a perfect place  with no crimes  no hurt  pain  and sorrow  Imagine the STEPFORD WIVES    Lol  But anyway  the book starts off with a little boy name Jonas  who is 11 years old  and soon to be 12  Who is nervous about a upcoming a event  In this up coming event tells what hes going to be doing for the rest of his life Strange  but true  In this book at the age of 12 your considered adult  What I notice throughout this whole book  This community has a lot of rules  Strange to most  but overall different  For example  when your nine your not allowed to ride a bicycle Your not allowed to brag about your accomplishments  Your not allowed to mention the difference in nothing or anyone  I can go on and on  But trust me its a lot of rules   The community has chosen to forgo choice and emotion in order to produce efficiency and to eliminate pain  For example  there is no love in this culture  rather  these feeling entitled  stirrings  are controlled by medication Sexual feelings are not allowed  And the reason that sex is frowned on by the community is because it tends to create a close relationship between people  Then the good of the community is a effect as a whole  Because then you might put the good of those ahead of the good of the community  Marriage is controlled  and children are assigned to each  married  couple  to be raised  but not loved At the ceremony Jonas finds that his job will be the Receiver of Memories  Jonas gets his memories from the Giver  The Giver is the original Receiver of Memories  Jonas is lucky to be the Receiver of Memories As Jonas becomes older  he begins to see things that make him question everything he knows  I would recommend this to everyone  especially those who love books about the future  It shows the importance of giving people the freedom to make their own choices  even if those choices sometimes cause pain or maybe the wrong choices  At least they have freedom  Enought with the spoiling  If you would like to find out and learn more please pick up this very interesting  unusual book   I re read this book after reading the rest of the series  The first time was 6th grade and needless to say  I couldn t remember enough of the details to know why it was at all related to the other two I still really liked this book  maybe 4 5 liked it  but I ll round up since it changed my idea of what books can be when I read this for the 1st time in 6th grade  At that point I had only read assigned reading  Little House on the Prairie  my mom had the whole set and read it as a girl  and a few random others  but never a book like this and this kind of book   what if worlds  i e  not exactly post apocalyptic and not quite dystopian  almost similar enough to reality to be plausible  are among my favorite now   I also really liked The Hunger Games  another book I d lump with this one   spoiler  Questions  Why do you think they had to talk about their feelings every day  Was that  in addition to the dream telling  to make sure they know when to give the pill or something additional  And why can t they see color  I still don t get how that makes sense  I can see how the environment could be controlled and if history is never told  then people would be oblivious to it    but the color  I guess it s just magic  There is an element of magic to this since the giver must give memories    but it s still unclear to me and I m sure someone out there has a sure answer for me  Why were they so obsessed with  clear language   And I found it interesting that when Jonas asked his dad if he  his dad  loved him  Jonas  his dad responded by telling him his  Jonas   question was too vague   love  wasn t clear enough language  Really  I think we re supposed to recognize that this culture didn t have love  which was obvious before this question  I thought   but it did make me think about the word and that it is quite vague  at least in English  Supposedly  in Greek there are three different words for love  depending on who it is said between   if I remember correctly    rest is spoiler for book 3 Turns out Jonas from book one  is Leader in book 3 I have one other question  So  was Gabe in book 3  Did I miss it because I read it not having remembered he existed  This book reminded me a lot of 1984  The society in which Jonas lived in was  what seemed to me  brainwashed  Everything was the same except for the people s daily jobs and spouses  Love was no longer a word   which is scary to think about since loving and being loved is a great sort of feeling  The people couldn t see colors or hear music because the committee of elders believed it was dangerous for them to live that way  Jonas had never heard of any of these things until he had been chosen to be the next receiver of memory at the twelves yearly celebration  At first  Jonas loved what he was doing  but he started deciding that everything that was occurring was cruel and unfair  especially after he saw what the release truly entailed  death by injection  Jonas and the current receiver of memory decide to have Jonas leave the community  so the feelings may come back and the Giver may help them out  The plan the had constituted was derailed when Jona s father talks about Gabe s   a child who was considered  unprepared  for the community  release  This caused Jonas to speed up the forbidden act  He akes the child and himself away from the community and they go on elsewhere until they reach a location that resembled a memory he had received early on during his training with the giver   The Giver was one of my first  favorite  books growing up  That s saying a lot for a girl whose other first favorites included Anne of Green Gables  Little Women  The Secret Garden  Jane Eyre and Pride and Prejudice  The Giver  when I think back on it  was my first foray into social anthropology  Reading it as a child  one doesn t necessarily equate the Utopian   Dystopian world that the main character grows up in as  horrific   and unfeeling  Instead  it allows children to see a world in many ways very similar to our own    In many ways much better  and in other ways much worse  And it gets kids to think about concepts like community  family  interdependence and independence  It is a good novel because it gets one asking questions about themselves and their own families and communities  And ultimately  that s what a good book should do  help you gain perspective on aspects of your life that you have stopped questioning I highly recommend this book to both children and adults  with the caveat to adults that they try to read it through the eyes of a much younger self  To the people of various Communities located around the world  life involves little pain or suffering  as well as minimal dissent and disagreements  People in the Communities have no conception of true suffering  of starvation  of chaos  or of war  Every aspect of their lives are carefully controlled  from what they do as a career to who they are in a  family unit  with  They have no worries  no desires  but also no choice nor aspiration  However  one boy gets the opportunity to experience all that no one else has  both good and bad  Actually  this boy does not truly get to choose to take all of these experiences in  but the role is forced on him by the Council of the Elders  The boy  Jonas  through his new found experiences and the wisdom that he gains through them  realizes that without the good and bad in life  life simply becomes a waste of time  Lois Lowry s The Giver entranced me with the sheer oddity of a seemingly perfect society  then horrified me with the truth about every action behind the scenes As previously mentioned  Jonas has been chosen to receive experiences in the form the memories of ancestral people  One person in the Community must bear this monumental task for the rest  and every once in a blue moon a new  receiver  must be chosen  Needless to say  Jonas is the newest receiver and must obtain the memories from the previous receiver  now known as the  giver   As time passes and Jonas receives more and more memories  he begins to realize that his  perfect  world possesses some flaws  In order to maintain complete equality and perfection  in addition to every aspect of life being controlled  the climate  landscape  and even color of everything is strictly manipulated into a never changing  flat  and bland world  Jonas  caught between his duty as the new receiver and his desire to show the world what he sees and feels  must choose either to stay and live in a pretended ignorant bliss or to relinquish everything he has known and cherished for the sake of the populous Lois Lowry s main goal in writing this book must have been embedding serious themes subtly within  One of the most prevalent throught the novel is the question   What sacrifices should be made in order to obtain perfection  and moreover  would they be worth the loss   The people in The Giver sacrificed their strongest emotions  the variation of the Earth  and their freedom to make their own choices  but were their decisions worth the peace and leasure that served as a replacement  Is peace and prosperity worth blandness and a pre decided fate Lois Lowry and her book  The Giver  provoke many difficult questions that must be answered  while simultaneously telling an imersing tale of love and sacrifice  Honestly  this book belongs among the best that I have read  and that is saying something  I cannot think of any reason someone should not read this book  so to all  go pick this book up somewhere  find a comfortable position  grab a glass of sweet tea  and begin reading  Chances are you will like what you read 179 Pages  Es uno de mis libros favoritos  Lo he leido solo una vez  pues han sido pocas las veces en las que leo mas de una vez un libro  siempre estoy ansiosa por leer algo nuevo  dado el tiempo limitado que tenemos y la numerosa cantidad de libros existentes   Sin embargo  entiendo el punto de releer un libro y sacar de el nuevas conclusiones  Este libro genera en mi ese deseo  ese de entender mas alla de lo que ofrece la superficialidad  Ademas  siento gran curiosidad por las criticas al libro  hechas por personas que lo ven como algo negativo y sinsentido  Tambien quiero tratar de ver lo que ellos vieron al leerlo    Reread Finished August 19  2014  I first read this book as a requirement for my 8th grade English class and really enjoyed it  I then proceeded to read the other two books in the series at the time  Gathering Blue and Messenger  When Son was released  a friend and I decided that we needed to go back and reread the series as it had been such a long time since we had actually read the books  I have been working my way through the Delirium series recently and am working my way through the third and final in the series but discovered that my copy of the Giver was due back to the library today and I hadn t even started it  and being that the movie adaption was just released in theaters there are a lot of holds on the book  at this point around 61  so now renewing allowed  thus resulting in me plugging my way through it so I could have it finished and return it without having any late fees on it Now to my actual review of the story I have to say this book was as enjoyable as it was the first time I read it  I like that it is not like the typical dystopia of today s Young Adult fiction  This book  similar to Ender s Games  is more focused on the individual and their own personal struggle in their world  instead of focusing on the romance and love triangles that are more common today  There really isn t much more I have to say about this book at this time  I may have more to comment on after reading the bonus section in this book   Exclusive Interviews with Cast Members of the movie  After reading the Interviews with Cast Members of the movie  I don t know how I am going to feel about this book to movie adaption  From the responses that were given  it is very apparent that they have made major changed to the story line and characters  I will most likely be seeing the movie  but seeing as I like the book  I don t know how I am going to feel about these changes  I feel like they are going to take away from the deep meaning that was conveyed through the book  More at  Dawn of the BooksThis book was the very thing I have been looking for in quite a long time  I know this because upon reading the last word  a shiver crept through me and my eyes began to sting with longing for more Jonas lives in an ideal world  Conflict does not exist  Poverty  injustice and divorce are unheard of  There is no color in his community  Everything is nondescript  Each December  children who reach the age of 12 are given a job that was selected to fit their aptitudes  Jonas is given more  for as of age twelve  he must bear atop his shoulders a weight equivalent to a million mountains When I finished the book  I asked myself why on earth it took me so many years to finally read it  I ve seen this book around since I was ten years old  and now  six years later  I am glad that I did not read it earlier  Had I done so  I might not have understood the beauty in the simplicity of the language  I might not have understood the importance in distinction  I might not have felt the sting of tears at the idea that there could be a world without love and loss  Without pain and joy  Jonas lives in this indifferent life  and it was certainly something new for me to perceive  The idea behind the story is very bizarre  but definitely atmospheric  The setting was such that the colorless world seemed almost palpable to me And the characters  Their conformity with the rules was very well executed  The characters did not come off as card boards even though they felt nothing they were not taught to feel  In all honesty  until about halfway through  I began to wonder myself what was so rotten about the nondescript life they lived in  It was that real  I thought everything really worked  There is no struggle  But there is also no choice I would recommend this book to everyone  Though it was written for children  the depth between the lines is enough to fill up anyone with wonder   I loved this book  The way this story was told had a huge part in making it one of the best stories I have ever read  The only problem I have with it is it being just too short  I wanted more  But it was great  OH  MY  GOSH  I just finished it and i can t stop shivering and tingling and crying  This book was amazing  It was heartbreaking and touching and beautiful and sad and mindblowing  I cant even     I went into this book with really low expectation mostly because I wanted to read the book before the movie came out in the end I didn t do that but I havent seen the movie yet   So I wasnt sure how much I d like this  OMG  IT WAS FLIPPING FANSTATIC  This book had me crying like crazyyyyyy  The Giver is about a boy named Jonas and he lives in a world with order and perfection and sameness  It s all seemingly perfect until he s assigned to be  The Reciever  and meets an elder who changes the way he perceives life and the way he lives  I really want to tell people more but that would be spoiling and I m pretty sure everyone has already read this book and I m so late on the bandwagon  haha  FIVE STARS  READ THIS BOOK  if you havent already  This review is going to be really sloppy and awful by the way  SPOILERS DOWN BELOW    This world was so awful  As I read it  I found myself feeling really sorry for these fictional people  In the beginning I though their system was really absurd  You cant even choose your own child s name    You can t choose the job you want  You can t choose your wife husband  Omg  haha  and you can t even see your partner naked because it s banned    Like    Okay then  Also  you re constantly being watched and observed  It s creepy     The writing and the world kind of reminded me of the Delirium trilogy  but this world is even worse   Well sort of  they re both bad in their own way  It s crazy  At least in Delirium it s the cure that makes the people act like zombies  but wow    Did they people evolve over time to become like this thanks to the Elders  Or did they just cut the memories out of everyone and go to sameness in one quick day  Weren t there rebellions  Didn t people resist   Around chapter 16 or 17 is when I started sobbing  It was so painful to realize how these people live  I started crying think about how awful this world is and how they don t have these amazing memories or any choices  They don t even have colors  They can t recognize beautiful sunrise  Books are forbidden to people  Imagine how painful that would be for us booklovers  O   They don t have literature  They re all blind    It really hurt reading about this  But ignorance is bliss for them     I really like how he compared the sharing of feelings they did at dinner in the beginning of the book to the real feelings he felt page 166   How his sister and his mother s feelings were mediocre and artificial  They didn t experience true anger or true grief and sadness     On page 188 I started sobbing again    I mean it was obvious that the release was just some glorified death sentence  but there was a part of me that hoped Jonas was right and that they really do send those who are release into Elsewhere  But that wasn t the case    It was still so heartbreaking to read this chapter  His father just killed the baby and tossed him into the trash with no remorse  No guilt  No feelings     When the Giver said that Rosemary was his daughter     I broke down crying hysterically    It was so sad  He watched his daughter kill herself and I can t imagine how hard it was for him  He probably thought it was his fault because he gave her those unbearable memories    I could not stop the tears     I really loved this book because it teaches you to be grateful for your choices and for your freedom  It also really relates to that quote that went something like   Without sadness  there d be no happiness   or something like that  I really can t wait to get the second book in this quartet  Gathering blue right  Sorry this review was really bad and stuff  but I have to rush to get this down  Stupid school taking away time from my reading    Ugh  Anyways  happy reading       imagine a a society where you are seperated from all technology    most of you are probably scared to death right now aren t you  LOL  but seriously    no t v  no phone  no computers nada  and every one is grouped according to age and you have certain things or enjoy certain luxuries until you reach a certain age  A society where child birth is shameful  if you have twins they kill the one who weighs the lesser amount  A society where they inject you with stuff to keep your hormones from bouncing off the wall  everyone wheres the same thing  O M G   or even a society where the world is all black and white  no the town isn t all monochromatic  but every one is colorblind  you scared yet           this book is sad  weird  crazy  and twisted all wrapped into one  jonas the main character is in this society where every child is grouped with other children of the same age and every year they have to leave their friends and go with new children the age they are now  every child is adopted  the girls have to stop wearing hair ribbons at a certain age  they have to be a certain age to ride a bike  and child birth is kind of a thing to be ashamed of  for instance they have jobs and one of the jobs is to be a child bearer and your job is to have children basically  you are pampered for your stay there and given everything you want but after you have about 3 kids you re cut off and basically left on your own  any who    jonas isn t like the other people there  you see every one there is colorblind and jonas is slowly given the gift of seeing in color  so he goes to the giver and he transfers memories to jonas so that he can become the new giver  and slowly he sees a new color and to him he is fascinated  but just as every eleven year old boy nearing teen hood you start to have eyes for the opposite sex and as soon as he tells his parents about this dream he has where he s bathing his lady friend they freak out and give jonas pills to prevent the boy from lusting  and like every little town they have a outcast  a guy who tried to elude the craziness and they exiled him  and ever since then everyone in the town is banned from even speaking his name  yes the giver is one of those novels that will kinda grab you  get you wrapped in it s words  tangled in it s story hold you for a minute and just when you get into it slowly let you go and leave your mind boggling and begging for more   Ho appena finito di leggere questo libro e sono ancora totalmente stupefatta E  uno dei migliori libri che abbia mai letto  Scritto accuratamente  e ricco di occasioni di pensiero  riesce a catturare immediatamente il lettore Ho adorato il cambiamento del personaggio di Jonas  la cui maturita fuoriesce completamente nel momento stesso in cui capisce che  il Comitato degli Anziani  cerca in tutti i modi di tenere i membri della comunita all oscuro della realta dei fatti  educandoli minuziosamente sin da piccoli E  bellissimo anche il rapporto che si instaura tra Jonas e il Donatore  il precedente Accoglitore di Memorie  nel corso dell addestramento al quale in protagonista viene sottoposto Jonas conosce la goia  la paura  la sofferenza  e soprattutto  i colori  La sua comunita non e piu in bianco e nero  ma i suoi occhi riescono a vedere le tonalita e le sfumature del mondo Essendo finalmente a conoscenza della realta  e avendo per la prima volta nella sua bita la possibilita di scegliere  Jonas  da ragazzino ingenuo che era  e costretto a crescere repentinamente  ribellandosi alle regole con le quali e cresciuto  fuggendo dalla comunita Consiglio davvero questo libro a chiunque abbia voglia di leggere qualcosa di diverso e davvero ben fatto Primo di una quadrilogia   The Giver  e stato censurato in molte scuole americane  in quanto accusato di trattare in modo esplicito temi come la sessualita  l infanticidio e l eutanasia Il romanzo e seguito da  La rivincita   Gathering Blue   2000    Il messaggero   2004  e  Il figlio   2012  Io li gia ordinati  Voi che aspettate  Il mio blog  Questionedilibri altervista orgRecensione  http   questionedilibri altervista or    I read this one out of curiosity  wanting to have read it before seeing the movie   Spoiler  the book is better    This is a YA series  very easy  quick reading  and beautiful and touching as well  Once I d started reading I couldn t stop until I had finished the series  four books total   Can definitely see having students read this  you could discuss a lot of topics and ideas and feelings based on these books  I can see why this one won a literary award   and I don t usually like  Literary  books  I m more lowbrow and entertainment oriented    The society in The Giver has eliminated all pain and prejudice  but also all choice  distinction  and love  Eleven year old Jonas grows up in this pleasant and orderly society  Here  families and jobs are chosen by the leaders  At the Ceremony of Twelve  Jonas learns that he has been selected to be the next Receiver of Memory  He begins the process of receiving all of the memories that the society doesn t retain  memories of pain  war  hunger  color  art  love  etc  He receives them from an old man  the Giver  Through the transferring of memories  Jonas learns the cost of living without pain  He learns that when the elderly  imperfect newborns  and criminals are  released  to Elsewhere  they are actually killed  This makes him fear for the infant  Gabriel  for whom he has been caring  He knows that something must be done to give people back their own memories  and he is willing to sacrifice everything to do it There is a reason why this book is taught in many schools around the country  Its themes of courage  dealing with pain  and individuality are apropos for all adolescents  The dystopian setting and quickly moving plot engage male and female readers alike  I recommend this book to all middle grade and young adult readers looking for not only a thrilling adventure but also a thoughtful read The ending of the novel is ambiguous  Many debates in many classrooms try to sort out the meaning of it  Though some readers may find it satisfying  I would prefer more clarity there  Its vagueness  fortunately  does not hamper the story s staying power  The Giver  by Lois Lowry  The Giver is about a by named Jonas  he lives in a place where there s no war no poverty  no starvation but    no choices  you don t get to chose your job  your spouse  you re family is not your genetic family it never is  When you reach the age of twelve you get your job for life  Jonas gets the job of  The Receiver of Memory  he gets to meet the Giver  The Giver gives him memory s of the past like memories of    war snow sunshine color  I liked this book because it was realistic and could very well happen but just think    could you imagine living in a world with no feelings  no colors  no choices  no sun snow or rain    Spoiler and disturbing  A release is when they say that they get to leave to another community but really this happens to baby s and elders  they get killed  The part that really unerved me was when Jonas s dad ends up releasing one of the twins because they can only keep one so the dad puts a needle in its forehead which kills it and then his dad put it in a plastic bag a throws him down the garbage shoot and then says bye bye little guy  This book was really well done and the flow of it was good I would not want to live in this world because i would rater have choices than no war  That s all i have to say thanks for reading    The GiverSeptember 1  2015I read the The Giver by Lowis Lowry last year  and i thought it was a very good book  It was a little hard to get my head around at first  but once i did i was hooked  It is a crazy spin on our world today  i have never read a book with concept like this  The plot was fast paced and unpredictable  Every chapter brought new surprises and new meaning to the chapters before it  The Giver is the type of book that you have to reread some of it to fully understand what its deep meanings are  It was overall a pleasure to read and i recommend it to all teens and adults  Not recommended for young kids because it has some fatalities  and is a complex book  The Giver is a book that holds a very strong meaning  It goes into so many things that we have never thought about before such as  what if there was no emotion  This book was satisfying  but there were some scenes that ripped my heart out  When Jonas s parents refused to tell him if they loved him because it was misusage of language making it an unlegitament question  I wanted to cry  The bond between Jonas and the Giver as well as Jonas and Gabrial really touches your heart in a book explaining a world with no emotion  I would definatly recommend this book to my friends  This book was very enjoyable and I guess my schools were just not on par with others and I never got a chance to read this in high school or junior high Like most people I picked this book up because there was a book coming out and I finished the book literally minutes before I saw the movie so it was very fresh  I enjoyed the take on people being drugged to be happy much like the people of Brave New World by Aldous Huxley  I am also seeing how others writing books now have nearly copied some of the ideas in this book Main CritiqueThe ending was a bit lackluster for me   that was basically all and maybe I am just not refined enough to fully appreciate it but it just seemed like an easy end  I would not have read this book   if my Goodreads friend   Heather had not recommended it   But I am so glad that I did   It s a wonderful book for children as well as adults   I read a few pages of it on Wednesday night and then found it so compelling that I finished in one sitting on Thursday night   It s a small book with less than 200 pages   but holds a profound story of a dystopian community where life seems to be perfect  When 12 year Jonas is selected to be the Receiver of memories  we begin to realize how much is absent in the lives of the people in the community   It is a place devoid of color   pain and love  where lying and euthanasia are the norm   It is through the relationship that develops between Jonas and the Giver  formerly the Receiver   and between Jonas and little Gabe love becomes possible as well as the possibility of change   I was really moved by this story and will read the others on the series  Thanks Hearher  The giver by Lois Lowry is an extraordinary story written for young adults  This is because the language in the book is too difficult for young children to read and the main character is a young adult who deals with similar emotions and conflicts that teenagers do today  The main character is a boy named Jonas  He is a very intelligent student and always follows the rules  other than the small infraction of practicing riding a bike before he receives his own  Jonas fits in very well in his perfect community and doesn t attract any attention  This is until the Ceremony of Twelve  The Ceremony of Twelve is the most important ceremony  it determines what a person s assignment will be in the community  The Ceremony is going smoothly until it is time for Jonas to receive his assignment  He is skipped  But how can that be  In his impeccable community there are almost never mistakes made  especially not by the elders  But of course  there is a reason  Jonas was skipped because he receives a very important assignment  perhaps the most important of them all  The rest of the book is about Jonas s painful training for his assignment and he coming to the realization that maybe his community isn t as perfect as he thought it was  Jonas is a very interesting and introspective character  It s fascinating to see how his view of his community changes as the story progresses  Through Jonas s eyes you are able to make connections from his world to the real world  This is probably one of the many reasons it is known as such a great book  I would recommend this book to anyone who is mature enough to read it  While it is fiction  it is not too out of the box for older people to enjoy  The Giver is very similar to popular young adult books like The Hunger Games and Divergent  They have the same idea of one young adult rebelling from a dystopian society  However  The Giver is different because Jonas starts out thinking that the dystopian society that he lives in is actually a utopian society   Here is my preamble of sorts  I read so widely and voraciously as a child that  despite having a very good memory  there are many books whose contents I have essentially totally forgotten  The Giver is one such book where I remembered nothing  but that it had been an excellent book I thus recently set out to reread it  and wow  I m so grateful I got the experience of reading this book as for the first time twice What a masterpiece of simple  elegant storytelling  The language is beautiful without ever being cumbersome   I loved the freshness of common words slightly twisted for the community this book is primarily set in   sleepingroom  and  newchild   for instance   The world building is so subtle and yet fraught with detail that you can actually imagine a world like this  and experience its departure with Jonas as much as if you had grown up in it Not to mention all the poignant ideas that Lowry treats with such simplicity  depth  and elegance  Those are the three words that most come to mind when I think of this book  its plot  its language  its themes  its characters I don t know how much more I can add  Just  wow  This book is about the community when the giver was young  and his community had a weird rule and languages that community use  Character in this book have 8 character  When Jonas was twelve in ceremony  the Chief Elder was called all people  but skip Jonas and Jonas was asked her about that  You job had been sign  but it not assign to doing this job  because this job is very painful to you memory  That job was Reciver of Memory  Then Jonas went to the training at the house of the old and he started to memories all thing that happen in the community  Th giver will help Jonas to training  Now twin must be one newchild that going to be released from the community  so he watch the video of it and his father kill the baby  then the next released person was Gabriel  Jonas plan to save him he still the food and take Gabriel away  then the weather is change the rain was coming  he want to save Gabriel and he saw the plane that flew over Jonas  Jonas hidden  but He didn t know that was The giver  Then him toward to another community that has color  I have heard of this book many times before  but never bothered to read it  Then I heard it was a dystopia utopia  so I became interested in reading it  since those are the kinds of books I read  Before I could read it though  my language arts teacher assigned us the book in class  She told us to read up to Chapter 6 or farther if we liked  I read till Chapter 17 that night  Seriously  I just stayed up till 12 saying   Oh  just one more chapter  One more wouldn t hurt  I ll close the book after this page     I finished the book the next day and was MIND BLOWN  Read this book if you like dystopian futuristic books for middle schoolers  If you are anything like me  you will fall in love with it and hope people didn t make the movie bad  I remember reading The Giver when I was young  and realize now that it must have been a brand new book at the time  I only remembered snapshots  images that stood out  the fact that it was my favorite book at the time  and little else  It was gratifying to dip back into that world and recover the experience   the act of reading felt akin to receiving a memory from The Giver himself The story is a beautiful allegory for what we sacrifice when we try to control too much  and how an attempt to build a perfect world  in the estimation of some  can destroy the things that make us human  It s also a story about the importance of shared memories  I ve been watching a lot of Twilight Zone episodes recently  and this seems like a perfect companion  I can almost hear Rod Serling introducing Lois Lowry s colorless world The Giver is carefully engineered to be open to interpretation  and I d probably give it a different synopsis every time I d attempt to write one  My interpretation of the ending was rather dour this time   I wonder how it might have resolved in my mind on a different day  or how my 12 year old self saw the conclusion  I wish I could remember  I remember seeing this bearded man book cover many years ago when my friends were reading it in school  I somehow missed the boat and never got around to reading it until now  I was riveted  It s not a hard book to read or understand  It s very simple  maybe even too simple   but the heart is definitely there  It s a tragic and beautiful story that s very acutely told  I think I enjoyed it so much because it really thrilled me to read basically the origin of the dystopian genre  after reading other more recent offerings like The Hunger Games  I think this is a really worthy read and would highly recommend it   Tragic and hopeful all at onceI honestly don t know what to think of this  It was amazing and sad and poignant and just well everything at once  Short but compelling so many questions can arise from this book regarding its message but it s written so it would mean something different to you at many stages throughout your life  Very few books can irrevocably change the way you see the world and this is something beyond even that  It is inexplicably amazing  The humanity displayed here is unparalleled with an ending that is so definite but open to interpretation  I love it  So good it s scary  OMG I loved reading this book at school It was so much fun   This book will always be deep in my heart  I can t put in words how it made me feel  Loved it  The giver is about Jonas a twelve year old who thinks his world is perfect  but after he becomes the new Receiver of memories  His world will change  Jonas finds out in the ceremony that he is the new Receiver  After a while Jonas finds out about love  pain  and happiness  He wants to change his world  he wants his society to know about these things  To experience love to see a  unperfected  world  what risk will Jonas take to make this happen  I loved all the book it is so descriptive  It makes you think of a lot of things  The book is perfect  This why I loved this book so much  I recommend this book to people who like a book will really descriptive language and a story wit ha lot of feelings  to people who will never get tired of such an inspiring story  I immediately fell in love with this book  I had heard many good things about it  so after my mission I put it at the top of my to read list  The book has certainly earned the positive praise  The characters are well developed  the plot is interesting and captivating  and the setting is so well portrayed  In the novel  Jonas  the main character  has just reached the status of age twelve  As a twelve  he will be receiving his job throughout the rest of his life  In the civilization that he lives in  at age twelve you begin training in the field you  belong  in  as decided by a special committee that study the children until this special age  When Jonas gets his assignment  his life becomes new and exciting  but not always in the best of ways  He is taken on a journey of questioning his entire life and community It is a wonderful and engaging story  I have continued on to read the next two in the series  I have not had time for the final book yet  and must warn any readers that the second is not immediately connected to the first book  It takes a completely different story path with all new characters  In the third book though  the first and second are connected and it all makes sense  They are all very good books  but it is important to know that the first and second feel very different and unrelated which puts a lot of people off  I really enjoyed the unique way of looking at the world in this book  Actually I hardly stop reading when I started reading it  This story was a kind of SF  the stage was another world in the future  Main character was a boy  his name was Jonas  He lived with his family unit  father  mother and younger sister Lily and he also had classmates  Asher and Fiona  Later Gabriel became one of member of his family unit  However  his community was an ideal city  There were no rain  no snow  no sunshine  no pain and no love  People encouraged speak precise and allow commune rules  People could not understand love of family and do not know any color  When Jonas became 12 years old  he was singled to be a next Receiver of Memory At first time he felt it was really honor  but after he met the Giver who give him memories of whole world and he knew the history and truth of the community  his mind was changing   It was great to finally read it   specially that it seems like every American reader have read it mostly for school assignment and here in Poland I haven t heard anything about it before    And yes my main motivation was reading the book before I see the movie   oh well  I can see how it s really a classic   I noticed so many details that where used in new dystopian books mostly for teens   I mean they had to have their beginning in Giver  kind of  It was also super interesting to think about how younger kids would react to that as I m not that young anymore heh  secretly planning to make my niece to read it muhaha  I got the feeling that for young reader s mind whole story could be kinda harsh idk  Me myself  sometime I had to step back and be like WHOA that s slowly fucking up my mind heh But after all it was of course amazing read thou this     not explained end is bothering me   my logical mind needs real end and explanation for it all OKAY  UPDATE   few days ago in my extra history class we watched a documentary about how leadership of Hitler became like a religion for people in that time in Germany and just those who supported him  Also we had discussion about communism and marxism and what it s leading to  And whole this time THE GIVER was popping out in my mind  it lead to a point where i was just opening my mouthc and all my friends were like  yeah yeah the giver we get that just borrow us the damn book and stop    so yeah   very interesting book making me think about our society  our values and the dreams and hopes of myself  jonas  the main character is realistic  sweet  curious  strong and a child at the same time  he suffers under a burden his community has lain upon him and the more knowledge he gets  the more he learns about other cultures or societies  the more he starts to question his own background    loved the book and read it in one night I luv this book            It is amzing and as i said 6 chaps  ago it gets more interesting   egde of ur seat as u turn the page    I luv this book It is clearly one of the best books ive read   thats saying something                       I read this book again for the second time after many years  I must admit the movie release sparked my interest and it has been on my real book shelf for as long as I can remember  I loved all of the changes made in the movie  The difference of transfer of memory  the age change of Lily and Jonas  his enhanced relationship with Fiona  and the more direct ending including the barrier  Even simple things like the difference of jobs designated to Fiona and Asher  I still loved this book  but I was surprised at how for once the movie made the book better    that never happens  This is an amazing creative storyline that really lets your imagination fill in the blanks  I felt it was incredibly easy to read  I can t decide if this is a good or bad thing  I have two young toddlers and finished this book in 2 days which is nice  but I also wish the book would have been more  I have yet to read the 3 books following  so maybe those books will provide me with more  Love this book and the real life evaluation of how sameness would be a world not worth living in  The Giver is a dystopian novel about our world after the fall of humanity  The main character is Jonas  Jonas is waiting to receive his assignment or his job in society  He is deemed the Giver and is told that it is a tremendous honor  If the assignment is so honorable then why is it such a burden  Jonas lived happily in his world before becoming the Giver  Now he knows secrets  inside things and memories  He knows that his world is not as perfect as it seems  He has a choice  he can stay or run  This book is about enlightenment  It is about now knowing when you were previously ignorant  Sometimes we ask questions but I am not sure we really want to know what happens  Jonas learns this lesson very quickly  The problem with knowing is that you can t go back  Lowry does a good job at showing the struggle in Jonas  This book set the stage for our other wildly popular dystopian novels that are famous such as Matched and Hunger Games  It is a good read for adolescents however if the children are too young they may not fully understand what is actually happening in society  This book requires students to be abstract thinkers or perhaps it can help create abstract thought   In a post apocalyptic world  everything is geared towards sameness and decisions are made for everyone  From the children parents  receive  to the names they are given  to the jobs they will hold  Til when they are  realeased   Only Jonas is special  He is to be the new  Receiver  of memories  He will hold all the pain of the past for the community  The Giver is the current receiveer who passes all these memories to him  Only this time  they decide it is time for the community to learn pain and to change  So Jonas will seek a new future for himself This was a fantastic book  Jonas  experiences and thoughts are believeable and I was sucked into the story enjoying it all  And not to mention   thinking about it a lot  Look forward to the next in the series   I read this book and I thought it was really good  I liked how he tried to help everyone realize what they were missing and all  and the part where the baby was about to die because of the cold made me really sad and I felt bad for the baby and him  It must have been very hard for him to realize that there was nothing he could do to keep that baby safe or from harm or even alive  In total  i liked this book a lot and I thought it was very interesting  and made you think about life and everyone s values   This book is dystopian literature at it s best  Although it is a young adult novel and brief in length  the author set detailed characters in an emotional setting that made it well worth the read   kindleI finished this book wondering what my impression of it might have been if I d read it in middle school  I know my daughter read it more than once at middle school age and encouraged me to read it recently  I think she plans a re read and I wonder if as a young woman in her twenties  although without children  if she will have a different impression of it  I was very struck by the discouragement of any attachment or real emotion in the society drawn there  Babies aren t raised with their mothers  families are not kept together for lifetimes and the joys and sorrows of life and death are kept away from people  The one real example of how babies attach showed clearly that the person who reached out and acted in a loving way toward that baby also felt attached and once shown the  memories  and realizes he has a choice  he gives up everything for himself and to save the baby in the hopes he finds a world with warmth and love  I ve thought a lot about this lately in regards to babies  and I have lots I could say about it   Babies these days are forced to be in day care and away from their primary attachment  their moms  People say it s a different world  Maybe it is  but babies are coming into this world pretty much with the same needs they had 2 000 years ago  It is not their fault that we have created an economy and society that doesn t value their needs as much as they do production and things  I ve had conversations with people recently  mothers among them  and am surprised and saddened that people really believe that it is better for babies to endure the stress of separation  or that young people should be earning in their prime earning years  not nurturing   I remember reading this book as a child over and over again  I had forgotten about it for years  until I recently rediscovered it here on Goodreads and knew that I would have to get it The story is about Jonas who lives in a world of the future where everyone is the same and nobody is ever rude  Strict rules guide the community and everybody is happy   until the day that Jonas is selected to become the Receiver Over the past ten years  I have forgotten many of the details that come up in the book  the bicycles  for example   Some came back to me  others I never remembered so even though I ve read the book already  the turns still managed to surprise me This was my first dystopia book ever and I love how easy it is to read  It took me half a day to get through it  and I was doing lots of things on the side  It is an enjoyable read that makes the reader think about the world they live in  the liberty of choices and what it means to be an individual  Sometimes  Lowry is a bit too obvious in her message  I hate books that try to lecture me  yet  I don t mind in this one What I found very interesting was the ending and how differently I interpreted it now in comparison to when I was younger  Even now  more than ten years after I read The Giver for the first time  I still love it   BEST BOOK EVER  In Lois Lowry s masterpiece  the world has adapted to a stage of Sameness  a dull existence that leaves the world gray  without flavor and without emotion  Only one man holds the memories  the joys and the pains of a world long forgotten  and he has chosen one to give the gift of remembering   Like I said  I loved this book  This tapped into the human nature in a way that is rarely seen in literature  It taught me the importance of accepting the bad with the good  with confronting the honesty of the world but learning how to bear its burden with a hope of a better tomorrow  Seriously  Can t say enough good things about this book  Content Warning  ViolenceSexual Reference This book is really good  Lois Lowry writes it really well  It captured me since the beginning to end  Guaranteed to be a good read  and don t forget to read the sequel and triquel    Lois Lowry s book The Giver was an impeccable piece  I read this book during my Sixth grade year  Of course as part of the sixth grade reading list of that year I was forced to read it  but it was no disappointment  My classmates and I would always want to read on and were constantly conversing over the way the society was run and always making predictions on what would happen next  The Giver is a must read book child student or adult  As a student I recommend an age of at least 10 or older considering that students will only enjoy the book if they understand it  I have one thing to say thank you my wonderful teacher for making us read this book   This was a student entering 7th grade opinion by the way  I gave  The Giver  a five out of five because it was a remarkable storyline with a theme of receiving the truth creates a better life  I m not a big fan of futuristic books so was was surprised by  The Giver   After Jonas became the Receiver of Memory  I began to wonder how much the community was hiding  I was appalled by the fact that releasing means to kill  I thought it meant at first  to go to a different community until you died naturally  Jonas didn t seem like an average boy  He wasn t so intense or rude  His personality was kind of like a girl s no offense Jonas   If a random boy nowadays wouldn t care about Gabriel so much to take him with him  For a boy  Jonas had a pretty unique personality  But at the end  Jonas proves himself courageous  brave and caring  I wonder  if anyone were to be put in that situation  if another side of them would come out  When Gabe first came to stay at Jonas s house  Jonas wasn t really into him  Did finding out that release meant to kill change his mind  The council gave the Receiver of Memory to Jonas because he was seen as courageous and brave  When did they see him possess these qualities  Jonas didn t have any idea of what assignment he would be given to him  Did he not know about the Receiver of Memory task  There is nothing much to say about Lily except that she is your average seven year old eight  I should say   Jonas seemed to be peculiarly unbothered by Lily  which is strange to me  The end of the story is a bit of a cliffhanger  so I find myself wondering what became of Lily and her parents  What assignment was Lily given  How did she react to having the flood of memories nearly drown her and the community  I also wonder if Lily had known that release meant to kill  would she react the same way as Jonas  I also wonder if any of the community had known that release meant to kill  would they react differently  Jonas s parents were pretty calm most of the story and didn t stand out in a way that caught my attention  Except that the father was kind of weird being all affectionate towards Gabriel  Obviously the father knew about releasing  but did the mom know  Asher was a more typical teenage boy  Overall  this book was amazing and I recommend this book to any elementary or middle school student who loves to read  The Giver by Lois Lowry is a classic and has been brought back to life by the making of the recent movie  I recently watched the movie and was inspired to read the book afterwards The book tells the story of a dystopian society  In this world every citizen is a given a parent  a job  and necessarily a role  A boy named Jonas is given a job  a very special job  He must learn the memories of the world  A job that is both blessed  and cursed  The Giver is a a page turning thriller that leaves you more curious page by page  Lowry has many intriguing themes that a reader will contemplate many years after reading the book  5 5 stars  Recommended for 9th grade as some themes are quite deep   I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and would recommend it to just about anyone  Lois Lowry brilliantly presents some very complex ideas in a very simple way through her novel The Giver  I think this author nailed it with the style in which she wrote this story  The chapters are short and easy to read  and I appreciate that simplicity because it leaves room for readers to truly think about what they are reading and the concepts being brought forward throughout the plot  This book is labeled as Young Adult Literature  I ve found that I appreciated the subject matter much more reading as an adult than I ever did as a fifth grader  This story got me thinking about many huge ideas that I completely missed the first time I had read it  As an adult whose opinions have matured as I have  I connected with the idea of questioning authority as Jonas does in The Community much more than I had the first time around  Additionally  and more importantly  I began reflecting on the differences between living and simply existing  What makes us human  Are Jonas and the other members of the Community truly experiencing life  These are concepts that are too complex for the average sixth or seventh grader to attempt to tackle because of their limited life experiences  So while I love this book  I think it would be hard to incorporate into a middle school classroom  If I did  I would be absolutely certain to spend less time focusing on the book itself and more time focusing on the big ideas Lowry is provoking readers to think about  While some topics may be hard to grasp for younger audiences  the idea of being true to oneself no matter what is one that would be beneficial to a middle school age group  I have a feeling I will be revisiting this book soon so that I may have another chance to gain even more as my life experience and my memories shape who I am as a person  I loved it when I was a child  and I love it now  The Giver is a great dystopian book  This book was assigned by my school for my summer reading when I was in seventh grade  and I was hooked to the story even though I never liked reading back then  Rereading The Giver  I felt the same way  At first  I must admit that it was kind of slow for me because I had already read the book  and it was just the introduction to the story  which I had remembered what it was about  but after Jonas was given his task at the Ceremony of Twelve  I hooked to the story again  I didn t put the book down until the end  I even cried on some parts  and I love the relationship between Jonas and the Giver  which was something that they can share only between themselves I wished that the book could be longer on some parts  because I wanted the relationship between Jonas and the Giver to prolong  I wanted to see what more can Jonas receive from the Giver  Overall  this was a really great book even though it was for children  Amazing  thought provoking story that will linger in my thoughts for a long time  This book paints a daunting picture of how unsettling it can be when a society strives to make everything perfect and constant  There s a lot to think about when it comes to this book and to say it comfortably resides within the dystopic genre is an understatement  The Giver by Lois Lowry is a gem in its own right  but at the same time the themes presented here are the sort of Pleasantville I would hope can never be achieved This story takes place sometime in the undetermined future when climate changes and unpredictable weather created a perception that Sameness was needed to achieve order  Things like hippos  elephants  birds  etc  are regarded as imaginary animals and the presence of love  colors and history are hidden from society  In this story  people have lost the ability of choice  Everything is decided for them from their mate  family unit  job  even down to the loss of ability to experience a Stirring  I won t dive into that one because it gave me the creeps  By eliminating the option to choose  people can avoid making mistakes  but that perceived value is challenged when Jonas is singled out to receive the memories of true emotion and the pleasures of life  He goes on a quest to seek the truth and a course of events begin to unfold that threaten the balance of constancy this society has worked so hard to achieve As I was reading  my purchase receipt slipped out of the book  and I noticed I bought this book back in January 2009  Thanks Flannery for making me dust of this book and give it the attention it deserves  Great choice  Now can I have a YA contemporary  LOL    My Summary The community where Jonas lives is systematic  Everyone is assigned jobs  Everyone is assigned spouses  Everyone is assigned one female and male as their children   in other words you are given no choices  You obey their rules  You can t ask questions  As a result  they live in a world without conflict  inequality  injustice  unemployment  Sameness is their motto  Sounds perfect right  Wrong Every year they celebrate the Ceremony of Ages from One to Twelve  Twelve being the most important because they are given their predetermined life assignment based on the observations of the Elders in their community  Jonas  not knowing what his life assignment will be  gets  selected  for a special job which he didn t expect Training with an old man named The Giver  he begins to unravel the things that were and the things that could be  Living in a world without feelings and finally knowing what feelings are  he can no longer live in a world without it  But when he is given the choice to stay or flee  will he be ready to leave behind the life that he has always known or would he stay in a life of sameness and conformity My Thoughts  First off  I ve read this book a few years back and a few months back and yet again so in total this has been my third time to read it  What s wonderful about rereading books is that you get to relate it to the circumstances you are in at that certain point in your life  You interpret it differently every time  But no matter how many times I read this  what hasn t change is how much I love this book  One of my all time favorite Dystopian books  Just the thought of a place where all the choices are made for you doesn t sound fun to me at all  I cherish choices whether it be good or bad because that is how I learn but if you really think about a world where choices are made for you there could be positive outputs  One being that you can t go wrong and if you did you could blame the people who did the choosing for you which is what most of us do anyway   With sameness  there won t be jealousy which leads to a lot of bad things  Also  the stress of dating   trying to find  the one  and looking for a career would be gone but the negative side of this is lack of emotions  Everything they do feels very robotic  I can t imagine living in a world without emotions  It is what makes me feel human  Pain  anger  loss are all emotions I don t like feeling but without it you wont feel the greatest emotions like happiness  strength and love  No matter how good this community sounds  the negative surpasses the positives any day Jonas is such a character  Being trained by the Giver  he learns wisdom  Being a Twelve and having the courage to stand up to what he thinks is right is one of the characteristics I love most about him  The moment he wants to share all he knows to his family and friends makes you feel his want for change so bad  He wants them to feel everything he is feeling The world that Ms  Lois wrote makes you want to keep reading  It s always exciting when we think of a world that could be  perfect  yet their is this loop hole that comes along   we all love a good rebellion  This book is filled with so much knowledge  You will be able to know the pros and cons of a world like this I love how her writing is crisp and she doesn t sugar coat anything  The book is short yet all the information you need and want to know is there  Nothing is boring  You will instantly get hooked once you start  The ending kept me wanting to read about Jonas more even though it was a perfect ending  Definitely  a great read  The Giver is becoming a movie soon too  I can t wait for that  Happy reading   Okay  I remember reading this book in 5th grade and I LOVED it so i figured I d go back and check it out  And i must say  i loved it then but now that i am older and can understand it better it was 10 times more enjoyable to read  It really makes you appreciate individuality in every way  Very interesting book   Nemam slov  To bylo proste    wow  Jonas is getting ready for his 12th birthday and he is waiting to get his job  But then he gets the job of the giver and has to hold the pain of all the people  No one knows of pain  color  or war  The giver has to have the job of keeping everyone safe  The Giver was one of those books that I ended up giving a five star rating without even needing to think about it  Here s a one sentence literature History lesson  The Giver was first published in 1993  This book was written more than ten years ago and what I found really interesting was that it s still relevant more than ten years later  While The Giver  might not be one of the first dystopian books that were ever written  it s much more original and refreshing compared to most of the modern dystopian books that I ve read Like most dystopian novels  The Giver focuses on the perfect Utopian society  I couldn t help but compare it to  Matched  even although The Giver was written a long time before  Matched  was  With both novels  I couldn t help but have a sense that there was something creepy and dreadful beyond the perfect surface  So  I m going to become a horrible person whose compares two books of a similar genre     The Giver and  Matched  are similar in nature  but I will try to keep these comparisons as subtle as possible  In the Matched series  I felt as though the passive action  the internal or introspective action  wasn t enough and I kept on itching for something more to happen  In The Giver  everything that takes place is introspective  meaning that is takes place within the main character  Jonas  This meant plenty of character development as Jonas starts his training as the Receiver of Memory  And I love awesome character development  The only time that there was external action in the book was towards the end  and even that external action wasn t about action at all  I love action books and books without any action  bore me to death  but Lowry is a genius  There was something about The Giver that was so interesting and gripping that I couldn t stop turning the pages  In my head  I knew that nothing much was happening in the world that Jonas lived in  but I didn t care The Giver had strong world building  great character development and was a surprisingly gripping passive action novel  Definitely  one of my favourites  In the community in the book The Giver there are suppose to be no emotions but  that s not the case  The only one who can feel emotions is the Giver  Jonas the new receiver finds out what an emotion really is  Jonas goes on a life changing adventure and experiences what life really is In the book there is a receiver and a giver  the receiver receives from the giver  The main character Jonas is chosen as the receiver  he keeps all the memories of the past  If the memories are ever lost there would be chaos in the community because they would receive the memories  Do you think Jonas can keep the memories Jonas living in the community is now the most respected person  Even more than the chief of Elders  The Chief of Elders are the people who run the community they tell everyone what to do and how to do it  They make sure no one can see colors  have emotions and  they make sure they all live the same  Since Jonas is the receiver he has to feel emotion which hurts him but sometimes turns out to be a good thing The Giver is a stupendous book  I would recommend it to everyone  I would give this realistic future book 5 stars  Jonas is a member of a unique community that requires its members to live under a strict way of life  Jonas is assigned a position known as the  receiver   and his task requires him to receive memories of the past that have been kept from the knowledge of the community with hopes of protecting and creating a utopian society  Jonas finds a conflict in keeping this knowledge from people he loves since he finds the joy of so many things that have been kept from the others  Consequently  he rebels against the system and faces further conflict between what he believes to be right and what he has been taught is wrong This is one of my most favorite books  I also really enjoyed the movie and would suggest that it is quite similar to the theme of the book  It teaches its audience to never be satisfied with what government or corrupt leadership might feed to them  but to look beyond the mark for truth  even at the risks that come with rebellion  There is a disturbing scene that describes the murder and disposal of a baby  Other than that  I am not concerned with any censorship issues  Okay  This book  This less than 200 pages long book  It s driving me mad I started this book without actually knowing the synopsis  and I loved how I wasn t confused or anything  It started off smoothly  and it took you along carefully The story is great  it was terrifying  The fact that I could actually foresee this happening to us in the future  it s just horrifying  What hurt even more is the  release  part  I was shocked  hurt and scared  And I was also extremely shocked at how much it shocked me I appreciate how you get to choose how you want the ending to be  But I also absolutely hate it  Of course I want to think it ends happily  then again  who am I kidding  My only complaint is that it s short  I want more  I need more  I want to know what happened  I NEED to know what happened  I love this book  It s incredibly fast paced  I can definitely see myself rereading it and actually analysing it  And I most definitely am going to read more Lois Lowry  I HOPE THE MOVIE DOES IT JUSTICE                        Hi  okay  It s Day 2   since I ve finished it  And   The more I think about  the more depressing I realise it actually is  I don t know why I keep thinking and overthinking about this darn book  My mind s been flooded with doubts  Perhaps it s because I actually believe that at some point  this might actually happen Ugh  this is why I don t read realistic fiction  But for some undiscovered reason   I m glad I did   Powerful  moving  with an unexpected ending  this book was a bittersweet experience for me  I whole heartedly recommend it to all   This book is amazing  I somehow missed reading this in middle school  so when someone told me it was a must read dystopia novel  I had to buy it  I am always on the lookout for good books that I can read to my son when he is old enough  saving the Harry Potter series for that    This book was beautiful in its simplistic and powerful depiction of a dystopian setting  the  community   The way the author holds back on information creates suspense and intrigue  The Giver  as well as the Jonas  are characters with great depth for such a short story and I love the enlightening process that happens through their relationship  There were so many moments that sent chills through me  for various reasons  I agree that this is definitely a must read for adults and children who like to think and question   I have finished the book   1CThe life where nothing was ever unexpected  Or inconvenient  Or unusual  The life without colour  pain or past  1D These words encompass the reality of the world in which Jonas  the protagonist of  The Giver  has grown up in  After walking past this distinguished piece of literature that has sat atop my bookshelf for many years  I finally decided to read it   The Giver  is a short  captivating dystopian tale that forces its readers to think beyond the world to which they are accustomed  This book reminded me of the pleasure that comes with being completely immersed in a story and the magic quality that books possess  Looking at this thin book after reading it  I am bewildered by the fact that just a few hours ago  as I was curled up with this book  the words on its pages transported me in to a completely different world  Jonas lives in a futuristic society  in which each citizen is assigned a job  a spouse  and children  Everything in the lives of the people in his community is conveniently planned  For example  people s clothes are chosen to be appropriate on their ages and needs  Also  parents are selected to match their children s character and in order to get married  a person must be assigned their most compatible partner in their society  For Jonas  what worries him most is that each person is assigned a career that is chosen based on their intellectual strengths and personal interests because he is apprehensive about what job he will be assigned  There is no crime  no war and at a first glance  his world seems like a utopia  However  Jonas finds out the truth about his society  As he learns more about himself and the truth about his community  he understands how his world is more of a dystopia  Lowry creates a vivid world that is shocking and impacting  It stays in your mind and makes you think and compare it to the other worlds of dystopian novels  My brother was assigned to read this book in Middle School and after a few years  I thought I was too old for this  children s  book  Yet  after reading it  I can say that this blind label is completely inaccurate  This book requires emotional maturity and can be an enjoyable read for people of all ages  Many times in my life I have wished for a world of peace and happiness such as the one that Jonas lives in  However  this book has made me realize that without feeling the depths of sadness  we would never know happiness   The Giver  is simultaneously deeply disturbing and stunningly beautiful  This book definitely made me think about my own world and the balance between good and bad in our lives  The world Jonas lives is the result of many sacrifices in order to ensure a Utopia  Ultimately  they  gained control of many things  But had to let go of others  1D Overall  I truly enjoyed every bit of this book and am considering reading it again  Lately  I had been questioning my love of reading because I had not been completely hooked by any story  I definitely recommend this book to anyone who is interested in dystopian utopian fiction or who wants a shorter novel that will still have a fantastic story to tell  This book definitely deserved a Newberry Medal and I am shocked that I had not read this book until now   A must read  especially the whole series  Really good book  O Doretes einai ena kataplektiko  allegoriko biblio

school up until 12 and gets a job called the receiver which receives the memories of the real world  He works with the man called the giver which gives him the memories of the real world which the towns people don t know  They work out a plan to try to escape to the real world  Will he escape I really like this book because it s a unusual book  It s not like the way we live now it s like a parallel universe  It never really could happen  but is a crazy thing to think about I would put this book in the category of more outside of the box thinker s  or complex  or complex readers  Probably most teens would like to read this book  Excellent  My elder is reading  Clockwork Orange  However different these to books are  and they are VERY different   the theme is the same   which ias better  to be happy  but without free will and choice  or with free will and choice  but the possibility of pain and mistake  The Giver will always be my favorite book  It was the only book I liked when I was in middle school   I wasn t a big reader  Been my favorite since 2005  I never got the chance to read this book in school  and I wish I had so I could see what I may have thought about it when I was younger  I picked it up because someone at an art blog I read is illustrating a scene from each chapter  and the more he described the more curious I became about the story  I didn t want the whole thing to be spoiled so I went and bought the book and read it Since it was written for pre teens the book itself is small and thin  but in that little thing was a really riveting story  I couldn t put it down and sat up half the night finishing it when I meant only to read like a few chapters  I m a sucker for  coming of age  stories as it is  and this one is pretty much a literal coming of age story  The world the protagonist is in is efficiently and adequately described over the course of the story without feeling like an info dump  All the characters are appealing  especially Jonas the protagonist  I hope  if I ever have kids someday  they get the chance to read this at the age of the main characters inside  In the book The Giver by Lois Lowry  Jonas is about to turn twelve  and everyone in the community knows what happens when you turn twelve  You get your assignment Life in the community is simple  Go to school  go to work  eat sleep  repeat  But at the Ceremony of Twelve something s not right  When the Twelves are getting their assignments Jonas is singled out to receive a very special assignment  He has to become the new Receiver  Jonas begins his training and realizes how corrupt the community is  He decides to fix it  In this short novel Jonas must return what once belonged to the people  and It won t be easy This epic novel will keep you at the edge of your seat  and take you for a ride  Continue reading the series  Gathering Blue  and The Messenger for an even more mind blowing experience  oooooooh no   i still want more      first of all   if i can back in time   and change somthing i think i will take this book with me and gift it to my 12 year old self   and i believe she will love this book even more and it might be her favorite of all   i enjoy every single page and i loved eveything about it   even thought there wasn t lot of things happening   no Action or mystery or anything but there something kept me read   i cared about the world   the characters   i wanted to know everything going   that is somthing i missed when i was reading series like   Divergent   or   Delirium     i liked there worlds but i didn t feel like i care so much about what going   or why they need to change there worlds   but here   i did care i wanted Jonas to do something to share memories with all the people   but things that i didn t like about the story   it s how the end comes without letting us knowing what happen to Jonas  s family   or his friends   because i loved them   i wished if there was more chapters with them   or more things like they run with Jonas   i still want to know what happen after the end   but i guess i have to use my Imagination now and think of what happen      before the finish this   i really loved this line    Memories need to be shared     Original Review  One of my favorite books of all time  and one that means just as much to me as an adult as it did to me as a 10 year old August 6  2012  After feeling bogged down with a lot of recent academic reading  I needed to revisit a simple book I loved and could read for pure pleasure  But  simple  isn t an accurate description of this book  which still stands as probably my favorite book  and definitely the one that has moved me the most  The Giver deals with many things  not least of which being the power and significance of choice  But on this read through  I was struck especially by how much it deals with sacrifice  Not just personal sacrifice  but communal sacrifice as well  and how the decisions we make often reach farther than we can imagine   I m not sure 4th grade Joie was capable of considering this particular theme   It s just a beautiful  solemn story  and I look forward to seeing the other stories Lois Lowry later crafted within this universe  It was amazing  Everyone go read it now   It s impossible to imagine life without love   happiness   colors   sudden events even sadness and mistakes   Jonas s world is perfect and citizens know nothing about difficulties and true of life   It s very first time i felt grateful toward my sentimental heart   I was glad because i can feel all these wonderful things   Extraordinary book   I looooooved The Giver  It was a very fast read  It was really interesting I really can t wait to read the second book in the quartet  I really liked the characters especially of course the main character Jonas and the reasons why I liked him are because 1 He understood the things society was doing to them and 2 He wasn t blinded like the rest of his family  I really enjoyed the scenes with The Giver because he as well understood the concepts of feelings  happiness  love  etc  I really liked the twists and turns  spoilers ahead  Like Rosemary being The Giver s daughter I wasn t expecting that at all  I also can t wait to read the second book because I want to know more about what happened with Gabriel and Jonas also what did The Giver do  Overall I loooved this book 5 5 stars  but I have a feeling that I am going to hate the movie  3 Genre  Science fiction     Reading level  Age 10 Dystopia is an imagined place or state where everything is unpleasant or bad  Twelve year old Jonas doesn t realize that his world is bad  He is happy with the strict guidelines for behavior  the rigid daily schedule  and the concept of  Elsewhere  for those who no longer fit in  When Jonas is given the great honor of becoming the new receiver of memories  he begins his training unaware of the knowledge and wisdom he is about to receive  The Giver shares with Jonas his store of thoughts from the world before the  sameness  became the norm  Jonas s complacency is shattered as he begins to experience pain  loss  and hunger for the first time  Feelings of love  warmth  and family give him hope that his world can be saved by his sharing of these memories  This novel  winner of several awards and a prestigious position on the Banned Books list  is an excellent introduction for the older child to a discussion of metaphors and symbolism  The unusual family life and decision making process will give the reader an opportunity to consider how his or her life compares to this safe and structured world Other books on the subject of Dystopias Among the hidden  Margaret HaddoxOff the road  Nina BawdenThe white mountains  John Christopher The Giver came to my attention around the same time I started reading Matched  It was first mentioned due to the  then  upcoming film and again when I started reading reviews of pointing out how similar the worlds are  After my disappointment with Matched  I was quite keen to read a dystopian book that had been received well  This book is quite short and is a very easy read  it is technically considered children s after all  It works very nicely on a five hour train journey Jonas  world is perfect  everything is under control and everybody can go about their daily lives without fear  pain  hunger or those pesky things called decisions  How is this possible  Their emotions have been taken away from them  To continue the population certain people are chosen to be mothers  Those children are then raised by Nurturers until they are assigned a family  In December of the next eleven years  that child will  along with everybody else  celebrate another year of life  With each year comes new responsibilities  Jonas is about to turn twelve  the most special year of all  This is the year he will be given his assignment  But when that day comes  Jonas is singled out and told that he will become the communities new Receiver of Memories  That s when Jonas begins to learn the truth about this supposed utopia Read the full review here   The Giver  by Lois Lowry is about Jonas who lives in a perfect community and gets chosen for Receiver of Memory at the age of twelve  Throughout the story Jonas expierences memories  that make him question his perfect community  I think this book was full of suspense and mystery  It made me question if our community would be better with Sameness  The ending was kind of a twist that really shocked me  Can t believe I waited so long to read this  I think I finished it in about two hours so it s a very quick read but it had me hooked from the very beginning  Jonas lives in a community where everyone is the same  All members of the community wear the same clothes  have their hair the same way according to age and do everything according to a strict set of rules  Each member of the community is assigned an occupation when they reach the age of 12 and during his Ceremony of Twelve  Jonas is assigned to be the new Giver  The Giver holds the memories and emotions of the entire community and is therefore a very honored position  But Jonas finds out that everything is not as perfect as he has grown up believing as the Giver shares all the memories with him  Because I feel like individuality is one of the most important things to protect  I was suspicious from the very first chapter but I had no idea how crazy it was going to get  I will admit that I never thought that precision of language could become that twisted   P I loved that Lowry shows you the cost of choices and really makes you question whether what they give up is worth what they receive  With the dystopian genre being all the rage  this should be at the top of the list  It s definitely one of my favorites now  I read this book in one sitting and oh gosh I can t even begin to process that it ended Okay  First of all I would like to thank one of my bookworm friends  Joseph  for encouraging me to read this book  Thank you  Since most of you know there is a movie coming out  in some countries it s already out    I just really wanted to read it before I go and watch the movie  Thoughts This book is the mother of Divergent and The Host  Fans of the said books will definitely feel that deja vu vibe while reading it  But as you descend deeper into it  The Giver will take the name of it s own  Before watching the movie I just can t  The trailers and the posters are just so freaking cool  The guy they cast as Jonas is Brenton Thwaites  Evidently  the guy is very good looking  I just wish they made him him look younger because Jonas was supposed to be just 12 years old  This is what he should ve looked likeBut in the movie he looks like this  Just kidding  He looks like this Hot hot hot in every way  So yeah I m still happy about the casting cause other than Brenton  they also included Jeff Bridges Meryl Streep  Taylor Swift and many more  So yeah  I can t wait to see the film      UPDATED 082913    AFTER THE FREAKING MOVIE The movie was so cool guise   I don t know what word to describe it so yeah  I used  cool   Gosh  Visually  it was fantastic  The setting was beautiful  I didn t know the Community can be that beautiful in black n  white   in color  There are some parts that changed  DUH  but for me  it gave justice to the book  Brenton was so good  He s definitely in line as one of the amazing leading man for book to movie adaptations  Bravo Phillip Noyce But first    10 5 stars  The Giver really had me on the edge of my seat  Thank God I live in this world with it s beautiful colors  Loved this book and can t wait to read the next ones  A fascinating commentary on the importance of personal freedom  even with its flaws  Whoa whoa whoa  I need more  What just happened  It was beautiful  I felt this spiritual parallel to Christ Throughout the story  I didn t realize this was a series when I finished it  I ll be checking out the next one for sure  Ok  now that a few days have passed and I ve stewed over this    yep    I still love it  I ve had this book for a very long time on my shelf  I picked it up because it won The Newbery Medal  which is a pretty high honor and must mean than it caught some good attention from some higher ups  But I never wanted to open it  The cover had this old bearded dude on it  I really didn t think I would ever get into it  I thought Lois was a guy  I guess I m sexist  I like the lady writers      This book just shows me how I need to stop judging books by their covers because even though I pictured the Giver as Michael Gambon the whole time  Dumbledore   he was my perfect fit  I was pulled in from the burdens he and his apprentice had to carry so that others could live a better  well  more care free life  They were in charge of holding on to all the memories that the world had ever experienced  Somehow  in this utopian society  things that caused pain were taken out but one member had to carry on the memories for the future  Beautiful  I can t wait to continue on though I m sure it is from another perspective  Well done   The Giver is one of my favorite books by far  It is a futuristic novel published by Louis Lowry in 1993 and won the Newberry Medal  This book is recommended for kids in middle school around the U S  This book is based on a kid  named Jonas  who lives in a utopian society where no one feels love or sees color  In the ceremony of twelve  Jonas is selected to be the new Receiver of Memory  who keeps all the memories and bares the pain they bring  He and the Giver  the past Receiver of Memory  make a plan to change their society  My favorite part of this novel is when Jonas gets skipped in the ceremony of twelve because it makes you nervous and you re telling yourself   What s going to happen next  or   What s going on   I give this book 5 stars and recommend it to people who like reading books with utopian societies  for example  the  Hunger Games  or  Divergent   i read this in high school in which i was forced to read at first  then i just got really into it and i wanted to know what happened next  The Giver by Lois Lowry is one of the more incredible science fiction books I have come across  Jona lives in what is assumed to be the perfect world  your family  profession  and future is decided for you at a young age  The world is removed of race  violence and hate  but the downside of the that is the absence of love  memory  and color  Jonas becomes the Giver  who is responsible for the world s history and past  when he comes to know about music  color and history  he also learns about pain and violence  He struggles with whether or not the world should have the good with the bad  and how to be the Giver Though this is not a picture book  I would recommend it for new readers who are immersing themselves in chapter books  I remember reading this myself as a young reader  and it s a wonderful  magical story for any age  One of the most interesting parts of the book is the questions that it poses to the reader  is a world of black and white better than one of color  Should humans have the right to learn about history and have the right to choose love over hate  Is a world without love better than a world without violence  Talking about these things as with a young reader encourages them to contemplate the good and the bad of our world  Jonas is a young boy who is easy to relate to in his curiosity and passion  Young readers will understand his struggle with his gift of being the Giver  and what it means to have the responsibility of the world on his shoulders  I would recommend this book to any reader  I loved this book  Had been hearing a buzz about it for a few years but just got around to reading it  Reading it got me to thinking how I would like living in a utopian world  The answer     not at all Jonas has been selected to be the next  Giver   Being the Giver is a great responsibility and Jonas trains for it with the current Giver  But as time progresses  he finds out things about his community that are not in line with what Jonas and others have been led to believe  His torment  Can he go through with being the next in charge knowing what he knows about the unfair treatment  murders and inequalities that his community live with  Great book for a young reader  Or  like me  the young at heart   Will there be more of a resolution in the sequels  They re different stories though so I m doubtful I have read a couple of dystopian novels  but this one was certainly unique  And it was written years before the outbreak of YA dystopians  And it s unlike the ones today that speak of revolution or violence  I could feel the eerie silence that probably enveloped Jonas  little community  It is certainly terrifying to see people stripped off of their humanity  And ignorance can be such a dangerous thing  There is a lot of thought in this book  and it is simply well done   I recently read The Giver by Lois Lowry with my 7th grade honors english class  Let s just say that this book is completely worth the read in my opinion  One of the main reasons for my love for this book was because the setting drove the plot really well  Also  the point of view of the story played a big part in showing how all characters felt  Another reason why I loved this book is because it made you make a lot of inferences  and there were really no right answers so you had to make your own assumptions for what happened in some parts  While some people may not like this aspect of the story  I found it very interesting and I thought it opened up topics for many discussions to be had   To be honest  there wasn t really anything that I did not like about this book  One of my only concerns was that there were still a few unanswered questions by the end of the whole series  although that does happen often  Other than that  the whole book was great  The characters fit into the story perfectly  and the plot was clear and focused  The setting couldn t have been more important to the story  The companion novels to The Giver are in completely different communities  so don t get frustrated when Gathering Blue  Messenger  and Son seem almost completely different  The plot all ties back in at the end  and almost all of your questions will be answered  P S  The movie is very different from The Giver book  This is one of my all time favorites  It s the sort of book that I re read when I forget to borrow a book from the library  The Giver is a wonderfully descriptive  newberry honor  unique book  Simple enough for young adults to understand and sophisticated enough for adults to enjoy  My mom actually read it and was delighted To put it in simpler words  I love it I recommend this book to people of all ages  personalities  religions  and races  There is no put downs that apply to any people in this book  The Giver is an excellent read for children or adults  shy or out going  Christians or Buddhists  black or white  cool people or social klutz XD Simplified meaning of the paragraph above  Everyone will enjoy this book Lowry has truly put in imagination  The events and dialogues are realistic  yet surprising  Lowry s description creates a clear image in my head  The book is deep  yet understandable  Perfectly mixed and truly a masterpiece  I am expecting this book to turn into a  classic  in the future   As a child  this was the first book I couldn t stop thinking about  even after I finished it weeks before  Ualaaaaa  Me ha encantado  por fin una distopia original de verdad  la historia es muy buena y la pelicula sorprendentemente tb  La recomendaria con los ojos cerrados y sin duda me voy a leer toda la saga  great

to us and I was blown away by this world that didn t have colors or music  As an adolescent  I marveled that this world didn t have so many of the things we take for granted in our world  things like emotions and the ability to choose  As an adult  I was saddened that this futuristic society had given up everything that enriches life  family  weather  hopes and dreams  individuality  because  logically  a society is better off when governed by rules  It doesn t matter how many times I read this book  every single time I am reminded what a wonderful gift our agency is  It s so cool that we can decide what to wear each day  what to eat for dinner  what to be when we grow up  whom to marry  and so forth  Yes  we make wrong choices all the time  but I d gladly leave a life of structure and  comfort  for one of richness and beauty  This book struck a chord with me when I was only 11 years old  which lingers to this day  This is a really hard book to put into words    usually I have trouble reading if the TV is on  or people are around talking  but not so much with this one  The deciding factor that got me to read this one  above all else  was the page count    just 129 pages  nice and quick  just what I was in the mood for  Most of my favorite books lately have been little gems like this  The only thing I didn t like so much was the ending  Kind of one of those things that make you huh  What just happened  However  I was so excited by The Giver I immediately went in search of book 2 but it doesn t appear that it is going to follow Jonah s journey  hopefully it does at least a little  if not  I m okay with that  This is one of those books that I kind of feel like I need a few minutes to finish digesting before I move on to my next great read Mmm  it was delicious  Reading all the mixed reviews  and  I find it amazing all the different messages people have taken away from this one  I found myself wishing this was on the curriculum when I was in school  then it occurred to me that it hadn t yet been written  I have never been one to wish for a Utopian society  and now  when people ask why not  I can direct them to The Giver  I also look forward to suggesting it to kids middle school and up  hopefully stirring their grey matter into a nice little frenzy  The writing is simple  it may be a bit too simple for some  adults and children alike  It is perfect for those who lose interest quickly and feel bogged down in too many details  I don t think it is perfectly geared toward children because the writing is simplistic either  I think it is well geared because with the onset of puberty often comes a tremendous onslaught of emotions  with kids wishing they didn t have to feel at all  or feeling things out of proportion  I think this is a great way to sneak in the lesson that feelings are essential  Good  bad or indifferent  we need to feel them all  It also really reminds you of the importance of the love of family   Jack Wilson   Wilson 1Ms  CarteauxEnglish 1  Period C2 March 2014 The Giver by Lois Lowry  is called one of the most challenged books by the American Library Association  This story provides the reader with a number of lessons  among them the lack of options  of choice  is very dangerous  If freedom and determination are meaningful to a reader  then The Giver is a book he or she will embrace quickly  This book and review will explain the struggle it was to be different in this society and it took all of Jonas  will to get to where he wanted Eleven year old Jonas  the protagonist  is anticipating  not happily  the Ceremony of Twelve during which he and others his age also known as Elevens receive their assignment  Jonas  assignment turns out to be one of such great importance that he wonders if he has what it takes to succeed  The job includes receiving memories of things long gone from society  things like colors  feelings  happiness  sadness  hope  and regret  Diversity is not embraced In Jonas s world  Everyone is expected to be the same and your whole life is planned out for you at the age of twelve  As time goes on Jonas starts to wonder if this community could ever change and maybe he could be the one to change it  With the help of The Giver and when his new adopted brother is in trouble Jonas will need to make a decision on whether to do what society has been taught to do since anyone can recall or to save his brother and leave the treacherous town for good  In this battle for sameness vs  diversity will there be a winner or one big mistake The whole story is about conflict between similarity and difference  Lois Lowry really dives into what it was like to be Jonas and how different he became from everyone else  If a reader ones to enjoy a struggle between doing what is right and what others want you to do they will enjoy this book  This book was a great read and I really enjoyed it and its plot   Jonas s life is not what you would call all that great  Basically everything in his community is assigned to him  and he can t make very many choices on his own  Each family is assigned a boy and a girl to their family  and there are designated mothers that give birth There is a Ceremony of Twelve held in the community for people who turn twelve go to  They receive their jobs and other things necessary for their future  Little does Jonas know that he is much more special than he thinks  and he meets an old man called The Giver   I m Jonas    I know  Welcome  Receiver of Memory    pg  94  Is Jonas ready to see what power lies before him  Can he handle it if things become extreme  Is there someone special in Jonas s life that he is unaware of  In The Giver  Lois Lowry  the author  does an amazing job of explaining what life would be like if you had to live like Jonas  and the choices you had to make  and I really loved this book for that reason  I recommend this great science fiction book to anybody from 5th 10th grade  and even adults   Giving this book 5 stars I obviously love it  It is a simple tale with great meaning and depth  Young Jonas lives in a world where he is protected from feeling and difference  Everything he knows changes once he fells feelings and sees color  The book did not have as much of an action plot that I was expecting  I feel as though Lowry was using the book more so to get a point accord about feeling and difference  When Jonas is exposed to the memories he changes like a child does when they are forced to grow up  They see that not everything is black and white  not everything is easy and planed  but that s what makes life worth it  This book is very interesting  exciting  and truly a good read   This book was beyond amazing  I was 12 years old when I read this  and I m still rereading it to this day  15 years old   The Giver is about a boy named Jonas that started out to be a boy with very good word choice  but then started to change  At the begging Jonas was riding his bicycle until he saw a plane fly over his community  Then alarms went off and a speaker said get to the nearest building  so Jonas did so  After a couple of minutes the speakers said it was safe to get out  Jonas went home immediately to his family unit  After a year  Jonas became a 12  When the chief elder was naming the assignment  she skipped Jonas and the whole crowd was devastated  After she was done naming all the assignments  she said that Jonas was the receiver of memory and would do his work with the old receiver  the giver  alone  When being the receiver  the giver told Jonas that he might be seeing the color red  Jonas recalled seeing a change in an apple when his friend and he were playing with an apple  The giver then gave Jonas a memory of war and when Jonas saw his friends play a war game he was furious at them  He noticed that he was being separate from his friend already  Jonas heard that his father was going to release one of the twins that were born  Jonas tolled the giver that he wanted to see the release  He said to the office women to show him the release that morning  A screen popped and showed the father weighing the babies and then he took the one that weighed more and gave it to the nurse to nurturer  but he took the one that weighed less and injected the baby with a large needle  Then the move ended  Jonas realized how bad the community is  The giver and Jonas made a plane to get away from the community  An injustice in the story is when they put all the pressure on the giver  The community established a  utopia   but they seem to make the giver have pain  Even though the giver is a respectable job it requires lots of bravery  Just because the elders want everyone else in the community to feel no pain the giver has to take most of it  That is not fair and no where near equal  I would recommend this book to people who want to be or want to make something perfect  A lesson a person could learn from this is that you can t be perfect     The worst part of holding the memories is not the pain  It s the loneliness of it  Memories need to be shared     A society where language needs to be precise  where stereotype  discrimination  change  and even choice  were meaningless  Obsolete  A government who value sameness  order  peace and equality run the nation  However  it overvalue them that they also terminated people s freedom to choose  And a populace devoid of human emotions that they don t know what it feels to truly live  This is the things Lois Lowry has shown in this book Lowry wrote a novel that is appealing and so powerful  It interests me because I believe that  The Giver  was not just a dystopian novel  it also implicates something that is happening in the present modern world  the withholding of the authority to people s freedom of choice and expression He write it objectively and is substantive in form  Very well written and very vividly described  A fast read and engaging  Truly worth reading  This is in my top ten of all time list  I ve read this book multiple times and it never gets old  It always helps me to appreciate the good and the bad in life just because we can   This is one of my all time favorite books  I think it is so intriguing to think of a world as to how it would be if all of these things happened  This is a story of a futuristic town where there is no pain  hurt or sadness  Coming with those things  also includes not having excitement happiness and joy  They tried to perfect their world by having everyone robotic  They pick your spouses and your children get assigned to you  When the children are 12 they get assigned their jobs  A young boy Jonas who narrates the book gets assigned the job of keeper of memories  He is unusual things happen to him  he can see things in color sometimes adn feels things  Once he starts his training he begins to feel all of these memories  Jonas then makes a special connection with a little boy who has trouble sleeping so he gives him memories to fall asleep  When he finds out the little boy is going to be put down so Jonas with the help of the Giver makes a plan  They plan to escape the village and all the memories good and bad will be released  Jonas and Gabriel make it out but have to endure hunger  pain and the cold  Finally in the end Jonas sees his sled from his memory and they ride the sled down and see a town with lights and Christmas tress and home Critique  I think this book was very well written and very creative  The ideas are kind of scary to think about however because something along the lines of this story could potentially happen  It was obviously a really well written book since it was a Newberry Winner   Reading is an act that requires two parties  the writer and the reader  Often the writer gets all the credit and the reader is neglected  But in fact  the reader brings her own thoughts  feeling  and experiences to the table when she reads  Sometimes a writer writes to speak his mind  to express himself  to tell his story  Other times  a writer writes to engage the reader  to allow the reader to bring her own experiences to the table  to allow the reader to bring her own meaning to the tale  to give the reader control over the interpretation  In The Giver  Lois Lowry is this type of engaging writer She gives us a utopian society  Everything is carefully planned out  Words are carefully chosen  Society is well organized  predictable  and peaceful  Certainly  an interesting new world to discover  The story is simple and straightforward  The words are easy to devour  After all  this is a novel written for adolescents  But despite the simple story  the novel is deceptively rich and complex  as there is so much for you  the reader  to bring to the table  I have no doubt that I could read this book over and over again and find something new each time  I highly recommend it for readers both young and old With that said  here is my initial reaction to the novel  I ve hidden it behind spoiler tags  view spoiler  I read The Giver for the first time as an adult  a mother of two young children  With the perspective of a parent  I found The Giver particularly profound  Lois Lowry has written a utopian society  one in which all the inconveniences of real life are erased  There is no pain  No fighting  No conflict  No sexuality  Everything is perfectly planned out  And this is exactly the society that we parents try to create for our children  We try so hard to protect them  to shield them from pain  to preserve that childhood innocence  to make choices on their behalf with their best interests in mind  And so  I found it particularly profound that this is written for adolescents   precisely the people who are living in a world controlled by adults  The novel allows the reader  perhaps a middle schooler  to see how the utopian society might not be so utopian after all  The writer trusts the reader   trusts her to handle topics like death  trusts her to think for herself  trusts her to even be a bit subversive  In the end  the writer gives the reader the ultimate control  In a sense  she says to the adolescent reader   Adults have controlled your entire life thus far  but  perhaps there is another way  You are smarter and more capable than adults give you credit for  I trust you  And to show you how much I trust you  I give you the ability to choose your own ending  This novel made me wonder  what do we lose by trying so hard to create this utopian society for our children  On the one hand  you can argue that one does not need to experience warfare in order to experience love  On the other hand  one must accept the risk of falling in order to experience the thrill of climbing a tree    hide spoiler   Wow  what a great book  So  The Giver reminded me quite a bit of some more recent dystopia that I ve read  but I think it s likely that others have tried to emulate what Lowry has created here  I can t believe I waited this long to read it  shame on me I loved the relationship between Jonas and the Giver  and also Jonas  relationships with Fiona and with Gabriel  So well written  The world that Lowry has created is all to realistic and believable  and I loved how the reader is left to  figure out  the specifics without it all being provided in the text  I can easily see how this would be a great middle grade reader  and what fabulous discussion it must inspire for teachers and students I m a bit taken aback by the ending  and I think it s likely that I ll read the next in the series  I hope it picks up where this one leaves off  Excellent read  highly recommended Update  Hmmm  I ve just realized that the next book isn t about Jonas at all     disappointing  I ll probably still read it  though     The Giver takes a glimpse into a world where everything appears to be working in a calm  orderly manner because anything that causes conflict or discomfort has been eliminated  On the surface  the rationale for  sameness  was that it made life good for the whole community  As Jonas comes of age and takes on his responsibilities training to be the  receiver of memories   he comes to realize that the richness of living is compromised by the conformity his community has embraced  It is through the struggles of life and by embracing differences that we can fully see the  colors  and hear the  music  that life has to offer  The Giver allows the reader a glimpse into what these different approaches to life could look like and how Jonas deals with the dilemma of doing what is morally right even when it goes against the rules of the community  Will Jonas be brave  The Giver is thought provoking and an enjoyable read  I highly recommend it  Jonas lives in the  Community   a supposedly utopian world where everything is flawless  There are no good or bad  there is no hunger  no war  and no pain   a perfect world to live in  Jonas lived 12 years of his life without questioning the system and accepting things as they were  But when he is selected as the  Receiver of Memories  he starts to discover secrets which lie beneath the perfect exterior of his world which he rather would not have known  As he receives more and more memories his wish to explore the world beyond his Community increases  A compelling tale showing the courage needed to go against a set system to bring a change  The characters are perfectly described and none of the characters are bland  Most of the characters are accepting of the system of the  Community  and do not want to change it or are rather scared to go against the system  The main character of the book Jonas on the other hand is unsatisfied with the way things are and wants to see it change  Sometime before he becomes twelve he notices certain changes in his surroundings which he can t explain  When he becomes the Receiver of Memories he starts to understand the change he had experienced  change he which had made him feel free and not bound by rules  His longing to explore the world beyond grows stronger with each new memory he gets even though he knows it s illegal  My favourite character from the book would be the Giver who gives the memories to Jonas  Sad and melancholy in nature  he is the only one who understands Jonas  longing for freedom and even decides to help him escape  The book is a complete page turner and raises issues which force the readers to ponder upon  What if the world was perfect  a world where everything was same and without any conflict  Would we still long for the imperfect world  For the people living in Jonas  world the world they live would be a utopia but for the reader it is a dystopia where all things are controlled by one person  a world where there is no freedom of thought and talk of change is not endured  The people controlling Jonas  world to be perfect even the families are made so that they are perfect  People are made to think what the rules say are right  Even their profession is chosen by other people  This book shows us the imperfect world hidden behind the fake exterior of a perfect world I recommend this book to all young adults  A book which would compel you to ponder upon the concept of the perfect world which we all wish for  If you liked this book you would also like The Seventh Tide by Joan Lennon and The Time Machine by H G Wells both of which deal with the same concept of utopia and dystopia  A memorable and thought provoking book which cannot be easily forgotten  A compelling read   Lowry somehow manages to package complex concepts in a form that is accessible for younger readers without straying into too explicitly distressing territory  The maturity and intellect of the reader will determine how far the  what if   enquiries catalysed by the book go   like a built in protection  Rather than forcing the reader to confront the implications to the extreme  much is implied and is there to be considered as the reader is ready and able  Regardless of whether one  enjoys  the novel  I don t think anyone could read it without being inspired to THINK  Furthermore  it s the type of book you could revisit several times and each time end up noticing or exploring different implications  I think it s a great introduction to dystopian fiction and would lay a rich foundation for later encounters with books such as 1984 and Brave New World  Adult readers might compare it unfavourably to those books but in my opinion that would be unfair  This novel can be read by younger people for whom those texts might perhaps be inappropriate  The best thing about reading this book was that it was loaned to me by one of my year 7 students  She told me some of it had  gone over her head  but she thought I would like it  Hopefully I ll find an opportunity to chat to her about it and see if any of the bits she didn t get are already seeming to make more sense  I like the idea that bits of this story will be percolating  albeit subconsciously  in her mind  ready to be tapped into later  This Giver is a book about a boy named Jonas who lives in a community  At the ceremony of 12 each child gets assignment  Jonas gets chosen for something that has great honor I thought this was a amazing heartwarming book  There was love  but not dating type of love I liked the bit of adventure that was in this book  I would recommend this book to everyone  I loved this book  I saw the movie last week and immediately knew I wanted to read the book  I finished the book in 1 day and it was great  I think I actually appreciated it more by reading it post viewing of the movie  I knew the plot and could really focus on and pick out details that the movie lacked  I feel like reading the book brought me closer to the story and characters  If I could I would give this seven stars  This book is amazing  It is set in a town were everything is very orderly and everyone does everything just right  I liked it because it looks at the world through different eyes  The eyes of Jonas  a twelve  eleven at the start  year old who is selected to ba a Receiver  He will get memories of many years past and will start to actually feel  The part that shocked me the most is that the people in the town cannot see color  so when Jonas sees color in one of the memories he is very shocked  This is n amazing story and I highly highly recommend this for people ages 13   Wow  The idea of YA dystopian literature didn t seem very appealing to me after the disappointment of The Hunger Games  but this book was absolutely incredible  Well written  thought provoking  well developed  respectful of the great works of its genre before it  The Giver almost makes one as thankful for the little things in life as Thornton Wilder s Our Town  The book is a celebration of many things  Independence  feeling  free will  love  the joys of life like food and music  It is also a reflection on the pain of human suffering  At the core of the book  its question is  Is it better to be safe and void of free will and affection  Or to have independence and feelings at the expense of your safety   As in most dystopian literature  the political conclusions the book comes to were quite pleasing to me  I am ecstatic that middle schoolers and young high schoolers are reading this book  The government stooges may say they are challenging the book due to some sort of content they deem unacceptable for young readers  Middle schoolers have heard of much worse things than depicted in the book  If the public schools think they can somehow shelter children from some  inappropriate  content they are sorely deceived  I think it s important to establish early on that the government s promise of safety has an extremely high cost  Also  that free will rules all  Of course  they wouldn t want anybody thinking like that   Those who would give up essential Liberty  to purchase a little temporary Safety  deserve neither Liberty nor Safety     Benjamin Franklin  I loved this book  It s about a society that is controlled by the government  so there can be no pain  no love  and no true emotions  When someone in the society reaches their 12th year  they are given a job  Most of them all know what they will be  because it is chosen very carefully to fit their personality  Jonas  on the other hand  has no clue  There is one job that only a special person can get  and that is the Receiver  My favorite part of the book was when Jonas started receiving memories of the past  especially the snow  Lois Lowry is fantastic at describing that  to us  is just everyday life  It makes it feel like I m part of the story  instead of watching someone else s life play out  If you liked the Hunger Games or Divergent  I would recommend this book because it is the same with unfree societies  and someone fixing it  I would recommend this book to young and old as well as men and women  The reader should be old enough to understand the books true meaning  therefore I suggest the reader to be at least 15  I liked the book a lot because it shows you that with love comes hate but that love is greater and better and that it is worth fighting for  It showed me how important it is to have the freedom of choice and to make your own decisions  In the futuristic society  the book takes place  one has ever made a decision by themselves  Therefore I gave the book 5 of 5 stars   THE GIVER tells the story of Jonas  a boy who lives in a well ordered community where there is no suffering  everyone is respected  feelings are shared openly  everyone s needs are provided for  and no one has to choose their profession because each person s role in society is carefully chosen for them by the leaders  Each year  there is a ceremony in which each child receives age appropriate privileges and responsibilities  culminating in their twelfth year when they are given their job designations  From that point on  their education includes job training  When Jonas s turn comes  all his peers joyfully receive occupations that fit their abilities  But Jonas is passed over for a very special job  one that fills him with excitement  and fear Jonas s world seems  at first  to by idyllic  Is this really a dystopian novel  But as we progress with Jonas through his twelfth year  we get the impression that things are not as rosy as they seem  And the more we learn  the more we discover how harsh and terrible the truth is This is a powerful story for a relatively short book  The voice is third person  but told in a voice that could easily be Jonas s  Lowry gives us the impression of a fully realized world without lots of detail  This might frustrate some  since we aren t told how the world became the way it is  only that there was a time when things were different  We don t know much about the leadership structure  how much the leaders understand about their world  and a whole slew of background details that some might feel they need to know  But such details really aren t necessary to the story Lowry tells  She gives us sufficient information  and focuses on Jonas  his family  and the situation into which he is placed I would say this book sits somewhere between MG and YA  Older MG kids could read it  but some of the concepts might be a little dark  and veering more into YA territory  There are no language or sex issues with this book  aside from a dream Jonas has where he asks a girl of his age to bathe naked  she refuses   This  along with the mention of him starting to get  stirrings  is as sexually explicit as it gets I highly recommend THE GIVER  It s exceptionally well written  and very thought provoking  And this review doesn t do it justice  because a more full discussion would require spoilers  I am completely in love with this book I ll be honest  I had to summon a lot of courage to buy The Giver  I d seen such mixed reviews of it and the trailer for the movie looked kind of unoriginal  Then my favourite book shop set up a display of  YA Books That You Must Read  and The Giver was there with a wonderful write up by one member of staff  So  I thought  what the hell   and bought it and that has now turned out to be one of the best decisions I ve made when it comes to books  This book was incredible  I haven t been able to stop thinking about this all day  I think I could have read this all in one go if I d have allowed myself to  I was hooked One of the most striking things about this book is its simplicity  It s written in a way that anyone from young children to fully grown adults can understand  I loved the accessibility of it and I also found the simplistic prose rather beautiful  Also  I thought it allowed the reader to step into Jonas  shoes  The simplistic language painted a picture of a simple world with no colour or music or love  The simplistic way in which memories were presented to Jonas made me think  It made me feel as though I was experiencing snow or sunshine for the first time even though that clearly isn t the case  Everything was so compelling and thought provoking  This is one of the most simplistic concepts I ve read in dystopian fiction and yet I think that it works the best  In fact  the world presented seemed more of a utopia than a dystopia to me  It was just a utopia that doesn t seem entirely fair As soon as I finished this  I thought  I WANT MORE   I m in love with this world and this concept and I need more of these fantastic ideas  Thank God that there are follow up books to this one so that it doesn t have to end here  I think this is one of my new absolute favourite books  This is a stable piece among YA and dystopian fiction and I would so definitely recommend it to fans of either of those genres  I had an English Literature lesson at school today and I felt like running around the classroom and telling everyone to read The Giver  Is there really any higher praise I can give  Just read it  If you re anything like me  you will be completely blown away   I really enjoyed reading the giver because it was simplistic in the plot line and it was easy to read yet its words were very meaningful  I would recommend to anyone about 4th grade and up for much of the same reasons   I also liked the book because it made me think about things I usually just take for granted  Take color for example  All the people in Jonah s community except for Jonah and The Giver and possibly Gabriel didn t even know that they couldn t see color  one of the things I love most about our world  I don t think I could ever be happy living in a place where all the beauties of life have been taken away from me  the only problem being I wouldn t even know they ever existed   I think the author write this book to show people the need for individuality to live a full life  She shows us that pain is necessary in order for happiness  If you take out all the emotion  you may be sparing people from sadness  but they will also never be able to experience love  Lowry shows us that we cannot always blindly follow society but that we should try to change it   Some foreshadowing is used when Jonah sees the apple  change  and you can begin to assume that there is something different about him  Overall  the book was wonderful in all aspects   Living an uneventful  obedient life is what Jonas does every day  along with the other people living in his community  That is  until he is selected to be The Receiver  This one honored job changes Jonas s entire life and the way he thinks  This book is short  with only 180 pages compared to a typical novel s 300 and up pages  but the author does an extremely good job with the time and details throughout the story that it s never too detailed or lacking in detail  The author also does well in building the plot over time  so that it isn t all at once dramatic and full of action  This book is written simply but at the same time there is a lot of depth lying in its simplicity  I recommend this book to anyone looking for something good to read because the simplicity and simultaneous depth as well as its short length is sure to hook anybody that picks it up  Wow  This book has been on my list of books to read for years  Since it will be made into a movie  I wanted to read the original first  and I m so glad I did  Set in an utopian dystopian society  we can easily see how a world that values efficiency and order over everything else can quickly reduce its individuals  quality of life  This book opens up many discussions about how our memories  emotions  etc  affect us  bringing a richness into our lives  Much to think about   and I m excited to read Lowry s other books  I loved this book   When people have the freedom to choose  they choose wrongDulu  kelas les bahasa gw pernah bikin diskusi  apa yang terjadi kalo semua orang di dunia hidup dalam kedamaian  Ga ada orang jahat  ga ada kesusahan  ga ada kelaparan  semua hidup bahagia  Dan semua murid di kelas   termasuk gw   setuju  hidup serba damai adalah jalan hidup terbaik  Tapi lalu tiba tiba guru gw bilang  tapi bukannya kalo semua berjalan serba lurus  hidup jadi membosankan ya  Ga ada tantangannya dan manusia malah jadi berhenti berusaha karena semuanya udah serba gampang Dan pertanyaan itu bikin satu kelas diem  Lalu 2 hari lalu gw mulai baca buku ini dan latar ceritanya persis seperti apa yang pernah kami diskusiin  Perfect is boring  It s even dangerous SinopsisJonas hidup di dunia yang serba sempurna  ga ada rasa sakit  ga ada duka  ga ada kelaparan  Semua sudah diatur dengan sistem yang teratur sempurna dan semua orang menaatinya  Setiap unit keluarga boleh mempunyai maksimal 2 anak  satu laki laki dan satu perempuan  Anak anak ini dilahirkan oleh para Birthmother dan akan dirawat oleh para Nurturer supaya para bayi yang baru lahir ini  terlatih  untuk tidur nyenyak  tidak rewel dan tidak menyusahkan orang tua baru mereka nantinya  Setiap orang punya pekerjaan masing masing  Makanan selalu diantar tepat pada waktu makan oleh para petugas dari Food Production  Setiap orang selalu sopan  meminta maaf kalau tindakan mereka dirasa menyusahkan orang lain dan berterima kasih pada hal sekecil apapun Jonas adalah seorang Eleven  yang akan segera dianggap dewasa begitu mencapai umur dua belas dan akan diberi penugasan  Pada akhirnya di Ceremony of Twelve  Jonas ditunjuk sebagai Receiver of Memory yang baru   sebuah posisi yang sangat dihormati dan disegani di komunitas Jonas  Pada waktunya Jonas memulai pelajaran dari The Giver  Jonas mulai mempelajari banyak hal baru yang tidak pernah ia ketahui dari komunitasnya  jenis jenis warna  rasa bahagia  kehangatan  sinar matahari  rasa cinta dan kasih sayang  Namun Jonas juga mempelajari apa itu rasa sakit  duka  kelaparan  perang dan kesepian  Dan sejak saat itu dunia serba teratur yang Jonas tahu tidaklah sesempurna itu Initial Thoughts  Merinding  itu hal pertama yang gw rasain pas baca buku itu  Sedih adalah perasaan kedua  Masalahnya kadang gw bisa ngerasa kalo beberapa hal di dunia Jonas mulai terjadi di dunia sekarang ini   orang cenderung lebih suka berlindung di rasa aman tanpa berani mencoba  Dan makin kesini kita makin hidup kaya robot  That s the actual horror   Dari sisi bacaannya  baca The Giver berasa kaya lagi didongengin sama kakek gw dulu  Rasanya tenang  nyantai  tapi tetep bikin penasaran  Gw sangat sangat suka sama gaya penulisan Ibu Lowry ini  And I can t get enough   Endingnya dibikin open  kita diminta bikin intepretasi sendiri  GW pikir di buku lanjutannya  Gathering Blue kalo ga salah  ceritanya bakal soal lanjutan petualangan Jonas  Well  it s not   banting meja dengan kalem  Agak kesel  tapi    tetep kesel  Kan gw pengen tau soal nasib Jonas sama Gabeeeee T T                                                                                                                Udah gitu aja reviewnya  Gw pernah baca entah di mana  seorang reviewer pernah bilang  lebih gampang ngereview buku yang kita ga suka karena kita bisa nulis panjang lebar  maki maki  nyampah soal apa yang kita ga suka soal buku itu  ketimbang buku yang kita beneran suka  karena kadang kita kehilangan kata kata buat ngedeskripsiinnya Itu  Bener  BangetThe Giver udah terkenal menang banyak penghargaan  jadi bacaan buku buat anak anak sekolah  juga masuk daftar Banned Books  Sekarang gw ngerti kenapa buku ini begitu mendunia dan dibaca banyak orang  Gw sendiri berharap jumlah orang yang baca buku ini bertambah  mungkin anggota KPI sekalian   Re  Spongebob dibanned   p It s just that good  Kalo belom baca  please baca  it really worth your time  Lagian cuma 200 an halaman  ga akan kerasa bacanya  janji  D sekarang mari kita cari 3 buku lanjutannya   elus elus dompet  It s an amazing book   This does not feel like a children s book  The themes and conflicts of this novel are real things we deal with everyday as adults and as a society  Jonas lives in a community that must be in the future based on advances of science mentioned in the book  In this new community they live by sameness  The people follow strict rules and never question anything  At age 12 children are assigned to jobs they will spend their life doing  Jonas is chosen for a high honor or becoming the communities Receiver  A position no one but the current receiver understands  The receiver is  in short  responsible for knowing all the worlds history and memories and harboring the feelings  both happy and painful  that come along with it  which leads to a lonely existence  But once Jonas learns to love  and learns the truth if the society he lives in can he really stand to live his life there  This novel was thought provoking and almost intense for me  It felt thrilling and fast paced as I read in my excitement  My only qualms is the ending is pretty abrupt an the novel is actually quite short  only 132 pages in my nook  However there are 3 follow up novels  which don t actually continue the story where we left off  but do connect to this novel eventually   An excellent book  I had the impression that this book was going to be sci fi  but it wasn t  It is about a society that has  improved  over countless generations  I don t think I want to see the movie  There are 3 other books in the series which I intend to read  I have actually read this twice  It is a keeper  So I found this app called Oyster  which is apparently the Netflix of books  I have a one week free trial  so I am taking advantage of it and reading as many books as I can I really really liked this  It was easy to read because I liked it so much  and it was quick  Very thought provoking but very good  Another take on a dystopian society where someone decided that protecting their citizens from themselves is a better way to live than allowing free choice  Another job well done  I was taken by the positive spin this book put on the future  Then as the story went on and I learned more of their Community  I saw that I wasn t quite right  And that s where the story really takes off  Jonas is the son of in a family unit of four  One Dad  One Mom  One Son  One Daughter  There is no pain  There is no discomfort  There is no choice  Even your meals are chosen for you  Life is perfect for Jonas  That is until he is given his Assignment at his Ceremony of Twelve and everything changes  Or  you could say  becomes more colorful  I loved this book more than I could imagine  more than I can describe  I recommend highly   Jonas s life is well thought out and very consciously looked at by the board of elders  What he wears how he does things and the people around him are all place into different roles into the community  People never stand out  always do what the are told and the are happy  But now Jonas is 12 and was selected to be the receiver of memories for his community  He is responsible for all the decision made based on the past  He discovers how the community is intertwined and how the choice for your own life is very fun and exciting  This doesn t sit too well wi the community  Now Jonas has all this knowledge and doesn t know what to do    The giver is a very well written book by Lois Lowry  It has a way of catching your attention and not giving it back  I personally could not put the book down  The way the minds of the characters so complex yet all made one living person is amazing  The giver is a book that I can relate to going through the motions in life how you feel like you are controlled and you like it until you get older and realized that you want to be able to make your life  I feel this book is much about how that works and how you can t be controlled without ignorance  This book has a way of telling things the way the are without explaining anything  The way that it shows even though you have to make your own decisions they can be hard and you might not always benefit from them  You just have to listen to the music  I highly recommend this book to anyone that can relate to the way you feel when you don t have control  so ages 12 16   Read with a 7th grade class I co taught  highly recommend for all ages   I chose to read this book because I saw the movie with my family and wanted to read it for myself  My younger brother read the book before the movie and told me what was different  along with what he liked or did not like about the movie  I felt that it was a book that I needed to read and add to my library  I thought the book was very interesting and thought provoking  I now wish I had not seen the movie first because of what it gave away  I did liked comparing the changes and wondering why those changes were made  It was a quick read but not necessarily an easy one  It certainly left me thinking  maybe even more than the movie did  about what it meant I would honestly recommend it to anyone that wanted to read it  Especially those that like the dystopian fiction like the The Hunger Games  As far as an age group goes  I think that it would be more appropriate for kids in middle school and up I think that if I were to use it in a classroom  I would want to use it as a bridge to another work that may be harder to read  I was actually discussing this in another class of mine and how I would use this book to teach Romeo and Juliet  In The Giver  there is a rule called  Sameness   meaning no one is allowed to be different at all  I would use Shakespeare to model a world that might lead to the world Lowry created  Warnings  Sex  NoneViolence  Moderate  Book uses the term  release  instead of killing and many characters are  released  Drugs and Alcohol  NoneLanguage  None This book is a gem  The way the writer envisions and present the story  a Utopian society not truly Utopian  each of Jonas  new found feelings  his choice of a adventurous yet dangerous life over a comfortable one  his tiredness of the  Sameness  are surprising and sometimes incredible  A hopeful book    SPOILER ALERT         The Giver was an interesting book that is set in a distopia where everything is perfect  The main character is selected to hold memories of then real world  of pain and fear  His family was selected for him and nobody was a child to their real mother  The giver who passes good  bad  and even torturous memories to him realizes that the life they live is dull and pointless   Finally he and the giver end up deciding that they will send the protagonist  Jonas outside of their perfect world and realease the memories so that everyone can have them  He then journeys far away to where there are people leading a normal life in a normal community  Along the journey he faces many hardships which he has some of  experienced in his memories from the giver  Some parts of the book have action and suspense but the writing and complexity of the book and character is what draws you in  Once he gets to civilization one realizes that the new world he has journeyed to is exaclty like our world  This book is much different from any other books that I have read because of the interesting setting and plot   This book is set in a weird setting which is what drew me in at first  The author develops all of the characters even though they have such simple lives  This is what rekates them to humans in the real world  I recommend this book to my friend Shay who will critic it but enjoy it as well  It was a bit strange adjusting to the idea of that society and how they did things   I guessed correctly a couple of things from the beginning  And I really liked how it developed  A very short but good book  Lowry delivers an engrossing novel in this first installment of her quartet about a utopian society  and how well  or not   it operates to serve the needs of its citizens  The Giver has chosen Jonas to take over his position as  Receiver  of all memories  driven by feelings  Until now  citizens followed strict protocol to ensure harmony within the community  but WHAT IF they were given the ability permission to exercise free will while feeling the whole range of emotions  Until now  emotions had been only accessible  in their entire spectrum  to being felt by the Receiver  After Jonas discovers how his newfound abilities have changed his life  and decided that the potential gains were worth most resultant costs  life on the  inside  will never be the same again I m eagerly awaiting the second book  with so much potential to continue this fascinating look at human nature  The possibilities are endless for plots  as new lives await all  Extremely Highly Recommended for all book clubs  as The Giver crosses many genres  A brilliant gem  perfectly paced and the characters so well drawn I will miss them until I read the continuation of their plans  Will life improve  or will changing this carefully planned society result in its eventual demise   Doc Aloha Reviews 11 08 2014 The Giver by Lois Lowry is about a place where no one feels emotions  At age twelve everyone is assign a job based on his or her abilities and interest  At the ceremony of twelve Jonas is given the Receiver of Memory  Since Jonas was Receiver of Memory he was allowed to lie because everyone else can t lie  Jonas finds out about all the emotions they don t feel and hes trying to change everything   I honestly like this book because it always gets you wondering about if the world was actually like this  Like how everything was put together and how in every chapter it had lots of details  Once you start reading it you can t stop because you want to know what s going to happen next  I think that you should read the book first and then watch the movie because it has so much detail that you wouldn t understand what s going on in the movie  It s a really good book and I think that you should read it  I highly recommend this book to people that like to read about the future and emotions  This book will get you wondering about a lot of stuff because the world can actually be like this  If you like the book The Hunger Games and Divergent  I really think you should read this book  All of these books make you wonder if one day it ll be like this  Go for it and read it because it will get you wondering like it did to me  I really enjoyed this book  almost more so than many other dystopian books  I found it to be easy to read  and very thought provoking  I think it s more straightforward than many other dytopian novels  and focused more of the relationship between Jonas and The Giver  as opposed to the actual society  That aspect was still there  but defying it and proving one s uniqueness wasn t the main theme  as many more modern dystopian stories are  The story took me on a roller coaster of emotions  I found some aspects to be very interesting   things like preciseness of language could benefit today s society  the same sentence could be interpreted 15 different ways by 15 different people   and children being assigned jobs spouses based on their strengths  a lot of consideration goes into arranged marriages in other cultures   assuming the selections are made based on things other than reputation getting ahead   However  I wouldn t be willing to give up my freedom of choice and the opportunity to make the mistakes I ve learned from  I think some could benefit from being assigned a partner job  but the discipline wand gave me shudders  If their forced method of parenting were in line with my own though  lol  I d be all about that being mandatory    This book was written in 1993 and it is just as relevant today as it was 21 years ago  This is a modern classic dystopia  In this world the government controls all  The goal for the government is to free the society from suffering  The goal sounds nobel  yet  a closer examination of their methods shows that this happiness is only surface level and many are making the ultimate sacrifice to uphold this supposed ideal  Jonas learns of the horrorific means the government utilizes when he is selected to be the next  giver   The giver in this society takes on all of the memories of the past  both good and bad  Jonas learns from his teacher that man is capable of creating beautiful and wondorous things that this society is being withheld from in order to maintain sameness  Jonas also learns that mankind is capable of terrible evils too  Jonas must now decide what he will do in light of these new revelations I would love to use this as a whole class novel  I think that the conversations that could be had with a class full of students would be amazing  I also think that the questions posed in the novel would make for some excellent writing prompts  I m looking forward to the August 15th release of the film version of this novel  Sometime soon  I will have to read the rest of this series  This book was sooo good  I loved how it showed the appeal of a society devoid of differences and hence devoid of pain  but then it reveals the great tragedy behind such a society  Thought provoking and wonderful  This was a wonderful read  it reminded me of Agenda 21 by Glen Beck which I also enjoyed  I don t think this is really a childrens book  If I had read this 20 years ago I don t believe I would have understood it  I don t pay attention to conspiracy theories so I just enjoyed this as a novel  It was a story about a young man named Jonas that lives in basically a prepackaged world where you don t have to deal with love  death  or decisions  He decided he wanted to really live and escaped this community so he could enjoy the blunders of everyday life   Es un libro que me ha hecho sentir muy triste cada pagina  Creo que ademas de tristeza siento empatia  Jonas es una persona muy joven y ser el receptor es un trabajo muy duro  Me ha parecido un tanto rudo el modo en que conoce la verdad porque es su trabajo hacerlo pero me ha mantenido constantemente en suspenso Me ha gustado mucho este libro a pesar de ser a mi punto de vista tan triste y en un desarrollo de una sociedad sin sentimientos  colores y recuerdos de generaciones pasadas Al terminarlo me ha parecido un  Delirium  mucho mas cruel y con nada de amor  El final ha sido demasiado abrupto y no se si es porque la version que compre es mas chica o enserio termina asi    Quiero saber que paso con el dador  que pasa con Jonas y con Gabriel  quiero saber si hay algo menos triste en lo que sigue de libros  Espero que lo haya o buscare como contactar con Lois y decirle que es super cruel Es una saga  creo que son mas de 3 libros  que deseo seguir leyendo y terminar  No sabia mucho  sigo sin saberlo  de estos libros hasta que aparecio en el cine un trailer de la pelicula que hasta el momento no he visto  Ya vere que tanto le cambiaron  creo que mucho  cuando tenga oportunidad de verla  A boy named Jonas was born in a perfect community or a utopia  When Jonas becomes a 12  he is given a job assignment as Reciever of Memory with The Giver  He was picked for the job because everybody else is color blind and he gains the power to see color  He first noticed this when he was tossing an apple back and forth with his best friend named Asher  The Giver guides him through a trip to gain wisdom through memories of happiness  pain  suffering  hunger  and many  many more  Litte does The Giver know about Jonas  little secret with Gabe  a baby the nurcery wants

released herself  Jonas hated the idea of his father killing inocent people by sticking a needle through their arm  I would suggest this book to a higher level reader because of the high infering and the large vocabulary words there are in the book  I really like this book and i hope everybody else does too  Great middle grade read a must read novel AMAZING            The Giver by Lois Lowry was a well known book  loved by different kind of people with different ages  The Giver also happened to be one of my favourite book  The book was about a boy who live in a perfect community  a place where there is no war  no hunger and no pain  A perfect community  or so Jonas thought  Jonas was a perfectly normal boy in the community  but it all change when he was selected to be the Receiver of Memory   Intelligence  Integrity  Courage  Wisdom  These are the qualities a Receiver of Memory must have  And one more which can only be named  but not described  The Capacity to See Beyond   from the back of the book and it was also mentioned from page 84  85  My favourite part of the book is when Jonas received the memory of love from The Giver  In this part  Jonas truly realised that his community seem perfect from outside is because he don t know what is truly inside  He also realised that love don t exist in his community  I personally think that the main theme of this book is to teach people that in order to have one thing  you must sacrifice another thing  Jonas community is actually a lot like ours  but a lot different at the same time  For example  the people want to stop hunger so they change the weather in order to grow more food  but they have to sacrifice seeing or knowing other weather beside sun shining which it isn t too bright or too dull  I strongly recommend this book to people who is older than 10 and to people who like science fiction  I LOVE THIS BOOK  Instantly  it became one of my favorites   The Giver  had always been on my literary bucket list  I am so glad I finally got around to reading it  Unintentionally coinciding with all of the new YA novels coming out  and matching movies   this story is dystopian  The messages and literary devices in the novel are SOOOO teachable     I would love to teach  The Giver  and use pieces of Hunger Games and the Divergent series  I do see inevitability in the future with extreme gov t regulation  starting with gas and water   These dystopian novels are a very interesting  controversial and arguably plausible future  I will likely go on to finish this quartet series  as I have been made of its existence as of yesterday  lol    The Giver is recommended for ages 12 14  and adults alike  It has won the Newbery Medal  1994   Horn Book Fanfare Best Book  1994   Garden State Book Award for Teen Fiction Grades 6 8  1996   An ALA Best Book for Young Adults  1994   and the Grand Canyon Reader Award for Teen Book  1995   This book is about an ideal world  a world in which there is no poverty  no crime  sickness  or unemployment  It is a world where every family is happy and has agreed to marry only well matched individuals  and raise two offspring which includes one boy and one girl  Drugs are taken to get rid of sexual impulses  and careers are given out like assignments  Elders live in group homes and are released  die  in time  as are infants who do not develop properly  Jonas  a boy who lives in this society  is the receiver of memories  and is responsible for discovering the truth about his  perfect world   The author paints a picture of a very ordered and pain free society  This book was very interesting  intriguing  and appealing to older readers and adults alike describing how a  perfect world  was created  Everything was chosen and given to them and they acted more like robots than humans  Gradually throughout the book  Jonas and the readers learn just how costly and boring and pain free society can be  This book lends itself to many what if questions about the world  and would make a great book for discussion concerning the meaning of happiness and individuality  among others  This is definitely a book that can be read over and over again and each time new questions can be raised and new insights can be gained  There were several parts in the book that gave me chills and as I continued to reread some parts  they gained more and more meanings and even various meanings  This book is definitely a must read for everyone and I would read it again in a heartbeat because of the cleverness and the many thought provoking questions it raised   Advanced 5th grade   high schoolI really enjoyed this book  even though it is very sad  The Giver does not have any pictures  The content  font size  and lack of episodic chapters suggests that this book is suited for more advanced readers  There is a lot of underlying text that helps to develop the story  This book would be great for a lesson on utopian ideas  or society in general  There are a lot of questions of morality and what is right and wrong  such as  do we want to be ignorant to the beauty of the world so that we can be safe  What makes us human  The book asks these questions unflinchingly  and these questions evoke higher order thinking in the reader  All this is done in a way that can be understood by young readers  Lowry s book is a wonderful piece of literature because of this  Language Arts Social StudiesLesson Plan  This book would be great to use as a topic to begin discussion on different forms of government and what type of system tries to create a utopian society  A compelling tale to relish   I unreservedly loved this book  I read it from cover to cover in two days  and found myself greatly affected by its sheer beauty  Jonas is an eleven  almost a twelve  and at the Ceremony of the Twelve all children receive their Assignments for future full time work  Jonas doesn t know what he d like to be  but is given a huge responsibility within his assignment  and dutifully begins training  He cannot know how the discoveries he makes will change him   This is a book I d always planned to read  but hadn t got around to it  I m glad I did  Lowry s writing is expressive and compelling and I was quickly caught up within the world that Jonas inhabits  The rules of his community drew me into a calm and strait laced culture  but made me concerned for Jonas  something was missing    Lowry describes the community so well  that when I discovered the twist half way in  I was surprised and delighted  The second half of the book captivated me as Lowry s beautiful descriptions kept me entranced  This story offered parallels into our own lives  and will make you think about right and wrong  good and evil  complacency and fear  and much more   I thoroughly enjoyed debating this experience  and it was an experience to me  after finishing the book One word of warning   if you love the book and feel compelled to watch the recent movie  don t  The movie is pretty much an entirely different story and will only serve to frustrate you as it switches around characters  metaphors and entire storylines  Read the book and enjoy Lowry s unadulterated story as it should be appreciated   Holly freaking bananas  This book was awesome I must say that at the beginning I asked myself why the hell was I reading this boring book  The story was really slow  even though it was a short novel But after a while I started to crave for the following chapter  and without noticing  the book was finished The Giver made me realise how much everything is worth it  From colours  to feelings  and most importantly  memories  There are a few quotes that changed me forever  and made me value life so much  It s so deep in so many ways   I think that the ending was the most unexpected thing from the book  It left me with so many questions and so many hypotheses What happened with Gabe and Jonas  Did they die  Was the music Jonas  imagination  What happened with the Giver and the rest of the people from Sameness  Even though I was left with all these queries  I wouldn t have liked any other type of ending  I think it was the most accurate way of ending the book  Somehow  the way it was written  made me feel like Gabe and Jonas found Elsewhere  and lived happily there  while in Sameness  the Giver succeeded with the plan Great book  It should be a must read for the entire population of the Earth   Main Characters  Jonas  a newly 12 year old boy  The Giver  father  mother  and sister Lily  who is 7 as the stort begins  Asher and Fiona  Jonas  best friendsSetting  The community in an undisclosed timeTheme  The importance of individual choice and the risks of conformingSummary  Jonas and his friends nervously await the Ceremony of Twelve  the point at which they learn their adult roles in the community  The selection of career  along with all other important choices are made for the members of the community  They are born to Birth Mothers  cared for by Nurturers  and even assigned their spouses  Nothing is left to individual choice  resulting in a harmonious  worry free existence  Jonas discovers that his perfect world is not so perfect after being selected as the next Receiver of Memory  While all suffering and joy may have been removed from the community  they have not been completely forgotten Target Audience  Middle School  This book is at an upper elementary reading level  but the content is more appropriate for a more YA audience  Curriculum Ties  It serves as an early model of the dystopian society genre  It serves as an early model of the dystopian society genre  It would be a good choice to use as a literature circle book due to its readability and many opportunities for discussion  It would also work well for shared reading or use as a read aloud  if the teacher wanted to focus more on discussion  Awards  Newberry Medal  1994Personal Response  This book is a cautionary tale  It warns the readers against blindly conforming to what is allegedly best for them  The protagonist is a boy of about the same age as the target audience  which makes him very relatable  There are twists and turns along the way  which keep the reader engaged  This book would be a great choice for a shared reading or literature circle group because there is so much to talk about  I thought this book was phenomenal  I have no clue how I have gone this long without ever reading it  I know family members of mine have read it in middle school high school and I haven t until now  If you enjoy plots that are very unlike the world we live in today  you will definitely enjoy it  It s not exactly the same as  but it s quite similar to the Divergent Series in that each person in this community has a specific role to fill The book begins with the main character Jonas describing to us the community he lives in and how his family is seen as more of a unit than a loving family  Every day their are rituals they go through  speaking of their dreams  talking about their feelings  and the days carry on the exact same  The language used by the characters is very interesting  being rude or lying is not an option  Apologies are given quite frequently and are heart felt  All families only have two children and once the parents children reach a certain age  the parents go and live in a different community  It is quite different in that each year a child gets older they receive certain things  a new bike  the privilege to get volunteer hours and the final year  12  their job for the rest of their life I do not want to give away the ending but Jonas is given a special job that he is not allowed to speak about  We learn a lot through his eyes and his training in his  new job   The community they live in seems very odd and it s amazing the things that people do not know about in this setting  I d reccommend reading this if you enjoy unrealistic plots and have a great imagination  I read this book several times many years ago as it was a book I used a novel study when I taught 5th grade  My son  a rising 6th grader  has this had this assigned as his required summer reading and so I decided to give a it a quick read once again to both be able to discuss it with him fully and in preparation for the movie release  It had been 20 years since I last read this novel and it is every bit as good as I remembered  A true classic that stands the test of time  I am excited for my son to start reading it once school gets out   This is such a beautiful book  It is eye opening and poignant in the best way possible  A must read for anyone old or young  This book will make you feel and think in the way only the best books manage to do  Even though  The Giver  by Lois Lowry is considered a young adult fiction classic  the novel should be considered a must read for every adult  It is a refreshing change from the dystopian  undead  vampire fad that has invaded our culture today  Lowry transports to a utopia that keeps the population homeostatic by incorporating the Sameness  No memories  no colors  no choices  Until Jonas is chosen as the Receiver of Memory at his twelve year ceremony and begins his training Lowry delivers an extremely well written tale that incorporates many of the issues we deal with today  ageism  racism  poaching  war  etc  She creates a world void of historic and sentimental memory  Her imagery is flawless  describing the way a boy who has never felt the snow or sun on his skin would experience such sensations for the first time  There several examples throughout the book of learning and experiencing through other people s memories  but the one that stands out is how Jonas first experiences grief in the form of a elephant caring for it s friends body after poachers claim his life  It is riveting Finished this one in less than 24 hours  Everyone should read this masterpiece celebrating the pursuit of individuality and passion through determination and memory  Please  do me a favor and read this one   Now  on to book two   Summarize the book This book follows a boy named Jonas who lives in the perfect world  or so he thought  In Jonas s world there is no war  no pain  and no choices  Everything is chosen for the people by the Elders  from jobs  who is in your family  and how you should act  When Jonas and his friends turn 12  they participate in the annual Ceremony that tells each 12 year old their assignment for life  There are jobs like Caretaker of the Old  Assistant Director of Recreation  and Birthmothers  but when it is time for Jonas to be assigned he is skipped over  We learn that Jonas has been specially picked to be the next Giver  the one who holds all of the memories and knowledge of the way the world use to be  Through his training as the Giver  Jonas learns that his perfect world is not as perfect as he thought and something must be done Identify the characteristics from the text that support the specific genre The Giver fits into the science fiction genre because it depicts a utopian society  It is something that could possible happen  but pushes the limit on what we think society will allow  Identify specific concepts that could be integrated into the classroom Concepts that this book could bring into the classroom include bravery  being different  what it means to be just and fair  and or what leadership is Provide any other suggestions that would be useful regarding literary content  reading level  and other ways in which the book might be integrated This book is listed for grades 5 8  The Giver could also be integrated in a historical way in that you could look at what they thought Utopia looked like  and then what other historical figures in history thought Utopia would look like and compare contrast the two  I don t know how I missed the boat on this book when I was younger    It was first published when I was five  so maybe it was just before my time   when I started reading longer books  I was all about Nancy Drew and only Nancy Drew  I had actually barely heard about The Giver until it was being made into a movie  I didn t make it around to reading the book until after I watched the movie    and that was really only because I really like the movie  I guess I stalled with reading this because it s labeled as a children s book  But it is far from juvenile  It is extremely insightful into human emotions and what makes life meaningful but also has the chance to make it painful  I love the message in this book  It s a heavy children s story  but an important one  I m dying to move on to the next books in the series     and I will read it again           Wonderful book  This book was a great book with theme that memories matter  It takes place in a  Perfect Society  where no goes hungry  there s perfect weather  and every one has an assigned jobs  One thing wrong with this society  is that there are no memories of the past  The people don t know that people before celebrated Christmas  that there was snow  and even memories of love  Jonas the main character  is assigned the special job of The Giver  where he has to hold all the memories for the whole society  When he gets these memories  he realizes that it s wrong that people don t get to hold them and that they help  The Giver says  The worst part of holding the memories is not the pain  It s the loneliness of it  Memories need to be shared   pg 123  This shows how memories are important and that we should value them  In their society  the Giver will never be able to share them with the people he loves  making life dull and sad  In conclusion  this book was a great tale of how much memories really matter to us   This is the first dystopian book I ever read and completely changed my life   o  I now am a dystopian novel junkie    The Giver is possibly one of the best fiction books that I have ever read  The book is set in a futuristic city where each citizen is assigned a job at the age of 12  The main character of the book is a boy named Jonas  and he was assigned to become a Giver  At first he s unsure of the job because on his first day of training he is told that he cannot tell anybody about what he does and he isn t allowed to receive any medicine for an injury that occurs during his training  Since Jonas s people have removed emotions  warfare  crime  and history prior to their establishment they task one person with holding all of those memories  and that person is the Giver  I would recommend this book to anybody who enjoys reading fictions books for the experience gaining some lesson about life in general  The thing that makes the Giver such a good book to read is because of the overall storyline and how it continues to leave the reader on edge wanting to know more and more as they read the book  I love this book because it is an incredibly creative presentation of the importance of free will  I first read it in high school on the recommendation of a friend who had it as assigned reading in elementary school  and picked it up again recently because it is my favorite kind of book to read at the beach    short and plot driven Parents and teachers may also find this book to be an entertaining and effective means to introduce discussions about development  as conveyed by the December ceremonies   puberty  as conveyed by the  Stirrings    sharing feelings  as conveyed by the dinnertime conversation   morality  as conveyed by the decision to lie   retribution  as conveyed by varying degrees of punishment   and the limits of utilitarianism  as conveyed by the training sessions between the Giver and the Receiver   among other things While the reading level suggests that the target audience of this book is the youth  I cannot think of an adult that would not also benefit from a clear and concise lesson on choice  diversity  and the value inherent in the life of each and every person  In the words of hip hop artist DMX   To live is to suffer  To survive  well  that s to find meaning in the suffering   I haven t read a book that held my interest and I was anxious to get back to in a LONG  LONG time  This one did it  And this is a YA book   which I have never read  even as aYA  Lowry visits a time when pain  diversity  choices color  EVERYTHING is gone  all is the same  Memories of the past have been wiped I loved this book and can t wait to read it to my daughter  I was sucked into this story almost immediately  It holds interesting areas for discussion in ethics  unusual social situations  and freaky ponderings of  what ifs  in a world left without choices  The concept of memory is fascinating in this unique presentation of individiual and communal awareness  A GREAT READ with startling implicatons of the nature and  un natural side of mankind  In the book The Giver the main character Jonas is a boy who gets chosen to be the Reciever  An interesting part in this book is when Jonas is chosen to be a reciever  This part turns interesting because I had a lot of questions like  What does the reciever do  What is a reciever  In this book when Jonas is watching the release of a twin this part turns exciting and surprising because Jonas realizes that releasing is killing someone  This part is important because Jonas realizes that the community doesn t know what they re doing and they have no feelings  When Jonas became the reciever it made me curious because I wondered why is he so important  This book is very interesting and I recommend you read it  I didnt know what to expect with this book  but by page 2 I was hooked  Such an interesting concept to explore and every page I wanted to know more and more about Jonas  way of life  I read this book in just a day  loved it  One of the best books I have ever read  It makes you think about how life could be  Antes de dar mi opinion tengo que decir algo que me tuvo en duda casi todo el libro  Tengo la edicion de la pelicula en la que en la tapa aparece un chico   que es Jonas   el Dador y hay dos mujeres que no se quienes son  Es decir  no hay ninguna mujer que tenga tanto protagonismo como para estar en la tapa lo que me lleva a pensar que la pelicula no es muy parecida al libro  todavia no la vi  Decidi leer este libro porque lo vi a un precio muy barato  lo conocia y me llamaba un poco la atencion  La verdad que me gusto muchisimo  la trama es muy buena y atrapante desde la primera pagina aunque puede que sea parecida a algunos libros que lei  ya se que este se escribio primero   No podia dejar de compararlo en algunas partes con  Delirium  de Lauren Oliver  Sin embargo este me gusto mucho mas  Me encanta terminar un libro y disfrutar la sensacion de que leerlo valio totalmente la pena  Es cortito y el final es muy abierto  ya se que tiene una continuacion  pero sin embargo logre encarinarme con Jonas desde el primer momento Lo super recomiendo  I honestly thought that I must have read this before and I think I had convinced myself that this would be a new read  but it doesn t  It turns out that I hadn t read it before  Jonas is a young man about to be age 12 when the story begins  I can t say that he was going to be 12 years old because that wasn t how society counted age  In this community  everyone celebrates advanced from 1   12 as a community  No one has an individual celebration for their birthday  At each age  something new happens  Age 1 is the naming and the children are given to a family and given their name  At age 9  the children get bicycles  At age 12  they are assigned to their jobs  which they will work at for the rest of their lives  how ever long that is because they stop counting age at 12  Jonas is skipped over in the ceremony  which causes him much dismay  but finds out at the end that he has been chosen to be the Receiver of Memory  He meets daily with the current Receiver  who tells Jonas that he will now be the Giver since Jonas has been chosen to be the Receiver  In the community  everyone is the same  There are no bright colors  no extremes of temperature  no hunger  no poor  no rich   everyone is the same  or they are  released   Jonas and the Giver keep the memories of what life was like when everyone was different and there were colors and different temperature and pain and joy and love  During this process  Jonas discovers that being  released  is just a code meaning that they kill the person  He and the Giver start talking about Jonas s need to leave so that the sameness won t continue to be a part of their lives in the community  However  Jonas decides he has to speed up the process of leaving when he discovers that an infant his family has been caring for is scheduled to be released because he is immature and struggling with adapting to his life as it has to be   Best book i have ever read just could not put it down even for a minute  Go run and read this book now just don t read even the synopsis for it will spoil the suspense  The author s style of describing complicated things such as emotions   colors etc was in fact so simple and effective i could clearly see the  sameness   Oops  Stop here if you havent read this book The climax is something that had me mind fucked  I jumped to google immediately apparently looks like so was everyone  This is the first book i am reading that had such an ending where reader is left to imagine their own one  But here is what i thought when i read the end In the meanwhile when Jonas and gabriel are on their journey the giver passes the one year of left behind memories to the community  So the society has now realised what they were missing and invite the memories and changes opposing the sameness  So what jonas and gabriel are seeing is once a similar community now changed and have learnt how horrible they were in sameness and waiting for child and receiver  Now that I ve finished this book  I have only one question for myself How did I never find this book and read it before The Giver is a startling  life changing book  I view it as an elementary type of science fiction  the  first  dystopia  so to speak  that set the standard for recent YA novels  The Giver was dynamic  The beginning of the book was simple yet elaborate  and Lois Lowry painted a picture before my eyes as she described the mannerisms of the people  One boy and girl per family  you must apply for children  no cars  only bikes  age doesn t matter after twelve  your occupation is chosen  your spouse is chosen   Every single aspect of the Giver society is mapped out so perfectly  The dystopia is not overdone or underdone  in my head I picture a world where the residents live in harmony but dark secrets await   And they do  There s a chapter in this book where my view of the Giver society completely changed   it shattered  There s a dark side to every moon  and this society is not exception  AND THE MEMORIES  THE MEMORIES   Lois Lowry turns a memory like the falling of snow into a sheer miracle  and it s hard to imagine how Jonas and his society grew up with such an essential component of life  The painful memories were even harder    Jonas is processing what we go through day to day    he considers torturous what we consider current events    He is living our present  and while it s crippling to him  we hardly think of it  It was just BEAUTIFUL beyond words  But I am excited for Gathering Blue  which I m reading now  I hope it lives up to the Giver s expectations  because I have nothing but adoration for this series right now  I m raving   raving   raving Do you think you are the King Queen of Science Fiction  YA God  You re not  until you read this book     Want to read agan   The Giver is one of my favorite books  This book really makes you think about life and the luxuries you are given that some people aren t  I am someone who really enjoys dystopian books and for me I loved it  When the book started off it was really happy and there was peace all over and no one had experienced hunger  I though it was a Utopian book when it started off  Later towards the book I realized things the children were robbed of like love and music and the small things in life that we don t value that much  It follows the tales of Jonas an 11 year old boy that came from this town  Everything in this town was chosen by the elders  it be your job or who you marry  Jonas was chosen to be the Receiver of Memory that was a really big deal and he learned the reality of life and how it is  A great book I recommend to anyone who loves some Dystopia   My friend lent this book to me  The setup was one of the most intriguing synopses I ve ever read  The moment I had the book on my hand  I felt excitement that I really wanted to read the book right away  which I couldn t do because I was at school So I finally opened this book at home  The beginning was kind of confusing  but engaging at the same time  But it really got more  exciting  the more I read  I mean  even though it is narrated in third person POV  I could quite easily enter into Jonas  character  The more things were revealed about their community  the more was blinded to what were really going on  And that is why it made my heart race every time a truth was unveiled Looking back  this is not really a book I would recommend for someone  as it lacks the  excitement  or fast paced action or events that you d want to see in a movie  However  the book has played so well in stirring emotions and many thoughts within me  I recommend this book to anyone who wants to be left in awe  The Giver is a well written book that grabs onto you and takes you for a ride  Once you start reading this book you wont be able to put it down  This book also contains many themes and morale s applicable to every day life  No one is the same  And that a life with no love and no pain is not a way to live  Jonas and the giver are intricate characters that do not feel as though they belong or should be in a perfect society Lois Lowry describes all of the memories and settings with great detail making you feel as though you are right there with Jonas  For example when the Jonas is seeing color for the first time  it truly makes you think  How would you describe color  What would a world with out color be like  The Giver is one of the best books I haveread and I think that this is a timeless classic everyone should read   Jonas an 11 year old boy living in a seemingly perfect society  Weirdly enough  in this society  there is no choice  your spouses are chosen  your kid is given to you  and your occupation is chosen for you  Jonas  a seemingly ordinary boy  is randomly selected on his 12th birthday to be the apprentice of  The Giver   This was a job he had never heard of  so Jonas was extremely surprised and even scared when he heard he news  Over time  he learns that his new job is the most important in the society  he is supposed to hold all of the memories from how the society was before whether they are good or bad  Over times  these memories began to wear on him and completely change how he acts   what will he do One thing I really liked about this book was the character development  or lack of  throughout the book  At the beginning of the book  Jonas was extremely insecure about the few differences he had like his eye color and desires  As the book progresses  Jonas realizes that these differences are meant to be and becomes confident of himself as a person  Similarly  at the beginning of the book  Jonas was not very emotional and did not display feelings  but as the book ended Jonas is full of emotion and even making decisions off this emotion Another thing I liked about this book was the way society was laid out  Although it was very different  it was still interesting to see the theories of how people would react to a society with no choice  Ultimately the downfall was through something that wouldn t actually happen in real life  so it leaves me wondering if this type of society would work in real life    The Giver  by Lois Lowry  is a teenage classic and surprisingly suspenseful Newbery Medal winner of 1994  At the beginning of the book  the main character  Jonas  is apprehensive about his ceremony of twelve  Then he finds out that his job is to be the Receiver of Memory  who has to hold all of the memories given to him from the Giver  because all the other people in the community can t handle all of the memories  Everyday after he receives his assignment  he goes to the Annex room to receive more memories from the Giver  He likes it at first  but then he has to take in some of the painful memories  like a sunburn  and breaking his leg from sledding down an icy hill  Jonas and the Giver devise a plan to help the community get used to having lots of memories  Jonas has to leave the community and never come back or he would be released  He takes a baby named Gabriel who would be released the next day  At the end  he and Gabriel are sliding down a snowy hill in elsewhere because they ran away from home  The book ends halfway down the hill leading readers to read what happens after they get to the bottom of the hill  I think this is a fast paced book good for 12 and up and maybe advanced 11 or 10 year old  It can also good for adults who want fast paced adventure  not action  From reading this book  I like it because she makes the unthinkable become thinkable  The Giver fascinated me as a child  I loved the world that Lowry created  Then  read it as a college student and wrote a paper on it   got an entirely different meaning  Great read for adults and children    was a little creeped out when I first started reading this story  I almost didn t continue  It seemed like some kind of freaky for a fundamentalist society where everyone obeys without question and acts all fake nicey nice and pretends everything is fine when it s not  I kept reading just to find out why the book is so popular  I really liked it once I found out what was going on  It s the opposite of what I thought at first   Loved The Giver  This is one of book that you want to get to its end without actually finishing it  you just want to keep on reading Very deep and thought provoking  Happiness is beneficial for the body  but it is grief that develops the powers of the mind  Marcel ProustI read this book years ago  in my late twenties  and I remember liking it  but I realize now I didn t fully grasp the subtle lessons  the hidden truths  found in THE GIVER until rereading it after two decades of living Having gained twenty years of sorrow and joy  I appreciate this book more  The question of  Why is there pain   causes more people to lose their faith in a supreme being  causes many people every year to take their own lives  causes the lonely and hurting to fall into the depths of hopelessness  But pain in life is necessary  This book shows why And sometimes we even choose to hurt emotionally or physically  We want to hurt sometimes because not hurting would mean we are robots  I ve learned that lesson recently through my own situations and my friends  situations  Lois Lowry shows us through her storyteller why a person would actually crave facing hardship  The alternative would be the world she created in THE GIVER  The Giver by Lois Lowry is one of my all time favorites  I read it when I was in 6th grade but I couldn t really remember the details of the end  so I reread it  I could not put this book down  I didn t really appreciate the piece when I was younger  but I love it so much more now  I wish there was just more  More of the story and more of what happens next  I love how the author does not use adult language strenuously  so I understand it easier and it is much easier to make complete inferences instead of having to use context clues all the time unlike some books  I also love the overall plot and idea of the story  It s so remarkably smart and being in another world  a futuristic world  you get to understand what consequences come with what future  Overall  I d recommend everyone read this book  especially since the movie will come out very soon  read this book  any time  any age    view spoiler  The GiverBy  Lois Lowry 180 pages Jonas did not want to go back  He didn t want the memories  didn t want the honor  didn t want the wisdom  didn t want the pain  He wanted his childhood again  his scraped knees and ball games  He sat in his dwelling alone  watching through the window  seeing children at play  citizens bicycling home from uneventful days at work  ordinary lives free of anguish because he had been selected  as others before him had  to bear their burden    Page 121 Jonas was a plain and ordinary boy  in a plain and ordinary life  The community makes every decision for him  down to the clothes he wears to the food he eats  down the day he was  released   Then on assignment day  everything changes  While his friends receive ordinary  almost plain  jobs  He alone is chosen to become the next Receiver  He will bear the burdens for an entire society  Jonas quickly comes to realize from his teacher the people have undergone a change called samed   They feel no sorrow  and no pain  Everyone is equal  For the comunity there is no color  no music  no fire  no rain or sun  Worst of all  they no longer had memories of love or happiness  they had never experienced powerful emotions  They were all the same in a black and white world  Except for Jonas  His teacher the Giver taught him everything  gave him memories through a special power they shared in their role as the Receiver  The Giver had the memories of thousands of people stored in his head  but now he had given them to his successor  Jonas  My favorite part of this book was at the end  When Jonas was fleeing from the Elders  and his community with nothing but a bike  some food  and a baby who was sentenced to death  He struggles through the wilderness experiencing some of the memories he holds  in person  At one point he comes to a realization  Gabriel had not cried during the long frightening journey  Now he did  He cried because he was hungry and cold and terribly weak  Jonas cried  too  for the same reasons  and another reason as well  He wept because he was afraid now that he could not save Gabriel  He no longer cared about himself   I think Jonas discovered what love really is  A care for another person s well being over your own  He now had two people who he loved more than anything  the Giver  and little Gabriel The theme of this book could be interpreted in many ways  The largest one in my mind though is the blessing of free will  How often do we forget  even disregard the one thing that allows us to have all that we have  Freedom  gives us a choice  The Giver and Jonas  at one point realized how unsafe and dangerous it would be for people to make their own choices  Because they might choose wrong  I would say that  people do choose wrong more often than not  but we learn from those experiences  Through those wrong choices we make they make us stronger  They let us learn The conflict was an internal as well as an external pressure  The community choose everything for him  so when the time came for him to choose what he wanted to do he had to have an enormous amount of courage  He was faced with outside pressure and punishment when he didn t do what was required  In the end he triumphed over both and choose a new path for himself Jonas grew a lot between the beginning and the end  He surpassed the knowledge of even his elders and took on a great responsibility  He started out as a humble child content to do whatever he was told  whatever he was directed to do  As he grew though he realized his want and need for independence  His yearning for free will  At the end he takes action and leaves the comforts of his old life to strike out on his own  To try and give some memories back to the community  Behind him  across vast distances of space and time  from the place he had left  he thought he heard music too  But perhaps it was only an echo   This was the last sentences of the book  It defiantly ended on a cliff hanger  but never the less it was satisfying  The ending was probably the most action filled part  though the whole book was good  If I could write to the author I would immediately congratulate her on such a well done book  She made it exciting and pleasantly enjoyable  Her characters and plot were fantastic and engaging  She sped things along and didn t hang on one subject for too long  Making it interesting and fast paced  I reallllllly loved the Giver  On a scale of 1 5 I would rate this a five star book  I can t wait for the next books   hide spoiler   another classic from childhood The book is a interesting book for young adult readers  The book is great when it comes to story telling  But a great weakness for the book is it can be boring for readers that are new to Lois Lowery s books or a really picky reader  Also the whole giver quartet never has a official timeline  The books don t explain what time or place is given  or what book comes when  That doesn t mean because Gathering Blue comes right after The Giver because it s the second book in the series  For God sake it could be a sequel or a prequel  or even the last story in The Giver Universe  I may be over reacting  or maybe im not correct  But that s my opinion  Wow   why I m I just now in this point of my life reading this book  I really enjoyed it and I must note that I listened to it on audio and the narrator is fantastic   This is one book that is very upsetting  yet very good at the same time  It concerns a young boy  Jonas  living in a community which is run by extremely rigid rules could with a  thank you for sharing  mentality about some things  Each person has to follow a very strict code of behavior and  ultimately  the career they end up in is determined by others  not themselves It s also a world of sameness  think  Lathe of Heaven   and predictability  Behavior is controlled by drugs  upbringing  with it s own version of brainwashing   and murder  It s also a community where love simply doesn t exist Jonas is assigned to take over from an individual named The Receiver who will now become The Giver while Jonas becomes the new Receiver  The Giver transmits memories of things that might be pleasant  but also memories of things that are painful  Gradually  through both  Jonas  eyes are opened to the real world that he lives in and just how far people will go to justify not having any problems in the community such as crime or any other form of negative behavior In effect  Jonas is living in the world of a cult  for all practical purposes The events can be upsetting and I would suggest that parents be ready to discuss the book with their children should they read it  The book even includes some Questions for Discussion to help this Also upsetting  perhaps even frightening in parts  it s still an excellent book and well worth reading      SPOILER FREE     The Giverby Lois LowryI love this story     I absolutely love it   My first impression was that I would sleep the whole way through but as the first pages are told you are hooked  This was very mysterious and had me guessing the entire time   I loved the story and characters depicted in the novel and the way the story was told it wasn t too fast nor too slow  A perfect dystopian read and had if you think a little deeper as to the message of the story you might find some comparisons in your life  I would recommend to middle schoolers and older   I felt this book was very good  I loved how Lois Lowry made the book so that we had to figure out what was going  At first I had no clue that the characters had lived in a world that was all the same  Also she gives us clues to what we are going to learn in the future  In the book  we here about Jonas slowly seeing colors like when he sees the apple change when it is in the air  Then later we find out that people before Jonas got rid of everything that was different In the book  Jonas notices that the stuff around him is changing slightly as the drawing for jobs comes up  During the drawing of the jobs they skip Jonas  Then they come back to him after a while and they tell him that he is the receiver  Everybody is shocked that this is happening  For the weeks after Jonas gets the memories from the giver  Later Jonas says that he is going to runaway so that all of the memories will go to the whole town this way everyone can have color  He leaves with Gabe and they end their journey almost dieing at the top of a hill where there is a sled  Then it just ends I can connect to the book because I know that Jonas and I are both the same age  I could not imagen being a 13 year old who had to risk there life just to make others happier  I could not imagen living a life that had everything the same   The center of the story is a twelve year old boy Jonas who has been chosen a most honored and unique Assignment of them all in a dystopian society he lives in  Community  Jonas and the Giver who aids him in training for the Assignment  decide to take the faith of their Community into their own hands  Not only the greatest honor  but also the toughest mission lies ahead of Jonas and his little friend Gabriel  At first sight  the title seems ordinary  almost bare  prompting no intriguing effects or feelings on the reader  On the other hand  however  its simplicity might suggest the lack of something  perhaps of some human quality  need  or physical matter  that needs to be restored   or better to say  given  Fortunately  there are Jonas and the Giver  who deal with a topical issue of what is lacking in Community  Jonas  especially  may be perceived as Christ or a Saviour  who takes it all on himself and makes changes  There is also little Gabriel who  at first sight  does not contribute much to the story and is  therefore  not given a special attention  Despite the latter  I believe Lowry wants to provoke the reader and find his significance to the story himself herself  The book requires a certain degree of general knowledge in order to grasp its message  It is wonderfully and vividly written  with a simple language for teenagers up to adults to read it with ease  Do not get deceived by the language  however   Sameness  a place where Community lives  does not seem black and white after all  The conclusion tends to be somewhat rushed and utterly ambiguous   The story about a thought provoking question of one s freedom  safety  individuality  and society s welfare entails an open mind and time to think it over  This is a story that sets us on the verge and makes us expect the unexpected  This is a story for the brave  the story of heroes for the heroes  I LOVED the Giver  My friend had been telling me to read it for a long time and now I understand why  It s one of my favorite books  and I tried to shorten my list down from about 10 to 3 or 4  so that s saying a lot  Anyways  my point is that I really liked the giver I didn t really understand how there was no color  I mean  no one had ever heard of color or knew what it is  Here  we take colors and feelings for granted  I can t imagine a world without color  In the book  neither Jonas nor Rosemary wanted to be the receiver  If I lived in that community  I would want to be a receiver  I would want to see the colors that should be seen  and feel the feeling that should be felt  I know that it would painful  but I would choose having pain mixed with other feelings over having none If I were the giver  I would not have encouraged Jonas to leave  It is a privilege to be a receiver and be able to see colors and have feelings  If a receiver who had received so many memories left  the whole community would be crashing down into chaos  Those memories needed to be passed down to more and more generations  Although  I do understand how the giver might have felt  He became extremely close to Jonas and did not want to cause him the pain that he had caused Rosemary when he had had no more happy memories to give to her I think it was a good idea to take Gabriel with him  Jonas   I never thought that Jonas  dad would vote for Gabe to be  released   Jonas ended up loving Gabriel and would never want him to be killed I wonder how Jonas  parents felt when they found out that Jonas had run away  I would be sad  but also worried  while praying that he was safe  I  myself was really glad when Jonas decided to take Gabriel with him  I would have been devastated if Gabe had been  released   I really  really  really  really  really liked this book and I hope more people get to read and enjoy this wonderful book by Lois Lowry    So yesterday I was assigned to read this book along with my fellow peers for English class this semester  At first it looked  Yes  from the cover  rather dull  I mean who wants to read a book with an old  grief stricken man for cover art  But the first page itself spoke for the book  I was captivated just after reading the first passage  and books with a great beginning tend to be hard to find So it s about an 11  soon to be 12  year old kid named Jonas  But wait  His  parents  call him by his birth NUMBER when he does something wrong  who is anxious for his  assignment  come December  But this is no ordinary assignment  this kind of work determines the rest of your life  The few years of training until you become a fully trained worker in this messed up society terminally diseased with a bad infection of Sameness  I say the word infection because other communities are similar to Jonas   Citizens can make no choices whatsoever  The Council of Elders give you this job  this spouse  these 2 children  For you have women who are assigned to merely give birth  others are forbidden to conceive   And the thing is that the communities  individuals are not aware of Sameness  for it s always been like that  before their grandparents  and the generation before their grandparents  and  as Jonas often completes  back and back and back Back to the summary   Now the fateful day arrives where all ages from newchilds  new borns  to 12 year olds have a huge  grand ceremony where everyone drops their daily jobs and volunteering to watch the 7 year olds get new ribbons and the 9 year olds squealing over bikes  But the most important event of the two day ceremony is the  assignments  the 12 year olds get  Seriously that is most probably the highlight of your life if you happened to be a citizen of that kind of community  Most adults even lose track of how old they are after their 12th ceremony  So as Jonas watches all of his friends and classmates receiving their assignments with sweaty hands or confident smiles  he is singled out and is proudly announced  with great honour  as the Receiver  A Receiver is a person who receives  obviously  memories of the past which was so much more different than their present day  The memories are full with happiness  grieve  agony  and much more unfamiliar emotions and objects Jonas is fascinated with  But getting all these fascinating flashes from the past caused so much pain to both Jonas and his Giver  the elderly looking man who had been a Receiver once upon a time  To relieve the Giver from so much torture after keeping gruesome memories of war  starvation  loneliness  and death in his head for decades  Jonas has to take the burden now  before the Giver becomes too old and senile  on the verge of  release   My class and I were assigned to read the first 5 chapters for the week  but I enjoyed the book very much I finished the whole thing within two days  It was an easy read with a catchy plot and the ending still has this effect on me  I heartily recommend it to everyone  Such an enjoyable story that you won t be leaving easily  I read this book to my children  ages 9   11  and they were absolutely riveted  Lowry slowly reveals the true nature of the idyllic Community  where Jonas and his family live  and the issues with their philosophy of  Sameness   In exchange for the safety and security offered by life in the Community  its people have lost a lot of what we take for granted  Is it a fair exchange  I had great talks with my children after each chapter  The vocabulary seems right on target for what an 11 year old should know  or be able to determine from context  I had to explain words and meaning more to the 9 year old  but she followed the story with no problems  I imagine this book was banned for references to  Stirrings   Jonas is 12  what on earth could  Stirrings refer to      and euthanasia  Again  both kids were able to handle these issues   This is another title you ve probably heard about  To my adult friends who won t touch children s books  The only difference between a typical adult novel and this novel is the absence of language  sex and the degree of violence  Then when you consider the premise of this novel  a sanitized  purified ultra controlled future  not clear if it s our planet or similar one   then these elements will not be missed  The Giver is the old man who  alone  keeps all the memories of how things used to be   ALL the pleasures and the pains  The Receiver is Jonas  a 12 year old boy  who is chosen to be the next keeper of memories and  one memory at a time  learns the harsh truth of what it means to have a lack of freedom and the harsher and harsher truths of his supposed utopia   and the worst being that nobody will understand what he s going through  so there is nobody with which he can share his troubles  Heartbreaking  thrilling and even a  non Hollywood  ambiguous ending make this a classic  If you are old enough to legally have a Facebook account  this is a must read  Although it started out a little slow  and I was unsure of what was happening  I ended up really enjoying this book  Once I got through the first few chapters  it became a real page turner  I got really excited when I went to the movies to see  The Fault In Our Stars  and saw a preview for  The Giver   I cannot wait to see the movie later this year The Giver is about a young boy named Jonas  who lives in a futuristic society where everything is orderly and planned out for you  Children celebrate their  birthdays  on the same day  Nothing in this society is by chance or coincidence  Families and jobs are carefully coordinated by the Elders  Jonas has been selected as the new Receiver  a position in which he has to take on the memories of the past  It is deemed as an honorable position  and at first Jonas does not agree nor want this delegated job  As Jonas gets to know The Giver  who s position he is overtaking  Jonas comes to learn of times of old when people made choices and showed and felt emotion  He experiences good and bad feelings and events  and then Jonas realizes that the society in which he lives isn t all that it appears to be  and is determined to bring it back to times of the past  I highly recommend this book for middle school and high school classes  There are so many themes which can be taught   The book The Giver is an amazing jaw dropper  Its main character Jonas lives in an utopia when he finds out its a distopia  Its a book that seems like you have to grow up too fast  IT seems that way because you have to get a job when you are twelve  For example  the Chief Elder chooses their job for them and if they don t like their jobs they have to stay in them until they are to old to work  But the book has its ups and downs  It began really bland but then the salt and pepper came  action  adventure  etc   In my personal opinion this book was a little too bland but too me that s how i feel about this book   I gave this book five stars not because it is just the best book ever omg  I gave it five stars because the first time I read this book I was a child  this was the first book that opened my eyes to the worlds books had to offer and the effect they could have on us  not only was this the first dystopian book I read  but it opened my mind up to new way of thinking  the idea of everyone being the same seems easy enough to grasp  but trying to understand what would be like to not know the feeling of love or family or hurt or sunshine    it all was a completely new experience for me  their lack of feeling made me feel  I think this book deserves five stars for the audience it reaches at the age they are  it created a thirst for reading and adventure through words in me as im sure it did has does will in many young minds  this kind of thinking reaching a young mind is five star worthy  read this book  its worth every second  A quick but amazing read  It s a glimpse into life without choice  where everything is the same until someone risks changing life as everyone knows it  For some reason it impacted me as a parent  I m so tempted to make my children s lives safe   not entirely a terrible thing   at the cost of taking away some of their individuality and life experience  I was challenged by this book to really let them live  The mother in me cringes at what this might mean  If you read this book  be prepared for lots of introspection to follow   Beautiful  Aesthetic  Stunning  Outstanding  Such a remarkable prose  This novel features the life of Jonas  living with his own family in a place where people live the life of Sameness  One thing is for sure  the people are naive of pain  of colors  of weather and of the unacceptable killings that they do without hesitations  The 179 page book shows us the struggle of a child in knowing the truth  Yeah  I agree with the author s perception of the truth  It can really inflict pain  Jonas  journey to understanding his own identity and his own society is really painful  confusing and shocking  as what was shown in this book  The truth  as I observed in this book  shall really set you free  Here s a link to my blog http   yabookloversunite blogspot comFirst Impressions after reading the book I found this book super interesting  I liked the idea of a prefect world  and how each December they went up a sort of  Class  in the community  It s hard to give a first impression without giving away spoilers  it s best to start this book with only a a vague synopsis  So go read the book and come back __________________________________________________________________________    SPOILERS AHEAD    __________________________________________________________________________The Characters Jonas is a nice character  Always asking questions  I think that if we didn t have such a strong main character  this book wouldn t be as enjoyable  I wished though that we could have seen bigger development between him and Fiona Jonas s Family is a bit bland I think  His Father I didn t like at all  He was really actually sour  I couldn t believe he was killing babies and lying about it so easily  Lily was really cute  I liked how Jonas took them under his wing I enjoyed The Giver s character a lot  And I didn t at all expect Rosemary to be his daughter  but at the same time I thought it was a bit weird for an old man to fall in love with a 12 year old girl   DThe Ending Even if the plot twist weren t very dramatic  I didn t see them coming  I had no idea that the world was black and white  and for the releases I knew that something strange was going on  But I was a bit confused by the ending  I couldn t figure out if Jonas died or not  I think he probably did  with the music playing and the light  But maybe we ll know more in the next book  Gathering Blue which I can t wait to read Rating 4 5 5 starsThis book was super interesting  definitely going to see the movie  But this is not the most action packed book so beware My blog address http   yabookloversunite blogspot com The Giver1 September 2015 I thought this book was very effective because it really made me want to keep reading it for hours on end  It also was not a very difficult read in my opinion it was an average read  I thought this book s strengths were how it always kept you wondering what was next or what was going to come up  For example the choosing ceremony made me wonder what was going to happen to Jonas and how it was going to affect his life  This story makes the reader wonder what it would be like to live in a such a controlled environment  It makes the reader appreciate the freedom we have to choose what we want to do  I would recommend this story to anyone who enjoys reading fiction  The story has many interesting characters that would appeal to a variety of people   I absolutely love this book  It was such a great message and really makes you think about the decisions that are made between  what is best for people  and the decisions of  free will    This creative  yet odd narrative story is about a cult  They have strange rules like  one female and one male per family and girls have to have ribbons in their hair until age nine  I also thought it was strange that they have women assigned to birthing three children and they are given to the families instead of the parents having their own children  Adults are permitted from seeing each other naked unless it is an infant or an elder  The people of the community have rules to follow and they move up into a new group of numbers every December when a ceremony is held  The numbers range one through twelve  and once the children become Twelves  they receive their job for the community  A young boy  Jonas  became a twelve and was actually skipped over as they called the children in birth order to announce their jobs  He was startled  and was eventually called up last  Jonas was given the Receiver of Memory  which is a very honorable and difficult job  Jonas has a little sister  Lily  who is a Seven in the beginning of the story  Jonas s father is a Nurturer and takes care of children until they are given to their families  I also thought it was odd how children are not given names until the ceremony in December  so some children are born in January and are only called by the number they were born in that year  For example  a child born third within the year are known as Three and the community has their names planned on a list already  After Jonas becomes a Receiver of Memory  he finds out all of the secrets the community does not know about and wants to tell everyone  Even though he is permitted to share them with anyone  he shares his memories with a child named Gabriel  his father is nurturing  to help him sleep at night  Later on  The Giver describes to Jonas that the community has developed a  Sameness   The Giver and Jonas came up with a plan to help the community  A few days later  the community decided to release Gabe because he was not sleeping at night  Jonas thought on his feet  continuing with the plan and saving Gabe I noticed that the front cover has The Giver in gray on it and there is a forest like picture torn next to him in color  I think the forest is a picture toward the end of the story when Jonas is running from the community and hiding from the planes that detect heat  The story makes me glad that my life is not like that  I have rules in my life  but my rules are not that strict and I am able to learn as much as I want about life For my classroom  I would develop a thematic discussion about the book  I used http   www randomhouse com teachers c    as a source for finding ideas  I would divide students into groups of two or three and give them a worksheet that has the following categories  Family  Diversity  Euthanasia  and Feelings  Each category will list questions  as listed on the website  After giving the students about twenty to twenty five minutes to discuss the questions  we will go over the different answers students gave  By doing this activity  the students will understand the concept and meaning of the book more  It will also provide categories to discuss  rather than looking at the whole with a huge variety of topics  This book has a lexile of 760 and a guided reading level of Y  This book has an interest level that begins in third grade  but I would not expect a student to read this independently until sixth grade  I feel this book has many difficult things to grasp and should be discussed after reading a few chapters at a time so that the students do not get lost   I chose to listen to The Giver by Lois Lowry  The Giver is an extraordinary book about a utopian society  There is no war  disease  or suffering  Along with the seemingly perfect society  each individual within the society has their fate decided when they are assigned a position  The main character  Jonas  is chosen to become the next Receiver of Memory  which is the highest position of honor  Jonas begin training with the Giver and is exposed to the evils of the world  He has difficulty coping with the memories of the past and wants others to know the truth about the world  The Giver is a great instructional tool for a junior high classroom  It provides a platform for teachers and students to discuss many issues in society  Students can make connections between societal norms as well as connections to their lives  I would highly suggest this book to teachers and for students who are interested   This was an amazing book  This story is told from the perspective of Jonas  an eleven year old boy whose life is perfect  Everything around him is perfect and under control  No war  no pain  and no choices  Society has already made the choices for you  BUT  if you choose to disobey any rules  there will be major consequences  At the age of twelve  each child receives a life assignment  Jonas receives the Assignment of Receiver of Memory  which is an extremely honorable job in this society  With this new job  he discovers a man The Giver  The genre of this book is Science Fiction  I rated this book a five because I loved reading about how this so called  perfect  world wasn t as perfect as Jonas thought  The dominant themes in this book are leadership  courage  family  and government  I believe this book would be great for grades 5 8  This was such a good book  I can t believe I ve never read it or really heard of it before  I found it on a list of books that were like Divergent  I think  It was written back in the 90s and it must have come out right about the time when I felt like I was too cool for young adult books and was trying to read classics and adult books This book shows a 12 year old boy who is about to be assigned his apprenticeship job in his society  The boy is very nervous about what it ll be  Their society has a ceremony for kids every year of their lives until they reach this sort of pinnacle at 12  His sister was excited because she was getting a bike at the 9 year ceremony  They are watched and observed constantly by their leaders  These leaders know their interests and abilities and take these into account when assigning the jobs to the kids  Everything seems to be controlled by their government  The kids are given to them by the government after being requested and each family is limited to one boy and one girl   They are given because one of the jobs in their society is to be a baby maker  forget what they call it  The boy is given his assignment and it is a unique one that was very unexpected  Through his apprenticeship he learns more about his society and his family and he makes a difficult choice  After making this choice  the book kind of endeded abruptly and left me hanging  It was a rather big choice which should have some big repercussions  and I don t feel like the story resolved itself at all  I guess I ll have to read the next one   I ve been wanting to read this book for a long time  and I m so glad I finally got around to it  I actually read this in one sitting The world is paradise   in this community  there is no war  minimal pain  and constant harmony  Jonas is rapidly approaching 12  when his future career will be chosen for him  He has no idea what to expect  but is chosen for a role he has never before heard of  the Receiver  who is the holder of the community s collective memory  He goes to train with the Receiver  and in the process learns more about his world and the price his community pays for such bliss This book seems to me like the forerunner of YA Dystopia  and I really enjoyed this one  The premise is simple compared to a lot of the more recent offerings  but I thought it was really well done  Some of the ways in which Jonas s world is controlled were really unexpected  and I liked how it ended  Perhaps I ll read the next ones in the series  This book was read for the PopSugar 2015 Reading Challenge as a book I can finish in a day  The Giver is a dystopian story on a society that has lived for many generations devoid of real emotion  complication and or pain  The Giver is a keeper of memories which include pain  hope  love  etc  The Giver is old and must pass on the memories to his successor   the receiver    Jonas  The residents of the  community  are contributing members of society  reaching adulthood at the age of 12  and given an assigned life job at the 12 year ceremony  I have to give the author  much deserved credit for such an amazing portrayal of a society built on practicality  The simplistic writing is superb and allows the reader the impression of a perfect society   perfected by mistakes of the past  Lois Lowry has written a classic  a beautifully written portrayal of society s worse fate  dehumnaization  The story is well written and I would love for my children to pick it up and eat this story up  Jonas  the hero of this story  is a curious  intelligent and without his prior knowledge  a loving child  He s chosen to be the  Receiver  for a community who has none  The community s basic function is survival of the fittest  those who do not conform to this society as  released  and life continues  There is joy  but no love  there is perfection of language but no freedom to openly express oneself sans committing an infraction  Without giving much away  this story has a lovely  open ended conclusion that offers hope for love again where love was lost  I couldn t recommend it more to anyone looking to feel warmth inside when sometimes surrounded by cold   This book is about a supposed utopian society  Everyone is the same  they are given the same clothes to be worn at a certain age  and in every age every girl and guy have a certain haircut  and a present that they recieve  They are all given the same amount of food  Their spouses are also designated  as well as their jobs  They are paired by a council who thinks that everything they do is right  But there is one kid who wants to step out of that  he is different from the other kids because his designated job is to be a giver  He wants to see color and individuality again in his own world Jonas   the protagonist  unlike the rest  has mixed emotions  and sexual feelings  These types of things are not present in this society  This book shows that a Utopian society could never exist because everyone has different views on certain aspects  It is not good to supress someone into not letting them do anything I rate this book 5 stars because it I really like how it shows the impossibilities of ever having a utopia  This book had me hooked from the beginning  I was immediately curious to discover the secrets of the strange society the protagonist was born into  Soon however the focus of the novel turned from exploration to address its theme and purpose  In it a young boy living in a society where every aspect of life is dictated experiences the combined memories of humanities past  He is meant to be the vessel through these memories of emotion and struggle are kept alive  This is necessary because in his town struggle and emotion are a thing of the past  They have been suppressed in individuals to the point non existence for the sake of order and efficiency  This book delves into our understanding of the trade offs between liberty and security  emotion and reason  and morality and efficiency  The deeper lever of understanding it allowed me to achieve secured its  3 spot on my favorite books list   Sometimes reading a young adult s book is a waste of time  they tend to be like an empty pop song   catchy but upon closer inspection lacking in depth and meaning  Every once in a while however  you find a classic  and The Giver is in that realm It is a story about a utopian  cult like community where emotions and lives are closely monitored and structured  The story s protagonist  Jonas  is a 12 year old boy who thinks about things a little differently  he has the power to  see beyond  and uses his mind in a powerful way  He desires the truth and has the courage to follow this desire as far as it will lead him The main topic of this book is emotions   are they worth it  In the community  emotions have been carefully regulated and essentially flat lined  people even lack the ability to see colors  The Giver is the keeper of memory  the one responsible for holding onto them in order to spare everyone else of the anguish and difficulty of feeling  This is a philosophical spring board into a wealth of questions regarding the value of emotion  the responsibility or burden of carrying memories with you  the question of whether to obey prescribed rules or the murmurings of your heart What distinguishes this book as extraordinary is the craft and depth of the story  The setting and situation faced by the protagonist are well constructed  allowing the imagination to color in between the lines described by the author  The depth is also remarkable  this is the sort of story that will make students think deeply on issues  debate the books eagerly  and in turn deepen their own personal philosophies  Books that manage to tell an interesting story while deepening self understanding are rare gems  especially at a level that middle schoolers can access  The Giver is one of these books  put simply  a classic  Finally read this again after so many years  I believe I first read this in the 6th grade and loved it to pieces then  It stayed with me all these years  though I could not remember the storyline exactly  so I decided to reread it So glad I did  I really enjoyed the book this second time  and I understand why I had been so enraptured with it originally  My adult take on it is slightly different  as I would have liked it expanded  Jonas  time with the Giver to be detailed more to really give his character more depth  give more length to the time leading up to Jonas  leaving  etc  But for a book for middle schoolers  it was fabulous I still hated the ending for its ambiguity  and it hit me much more this time now that I m a mother  thinking that the two boys may have died  Picturing poor little Gabriel freezing to death with Jonas brought tears  Definitely a different depth of emotion this time around I didn t realize that there were sequels to this book  and I m intrigued as to how the author can continue this storyline  I ll be reading those next  I love this book  I first read it at 13  for my English as a second language class  and  at the time  I didn t really understand the multiple meanings and lessons that can be extracted from this novel  I found the beginning to be a little long and the ending a little to obscur A few years later  at a time when questions about society and individuality were big for me  this book helped me answer some of them and helped me put things into perspective  Since  then  I have re read many times this amazing book and  every time  I find a new meaning I have had many friends and family members read it  and all gave me rave reviews Good for all ages  Anybody could read this book  It is very good and interesting  It is about a family that lives in a community that is very plain  They do the same thing everyday and they have no real life expieriences  At the ceremony Jonas is chosen as  The reciever of memory   He know works with the giver  They work on everything and Jonas finds out being released from the community is actually being killed  Not to metion his dad does it  He and the giver decide that Jonas should leave the community in order to help them and give them the memories he has  But Jonas finds out gabe his little brother is getting release the next day  So he takes gabe with him and the go on the adventure to find the destination  Summary  The Giver is a book about a Utopian world  The main character is an eleven year old boy named Jonas  Jonas lives in a world with no pain  war  or fear  however  his world also has no color  emotion  or real passion  Each child has a job chosen for them when they turn twelve  and Jonas is the one chosen to receive all the memories of the past including memories of love  war  and true happiness  When Jonas realizes what he has been missing out on his whole life  he is determined to escape to Elsewhere Genre  Fantasy science fictionClassroom Use  I would have all my students read this book  and would either have them read it independently or use it as a read aloud and read a chapter every day for the end of the day story time  I would use this to teach students about the concept of a Utopian world  and to get my students to think about and question the world around them Writing traits  Organization  The book is organized well and presents ideas in a logical order  Word Choice  The book contains a lot of very descriptive vocabulary that helps the reader visualize the scenery when Jonas is receiving memories Interest Level  5th 8th gradeReading Level  5 9 You can also read this review on my blog In short  The Giver by Lois Lowry is clearly a very special book with a profound thoughtfulness to it that I don t usually see in the dystopians of today I have certainly read my fair share of dystopians and at this point they have all started to blend together as I inevitably end up seeing the same trends and tropes over and over again  So to read The Giver  a classic in the dystopian genre  after all this time and after reading tons of newer dystopians that follow the same basic outline  is a strange experience  Here  in The Giver is the origination of many of the themes and motifs that populate the dystopians of today and yet I didn t first come by these common dystopian trends with the originator  but with the followers But thankfully  The Giver didn t read to me as  been there  done that  as many dystopians do these days  Even with the same basic format that I ve seen again and again in this genre  The Giver brought to the table a profound thoughtfulness that I don t usually see in the dystopians of today  The Giver keeps things simple when it comes to world building  which would normally be a problem for me in any other book in the same genre  but here it works because it puts the focus on the important messages of the novel  rather than in the details of the world I am SO late to this party  but I m glad I have finally read this classic novel  The Giver is clearly a special book and it doesn t surprise me that it is often a staple in classrooms for study  I do regret that I never read it in school growing up because it would have been a great and powerful introduction not only to the dystopian genre  but to many profound life lessons  I am pretty doubtful that the movie adaptation will do this book justice  Thoughts Question to those who have read the entire series  is it a must for me to read the final three books  I am a bit conflicted about the end of The Giver because part of me feels it is incomplete  but another part of me thought the book on the whole to be a solid read and I don t want my experience of it to be ruined  I read this for school  I absolutely loved it  When it turned to a movie I was completely excited  Please read  You won t understand it at first but it will become amazing After living his whole life in a community with no choices  12 year old Jonas finally sees a different way of life by receiving memories of the past from his mentor The Giver  He sees how life should be  Now it s up to him  will he risk his own life for the betterment of the lives of everyone else  Although the ending seems ambiguous  I love how Lois Lowry emphasized in the end what s truly important  the betterment of an entire society  This book is awesome for any lovers of dystopian fiction books      and all thinkers in general  No matter how old you are or if you ve read this book before  it will make you think something new  I read this book twice  The first time  I read it in one night  which I rarely do  The second time  I finished it in two nights  It s basically about a 12 year old boy named Jonas who lives in a perfect world  There is no crime  no poverty  no illness  Everyone is happy and all is well  Then he and his friends are given their careers  Jonas gets the job of retaining memories of how things used to be  before the world became a perfect place to live  He visits an old man called  The Giver  who is the one who gives Jonas the memories  Over time  as Jonas receives these memories  his entire view of the world changes as he learns what is real and what he has been taught  For example  he starts to see color  Apparently  this peaceful  ideal world is in black and white  I thought this was a fantastic idea  Then Jonas stopped taking pills that he  his friends  and adults take  These pills inhibit sexual desire  In fact  no one has sex  There are birth mothers who carry babies and that is how the human race continues  Well  when Jonas stops taking these pills  he starts getting these desires  such as falling in love with his childhood girl friend  He also recalls pain  illness and war  So it s not all pleasant stuff that he s being taught  This book is actually more gloomy than books I typically read but the author did a terrific job of pulling me into Jonas  world and I had to keep wondering what was going to happen next  Some of it made me cry   spoiler alert  He discovers that babies who aren t developing normally are euthanized and when the elderly reach a certain age  they are euthanized as well  But you see  the people in this world are told that the babies are going to another family and that the elderly are having a big party before they head off somewhere else  It is Jonas  love that develops for the baby his father brought home to nuture  because the baby wasn t developing normally  he had delays in his development  that leads Jonas to run away with the baby before the baby can be euthanized  Well  Jonas manages to escape with the baby and he s searching for the place where people will be like him  now that he s changed   The final thing Jonas experiences  after who knows how long he s been gone  is sledding down a hill at Christmas time and looking into the window of a house where a Christmas tree is hung and there is a fire in the fireplace and there s love and happiness  Then the author makes it clear that this is a memory that he dies remembering  Very sad  I still get teary when I remember it because I really wanted Jonas and the baby to make it  Now on the flip side  it wasn t a completely sad ending  When Jonas escaped  the memories he contained  leaked out  and the people began to remember these things as well  The book ends with the people coming to the Giver and wanting to know what to do about these memories  some good  some bad  The problem with the perfect world was that people lost their humanity  Even though pain is part of the human experience  good emotions are part of it too  and to give up the bad  they had to give up the good  Love and compassion seemed to be the thing these people needed the most  and at last  they will get it back   Just reread this favorite in order to come up with some content questions for my cousin who I m hoping will read this sometime this year  I think the strength of this book lies in it s ability to get young readers to think about questions they ve probably never thought about before  Things like the possibility that to remove all risk and pain from the world you might also have to remove the great joys  That it doesn t matter so much what you do  but that you are able to make the choice yourself and that pain is lessened when it is shared  Lots of food for thought  I m glad my brother recommended this to me when I was in middle school  I loved it then and I ve never been disappointed or wavered in my liking of it with each subsequent read  Ermhagerd i loved this book SO MUCH  Finished it in a day  so small  but read it now  I MEED TO WATCH THE MOVIE  NOW   5 starsI read The Giver for my 8th grade project  The Giver took place in a community where everything was different from the life today  Every one see the world different because they only see black and white  Jonas  the main character  had the job of the receiver of memories  Later in the story  Jonas gets to know The Giver  Time gets passed and Jonas and the giver get to know more and more  What I learned from this book was that you can t have love without pain  I really recommend this book because it is very suspenful and the setting added to the intesifying plot Stories Blog Review  http   storiesbooksandmovies blogspot    Com era possibile sentirsi fuori posto nella loro Comunita  ordinata com era  dove ogni scelta era operata con tanta cura  Uno dei titoli piu discussi degli ultimi mesi e sicuramente The Giver  A breve  infatti  l omonimo film andra alla conquista delle sale cinematografiche di ogni dove  con condottieri del calibro di Meryl Streep e Jeff Bridges  In seguito all uscita del trailer  molti fan dei romanzi della Lowry si sono lamentati poiche le vicende narrate nel libro sono state modificate e riadattate Ovviamente non mi sono lasciata sfuggire il romanzo  considerato uno dei piu importante distopici degli ultimi anni  Armata di libro e segnalibro mi sono avventurata tra le sue affascinanti pagine  In esso ho ritrovato moltissimi aspetti che ho apprezzato in 1984  Brave New World  due classici di questo genere  In poche pagine  infatti  la Lowry affronta tematiche tipiche come il costante controllo della societa tramite la tecnologia  la sottomissione della scienza al potere e la manipolazione Con gli occhi di Jonas  il protagonista undicenne  il lettore conosce un ipotetico futuro  un mondo il cui unico scopo e quello di mantenere la pace e l uguaglianza ad ogni costo  Le eccellenze e le mancanze non possono essere tollerate poiche creerebbero troppe differenze tra le persone  Al compimento del suo dodicesimo anno  a Jonas verra affidato il suo lavoro  il compito che per tutta la vita dovra eseguire  Solo cosi riuscira a capire se stesso Ho adorato questo libro  Per tutta la lettura ho continuato a chiedermi  cercando una possibile risposta  perche non avessi letto prima questo libro  E geniale e preciso in ogni suo piccolo aspetto e dettaglio  Mi ha incuriosito molto l idea del colore  Si  perche in questo mondo ipotetico e impossibile riuscire a distinguere i colori poiche essi rappresentano allo stesso tempo la diversita e l unicita dell essere A differenza di molti altri lettori  ho approvato il finale piuttosto enigmatico  Lascia sicuramrnte molte domande  molti interrogativi simili a quelli che si e posto il protagonista durante la sua crescita  un percorso ricco di paure e di tormenti  Jonas aprira gli occhi ed iniziera a scegliere Un libro superconsigliato a tutti  Imperdibile  This book takes you on a journey of the mind  Its the story of a society where people are protected against hunger  thirst  war  they are also protected from having to make decisions  They are protected from anger  sorrow and love  When Jonas is 12 he is chosen to be the new Giver  He must learn what all of his people have forgotten  He must suffer pain and experience hunger and suffering  he must learn how cruel the world outside of his community can be  Jonas must be able to help his community make decisions which could impact their sameness  Jonas learns from his teacher that there is beauty in the elsewhere as well as horror   Jonas is exposed to incredible suffering and incredible beauty and love  Jonas must decide how he will use his power or whether he will use it at all  Why do I absolutely LOVE this Newbery award winning timeless classic    I m not sure if my excited ramblings will suffice  but I will try to summarize as nicely and quickly as possible   It s because it describes the power that even a twelve year old can have  the power to expose human hypocrisy  to shatter secrecy  to shine a light on truth  and to feel the freedom that lies beyond    Lois Lowry  2011It also shines a light on how controlled environments with  sameness  offer a bleak  boring  and mundane existence while thinking safety and robotic  brainless  non thinking is conducive to a lasting society  However  it fails to realize it is the exact balance of life   good and bad  embracing our differences and learning from those precious memories that makes a community thrive with each lesson   positive or negative  Being the colorful  sensitive  marches to the beat of my own drum LOUDLY individual  this book scared the hell out of me and made me wonder how I would have reacted to this book in my YA years  I also find it amazing that Lowry introduces such unique themes quickly and covers much ground in a book of few pages  I find it an outstanding feat and appreciate how the book can speak to young and mature readers and offer symbolic meaning for each age group  Overall  I thought this was the YA version of  The Handmade s Tale  for a younger audience and found this literature more enjoyable and chose a more optimistic ending than Atwood s version  I guess I ve always been comfortable reading books that weren t considered  safe  and I m easily drawn out of my comfort zone  Ironically  in my field of work  nanny teacher  I feel I am also a  Giver  of book knowledge and pass on my love of literature to every child I meet   The man that I named The Giver passed along to the boy knowledge  history  pain  laughter  love  and truth  Every time you place a book in the hands of a child  you do the same thing     Lois Lowry Pass it on    I read this book several times growing up but wanted to reread it prior to seeing the movie  I also wanted to read the rest of the series and decided a good starting place would be to reread the giver  I love this book just as much as I did as a child and raced right through it again  feeling just as sad for the community and Jonas as I had when I read it when I was 12  I am looking forward to reading the rest the series and seeing how it all comes together  I am anxious to find out what happens to Jonas and Gabe  Powerful  One word that doesn t even begin to describe this book  I went into this book not having a clue what it was about because I hadn t read any reviews for the book  I hadn t even seen the preview for the movie  Honestly  I m glad I started the book with hardly any insight into it at all  The book was phenomenal  adventurous  powerful  this book    Made me think   I m the type of person who gets really into a book  I start to allow the book to become a part of my life  I am so glad that I had the opportunity to allow this book to be a part of me  It made me think about everything that happens in the story  it made me think about what it would be like if all the stuff inside the book was how it really was in the world we live in   I would recommend this book to anyone who is mature and emotionally mature enough to read and comprehend this book  I absolutely could not put it down and I hope the people who have also read this book  have had the some feeling  Jonas can t wait to become a twelve  At twelve  they get their first job  The twelves all get assigned to a job  In Jonas s case  he doesn t get assigned  he gets selected  Jonas goes to a very certain outcome  one that will leave us all bewildered  His decision is final  and there is no coming back  The creators of the communities made a genetic modification  They called it the Sameness  It was created to make peoples  eyes see in shades of grey so there would be no racism  The people of the communities can t do anything to change the Sameness  they just have to cope with it  This caused Jonas to get upset because he was the only one who could see color  This made him realize the unfairness the the people who made the community bestowed on them  If only Jonas would have been able to get to the creators  then he would have changed the way the people saw things I would recommend this to anyone who loves sy fi  This takes place in the not so near future  This is how we might become if we continue with our conflicts  People who like a little mystery might also like this because there are times where you just can t simply wait to read the next page  It may not have any violent action  but it will still keep you in your seat  I can t believe it has taken me so long to finally read Lois Lowry s  The Giver   If you like dystopian future stories then you must read this book Jonas is frightened  No  wait  that isn t quite the right word  he is  apprehensive   But what could he possibly be apprehensive about  Jonas lives in a seemingly utopian community where there is no war  poverty  joblessness  divorce  or injustice  Lives are mapped out very carefully so that everyone is happy  comfortable  and useful to the community  Everyone is kind and thoughtful  No one is rude and no one is rebelling  But Jonas is worried because he is reaching his year 12 ceremony  This is the ceremony where all twelve year olds receive their future career assignments after which they begin their training  Does Jonas receive a good job  Oh yes  the most honored job in the community  But with this honor comes the deep dark truth Lois Lowry is a genius  This story really seems quite simple  It starts out as if it were a coming of age story set in a future utopian society  but slowly it becomes so much more than that  She begins to pose provocative questions like  What is more important to you peace  happiness  and simplicity or choice  love  and complexity  And then  and then  she bashes you over the head with a scene so disturbing that you finally know the answer  and so does the protagonist  I was pretty sure that I knew what being  Released  referred to in this novel  but when Lowry actually showed it    oh my God All I can say is  If you enjoy dystopian future novels like  The City of Ember    The Hunger Games   and  Divergent  then you must read their predecessor  The Giver   I will now be moving on to the sequel  Gathering Blue   I read this book in 8th grade many years ago  I loved it then and I still love it now  It s amazing how a society could possibly live under strict rules  but how would one curb the curiosity of another  I still haven t seen the movie to this book  and honestly I m a little nervous to see it  Books generally are better then the movies  Maybe someone will read this and let me know what they thought of the movie  Jonas lives in a freaky world where there are big time rules and no one thinks for themselves  Everything is the same  there is no music  no color  no pain  Jonas is assigned the job of Receiver of Memory  a big deal  He goes to see the Giver and begins to learn all about the way things used to be  like the way our world is now  Some things are great  some things suck  but nothing is the same  The more Jonas learns about having choices and the bad things that happen in his world  the more he wants to escape  This book was so intriguing and very very good  if your into sci fi fantasy type books you will want to read this I give this book 5 stars I first read this in school such a long time ago that I couldn t remember anything about it so I decided to reread it for the movie I absolutely love this novel  The idea behind it is so unique and beautiful that it s not wonder many other dystopians are influenced by The Giver One of the main reasons I like this book so much is the writing  Lowry has such beautiful and flowing prose that it s hard to not like this book  The writing style reminds me of sitting on a floating noodle donut in the water as the waves wash me away  Lowry describes everything so vividly and does a fantastic job relating the of meaning of words or feelings or ideas that Jonas does not understand because they do not exist to him As the story progresses and you find out about this supposedly utopian community you can t help but not be mad or upset with the characters  This world they live in is all they ve ever known so how could they act differently  I think that this feeling towards these characters stems from Lowry s ability to show the reader these character s innocence  Time and time again you see these characters act with indifference to the tasks they are doing  yet as a reader you don t feel hatred towards them  You feel almost sympathy and understanding of their ignorance  Despite this book being only 179 pages the story feels bigger than that  I usually complain about not having enough back story or information to root the present story and The Giver isn t an exception  however with the small amount of pages it does have it does a good job of giving the reader enough information about their community to be able to understand and insert yourself in their world I have not read the rest of the books in the quartet so I don t know if they give any more information about the world so I ll have to pick them up  In this novel of a dystopian future where  sameness  is the norm and politeness and normalcy is the status quo  we meet a young man chosen to receive the memories of all people  It will be painful  he is warned  and he will have to be brave  With the collective consciousness purged of any knowledge of famine  war  prejudice  pain  and fear it is important for one person to be wise enough to advise the governing council on their decisions  for only the receiver of memory has any idea what the repurcussions might be With the agony of knowledge also comes joy  however  and the discovery of emotion  pleasure  color  and a desire to be different and make one s own decisions  Is it better to be safe from the possibility of hurt  or is it better to hurt because by it you learn happiness  pleasure  and the texture that life may have By immersing you in a world of peace and a culture of safety and harmony  the author makes the question one that is difficult to answer  While it is a YA novel  the themes and writing style are fantastic  with depth and power and a poetic style that made the book impossible to put down All I can say is  why did no one direct me to READ this until now  A huge  thank you  goes to my friend Jill  who suggested it to me  and a huge  Go read this now   to the rest of you  Let me be frank  Here s what I like about this book  1  Lois Lowry has this beautiful ability to make me side with the bad guys at the very beginning  I read Jonas  narrations and I think   Oh  this world sounds so perfect and organized  I would love that   Yet she is so gentle with how she lets me down and realize what I would have to give up to live like that  That was probably my favorite element of this book  and the one that makes me realize how talented of an author she really is  2  Humanity is an issue  and romance is not  Love is the issue  but the love that made Jonas realize   I love Asher  I love Fiona  I love my parents and my little sister   And he wanted to receive love from those people  But his realization that they can t will break your heart  We take that ability for granted  and I always thought that there were people who didn t  Now  I m not so sure  Now  I realize that we don t know a world without it completely  A world completely devoid from emotions  That doesn t exist  and if it did  how devastating would that be  3  Lowry is so gentle in how she reveals what they can and can t do  This is hard to explain if you haven t read the book  but basically the community has given up  or rather  their government has taken away  certain abilities and characteristics of their world  Love is one  of course  But they also took away things that encourage those emotions as well  That concept is brilliant to me  Depressing  yes  but brilliant  Lowry does such a great job at introducing these things to the reader at an easy pace  she doesn t overwhelm the reader with it all in the beginning  but I didn t feel confused about anything either  I felt like I understood how the community generally worked within the first 20 pages or so  That s especially important to me  especially with such a short book  It s obvious to me why this is a classic  Simply put  I loved this book  I would recommend it to anyone  I think it s an important book to read  especially with the values that the world seems to be developing  It s important to remember that what we have is important   things like love  music  art  color  These things are important  and Lowry reminds us that  I m excited to read the next in the series    Do you ever wish you could live in some kind of utopia  The Characters in The Giver live in a perfect society  The Giver is a Story about a Community that lives a in utopia  where there is no love or war  My class read it in 8th grade  The plot is very rich with details and foreshadowing  The ending made me want to read more books from the series  My favorite part is when he is skipped during the ceremony of twelve and then is picked to be the receiver of memory  In my opinion  this is a great book  I would recommend it to anyone that enjoys reading I thought the giver was an excellent book that at the end of every chapter it had a cliffhanger that made me want to keep reading  the theme of the story was a very excellent theme  They can t see color and can t really enjoy things  until one day the giver tells Jonas to stop taking the drugs and then he can enjoy life  my brother had read this and he said it was so good that there was almost no comparison so I thought I might read it to see how good it really is  This book does have sequels and I am not planning on reading them at the moment because I don t have them  at the end of the story something that really surprised me was that the giver lost his sight of color a long time ago  I would recommend the giver to otter students because its a fast and easy read and a really good book  I m always wary of reviewing classics   I tend not to do it with the older ones  simply because I don t really feel it s my place to question the quality of something that has already stood the test of time and passed  However  The Giver is too good of a story not to write at least a little blurb about For such a short novel  The Giver packs in quite a detailed system of living in the Community  Much like the residents of the Community  the novel is precise and un flowery  I ve seen this marked as a criticism against the book  but I actually find it to be quite an important part of the experience  The simplicity and precision of the book  for me  heavily reflects the starting point for Jonas and that which he ultimately tries to escape  In addition  Lowry s writing is extremely readable  I will admit the characters are a little flat  but again  we re talking about a community where exactly two people experience real emotion  Funnily enough  my favourite character was Gabriel I thoroughly enjoyed learning about each aspect of Community life  and the fundamental underlying idea of giving up agency for a Pleasantville style existence  It is far from an original concept   the idea of a society without pain  sadness  violence  or redundancy  but it does well to illustrate the pitfalls and sacrifices of such a concept  without ever directly pointing out why free will is  although more chaotic and difficult  much better  That is left as a logical conclusion to be reached by the reader as Jonas does I ve seen some reviews discussing the foundation on Plato s Republic  and the depth  or lack thereof  of the philosophy in the novel  Mostly those reviews sound like people searching a young adult book for intellectual enlightenment  and I feel they re missing one of the points  Among my favourite things about this book is that it is a lightly intellectual story for younger readers     Spoiler Alert Lois Lowry s The Giver centers around Jonas  a young boy in a dystopian world of the future  The Ceremony of Twelve introduces him to a whole new existence  as the Receiver of Memory  He s blessed  or cursed   Separation from family and friends is a traumatic event for most 12 year old  but Jonah is introduced to a whole new world of secrets and lies  The Committee of Elders seeks the advice of The Giver to remember what came before  a past long forgotten   but the responsibility is also fraught with unimaginable terrors Jonah experiences the history of hatred  pain and war  which leaves him desperately  alone   The reality of what he has always believed to be harmless practices causes him to make the decision to leave the community  He s already been estranged alienated from all that he d previously held dear  His new understanding of himself and his society makes it impossible for him to stay  He decides he must leave and took a journey to somewhere else with Gabriel  To put it simply  this book is a piece of art  Intellectually  The Giver makes you think about every line in every page  I read this book for school  and I don t usually enjoy books that are forced upon me  but The Giver is definitely an exception  Lois Lowry is the queen of foreshadowing and I had to read between the lines and challenge myself to gain a full understanding  The Giver made me realize that perfection is unrealistic and cannot be achieved  and when it is achieved  to some ridiculous standard  it will come crashing down  Although I read this for school about two years ago  the feelings and realizations I had during my time with this book  I will never forget  I wasn t planning on getting hooked on this book  but I did anyway  It s so good that I couldn t put it down   Not only was the main character relatable and dynamic  the plot was extremely good and the whole book had several hidden  deep meanings that call on you to do some deeper thinking and soul searching  Their culture is really shocking if you re weak hearted like me  but you get over that as you get consumed with rooting for The Receiver to overcome the Sameness and the overpowering control of the Council  This is a super great book  I never read this book in school or as a child and it has long been on my list of books I felt I had to read  I m very glad I did  It s one of those ones you finish and ask   why didn t I read this sooner   especially because it was short and very accessible It s amazing to me that in such a short amount of time  Lowry manages to create a world that runs circles around some of the more recent YA distopian novels  There could be arguments for   that would never happen   but at the same time  I appreciate the logic of Sameness  of repressing sexuality and discouraging familial attachments  etc  There were little details too  that just struck me in the feels  including the way they could never ask questions  because it would be rude  and the way they apologized for everything  to avoid conflict   There was a scene where Jonas  best friend is being given his assignment on stage and they are telling a story about how he used to be punished for saying  smack  instead of  snack   There is a lot of laughter and almost affection for Asher as the story is being told and heard  but it s also a bit horrifying thinking of a three year old receiving corporal punishment for imprecision in language  Of course  that is one of the more subtle horrors  There are more and it s amazing how they are delivered in stripped down language with an almost dreamlike quality  It really gives it a feeling that things are this way because they ve been this way for so long  Again  many kudos to Lowry for both creating a world of  sameness  but allowing her supporting characters to still take on their own personalities Definitely an important read  I m shelving this for my future  hypothetical children   Conlan Carey B period Ms  Peyman19 3 15The Giver The Giver by Lois Lowrey is a great read for any level reader who loves to think more about a plot and storyline  From my experience this book is unpredictable and makes me grasping on for more and more  The Giver is a science fiction book based off a utopian society in the distant future  Everything is the same  colorless  bland  and completely controlled  No one can leave their community and no one feels they need to  Every year until a person turns twelve has new privileges and assignments for their community such as getting a bike and a bow for the girls  Once a person of the society turns twelve however  is assigned a job they will have the rest of their lives  The main character  Jonas is assigned a rather difficult and different job than the rest  He is assigned the Receiver role which collects and remembers memories of the past   Jonas all of his life felt like an outcast from his rather bland and normal family and his community all together  He thinks independently and has his own thoughts rather than the propaganda he has been introduced to  He quickly realizes and feels what has happened before his time  The Giver of the memories starts off showing him color  the more he is introduced to the more Jonas sees these colors outside of the receiver room in the outside world  Next Jonas is introduced to happiness  this is his favorite memory by far and he knows what true happiness is after experience  Next is pain  he is simulated through a dream where he is shot in a war and is about to die  that is the worst by far  Jonas experiences the pain of war when his friends are in the park with him  this scars Jonas   One day Jonas asks to know the truth of his society and the Giver shows him quite reluctantly  His father is a person who watches over slower growing and slower maturing infants and the Giver sends him to a horrendous sight  Rather than caring for the babies  Jonas sees his father inject one of the babies with a lethal dose and it dies slowly  After this his father throws him away in a garbage chute  At the time his family was watching a baby like this and Jonas became quite fond of him  he knows this would happen if he didn t act fast  So he comes up with a plan to run away in the early morning before anyone is up   The morning Jonas wakes up and leaves with the baby and takes his fathers bike which is breaking the law  He rides to a bridge and over a creek and leaves the boundaries of his civilization which is a death penalty  He travels for a few hours and finds out there is a search party looking for him not too far away  so he moves on faster  At night he falls asleep he wakes to hear a jet looking for him and he lays completely still  The plane hovers over him and leaves  once it s gone Jonas flees  On this trip Jonas sees all the things the Giver showed him in the dreams  flowers  trees  and mountains  He soon gets to a snowy region where he and the baby almost die of hypothermia  Finally at the last second Jonas sees a hill with a sled  one of his favorite dreams come to his mind where he sled down a snowy hill and at the bottom was a warm cottage  He sees the same image and the story ends with him reaching the bottom of the hill  All in all The Giver is a great read that is short but powerful in many ways  I thought this book was great because it made me think what will happen next  My favorite part was the end when Jonas leaves his dwelling with someone else  It had some sad parts but overall this is a really a good book  The Giver is a very interesting futuristic themed novel brilliantly written by Lois Lowry  This book in about two sentences is about a young boy named Jonas who gets selected to be the Receiver of Memories  The job is the most important job in the pain free  joy free   perfect  society that they live in  These feelings are hidden from the community and only Jonas  job can feel these hidden feelings I believe the overall theme of this novel has to do with not hiding negative feelings  If you keep hatred  and discomfort within you  it wont change anything  The community officials decided that humans were better off not being distracted with joy and not being worried of hatred  Jonas  the protagonist of the story  now has been assigned to keep all of the memories that are associated with joy  hatred  and love which are feelings no one in the society has ever been introduced to  The Giver  is the previous Keeper of Memories  gives  all these memories to Jonas because The Giver is old and has to pass his learnings to Jonas so that these memories of joy  hate  criticism  war  poverty  rebellion  and love can stay protected from the society  The setting like I said  is in the future completely separated from earth  This society is colorless and everyone acts like robots  They are still human but most don t feel fear  or any of the other feelings I ve named  The society is run by officials named the Elders and they keep a watch on everybody and make sure they are all following the rules  They also watch as they grow up to decide which talent they excel in and then when they turn 12 years old  they are chosen their profession and have to do it for the rest of their lives  This is where Jonas is chosen to be the Receiver  To be the Receiver  you must be different from the rest  Jonas never mentioned it but he could sometimes see color and the Elders knew he was right for the job because all Keepers of Memories see color  Jonas  curiously and rage after seeing war  a feeling he s never experienced  made Jonas realize murder and how bad it is  When babies are born  Nurtures have a job to see which babies are perfect  The babies must not cry too much nor sleep too much    And if they are  the babies are  released  which Doctors are to inject theme with toxic substances that kill them  The Doctors are unaware of murder so they don t understand that these are bad actions  When Jonas realizes murder  he gets enraged and wants to make a change  Jonas is set on a track of rebellion and he and the Giver make a plan to realize the memories to everyone living in that society  He believes this will make the society better  but along the way he runs into suspenseful situations and Jonas has to reach his mission This book was amazing  although the end was unclear  AN interesting concept made me keep reading this book  The trouble and struggle of Jonas mission to free the memories had you hanging off your seat the whole time reading the book  I would recommend this to everybody  I haven t read this book since high school and since the movie came out  my husband gave me the whole series as a Christmas present  I just finished The Giver this morning and really enjoyed it  I liked how we got a lot more conversation with Jonas thinking about the memories and how they relate to their community  Overall  I liked it as much as I liked the movie  although  both had things that I liked more  I do think that 18 was a better age to get your assignment than 12 like it is in the book and it s hard to beat Jeff Bridges as The Giver  I kept picturing him whenever The Giver popped up in the story  Okay  why haven t I read this book yet  No clue  A lot of people I know read this book for their English classes in school  I was never assigned to read this book and I wish I had been  I m glad I finally read it and now my husband can quit nagging me to do so When I started reading The Giver  I was nervous that I was going to be as disappointed as I was when I read A Wrinkle in Time  But that was not the case  It only took me a couple chapters to get sucked into Lowry s world and not long into the book  I had strong feelings for the characters of Jonas and The Giver  Jonas  being only twelve  is selected to be the new Receiver   a job of  honor  in the Community  While his friends are off working in normal Community jobs  he is left alone to receive the memories from The Giver  The Giver  who was once a Receiver  holds all the memories of the way things used to be by himself   memories of joy and happiness but also pain and misery  He passes these memories on to Jonas  Memories that teach him for the first time in his life how to feel And when Jonas learns how to feel  nothing is the same  He realizes that life in the Community lacks so many beautiful and wonderful things  Sure  by controlling people s lives  the Community has eradicated pain  suffering  anger  starvation  disease  But it has given these up for joy  happiness  family  freedom of choice  and above all   they have forsaken love  Once Jonas feels love  he can t let it go Lowry s words flow with ease off the pages and the world she creates seems like an absolute possibility  That society could one day come to the point where all our freedom is stripped from us  Where feelings are thrown out and order and sameness are all that s left  Her writing is also simplistic yet arresting  It wasn t an overly descriptive book yet I still felt a connection to the characters  especially Jonas  And I felt like who they were came across easily  allowing these characters to come to life in my mind Overall  I loved the story and the characters  It was a fast read but left me wanting more  which I guess is the only thing negative I have to say  it was too short    I definitely want to continue and read the other novels in The Giver Quartet  I also felt like this book was a refreshing change of pace  I was beginning to fall into a reading slump but this story perked me right back up  No doubt this slim wisp of YA fiction is part of the required dystopian reads of junior high school literature classes  However  try reading it as an adult  as I did  and prepare yourself for a chilling   and then numbing   effect  I was drawn to this book because there is a movie out  and the movie intrigues me  but whenever there is a movie based on a book  I always opt for the book  I d rather have the author  and not Hollywood  tell the story And oh  what a story  Although some concepts seem almost obvious   perhaps even expected  as the tale unfolds   it cannot detract from the power of a well told story against this bleak  black and white landscape  The tale itself is devastating  riveting and filled with despair So     why read it  Simply because it IS a powerful  well told story that inspires thinking and feeling beyond the scope of what our normal days entail  As the Giver says to the Receiver   you will feel pain   He is so right And I do know this  I am not likely to forget  The Giver  for quite some time  The chapter book entitled  The Giver  tells the story about a boy named Jonas  The society in which Jonas lives in does not know any pain  fear  war or anything bad  It is what you would call a perfect society to live in  The elder s watch your every move from the moment you are born and when children turn twelve are assigned a job that they are to fulfill for the rest of their lives  Jonas gets the role of the giver  meaning he gets to see memories of all that is prohibited in his society  pain  affection  war   The reading level of this book is grades 5 8  The themes of this book include responsibility  courage  and heroism  This book can be used as an introduction of the genre science fiction  A teacher can help students depict two books a science fiction book  this one  and a fiction book such as  Hello Goodbye Window   They then can understand the qualities that pertain to each genre subgenre  What I really liked about this book was that as a reader it got me thinking to what life would be like if it were perfect like this  and how lucky we are to understand what love  friendship  hard work is  The only weakness I believe this book had was maybe being a bit too confusing for a fifth grader to fully understand without asking questions  Lowry  L   1993   The giver  Boston  MA  Houghton Mifflin  It s been a very long time since I read this book  After finding out they made a movie  and watching the movie  I had to reread the book  Both the book and movie get 5 stars from me  I thoroughly enjoyed both of them   The Giver is a story of a community that tries to be perfect by having no differences  flaws  choices  or emotions  Choices are made for the citizens by the leaders of the community  from choosing the family members to whether or not a major rule in the community should be changed  As Jonas learns about how different the past was  he realizes how much his community is missing  from colors to feelings of joy  Jonas and his trainer  The Giver  both agree that the way things work is wrong  The Giver is a good read for readers who enjoy an interesting read that includes science fiction  but isn t all the way impossible from happening in our life  This book is a thought provoking story that is hard to put down  I found myself reading it in my free time  which is something I usually don t do  Lois Lowry showed how through attempting to achieve a utopia  there are sacrifices that need to be made  She showed how close we could be to that community if we tried being perfect  Everyone should read this book at least once in their life  and if they enjoy it they should read the next books in the series   Ah  dystopian fiction  The best kinds of reads  the giver by Lois Lowry a utopian society where there is no color and no fun  i read this book because in 7th grade i had to read it and i never got to finish  so i desired to read it again its a pretty good book its slow in the beginning but towards the ind it gets really good the giver is about a utopian society where all of humanity s memories are in one persons mind  he is called the giver and before he dies he has to transfer all his memories to the reviver  Jonas   he ends up wanting to giving all of his memories back to the world and stuff  but he is not supposed to  If honestly for me  The Giver  was one of the best books that I have ever read as it was something fantastic but at the same time it has a great massage It made me think is everything that goes on in the book can t become a reality  It can become   Nowadays people are colder they don t trust each other everything is built on thinking and emotions are going to be ignored by us  But it is wrong  World can t be a beautiful without every part of it  If we want to appreciate the peace we have to see war if we want to understand how it is to solve and live in a harmony we have to see how it is to live with problems and in messy life with full of immorality  I think that life can not be a wonderful without our great emotions feelings  All we need for being happy is to trust and love each other by giving chances understating just listening accepting each other the ways we are  We just need a warm of hugs  I am sure everyone needs that feelings  I like this book  It made me to think and to share all emotions that I was keeping in me before      This is what I like to call a what if read  The book is an easy read as it gently rolls through Jonah s growth into a  twelve  where he receives his life long assignment as the community s new receiver  During the early chapters we learn about the idyllic community  We learn about the assignments and how the community class structure results from those assignments  As the children grow  they are expected to do volunteer hours which will help the elders determine who qualifies for what life long assignment  Everything has rules and there is punishment if rules are ignored  It is a very structured and controlled community  And it is perfect in the eyes of those who live there without the burden of past memories When Jonas meets the Old Receiver  he begins his training to retain the memories for the community He comes to understand that there is a truth that most citizens will never realize and it causes conflict within himself  The later chapters detail Jonas  s escape from the community that isn t nearly the picture of perfection it had previously been What if the life we live is a lie  What if what we think is righteous is not  What if we have been taught one way when there may be a better alternative  What if we were deprived of every choice and the beauty of the world around us  Would we be content to live as always if we knew there was an alternative or would we want    freedom to choose how we live The Giver is a very thought provoking book  It is written well  flows smoothly and reads easily  It isn t what I d call fast paced  but it is steady  The characters are well developed and reactive to their story and situation  I am definitely looking forward to the other three books in the quartet  It is awesome in depth and feelings  There are a handful of books that I ve read that have changed my life or my perspective  and this is one of them  I ve read a lot of books by Lois Lowry ever since I was in elementary school  but this one stands out as one of my favorite books of all time  It s thought provoking and true  which may be an odd thing to say about this society that is so different from the one we live in  This book is the first in a trilogy  which I also enjoyed  but the other two books didn t have quite the impact on me that this book did  I am rereading it  The Giver is an amazing novel that lays out the details of a whole world in only 192 pages  It is so well crafted that every sentence and section work together not only to explain this strange world  but also to create an emotional impact upon the reader Jonas seems like any normal boy from our day and age  but the main difference lies in his surroundings  But not all is as it seems  and one by one the reader s assumptions of what is normal are stripped away as different aspects of the society are revealed At first those differences don t seem that strange  Things like yearly ceremonies where each age group advances to the next level of learning are similar enough to modern graduation ceremonies that they wouldn t raise an eyebrow  Other aspects  which I won t list here because I don t want to spoil it for anyone  are more surprising What I liked the most about this book was that it encompassed a whole world in such a short span of pages  and it made me feel deeply about the people of that world  I was hopeful for Jonas and his friends  and heartbroken over the lot of the Giver There were some aspects of the story that were not fully explained and so the reader is left to wonder how certain processes work  such as the transfer of memories   As long as you are able to accept that some things work a certain way without having an explanation of why they work that way  then it is no obstacle to enjoying the plot I highly recommend this book to everyone  It is going on my list of all time favorites  When I finished it I found myself thinking about it for days  pondering the ending and what it really meant  I found out that there are two sequels called Gathering Blue  which is a story with all different characters  and Messenger  which ties all of the books together  that clear up some of the ambiguity about the ending  I m sure I will read them at some point  but right now I m still mulling over and savoring the story of The Giver  I first read this book when I was 8 and it captured my imagination  At face value  a complete adventure of this boy who has no choice but to accept this daunting  honour  of being the Receiver  It wasn t hard to visualize the society of  sameness  and for an 8 year old  it was an intriguing change from all the colourful stories I d read 10 year later it s safe to say my perspective s changed  I think the themes the book handles are pretty timeless which is probably why I decided to keep the book  The second time around the story still held that newness despite me already knowing what would happen Overall  a great adventure book as a kid  a thought provoking one as a teenager   Let s see how it deals with adult and senior version of me   It makes you wonder what perfection is and that really  perfection are just imperfections aligned accordingly to make up each individuals perfection  What one person s ideal aspect is an another persons unideal  And that is how the world spins around without complaints because people learn to compromise and in due time appreciate small things that are unideal phenomenon  This book negotiates that trying to spare pain and fear definitely out of our world results the ominous start of living a life that loses the divinity of decision  To conform in such a stricter world out ruling vitalities to life means then  that all that is remained is a totalitarian life of existence not being or expression  In one way of thinking  one of the many possible characterisations that defines an individuals identity  We distinguish ourselves upon the choices we make not particularly the backgrounds of our life  The concept of  Sameness  works to an extent for liberty but does not function or work under the whole circumstance  Thus  the world is imperfect in its perfect way  The Giver teaches us that assimilating less specific traits from more ideas  themes topic insight  contributes to a happier outcome  It also accredits  Memory   What are we without memory  Memory are the experiences that shape  essentially  us   you   me  Because we are different  we interpret things differently   we may share the same event however  I will perceive and ponder my feelings and actions from the opposing person or people there distinctively disparate  Lois Lowry gives the opportunity to question your life because we take for granted things available for us that makes us unique from each other whilst for The Giver and Jonas they are locked privileges  Exceptionally written capturing you between its hands making you want to continue the story through next book and the next  and the next  It is my own misfortune that I missed this book growing up  I changed schools between fifth and sixth grade  The one I left read The Giver in sixth  the one I entered read it in fifth  How I waited two decades to hunt it down and give The Giver its rightful reading seems a travesty now  Every human being on the planet should read this book  BEFORE the movie adaptation comes out this year  Without giving anything away  I ll merely say that The Giver is simple in styling  straightforward in presentation  and packs one hell of a wallop before its end  Never would I have expected a YA novel to elicit such strong emotions on my part  Lois Lowry is brilliant  and I was grateful for the afterword she penned in the edition I picked up  Having written something like 40 odd young adult novels  even she didn t realize how special The Giver was until the mail began to pour in  Thoughtful  lamenting  hopeful letters and angry  outraged  hateful letters alike    from adults  not children  And then there was the time The Giver spent on the Most Challenged Book List  Without meaning to do anything more than present one introspective pre teen s adventure in a Utopian Dystopian future  Lois Lowry incited a conversation which  I believe  will continue to be timely and essential for centuries to come  It was really awesome to re read this book  One of my childhood favorites  that really made an impression on me  It was great that even though I knew the story  it kept me hooked the whole book through  I love The Giver and the Receiver  they are awesome characters  It is an incredibly interesting concept  Amazing  thought provoking story that will linger in my thoughts for a long time  This book paints a daunting picture of how unsettling it can be when a society strives to make everything perfect and constant  There s a lot to think about when it comes to this book and to say it comfortably resides within the dystopic genre is an understatement  The Giver by Lois Lowry is a gem in its own right  but at the same time the themes presented here are the sort of Pleasantville I would hope can never be achieved  The Giver by Lois Lowry was a captivating fiction novel that held my attention the entire time  I never found myself bored while reading and I didn t have to motivate myself to read  The Giver is written in a very simple tone  which is what I think makes it so powerful  In this story about a utopian community  the protagonist Jonas learns about how the world was before all of the conflict was taken from it  when he becomes the new receiver  As he gains more memories about how the world previously was  he learns about all the wrong in his society  What I thoroughly enjoyed about The Giver was the message it gave  The book showed that without suffering and pain you can t have happiness and joy  When they tried to eliminate all of the misery in the world like hunger and war  they found themselves almost left with nothing  Now they live in such a dull world  where everything is so perfect and life seems so gloomy  I gave The Giver five out of five stars because I thought it was an excellent must read book  If you haven t read it already I think you should definitely strongly consider it because the message it conveys is so powerful and I think it could be taken so many different ways  Beautiful  extraordinarily beautiful  The other worldliness of it How can you live in a world like that Where everything is dull and gray and you talk about your dreams and feelings A world where you dont know what snow and sunshine arebut then again you dont know what pain and suffering is How can you live without knowing what love isfinding out that your parents dont love you That being  released  means you are gonna die They kill identical twins  the smallest of the two  because thats just whats right NO thats horribleIt was a very amazing story   but i just didnt understand the ending completely Did Jonas die or did he find other people Did he hear an echo or did the place he left work out fine without him  I originally read this book when it first came out and though I didn t remember much about it from then I knew I liked it  This second reading has brought it all back and I think I like it even better than I did in my first read The Giver is the mesmerizing story of a community of sameness  where all life has rules that must be followed and all decisions are made by a committee  Broken rules can be followed by death  uselessness can be ended by death and a new born child that does not fit the standards can be  released  into death  This community does have a history but it is only known by one person  The Giver  He holds all the memories for all time and he must find a Receiver for those memories before he dies so that they are not lost or returned to the community  The memories would hurt and cause great anguish if they were released to everyone Jonas has grown up in a family where he has a mother  father and sister but they were all selected to be together by the committee  The committee has also chosen each parent s job and each child when they reach their 12th year is put into a training program for the job they will have until they are too old to work  Jonas has been selected as the  Receiver of Memories  and so begins his transformation  Jonas begins to leave behind  the life where nothing was unexpected  Or inconvenient  Or unusual  The life without color  pain  or past   Jonas decides to live a real life instead of a made up one but first he has one harrowing adventure to get through  along with a very small friend  I finally read this book  I know many people read it in high school but I didn t get that opportunity and I kept forgetting about it  Honestly what made me finally read it was the trailer for the movie  I really try to read books before movies because I was feel like movies never do them justice  So I finally sat down to read The Giver  It was a very quick read at just over one hundred pages  I loved it  I was very surprised by it actually  I knew that lots of people enjoyed the book but I honestly didn t think I would enjoy it as much as I did  It was a very original story line and I highly recommend it to everyone  I m overwhelmed at just finishing this book  and so very grateful it found its way onto my shelf  It may be a book targeted for younger audiences  but i think everyone would enjoy it  Without giving anything away  all i can say is that once  choices  seemed the most difficult of life s daily tasks  Now i know I am blessed to have the opportunity to choose  Everyone  young  old and in between should read this book  It fills you with appreciation for all that life has to offer   the good  the bad  the difficult  the easy  the risks  the rewards  the failures and the successes  I know I will read this again and again  so good  can t wait to see whether the movie does the book justice  I absolutely LOVED this book     I was hooked from the very first sentence   stayed hooked until the very end  I could not put it down     Just finished The Giver I really enjoyed it and the ending was reassuring  The receiver  Jonas  is a bright  brave  and caring kid who  on his route of escape  takes a baby on  death row  to Elsewhere  He has finally found this elsewhere and for once  he sees the light and hears the music that he s only dreamed about or obtained memories about but for once these senses and feelings were his own    I would suggest this book to people who are looking for hope  reasons  answers  a deeper level of excitement without a book being action  heavy    Finished on the 28th of August The Giver by Lois Lowry is such an amazing and interesting story that i would recommend anyone to read  It is really one of the first books of his kind where there is a futuristic society and a feeling of unrest arises  It has such unique qualities and an amazing plot that anyone will be captivated by  There is so much mystery and questions that the reader will have  I thought this book was so interesting and so unlike every other book of the genre  I would highly recommend that anyone read this series because it is captivating for anyone to read  Lois Lowry created such an amazing world and so many interesting qualities that make it such a fun and intense story  Awesome One of my all time favorites  I especially love assigning this to boys who are  non readers   Have yet to find a student who didn t like it Just finished the last in the series   Son   Not as good  This book was unbelievable just how this book was shown and was pretty cool but when I read it i thought this book was just amazing imaging a world with out fun no color   Plus they were forced to act that way so just for the author to be so spot on was amazing also how they were forced to have jobs chosen for them vet lol choices plus only the recover of memory cloud have the memory i loved it   Hop u love it too October 2014 Book of the MonthI received this book for free through Goodreads First Reads It has been over twenty years since Lois Lowry s controversial children s story The Giver was published and it certainly deserves its status as an essential modern classic  Jonas has grown up in the perfect world of the Community whose survival relies on strict rules and rituals  Adults are assigned spouses and children  one boy and one girl  as they take up their role within the society  At the beginning of the book Jonas is approaching then end of his eleventh year and feeling apprehensive about the Ceremony of Twelve where he will be assigned a job for him to do for the rest of his adult life  Jonas gets selected as the Receiver of Memory   a very rare position   and begins to experience memories from humans who lived a long time ago  For Jonas this is exciting until he begins to see the flaws in his perfect world Dystopian literature has become popular over the past few years and it would not be surprising if it were The Giver that inspired these contemporary works  Lowry claims that she did not intend for The Giver to have a sinister feel about it  she was writing an adventure story and exploring the concept of the importance of memory  but it turned out to be something much more thought provoking  As the children s novelist Margaret Mahy  The Haunting  pointed out  up until the publication of this novel in 1993 Lowry was best known for her funny stories about Anastasia Krupnik resulting in The Giver being even more shocking and unexpected  The Giver highlights that attempting to produce perfection can often result in the loss of good things as well as the bad  The notion of the ideal world may seem like a wonderful proposal  but in order to achieve it humans would have to do away with free choice as in ironing out the inequalities and injustices of the present world would result in everything becoming the same for each individual  This is a difficult concept to grasp  particularly for a child  Although intended as a children s series  The Giver and its following installments are more suitable for young adults and older  The only issue with this is that the writing style was target at a younger audience meaning that the overall story is short and lacks depth  If it were to have been written for older readers then there would have been the scope for it to become a much lengthier novel There are a lot of mixed reviews surrounding this book although they have changed greatly since the original publication  To begin with The Giver was banned in some areas however the dystopian theme has become accepted in today s society  What many people comment on now is the oversimplification of such strong ideas  Then again  as already mentioned  it needs to be emphasized that this book was aimed at children  thus the language reflects the reading skills of its target audience The Giver is a gem of a book that not only is enjoyable but also can educate the reader on the dangers of attempting a utopian society and why it is important to retain human memories   even the bad   in order that wisdom can exist  Those who have become fans of contemporary dystopian novels  for example Divergent by Veronica Roth or Delirium by Lauren Oliver  will be sure to love this series   One of my favourite books  Just DO NOT READ THE SEQUELS  IN FACT FORGET I EVEN INFORMED YOU THOSE EXIST   The Giver is a story about Jonah  a little boy who thinks everything about his world is perfectly normal  When Jonah is assigned a very special job in his community  everything about his perfect world starts to change  He begins to question his family s everyday life and wonder why he is now seeing things that nobody else seems to know  Everyone around him is so ignorant compared to what he has learned  Jonah develops a special relationship with his new mentor and soon realizes it is up to him to change his once perfect world and save his baby brother s life The title of the book  to begin with  gives nothing away  The story makes the reader figure out what is going on at first  though it gets more and more clear into the book  Soon you see what being a  giver  means and how interesting but painful the task can be  It is filled with wonder and really makes you think  This is by far my favorite book and Lowry does a truly amazing job guiding the plot  At first I was going to comment that there s too many loose ends  but I just found out that it s the first book of a series   Originally I was going to comment how it should be longer  so that it would be more satisfying  but truthfully I want to run to the local library to continue the journey I m happy I finally got around to reading this book   I picked it up a few years ago  but I didn t read it   The push  came after watching  Shinsekai Yori   my favourite anime  and many people commented on its similarity to The Giver  Indeed  I can imagine the similarities between Jonas Saki  Asher Sotaru  Fiona Maria    well that doesn t mean much if you don t know what I m talking about  XDJonas reaches the age of twelve  which is the age of adulthood in the Community  an AU society  maybe the future of the future of the future   parody of that one line that comes up again and again   Anyways  he is selected as the Receiver  who will be handed down knowledge of the world  basically he re experiences  History  itself   I find it interesting that the more Jonas understands about the joys and horrors of the old world  the more he is unsatisfied with their world and their ways  I have to agree with him  though I can t spoil it here So I m spoiling it here  view spoiler  At first it appears the Community is peaceful and pretty much heaven on earth  I mean  Jonas  ideal family always discuss feelings and dreams at the dinnertable  Unfortunately  it s really dull and colorless  literally   Lots of brainwashing and conformity  Everyone is basically docile sheep  who follow the rules  that strips them of choice and freedom of expression  and are easily  and willingly  manipulated  for their safety     Jonas and the Giver  man I wish we d get his name  discuss how much they disagree with the Community s current way of living  Ha  I revealed way too much  as Jonas would say  I d be condemned for breaking too many rules   Excuse my rudeness   pun intended     hide spoiler  Like a light novel the pace picks up and what needs to be said is told  Although  a couple of details are left out intentionally   I m burning with desire to read the next one considering these missing pieces are key to unlocking the complex story as a whole     Though there s something I want to verify with people who have read the novel  view spoiler   When the Giver said he wanted to be with his daughter  at which point confirms how much value he places in  family     since the first clue was that  family  and  love  is his favourite   happiest memory    excuse my digress  he revealed her name is Rosemary  I want to know if he implied his place lies in death   that he s ready to die   and that the previous Receiver who was a  failure  is actually his daughter  Since Jonas  mom said it s a name never to be mentioned or used again     hide spoiler  To conclude my unorganized  rough and unedited review  I think that if you have seen this book you should give it a try  It is a very quick read  took me an hour and a half with breaks now and then   Once you finish you have THE CHOICE  hahaha I m being punny today  to continue with the series  and read the whole story    I could be wrong here  Personally I love dystopia  though I have friends who do not  so I would not recommend the book for them   I would however  talk about it  since I enjoyed the the philosophy behind it    I read the book The Giver by Lois Lowry  The genre of the book is nonfiction  The setting is in idyllic in modern times  The main characters in the book is Jonas  The Giver  and Gabriel  Jonas is a boy who lives in a world with no crimes  no color  and no lying  Ever year the new teens reserve a Job the care for the rest of there lives  Jonas is assigned a very special job receiver of thoughts  He reserves all the thoughts us human have today  Jonas trys leave his life to go live a normal life  but It doesn t turn out quit right  I give this book 4 stars out of 5  I was very bored at part and I just didn t have focus in it anymore  why did they not write ya like this when i was a teenager  this and  feed  are mature  fascinating  very conscious of how the young mind can be made by its environment  wanted this maybe to continue  but a great ending  The Giver is a wonderful book  Lois Lowry skillfully crafted an intriguing and profoundly thoughtful story  She subtly creates an uneasy feeling that something is wrong with this  perfect world   The Community s advisors intend to establish security within utopian society  but they really establish a stifling dystopia  To protect people from the risks of making poor or wrong decisions in life  the advisors plan and dictate the lives of the people  In effect  the citizens have no freedom of choice  they do not choose their job or even their spouse  Moreover  the advisors inhibit the people s ability to feel because they want to spare them from the hardships and pain of life  For instance  individuals must take a pill everyday  which suppresses passionate feelings  The citizens do not know or experience true emotions like love  One of the goals of the Community is to achieve  sameness  so that no one feels embarrassed or gets excluded for being different  However  this limits individuality and freedom of expression because everyone conforms to a certain desired image  Finally  to relieve the population of the horrors and devastation of the world and the past  the advisors isolate the Community from the rest of the world  also known as  Elsewhere  and give the burden of holding the memories of the past to a single member of society  the  Receiver   Therefore  the Community lives only in the present  and the people have a narrow perspective of life because they only know their community and way of life  They are naive  they do not gain knowledge or wisdom from the memories  While receiving the memories  Jonas learns a different and better way to live and realizes what he and the Community have been missing  He decides that something must be done to change the current conditions and enlighten his community A powerful story  The Giver keeps readers in suspense  touches them  and stays with them for a long time  I love this book  and I encourage everyone to read it   I had always heard people talking about this book  so I was excited to read it  I thought that it was a very well thought out piece of literature  By the end of the book  I didn t know whether to be concerned about the future or disturbed because of some of the inhumane things  like death  in the book  I felt that it addressed what would happen if everyone continued to achieve  sameness   The reality is that if we continue trying to make everyone s lives the same  we could develop traits that were found  The Giver  society  which is scary   Review originally posted on my blog   http   bit ly t0irNnEssentially  I didn t read Young Adult Literature when I was a young adult  For years I didn t know I had missed anything  What I realize now is that I lacked the adult that could steer me toward enjoyable but well written and thought provoking novels for young adults  My English teacher was busy pushing the classics and I can t fault her for that  The school librarian was more of a multi media manager and while I liked him and spent hours in the library  I can t remember him ever suggesting a book  My parents weren t big readers at the time and my  adult friend YW leader  was letting me borrow her Jack Weyland novels This is what I regret now as I discover amazingly well written Young Adult novels such as The Giver by Lois Lowry  I do remember reading her Anastasia books   During a conversation with a friend last week who had borrowed and read my copies of the Hunger Games trilogy  she asked if I had ever read The Giver  I had not  Neal is assigned to read Lowry s novel Number the Stars this month for school  so while I was buying it  I added The Giver to the order The Giver is a dystopian novel  Published in 1993  it predates the current popular dystopian novels and it is obvious that it inspired at least a few of them  Living in a  utopian  society  Jonas and all the other twelve year old children are given their work assignments at a ceremony  Surprisingly  Jonas s assignment is a great and rare honor  He will be the new Receiver of Memories  The former Receiver becomes The Giver as he transfers all the memories to Jonas The Giver is cerebral  It has depth and symbolism and irony and wit and could have inspired a very interesting discussion in my high school English class  I graduated in 1993  so I would have missed it even if my teacher had included Young Adult lit in her curriculum   It is a beautiful novel  one that I will suggest to all the young and old adults within my meager influence   Awsome read   I can t believe anyone would put this book down  for you critics that say you couldn t get a good charecterazation well that s the point this book was based on the world being same and living in sameness the charecters in this book knew not of color sound place people or animals they knew nothing not until they were forced to have a recognization of memory  I m going to quit before I spoil it for anyone who hasn t read it so my advice to you is to read this book  I can t wait to read the other 3 in the quertet  well the giver has been quite different story  than most of the stories and novels i had read  the story is through the author point of view  everybody is polite in the story the four family members which the author starts with are really interesting in the way they act throughout the book  The author describes as everyone in the society had a thing he should be able to do  and he would be chosen through that interest as well  as you continue to read out the story you find many thing that keeps you motivating to keep an reading  The girl which has dreams to be what she thinks is the best for her  but her mother as her to let the people who called the nurtures chose for her because they know better than she or her parents do  i found the story complicated as it follow many things more than one story inside one novel  its good to be able to distinguish and be able to improve your reading skills as well the writing companioning more than one story in one  really love it    Okay  I know I m like the last person on the planet to read The Giver  I m sorry it took me so long Since the movie is out  I felt the need to read the book before it got tainted by Hollywood  I had the privilege of breaking up my long work commute with half hour segments of the story  Sometimes I d get home and sit in my car listening to the story as it was so good  Keep in mind  my rating reflects the audience I felt it was for  I m not saying there aren t elements for English majors  but if I were a middle school teacher  I would definitely give this book 5 stars  My students would love it   and I would love teaching it  In this  utopian  society  the reader feels like they want to belong  Finally  a group of humans got it right  They are considerate and kind  They place people in their gifts and don t take their talents for granted  Everyone has a place  As the story progresses  we are introduced to our main characters  Jonas and the Giver  We see Jonas grow  we are concerned about his future  and we are shocked as he is as he begins to see the world as we see it  In general  the book is well written  the story engaging  and the message important  Hence my 5 stars    Holy shit this book is amazing  In the science fiction book   The Giver  by Lois Lowry  Jonas is just an everyday kid  now at the age 11 he was going to be given a job  He wasn t like the other kids in his group of 11 s  he was special  Another main character in the book was  the giver  who was Jonas s mentor for his new job as the receiver  Jonas lives in a town where everything is the same  black and white  and the perfect weather day in and day out  Jonas had to make a choice as the receiver  whether to change everyones lives  or keep it all a secret  I loved  The Giver  so much  it was a fantastic book and was filled to the brim with so much happening at once  Some things I liked about the book where the characters because they where all unique and clear  the plot was also amazing  Some thing I did t like about the book where the slow parts when it felt like nothing was happening  and the ending made me mad  I think all teenagers would like this book  I didn t know what to expect when I first picked up this book  I had heard the name thrown around a lot by my classmates   The Giver  definitely exceeded my expectations  I kinda freaked out when I finished the book  I loved it but I was furious because of the way it ended   Love love love this book definitely a great short read for the week and can t wait to see the movie      MiaMor The Giver by Lois Lowry Cindy Xu IF you were to define what a Utopia would be to you  how would you make it  In  The Giver  a community lives in a world with no fear  happiness  emotions  color  weather  but there are also many other stuff to replace it  Rules  order  and plans are replaced over those thing  nobody has choice in the community  the committee decides everything for every person from the choice they make to their names  home  marriage  and job  Jonas a boy of twelve has to be assigned his profession   when he was chosen to the one job out of a million  he realizes the truth behind his world   Imagine having the job  the reciever  he recieves not just happiness  but pain  sorrow  lonliness  and memories of the past  He learns from a person called the giver  he comes through all these emotions at once  when realizing the world he lives in was a world of lies he can t accept it  Does having a world with no pain  sorrow  lonliness make a world the best place to live in  With no emotions  nature  color  makes a community of no excitment or feelings  The future giver runs away to save himself from the reality of his community  in the end of the book  Jonas makes a decision of his own  what would the community to do him after they find him  This is an amazing book  its not the same as other books becuase it really makes you feel like you are in a world where Jonas is  An interesting book for sure  This reminded me of Thomas More s Utopia but with more detail and depth It is thought provoking and fascinating  It made me reconsider some of the things that I take for granted and it then causes you to ask  would I give up my freedom for peace and comfort as this community did    That seems to be the age old question these days with each passing of Government policy and legislation  Don t we ask ourselves that very same question as the Patriot Act and others like it are passed Obviously  The Giver is an extreme example of giving up freedoms    and I don t think anyone would advocate becoming the Marxist Utopian society that is pictured in this story  But on small levels  we too have given up freedoms as the price for safety  How far would WE be willing to go as a society  Hmmm   with the state of the government today  I would say this question begs to be answered Overall  I liked the writing style and the storyline was fairly unique  especially to those who haven t been introduced to Marx and Thomas More   I also found myself wondering which job I would have wanted to receive at the Ceremony  When read with a critical eye  this is a fantastic book  Lois Lowry s highly acclaimed and awarded dystopian young adult novel holds bizarre for me  on one hand I loved the book and forsee myself re reading it several times  the world building is compelling yet on the other hand the story poses many unanswered questions that bothered me  my reservations side with the role of   The Receiver  and that of  The Giver   it isn t until Jonas learns of the colour red through transmissions of memories from the Giver that I realised this dystopian world exists in black and white  immediately I asked myself how  how can colour be removed from the world or if not the world  be removed  subdued from one s s vision  why aren t there any hills or varying weather patterns  most importantly why does only the Receiver possess all the true memories of the world whilst the rest of the community remains mutually oblivious    how does the process of transmitting memories work  is it magic  also  re touching the subject of a colourless world  is the assignment of   birth mothers  designed so the community scientists can somehow genetically engineer newchildren to suppress colour in their vision  maybe I read a tad too fast and missed things but I didn t pick up on any of this and would have liked it explained more questions like who was the first receiver and why would there be a need for such an assignment when all the knowledge  memories they would come to possess would have already been common knowledge    despite my list of questions I successfully managed to immerse myself in the story and fall in love with the character of Jonas and newchild Gabriel there is a moment in the book where Jonas  talking to newchild Gabriel  whispered the words    there could be love   these words convey a touching beauty and sadness I feel represents the very heart and soul of the story Overall I thought that The Giver by Lowis Lowry was a great book  I found this book to be a nice mix between easy to understand but still full of entertaining events  I would recommend this book to people who enjoy science fiction novels books  I think those people would enjoy it because it is a futuristic book that keeps you on the edge of your seat  Jonas has lived his life by rules  Each year they have a ceremony almost like birthdays for each group of ages  When you get to twelve  you are assigned the job that you will have for the the rest of your life  Each person gets a job except Jonas  he has been chosen to become the next receiver of memory  a great honor  Soon he realizes that important parts of history have been shielded from the community  Now he has a choice to make  Will he risk his own life to uncover the history of the world to his community or will he continue to live his orderly life   A world without choices  rules for everything  and actions without feelings  This novel places you directly in the center of a curious realm  Jonas  who is the main character  is getting ready for his big ceremony  The ceremony of the Twelve  Every eleven will be turning twelve and receiving their life long assignments  Engineer  Nurturer  Laborer  the list goes on  But  every once in awhile the Committee discovers someone who they think is brave  courageous  trustworthy and special  They become  The Receiver  This story takes you through laughter  pain  sorrow  surprise  and awe  To finally know the truth when for so long  the truth was all a lie  Lois Lowry does a riveting job with characters  descriptions  and setting the stage to keep you intrigued until the very end    saddened that it is over  This book would be wonderful for any child above the age of thirteen  There are some graphic images portrayed and situations that may be too detailed to share with a younger reader  In a classroom this book would bring a lot of discussion about our world as we see it  how we could change it  and how we live day by day  I would encourage every student to read this book to have classroom discussions  alternate endings and show them how they could write their very own life story   Close your eyes and be still  now  I m going to give you a memory of a rainbow    I totally loved this book   I was hooked from the beginning   I wanted to finish it so badly and I really need to read the sequel  At first I had my doubts about it   but it turned out to be amazing    This book takes us into Jonas  world  where there is no pain and everything is controlled  Until he turns 12  which is when he learns that there is pain  and fear  and passion  and emotions that he s never experienced before Ultimately  this book has the gift of reminding you that life is pain  but that is what makes life so wonderful  We make choices that may be the wrong ones  but they give our life purpose  Great book       Yet another book that brings into perspective an alteration on our own form of society  Don t ask me why I think that s so interesting but I do Although this is a rather sad book  I love it to pieces    The Giver was a very intense book  It is about a kid called Jonas who is different in his community  When he turns into a twelve he gets chosen the receiver by the person who owns the community of Jonas  He got chosen because he is different from other people  The giver the person who owns the community tells Jonas to go escape go to a place that other people have memory s and have feeling like you  so then Jonas is escaping and it takes him 3 days to get to the magical place and they are all singing and waiting for him   I read this on a friend s invitation to join a book club  In my online teaching I use it in a child development course for illustrating Social Learning Theory  Interestingly  most of the students criticize the society in the book as being one of conformity and trying to contrast it with our society where there is so much of  thinking out of the box   I have come to see the two as very similar though  In my mind  there are very few people who are truly original thinkers  We live in a society that values nonconformity  and we can readily find examples  even if we aren t surrounded by them  of people who break the mold and do something different  Jonas has no concept of creativity because he doesn t have any examples of creativity around him  We think we are being  creative  when we come up with something  new   but our creations are still the product of our environment  not independent of it  We could even say that what we think of as  creativity  is also a form of conformity  in 99  of cases  it fits existing rules of what is predefined as fitting into our species civilization culture  Very rarely do you find someone behaving in a way that is truly unique  even criminals and the mentally insane fit prescribed patterns of  criminal  and  insane  behavior To find someone like Jonas who truly sees things differently would be revolutionary  and probably deeply unsettling  I don t know if that is possible in today s world  where it seems that every avante garde possibility you see  has already been explored by someone  and is just a reworking of someone else s founndational ideas It is unsettling to readers to see how heavily Jonas  feelings are socially conditioned  We tend to believe that  by contrast  ours aren t also socially conditioned   but if you have lived in more than 1 country  you start to see how most of what we feel  our preferences  our responses to pain  our perceptions of what is rude polite  what we deserve  what is acceptable  are all the result of culture  In the book  what seems obviously socially imposed to us is invisible to Jonas before he meets the Giver  Similarly  an observer from Zimbabwe or China would point out many aspects of our lives that are taken for granted as  normal  or  natural  for us that they would see as socially conditioned  l  dry kyf ymkn ly wSf klmty bdqW   jwns  wmSTlHth dhsh     rtbk   jb   m   Hsys kthyr  mbhm  mn lndr  n tdkhlny  rwy   fy hdh lmzyj lmDTrb

perfect and simple it is  Everyone is polite to each other  people only ride bicycles  so it is environmentally friendly   people  volunteer  for a good cause  the old are respected and taken care of  But with every page  the perversity of this society comes to light  The price the people pay for a careless  seemingly happy life is the absence of everything that makes life meaningful    A true page turner  The first thing that comes to mind is that this is  1984  for a young adult audience  There are so many metaphors that what becoming an independent person is like and so many question one asks in the process of growing up  why do we have free will  why do we get attached to people if it then hurts when we lose them  why are there illnesses and suffering in the world I would absolutely recommend this book to any young person and their parents as well  It is inspiring to see Jonas grow through the experince of pain and loss into a a her   The Giver is told from Jonas s  an 11 year old boy  point of view  He lives in a society where there is no pain  fear  or hatred  He lives with his sister Lily  and his parents  Each person is assigned a job at the Ceremony of 12  His father is a Nurturer and his mother works at the Department of Justice  He is different because he has unusual pale eyes and is very perceptive  At this ceremony he is assigned the job of Receiver of Memory  someone who holds all of the memories of pain and emotion from the past  The Giver passes these memories to Jonas  In order to change the community forever  Jonas must escape to Elsewhere so that all of the memories can enter the community I love this book  It is by far my favorite book  and I must recommend it to everyone  It encourages the need for both warmth and coldness  the need for pain and suffering  but also the need for love and memories  It inspires the way that we see life  that without sadness or defeat  there is no way to feel overwhelming joy  The story simply helps to rationalize life in the most futuristic way possible so that whomever reads it will forever be changed to see the challenges in life in a different light  Books do not usually make me cry  Actually  I don t think I ve ever cried while reading a book  or watching a movie or anything like that  But this book  oh man  it had me close to tears  I think it was them not being able to see color that really did it  I can imagine a world with strict rules  where everything you do is predicted or planned out for you the second you re born  but   not being able to see color  Who could live like that  I know it s a silly thing to almost cry over  but that s what did it for me Overall a very good book  highly reccomend Can t believe I didn t read this book before  It was amazing and so beautiful I thought i would end in another way but this was good too It s wonderful how few words or pages are needed to create something incredible that makes you feel so many emotions   A young boy living in a world where everything and everyone is practically the same  A world where everything is chosen for you  How will that affect the future of their community  I started reading this book and it s all I could think about  I finished it in a quick two days  I couldn t help but imagine myself in that world of in Jonas s position  This story begins with Jonas  an average 11 year old boy  Its almost the Ceremony day where they celebrate the moving up of their age  During the Ceremony of Twelve  Jonas and the rest of the twelve year olds get their assignment  Assignments are jobs they are given to do until they become elderly  Jonas is given one of the most important jobs  vital to the community and the most honorable  Jonas learns and has to contain all the information  history  and memories of the worlds past  He sees things differently than everyone else  He can see colors in a black and white world  He has memories of seasons and war  He becomes distant from his friends because he doesn t want to play the games they play because it reminds him of a time when there was pain and worry and suffering  He becomes more emotional  something no one else would understand because they don t have emotions  He spends the majority of his time with The Giver because he is the only one that understands  He finds out what  releasing  means and realizes that everyone that knows what it is has been lying to everyone that doesn t know  He feels alone  This is an amazing book  I was instantly entranced in their world and how different and robotic it was  If you are a person that likes to think about what future years could bring  this is the book for you  It makes you look at how life would be like if there was no diversity  Everything is so artificial and strange in this world  If you are like me and love reading futuristic prediction books  you will love this  It is a life changing journey  In a place called the  Community   people live their day to day lives without color  music or any knowledge of anything outside the Community  A young boy with unique eyes named Jonas is selected to be  The Giver   someone who holds all the memories of the past  Because of Jonas  power to  see beyond   he must go through life changing series of events to become The Giver The Giver started off really slow  but it was very interesting so I kept on reading  The beginning is a little dull and colorless  but after Jonas is selected  the book gets really colorful as he experiences things that are unimaginable to the people in the community  Once Jonas starts to relive past memories  this book is really hard to put down I rate this book 5 5  and it s definitely one of my favorites  A simple to read book with such a deep and amazing message  This book is definitely one of those that should belong in your collection  I really enjoyed this book  I liked all the characters and I thought that it had some really interesting chapters  This book  like many others recently  questions the way we live in our societies and I found it very enjoyable  It has a good movie and a nice ending  Spoilers  I only wrote this to express my two hypothesi on the ending  1  Jonas dies  and the reflection of a better place was the communtity in reflection to heaven  where he goes after he dies  the sled ride was a vision he had in a coma like state  and he froze to death  gabe presumably survives  it hints so in the second book   the giver dies  the music jonas hears is the memory being released to the communtity after he dies to reunite himself with rosemary  even though i wish i could believe this version  it is probable thatv they all dies  and the man that the girl sees in the second book isnt gabe  Beautifully written and deeply thought  but in an accessible open way  Lowry was masterful in this one  It is the best sort of youth fiction   the kind any child could love and so good adults can too   It was a very interesting book I would like to read the other books to the series   Lowry s purpose for writing her book  The Giver  is to show readers that they have to influence themselves  The Giver shows us that things could be way worse than the situation we have now  It shows us the struggle of one boy to understand the world around him  The Giver is inspirational to those who think that they cannot understand the world around them and are falling to peer pressure  The Giver also shows a respect level with adults  This book impacts the reader by giving them something to relate to   The Giver is very well written  It s easy to understand and it flows very well  The story also has a since of weird amusement  For example  Lowry says  NEEDLESS TO SAY  HE WILL BE RELEASED    Lowry p 2  She also states  Jonas had smiled a little  though he knew it was a grim statement   This gives the story a hair raising  yet satisfying  tone  This sends chills down the reader s spine as they read  The Giver was very captivating and it wasn t boring  I could relate to Jonas  the main character  because he refused to follow the people he lived with  He believed in doing what he thought was right  He followed the ideas of a transcendentalist and fled into the woods  This book had a sense of seriousness and thought provoking parts in it  For example   There were only two occasions of release which were not punishment  Release of the elderly  which was a time of celebration for a life well and fully lived  and release of a newchild  which always brought a sense of what could we  have done   Lowry p 7  This statement makes you think about the cruel nature of people living in this city The greatest strength of work in this book would be the emotions evoked throughout it  The Giver makes the reader contemplate the emotions going throughout their head  Lowry does a beautiful job with the tone of the book  For example  Lowry states  Now he saw another elephant emerge from the place where it had stood hidden in the trees  Very slowly it walked to the mutilated body and looked down  With its sinuous trunk it stroked the huge corpse  then it reached up  broke some leafy branches with a snap  and draped them over the mass of torn thick flesh   Lowry p 100  This passage strikes gloom because of the pain endured by the elephant  The weakness of the work was the ending  The ending was unclear and lacked detail  There could have been some sort of ending that grabbed the reader more than what it did  Even though the ending wasn t very good  I would recommend this book to a friend  It grabs the reader s attention from the beginning and evokes emotions that many other books can t  The Giver is a non human role model to many people who read it   the last time i read this was in sixth grade and while i recall liking it i couldn t really remember the story    the fact i read the whole book in three days is just proof to how wonderful it is  and that even years later it s still great and relevant  this time i m going to finish the series    Well     Jonas had to stop and think it through   If everything s the same  then there aren t any choices  I want to wake up in the morning and  decide  things  A blue tunic  or a red one     But now that I can see colors  at least sometimes  I was just thinking  what if we could hold up things that were bright red  or bright yellow  and he could  choose   Instead of the Sameness   He might make the wrong choices   Oh   Jonas was silent for a minute   Oh  I see what you mean  It wouldn t matter for a newchild s toy  But later it  does  matter  doesn t it  We don t dare to let people make choices of their own   Not safe   The Giver suggested  Definitely not safe   Jonas said with certainty   What if they were allowed to choose their own mate  And choose  wrong    Or what if   he went on  almost laughing at the absurdity   they chose their own  jobs    Frightening  isn t it   The Giver said  Jonas chuckled   Very frightening  I can t even imagine it  We really have to protect people from wrong choices   Disturbing  yet thought provoking   I picked up this book because I wanted to compare Utopian to the Dystopian literature I ve been reading lately  A Newberry award winning novel published in 1994  Lois Lowry s  The Giver  tells of a world in which choice and free will are virtually unknown by it s inhabitants  There is also no crime  hunger  pain or poverty  This seemingly perfect existence is appealing on the surface  but all a reader needs to do  is explore the world that Lowry creates in The Giver  to understand the concept of a Utopian society is a misnomer The plot revolves around the novels young protagonist  Jonas  as he approaches his twelve birthday  Upon the twelfth birthday  all children begin the transition into adulthood and are assigned their occupational roles in the community  Jonas is chosen to become the next Receiver of Memories  the most honored position in the community and a skill no other member of the community has  During his tutelage  Jonas gains the memories of centuries past  of those that lived before  that go  back and back and back   and the facade of his safe existence crumbles around him as he learns about choice and free will Some of the imagery that the author creates reminds me of the 1998 Hollywood blockbuster  Pleasantville  staring Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon  Jonas  the 12 year old protagonist in the novel is like a younger version of the character Mr  Maguire played in Pleasantville  and he wins you over with his upstanding moral character  innocence  compassion and curiosity The Giver is a very short book at only 180 pages  but complete in it s message  Supporting characters never fully get fleshed out  but they re not the driving force behind the authors message  The world building is  it s precise and genius in it s simplicity  I found this book a quick  utterly fascinating read  the ending  disturbing yet thought provoking  Thousands of reviews demonstrate why this novel is a must read for those interested in Utopian or Dystopian Sci fi  I love a dystopian book  This book was very thought provoking  and I love the way details about the community unraveled through the Jonas s sessions with the Giver  I loved this book because the plot was very creative  the theme was magnificent  and the setting was vivid  The author s skillfully crafted and intriguing story had me flipping through the pages  Reading from the perspective of a boy  raised in the  perfect  world made me curious to know about the society with no freewill and without emotions and feelings would ve been  After reading this novel  very few things left me mentally stuttering as I struggle to put my thoughts into words  but  somehow  The Giver has done just that  It will take me a while to be able to make sense of  not the story  but my response to it  When reading  I was amazed at the deftly crafted details and was also amazed by finding myself lulled into the peace  serenity of Jonas s world but later disgusted by the thud of reality of the  perfect world   The mysterious ending  not a happy ending  but not a sad ending  left me filled with curiosity and wonder  The story line of this book is haunting and powerful  Simply a wonderful book  I had to reread this with the movie coming out  I haven t seen the movie  I have seen some previews  and after rereading the book  I can almost guarantee that I will never see it  The book is delightful  in a dystopian way of course  Jonas is so young  12  who must carry the memories of humanity   all of them   the good and the bad  That s a lot for one so young  And due to the nature of the community  no one can understand him  Because no one else has the memories   no one else  besides the Giver  really has any feelings at all  The effect on the reader is almost physical when we see Jonas s world shatter  Everything he thought he knew before is a lie  and it literally breaks his heart Lowry paints a picture of the  greatness  of a world of Sameness   a world without pain and suffering  but also a world without love and joy  It s beautifully written and can be read by the young and the old  The problem with the movie is that the book is so introspective   it isn t made like a Hollywood blockbuster  There are no explosions  no romances  just a boy shouldered with an impossible burden  To stay true to the book would have been difficult to make into a movie   but altering the book alienated readers  I m going to stick to the book I ve loved for 15 years   I was first introduced to The Giver when I was in seventh grade  My teacher read it to my class and I remember liking it  I remembered a world that was colorless  a main character who saw the color red in an apple  and a baby that meets a heart wrenching fate When the movie came out last year  I went to see it and  while I enjoyed it  I realized how little of the story I actually remembered  So when I got home that day  I cracked open the book for a second read through  now as an adult  and discovered two things 1  I definitely did not remember the book as well as I d thought 2  The movie did not do the book justice What I rediscovered was a literary work of fiction filled with more backstory than the movie could ever hope to touch on  a protagonist who was brave and selfless and a book full of deep  serious themes that some might consider inappropriate for a work of children s literature The Giver tells the story of Jonas  a boy who  when he is twelve years old  takes on the assigned job of Receiver  Everyone tells him being The Receiver is a job of high honor  one that is very important to the community he lives in  This job entails receiving memories from The Giver  Memories that go back and back and back  To the past  and as Jonas soon learns  to what once was Jonas lives in a world of Sameness  A mworld void of color and emotion where everyday has its endless routines  But as Jonas begins to absorb more and more of the memories  he discovers the disheartening truth about the world he lives in and sets out to change it With a tight writing style  good pacing  and intriguing plot  this is one that will leave children thinking for days and is one book I would highly recommend if you re looking for a good work of Children s Literature  I loved this book  It was powerful and thought provking  The book was good at the beginning but it got even better as it went along  especially once The Giver was introduced  The premise behind the book is horrifying and depressing but also somewhat hopeful  I think I should read the next two books in the series but I m also kind of worried that they may not live up to the first  I cannot believe that I hadn t read this before now This book was excellent  All those teen driven  YA  post apocalyptic dystopia books all got their inspiration from somewhere  and this book was it  And this book is far better I knew as soon as I read the word  released  what that meant  and yet still I was shocked when it was revealed  Lowry really examines what it means to be human  and what happens to us when we lose that  I have found that some books that I didn t understand when I was younger became better as I got older  I bought this book in middle school I believe and didn t enjoy it  I didn t really understand it  Then in high school I happened to pick it up again and didn t set it down til I was done about six hours later  This book made me angry and sad when I read it fully but it was engrossing and thought provoking  I have read it many many times since when I am bored and want to find something fast and easy to read  It is one of my favorites that I turn to  SUMMARY Story follows Jonas who lives in a  utopian  society where they have robbed everyone of their emotional depth and converted them all to  sameness   Each resident receives a job at the age of twelve that is supposed to contribute to society  Jonas is named the  Receiver of Memory   a position that allows for him to gain all of the memories that occurred before the time of sameness  They have this particular position in case they need the memories  However  as Jonas meets the previous Receiver of Memory  The Giver  he finds that he acquires knowledge that shows him just how dysfunctional and ignorant everyone is  Jonas is faced with a dilemma  shall he stay in his home where they are all blissfully unaware of real life  or shall he pursue a true life which comes with the pain and suffering  difference  love  and excitement they do not currently experience  EVALUATION A great science fiction read for advanced transitional readers  Has a theme of growing up   especially as a child who loses their innocence as they have to confront the world and leave the safe haven that is childhood  Best for upper elementary grades  though I read this in junior high school  Most likely to be used in 6th 8th grade classrooms  There is so much potential for enlightening discussion with this story  A definite must read DISCUSSION QUESTIONS 1  What do you think happened to Jonas and Gabe at the end of the story 2  Why is the relationship between Jonas and The Giver a dangerous one 3  What was the role of the family in the book 4  How do the families and society int he book differ from ours 5  What were some of the things that Jonas learned  I thought if was an amazing book  It is the best book I have ever read  It was a book that kept you interested through the whole thing  In this book they are in a dystopya  In there community they have eliminated feelings  They don t have color or music with in the walls  They have one person that cairys all the memory of the world  They don t feel pain  every one is given a job when they are 14 years of age  They are all being watched through out they lives and are given a job according to there likes and skills  They are also given a spouse and child  you don t get to pick  In the community they release the old and the young that are not healthy enough  and by reales they kill them  but no one knows that it is death  I first read this book in middle school  I love it more each time I reread it   The Giver  is one of those books that you ll want to revisit from time to time   This is one of the most brilliant books I ve ever had the pleasure of encountering  It s completely different from anything else I could think of  I would especially recommend this books for young adults  A lot like Divergent  but I love it  The ending was really surprising and disappointing  but I m glad I enjoyed it  and I ll definitely pick up the next book Update Whaaaaat   how come the actors  of Jonas  Asher  Fiona  are like in their mid 20s but in the book they re like 12        Jonas s world is perfect  Everything is under control  There is no war or fear or pain  There are no choices  Every person is assigned a role in the Community  When Jonas turns twelve  he is singled out to receive special training from The Giver  The Giver alone holds the memories of the true pain and pleasure of life  Now it s time for Jonas to receive the truth  There is no turning back    book s synopsis Holy cow   see image on my book blog cuz I don t know how to insert an image here  This is an incredibly amazing book  Not having read it thus far is another proof that I ve been living under a rock  I am totally at awe  My horizon has certainly been broaden  I am happier for reading this book   Aahhhhhh    So if you haven t read it already  what are you waiting for  Stop reading this post and go to a bookstore or library or Kindle or wherever you can find this book and read it today  Then come back here and finish reading this review   DOkay  let me take a deep breath and compose myself  Oh  I am lost for words but here I go  Anyway  Jonas s community of  sameness  will leave you asking  utopian or dystopian  It depends on how you look at it  How did you feel about the movie  The Truman Show  starring Jim Carrey  Would a society of peace and order be better than a society of chaos but with choices  Truly makes one wonder the worlds of the Amish  the Native American tribes  or such groups that subsist outside the mainstream culture  We might think that they are missing out but are they  Suffice it to say that specifically in this book  I am grateful for color  music  and love  I like having choices and I delighted in Jonas s courage to go after them  To me  the ending was a happy ending My quote ables  The worst part of holding the memories is not the pain  It s the loneliness of it  Memories need to be shared   pg 154http   booksthattugtheheart blogspot com This was an excellent book  I had never read an entire book in one day  as I did with this one  It was easy but profound  I personally tend to shrug off books labeled Young Adult because I don t have very good luck with them  As a dystopian fan  I read the Hunger Games and was not very impressed  What interests me mainly is HOW an alternate society would function and whether it is ultimately believable  Books like the Handmaid s Tale and 1984 are most definitely possible and arguable have already existed  This book  while it has  magical  element in there  a society built on the absolute control of LANGUAGE is possible  I read this as an adult but imagine you may have missed a whole lot if you read it as kid   read it again  The Giver is a captivating novel  that shows a world completely opposite of ours  which is void of pain  hope  suffering  but also lacks emotions and love  It makes the reader realize the importance of differences and uniqueness  In this world everyone is equal and life is dull and mindless  This story shows the importance of all feelings and experiences  good or bad  The journey and growth of Jonas is well developed and vividly told and you will root for him to escape the mind numbing boundaries of this fake and so called safe world  The author Lois Lowry successfully draws you into Jonas  re education about true life and the development of his plan to escape the manufactured black and white world where nothing is organic and everything is controlled for the sake of sameness  The book s abrupt ending leaves you eager to read more and find out what happens next  It was a very interesting book   lots of things to ponder  I read it because I am going on a field trip this week to watch the play with the Junior High  I can t wait to see how it coincides with the book   Jonas believed in his community  believed everything that they told him  Jonas is twelve years old and is excited to finally get selected into a place of work but when they tell him he is to be the next receiver things don t go as he imagined  The Giver  an old and wise man shows him all the memories of the past that the people of today have forgotten and thrown aside  He shows him snow  flowers  color  joy  happiness  and   love  Jonas didn t even understand this new feeling but he liked it  Everything changes when he meets a little baby named Gabriel and realizes that this baby is like him and can receive memories  But when this little baby is sentenced to death because he cries to much and isn t good enough for the community  Jonas takes action  With the Givers help  Jonas  with the baby  escapes the community and is trying to reach the boarder where all the memories will be released and sent back to everyone in the community   will he make it   I absolutely loved this book   Everything from the plot  style  and themes it conjured up  This is definitely my type of story  and I didn t think I liked science fiction   It is set in a  perfect  utopian  society where the members do not question the decisions that are made for them  They are set up in family units instead of the natural parents they were born to  And more  they do not choose what they will do for living  Instead  it is assigned to them when they turn 12 years old  Basically  the society s only goal is conformity where they do not have to experience the emotion or pain that may come with the past s deep memories  However  12 year old Jonas is assigned the job as the new Receiver of Memory  In my opinion  the story really picks up as we see how Jonas copes with his assignment  I would recommend this book to every young adult reader  Lowry provides many unanswered questions and leaves the ending open   perfect for readers who are curious about what drives humanity and society  This was a beautifully crafted book  one that will be on my favorites list for years  This book changed my life  Read it  Now  Esta es una de esas distopias que sorprende de manera grata  pues no apela a la mayoria de cliches a la que otras lo hacen con el fin de lograr vender millones de ejemplares  Inteligente  sencilla y astuta  Una obra con un trasfondo social implacable descrito de manera impecable   The Giver was an amazing book  It was a really good read and shorter book  I really liked the idea behind the city in the book  It really captured my attention and made it easier for me to read  The story was never dull  It made me want to find out what happens next   Jonas is growing up and he is at the age to receive his job in his community  He hasn t done a lot of volunteer hours so he isn t quit sure what job he will get  When the ceremony for their jobs begins Jonas is very nervous  They are going through the names and Jonas is the twenty third name  They call 21 and his friend Fiona goes to receive her job  It was Jonas s turn instead of calling 23 they called 24  They skipped him  He thought they must have made of mistake  but what if they didn t  what if he wasn t to receive a job  Jonas was terrified of what was going to happen next  At the end of the ceremony the leader of the community came up  She apologized to Jonas and said how there wasn t a mistake  and Jonas was to be the next Receiver of Memories  Jonas was the main character in the story  He had one younger sister  His friends were Asher and Fiona  Jonas sometimes saw things that other kids didn t see  Jonas wasn t sure about his future  Fiona  Jonas s friend  was a kind loving person  She got the job of taking care of the elderly  She was liked by almost everyone she met  Asher was a kid at heart  He loved recreational activities  He was often late to class  He got the job of Activities director at the school  The story takes place in the community  It is a large city in the middle of no where  Everything is perfectly planned in the city  Everybody in the city has a role  There are no cars  Everybody gets around by walking or riding bike  Everybody is very punctual and polite in the city  They city is kept very clean  I reccommend this book to anybody 12  it isn t a hard book to read  but it would be easier for them to understand  I think both genders would like this book  I give it 5 out of 5 stars   let me just gather my feelings for a day or two   or forever  who really knows Ok  so my thoughts have been gathered  sifted through and organized into a language I can only hope is English and not a sequence of sounds that would portray insanity rather then delight I cannot say that  The Giver  was everything that I expected to be  I went in with the understanding that it was written for children but had hopes that it would reach a fundamental level of philosophical prose I am so fond of  It did not contain any such thing  but I did find in this book a story to be loved I would say that this story is one of the more basic dystopia worlds I ve read  but there is a sharpness to it that can t be denied  It s found in the character development and in the relationship between characters  so simply sweet that is manages to satisfy whilst leaving a clean air of mystery I suppose you could say that I just was under prepared for the weight of something that  while reading it  felt like something light  It s written with such clever ease that you are lulled into a false sense of innocence  when the story is actually dealing with issues that are far beyond children and complexities that are difficult to explain through metaphoric symbols in fiction To say the least I was impressed by this novels ability to achieve this while still remaining safely within the regulations of children s fiction  I was awed by this book and will be amongst those who will admit to the need of a direct sequel  and I m not talking about the kind where Jonas is just a memory  if you know what I m saying    Being a 12 is a huge deal  it s the year each child receives their assignment    their job in their society  It is the year they are no longer children and become adults  The Ceremony of Twelve is a momentous occasion  And Jonas is apprehensive in the days leading up to his own Assignment  But Jonas is not assigned  after all  Jonas is selected  Selected to be the next Receiver of Memory  the most honored position held in their society  But with the selection comes a life of solitude  and  in time  a life of pain  For the Receiver of Memory carries the memories of all history  It is the Receiver  and the Receiver alone  who knows the pain of war  the grief of real loss  But it is also only the Receiver who really knows joy and love through the memories of the past  For Jonas lives in a society which has chosen to avoid pain    and by so doing  has also chosen to limit agency  They live in a world of Sameness where differences are minimal and shunned  It is the norm    life as they have always known it  But now Jonas will know what once used to be  And Jonas will have to decide what he will do with his new gained knowledge  An amazing book  Very though provoking  I enjoyed revisiting this after more than a decade   While reading this classic which I have been meaning to read for years   I was struck by a feeling that does not often occur for me as I am not a big re reader  I felt like I would read and re read this book many times again in my life and would want to have it as part of my personal collection  Great read  This book takes place in a futuristic utopia where there is perfection  Though everything seems peaceful  it comes at a grave cost   a cost that strips humanity of self  Jonas  a twelve year old boy  is eventually selected to be a giver  What he received transcends his world and he is determined to share it with others  A fast paced book  this is refreshing after reading about dystopian societies  Though the characters seem bland at the beginning  their character growth is phenomenal and takes its time  Through this  lessons are taught to the reader and the book remains engaging  The ending is excellent and the book is better than the movie  I would recommend this book to people who like deep and intricate books  as well as those looking for a quick read  I J  Grade 10CLPK Young Adult Readers Advisory Board MemberIn the utopian society of The Giver  everyone s actions are controlled and watched  Everyone s family can only consist of a mother  father  son and daughter  And up until the age of 12 the children are watched by the chief elders  the people who decide what their occupation should be  When Jonas is given the occupation of being a Receiver  his whole life rapidly changes  He has to absorb all of the memories about the violent world from the past  As he receives more memories he learns that the society he is living in has many flaws and failures itself  The Giver is a quick read that leaves the reader with many questions  The security and fairness in this society are what keep the reader interested as he she gets deeper into the book  It sparks many questions that the author does not answer and the ending lets the reader decide what happens to Jonas  at least until the next installment is read   The open ended conclusion of this book may frustrate people but overall this title is interesting and easy to read T J  Grade 9CLPK Young Adult Readers Advisory Board MemberJonas is an eleven year old boy that lives in a dystopian society where everything is perfect  There is no war or suffering and everything is controlled by The Elders  In this society  when you reach a certain age  you are given a job that you will have to pursue for the rest of your life  For young Jonas  this time is coming sooner than he thought  Later that month he would be receiving his life long task  Soon after Jonas receives his job  he begins to unleash shocking society secrets and hidden gifts he never knew he had  I would absolutely recommend this book to a friend  It s a a touching and suspenseful story that will leave you hanging from your seat  Not only is this book amazing and fantastic it is also a cliffhanger as well as begging you to read the rest of the series  H H  Grade 8CLPK Young Adult Readers Advisory Board Member I really liked this book  It was extremely intriguing and very telling about what Lois Finds to be great dangers of society and also the danger of ourselves  The social commentary in this books makes one thing rather hard about what life is really about and what it would be like to not experience life how we do now  I know many people don t like this book because of the ending  but as unsatisfying as it is  and open ended as Lois leaves this story  I think that there is something we can learn from this  I would probably not read this with young children but I d say starting about forth or fifth grade I think that it would be a good time to use this book with children  The prose is spare  the story gentle  The characters  Careful  polite  The setting is sterile  bland  Yet the swirling depth of The Giver can drown a reader  The Giver s quiet power pulls readers close with two fists  shoving questions of humanity and individuality in our faces  Lowry creates a vivid  frightening picture of humans under Type A control  living within boundaries never intended for people   Spoiler  I was especially startled by Lowry s keen depiction of Jonas  parents  an intelligent and cold mother  and a doting  caretaker father  And yet   yet  Jonas  father  the master of the syringe  sending little lives into  Elsewhere   His father is a fascinating caricature of good vs  evil  under the guise of caring for others  It goes without saying  but I will anyway  that Lowry s haunting masterpiece  The Giver  is a must read for teens on up  It s a glimpse into who we can t ever be   I read this book in fifth grade  One time  And to this day it is the best book I have ever read  I can still tell you almost every detail of that book  over a decade and ALOT of weed smoking later  It was the first book to make me cry  to make me scared  I spent months afterward thinking about what could have happened after my friend  as I saw him  sled down the snowy hill    I thought about the repercussions of the concepts spoken of in the book  and how it would be if it really were like that    at 10 years old     this book is why I love reading  Think Brave New World but backwards     this is a world where there is no war  because war is not a word  there is no concept of war  There are no colors  because there is no concept of color  There is no one that is poor because at 13 you are given your career  There is only one person who is burdened with the knoweldge of the world  and that is The Giver  It is his job to see the true world  but make sure that world never encroaches on the town  Because after all the town is perfect  The town is safe  the town is happy   Is ignorance bliss And I thank you goodreads because I just now have found out that i get to finally find out what happens to my little man  cuz i see there was apparently a 2nd and 3rd to this book  which unfortuantely never made it into the cirriculum    Ill keep you posted on how they are    Have you ever read The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas  At only 32 pages long  it s a quick read  I recommend reading it first  If you like it  you ll love The Giver  If you don t like it  you probably won t enjoy this one either  I immersed myself in this one in a good way  This story is about a boy  Jonas  who lives in a Community  The people in his Community do not feel  do not question authority  and are not able to see colour    and they don t even know it  Jonas  however  is different  On his Twelfth Ceremony  instead of being assigned a job like everyone else  he is selected to become the next Receiver of Memory  a position bringing much honour    and much pain  As the next Receiver  Jonas is expected to receive and keep safe the memories of the past  memories of love and loneliness  or hunger and of pain  He must receive them from the Giver  who was the Receiver of Memory before him  and keep them locked inside himself  as to prevent the rest of the Community from suffering and also to use them to give advise to the Elders  But due to a certain turn of events  Jonas decides to live the Community  along with a newchild  Gabriel  whose life he must now protect                                                I loved the allegory  It was amazing  I m not sure if the author is a Christian or not but    Wow  She gave a great description of the problems we face today A Community clearly represents a county  and the Elders of a Community represent its government  As most people today  the people of the Community  obey their Elders  or the government  without question  They believe the Elders are right  even when they re wrong  For example  you can get ordered by the Elders to release a newchild  if you re a Nurturer   which basically means to kill it with a shot  abortion   just because it s weak or has an identical twin  If you re a Caretaker of the Old you may get ordered to kill an old person with a shot  euthanasia   just because they re well    old  Children in the Community are taught and trained  for twelve whole years  to never question the Elders and to believe lies  what public schools basically do today  The boy in the story  Jonas  is with the Giver s help  able to grasp the reality of what the Elders really were doing  He runs away in order to try to get to Elsewhere  a place where people  with real feelings  live  fascinating book   I couldn t put it down and read it in a single day I am in my 20s  work for a publishing company  hold a bachelor s degree in English from a top 10 liberal arts college AND I STILL DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE ENDING OF THIS BOOK   The moment I read the first page of this book  I was interested  The way the society is set up makes me wonder if this might happen in the future  The main protagonist  Jonas is given a very good role in his community and he must receive training  When he goes to train he meets The Giver  The ability The Giver has is that he is able to look into the past  When he shows Jonas this ability  he shows Jonas things he s never seen before like snow and other things  That s when Jonas decides to rebel against the community  This is what makes me interested in this book    When Jonas  a now twelve year old boy  comes of age and is ready to be selected for his future job training  his whole perfect  painless  controlled world falls apart  Jonas lives in a distopian future town where there is no war and no unhappiness  It is a wonderful  timeless world where nobody is left behind  But after Jonas is chosen to be the next giver  he begins his training with the present giver  a seemingly innocent old man who has a lot of wisdom  Where does this wisdom come from  They come from memories the giver has been given that has been passed down through generations  These memories are passed along from one giver to the next by  giving  them the memory and letting them experience it first hand through a vision  As Jonas gains these  he begins to wake up and realize that his world is not as perfect as it once seemed  Without pain  there is no love  and without sadness  the color of happiness is removed from the world  Their world is literally colorless  for everyone has the ability to see color removed  and only through the memories is Jonas able to see them again  Determined to find a place where there is still humanity left  he makes a final decision that ends the book with a beautiful  hopeful feeling  Where do I even begin with this book  Its masterful writing really makes you understand the world it s portraying  At the beggining of the book  it makes you feel that everything is fine  and that Jonas s world  although different and very controlled  seems nice and enjoyable  However  as you go along in the book  you begin to discover that people don t have the true emotions that you once thought they did  People who you thought you could trust begin to feel nothing for those who die  and as Jonas learns along with us  we can simpathize with him and his realization that the humanity is sucked out of everyone and that his world is destroyed  heartless  and even terrifying  It does all of this really well because of the setting  Jonas s world isn t your stereotypical destroyed  computerized world  It seems very much like our real world  with trees  pumpkins growing on the side of the road  and a river on the side of the town  It tricks you into thinking the world is an amazing  happy place  which makes it an excellent commentary on the subtly of a changing world  and how a large amount of governmental control can easily slip past our minds if we aren t careful  Jonas s world is an excellent representation of the consequences of letting people take away too much expressive freedom  and how allowing people to take the evil out of a world can make it lifeless and dead  It s also interesting that there isn t a single entity to fight in the book  but rather it was the people s ignorance that made the world so awful  It was the collective population as a whole that allowed for so much control and limitation to take over  without anybody doing anything about it  Jonas represents someone who finally sees the destruction of perfection and tries to stop it  but ultimately fails due to so few people being able to see the truth along with him   This book is a fantastic adventure  and I honestly think anybody could read it  but if I had to choose a specific group s  that would like this book  I honestly wouldn t recommend this to those who like dystopian future books  Those books tend to have huge  advanced worlds where it s very obvious that the government is corrupt and has taken over the people s minds  They tend to have a person or group of people who rise up and fight the evil  superpowered ruler s   While I have nothing against this type of book  that simply isn t what The Giver is  I think that the people who would like this book would be the people who like surreal fantasies or good social commentary  All in all  no matter what your taste  I think this book is a fantastic tale that nobody should miss  A book I tried to read a year ago and never gave it a chance  Read it through this time and loved it  the main characters in the giver are jonas  the giver  and jonas father  jonas is an eleven year old at the beginning and is awaiting what hes future job will be  he recived the job to become the reciver and after he starts having memories he starts changing  the giver already knows what jonas will discover and is troubled by it  he does not approve of what he knows about the community  jonas father is a nurture and does dont have memories and does not belive in love  the setting is in the future and they live in the same setting like many other people would but they have modified society to macth them  the conflict starts when jonas starts to have memories and begins to revolt on restriction being placed on community members the out come is that he flees the community with gabriel to save him from being released  i would recomend this because this could never happen in real life and it is very strange which can interest many people  A boy turns twelve and is given a important job  The memories he is given are good but also bad  His father lies to him  so he leaves  What will happen to him and his family   The Giver  by Lois Lowry is a marvelous science fiction novel that tells of a young but very special boy named Jonas The giver is written from Jonas s point of view as an eleven year old boy living in a futuristic society that has eliminated all pain  fear  war  and hatred  The society has also eliminated choice  at age twelve every member of the community is assigned a job based on his or her abilities and interests  Though he is a well behaved citizen and a good student  Jonas is different  He has pale eyes  while most people in his community have dark eyes  and he has unusual powers of perception  Sometimes objects  change  when he looks at them  He does not know it yet  but he alone in his community can observe flashes of color  for everyone else  the world is as empty of color as it is of pain  hunger  and inconvenience  You can only find out what happens if you read this novel I recommend this book to anybody who likes to read science fiction novels or to anybody who likes books that take place in the future  I really enjoyed reading this book  This book has 225 pages  Although The Giver by Lois Lowry and The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins may not seem like it  if you look deeper they are actually quite closely related  In both books  characters must face hardships  love and sacrifice  things that we all face  whether on small or large scale  in our day to day lives  In both The Giver and The Hunger Games  we learn that if you care about something enough  you will sacrifice anything for it Over the course of both books  the characters sacrifice huge things for the people they love  For example  Katniss puts her life in extreme danger by volunteering to go into the Arena in prims place   That s how I feel now  trying to remember how to breathe  unable to speak  totally stunned as the name bounces around inside of my skull   Suzanne Collins uses inner thinking to show how upset Katniss is when Prim is chosen to be a contestant in the 74th Hunger Games  And so it becomes even more clear how Katniss is willing to sacrifice anything to protect Prim  What some readers might not realize is how this theme is strongly connected to The Giver too  An example of this is how Jonas leaves the comfort of his community to save Gabe from being killed  He makes a risky escape  and must go out into the wilderness to find a new home  Both he and the baby  Gabe  almost die along the way  which goes to show the extent that he has gone to give this child a chance Some might say that the reason Jonas left the community was not to help Gabe  but to escape the Harsh rules of the community  While this may be true  by running away from the community  he knew that he was releasing the memories  so he knew that he was helping to liberate the community  All this leaves us wondering  Will we not only make huge sacrifices for loved ones  but also for a cause that we believe in   According to these two books  the answer is yes  Katniss is trapped in an  Arena  and Jonas is trapped in the  Community   They both feel persecuted and powerless to make a difference  They both strive to be free  So Katniss risks her life and starts a rebellion  while Jonas risks his and liberates the community from it s ignorance  In the Arena  Katniss is Literally trapped  She cannot escape unless she is the last one standing  However  she is also trapped in a very different way  She is trapped in the capitol s power over them  the Capitol s ability to force them to work for them  staying in the community  unable to break their cycle of poverty  However  because of Katniss s desire to be free  even though it means risking getting punished  probably even executed or tortured by the Capitol  she start a rebellion  This rebellion unites the districts and overthrows the Capitol  creating a better life for the people in the districts  There is no colour in the  Community   There is only uniformity and rules  But most of all  there is complete ignorance  Jonas is trapped in a community that knows nothing of their past  trapped  following the rules  day after day  not even realizing that they cannot see in colour  cannot feel love  Lois Lowry uses mentions rules very often    Lily   her mother reminded her  smiling   you know the rules     But it was  of course against the rules    Rules were very hard to change   Underlying these words is a feeling of how their lives are controlled by rules  and gives the reader a sense for their lack of freedom  After being given memories from the past  Jonas sees this major flaw in the community  and must risk running away into the unknown to return the memories and knowledge to the people  so that they  too  can see how wrong the community is and help to make it right  In conclusion  the main characters in The Giver and The Hunger Games must overcome seemingly impossible challenges  and sacrifice their comfort  safety and even risk their lives for the people they love and causes they care about  This leaves the reader wondering just how far we will go when it comes to sacrificing something important to us  When placed in these situations  would we have the courage to do the right thing  A beautiful book  It is amazing to read things about everyday we receive and see them in a new light through Jonas  who experience everything for the first time  I can only imagine it as blind since birth and was finally able to see all the colors  feel the emotion  pet  warmth  love  regret  poverty  fragility  wrath  fear and I admit  it is very remarkable book also very enjoyed reading  want to read the next book  In the exciting and suspenseful book  The Giver by Lois Lowry  the main character is twelve year old Jonas  He lives in a colorless and somewhat dull world where no one really has any feelings and what you say is always monitored  He is given his life assignment of being the Receiver of Memory  He receives the memories of the past  good and bad  from the current Receiver  a wise old man called the Giver  He then begins to understand the secrets behind his strict community  It s a great and imaginative book that I really enjoyed reading  and it was a fast and read too  The cliffhanger ending left me wondering what really happened to Jonas  Overall  I thoroughly liked the book and would read the other books in The Giver Quartet  Wow wow I really enjoyed reading The Giver  This is very good story about newly selected receiver  Jonas and the Giver of the far away future  The future in the book is like Utopian but later  in the book  it reveals its bad faces along  This book made me think about what really is life  what a person can really enjoy from life without feeling love  pain  desire and etc  When everything is the way we want now  it doesn t seem to be beautiful after all I liked it   3 btw  about that pursuing enlightenment and emptiness    doesn t sound desirable anymore  The Giver takes place in a futuristic society in where sameness has been accepted and welcomed  Jonas  an eleven is given the title of Receiver of memory  When the old Receiver  named now the Giver  shows Jonas life before Sameness  Jonas must think where he stands on Sameness and what he must do to help the society  My favorite part is the ending because it is not definite and leaves a lot to the imagination  I would recommend this book to people who like a story of a citizen who uncovers secrets about the government and a heart warming tale of friendship  adventure and fighting for what s right   I first read this book in September  2002 and was blown away by it  Since then I have read this title several times  now I read it in anticipation of the movie being released shortly  Although  for the most part  I don t really enjoy dystopian novels  I must admit that each time I read this book  I love it just a bit more  I find that this is a wonderful book to reread since each time there is something new I see in the passages and something more to discuss  I urge all of you to read this book and especially to read this with a child to gain a young person s perspective as well as your own  I thought I had read this book years ago and I now know I did not  Fascinating   This book is my favorite EVER  it is really good  It is about a world with no color  personallity  or feelings  In this world jobs are decided for people  and there are specal mothers that give birth to the children  The parents don t even get to choose there own child  And they don t get married they just put certain people together and give them children to raise  So why do I like this book  It just sounds sad and confusing right  Well I like it because it is about a boy who s job is to keep all the memories of the town  This person devolops the sense to see color and have felings  He has regular sessions with the giver  The giver is in charge of giving all of the memmories to the boy  This book has a exellent plot and lesson of society bookpeek tumblr com  The Giver has been in my to be read pile for entirely too long  I was introduced to it nine years ago by a friend  given a copy by loved one seven years ago  and only just finished it around five months ago  Tisk tisk Dystopia  Though portrayed to be a utopia to its people  it is a society with repressive and controlling powers over its people  Some may say the Lowry began the gigantic trend of the genre in The Giver after winning the Newbery Metal  Whether or not this is true  it is certainly one that every reader should begin with when deciding to embark into the dystopian genre Seriously  why didn t I read this sooner  Probably because it has an old man looking miserable on the cover and I at the time was much more interested in historical fiction and mystery  Little did I know  Lowry would satisfy my craving for intrigue and suspense and give me a new found appreciation for my every day freedom For the very few left who haven t a clue what this book is about  I ll save you from any spoilers  The book is too good to let out any specifics  To sum up what you ll be faced with  the story circles around a young boy who lives in a society where the freedom of decision are few and far between  Except maybe for our boy Jonas  He s given a most treasured opportunity that few rarely get  While everyone is forced into a job profession and with a mate that Jonas s government chooses for him  Jonas is guided by a man who is ready to pass on his special gift  knowledge  I know right  Knowledge is so fantastically treasured  especially when faced with censorship and only one person in all of the society is given the opportunity to have it  The question is  can Jonas handle it  If you ve enjoyed Across the Universe or Delirium  you really should take a chance on The Giver if you haven t already  If you have read The Giver  what did you think  One of the best novel  This one made me dream about a life where I was living in the sameness society  Eating sandwich that looked like rotten  But because of all the people couldn t see colours  they were eating it happily  But I was standing starving and waiting  I don t care if the novel is for children  May be I m still a child in my heart  I don t care  I loved this book and will happy to read it again and again  I wish I could give it 10 out of 5  What is the meaning of life if I couldn t see beyond the colours  What is the meaning of life if I couldn t hear beyond the music    I think that this book was a hit  I had a good time reading it  so everyone should try to read this one The Giver was probably one of the best books that I have ever read  How Lois described some scenes and how he progressed the story made it that much better Jonas lives with his family unit  waiting for the Ceremony of Twelve  when he gets assigned to the Receiver  which is the highest honor of the Community  He has to learn how to feel sadness  happiness  and see colors  which no one else can   I don t want to give away anymore I reccomend this book to anyone who has read The Unwanteds  Percy Jackson  or Harry Potter  A compelling read  A riveting story examining a flawed Utopian society  Many would label it as book intended for children rather than young adults  I have doubts over how to realistically label the book for its intended target group   it is by far one of the most thought provoking novels ever written for children  After coming to know about this from a friend  thank you Julian  and watching it s trailer I decided to read it  It was an easy read in couple of hours  Though how easy it was to read on  it had equally complex storyline  Once  if not often I thought about a society where there was no pain  sorrow or suffering  this book made me rethink about the idea of a society of that blueprint  Even though principally the story is morally driven but the society it examines  I found it metaphoric in its ambiguity  I would recommend this book to anyone who loves dystopian worlds  and well as people who like a book to let them think for themselves  Salve people  Ok  partendo dal fatto che questa e la mia prima recensione  YEAAH   spero di farla decentemente Iniziamo col dire che non sapevo dell esistenza di questo libro finche non ho visto il trailer del film ad esso ispirato  Mi ha ispirato fin da subito  per cui un giorno l ho trovato in libreria e l ho comprato senza pensarci nemmeno un attimo L ho lasciato li a prender polvere per qualche mese e quando  finalmente  ho deciso di aprirlo  non riuscivo a separarmene  L ho letto in un giorno Ma basta cianciare  inziamo a parlare del libro  Il libro ha come protagonista Jonas  un giovane adolescente che vive in una societa perfetta  Nella sua Comunita non esistono guerre  differenze sociali  sofferenze  cio che puo creare dolore  disordine o disturbo e stato abolito  compresi le cose semplici della vita come i sentimenti  le passioni  i colori e gli impulsi sessuali  Ogni Unita Familiare e costituita da un uomo ed una donna a cui vengono assegnati un figlio o una figlia  Al compiere dei 12 anni di eta  il Governo assegna la professione che si dovra svolgere per il resto della vita  A Jonas viene assegnato il compito di ricevere tutte le memorie del passato da un uomo che a sua volta ha svolto questa mansione  Jonas viene cosi a conoscenza di tutto cio assente nel suo mondo e si rendera presto conto che la societa in cui vive non e poi tanto perfetta come lui credeva   OMG  io ho adorato alla follia questo libro  A mio parere non ha nessun punto debole Lo stile e coinvolgente fin dalle prime pagine  la storia all inzio puo sembrare povera d azione ma seguendo nella lettura ci si rende conto di entrare profondamente nella storia narrata  i personaggi e la loro psicologia sono descritti in maniera eccellente  E  impossibile non innamorarsene  Sono rimasta molto toccata da diversi temi trattati nel libro  che sono stati spesso descritti in maniera decisa ma intelligente  Insomma non so che altro dire su questo libro  se non che l ho amato  Mi e piaciuta anche la trasposizione cinematografica del libro  tralasciando il fatto che alcuni particolari sono stati tolti  altri cambiati   The Giver  e il primo libro di una quadrilogia che pero io ho deciso di non continuare per il semplice fatto che ho sentito critiche negative sugli altri 3 libri e perche mi immagino che il libro sia terminato qui  Detto questo  spero di essere stata esauriente e di avervi dato un idea generale sul libro  Alla prossima   This book touched me in so many ways that I am not really sure where to start  The Giver caused me to think and look at the world for what it is  Yes our environment and society has problems  differences  and disagreements but it is these things that cause our world to be what it is  In The Giver  there are no differences  disagreements  or even problems in their society  Everyone is the same  everyone is equal  and everyone likes the way they live because they know no other way  Jonas is just like everyone else until he is selected to be the Receiver of Memory  It is after this assignment that he begins to see what their society is and could be again if all the memories are set lose  This novel made realize that our world is beautiful  even with its problems  and we should be thankful for the way we see it  I loved The Giver so much and will definitely be reading other books by Lois Lowry  I really enjoed this book  I loved how Louis Lowery can just get you drawed in and can make you not put your book down until it s over  The character Jonas is just portrayed as the perfect little teen who thens knows how the real world is and is enraged  Jonas is in a family of four his mom  dad  and sister  Everything in his world is regulated such as age limits for riding bikes to grammar use to dream sharing  Everyone in the community follows by the book or rules  Everyone is assigned a job at a certain age and there are ceremonies for everything  But one day everything changes for Jonas when he is assigned the job as reciever  The book you could almost feel like you were there especially when The Giver showed Jonas the video of his dad during the release  It was kinda scary to think that the world could come to being humane with those acions and how boring the world is when they don t even see colors  The book was just so entruiging and one of the better books I ve read I would suggest this book as a must read before your die kind of book  I adore this book  I adore sharing this book with students  It is so rich and full of issues which are pertinent to kids  It is a book which connects to HUGE issues  suicide  the role of government  choices  love  risk taking  and allows students to engage in discussions about said topics  Love this book  Am grateful for this book  Am a better teacher because of this book  The Giver by Lois Lowry is an adventurous book with simplicity The idyllic society where everything is organized and everyone obeys the rule without asking At the ceremony of twelve  the elders pre organized the chosen roles for the twelve years old and Jonas is chosen to be the special one The giver who received the memories from the old generation  pass the special and every atrocious memories from the past to Jonas and he tries to change the society The book is well organized and the cliff  hanging ending gets the readers think about now days societyThe character development is only limited to Jonas and the Giver  where as other characters such as his family does not appear to be as important after the first few chapters The underhanded society from the future conflicts the now days society and the author is mainly concerned with humanity At the start  I had no idea about the book but as it got up to the climax  it got me thinking about the expectation  and rules from the society The setting of the book is engaging and anyone who likes to think about the conflicts nowadays should read this book and think about the society today  Which society is more idealistic to you This book is 5 5  I liked everything about this book and it s a perfect book for people who thinks about the world in a bigger picture  I loved this book it is a perfect book for readers that love realistic fantasy story hl lTmtk hdhh lHy  hl tsh r blt b wlnhk hl khsrt mn lHrwb

well  yesterday  this feels like a completely different book  When you re eleven  I think you re more prone to clue into the personal aspects of the story  no  this isn t fair to Jonas  because that s how I in my eleven year old brain am feeling right now  Reading this again at more than twice that age  the bigger picture is more overtly what drives the story  how can people live in a system like this  and I see some of these same flaws in the system that surrounds me I guess what I m saying is  if you read this as required reading as a kid  like I did  it s definitely worth a second pass  for lots of reasons  As a side note  I love Lowry for her ability to talk up  not down  to younger audiences while at the same time including enough in the story  in the way not just of details or dialogue but also overarching theme and development  that it becomes a completely different book for older readers  I thought this book quite thought provoking  It s about a eleven year old boy named Jonas living in his community  In his particular community  everything is always right and everyone knows what they have to do and when they have to do it  He rides the bike he got when he became a nine like all of his age group does  Since he was eleven that meant that in December he and his class mates would become a twelve on their last ceremony All of the age ceremonies are special in their own ways but twelve is the most important  When you become a twelve you will be given the job in the community that the elders have chosen you for  Jonas  friends sit down on stage in rows in the order they were born and wait to be called  When Jonas  number isn t called he gets nervous  After that moment his life changes forever    This book reads like 1984 through the eyes of a child  It begins in a bland world where everything is structured and orderly and little Jonas is waiting to turn twelve and receive his adult assignment  the job he will perform for his community until he gets old  His assignment is that of Receiver of Memories and when he begins training for this job his perception of the world changes  He eventually faces heartbreaking realities and realizes things cannot stay the same  Although it is a short book written for young adults  this story is filled with philosophical and ethical questions about what humans would give up in order to be happy all the time  It is relevant to the time when it was published  1993  and it remains relevant to the present  Read this book yourself  then let your children read it  then sit down and talk with them about it  It might encourage both of you to see the colors in the world  Interesting twist on reality book that provokes deep thought about the state of our world  It can be understood on various levels  as most good writing can  It s an easy read and a page turner  I loved this book  I know it is a YA but who can t benefit from experiencing a world without color  love  emotion  family and individualism  It makes us appreciate our daily lives for all their richness and choices  I cannot imagine at age12  being given the occupation which is meant to satisfy me throughout the rest of my life I look forward to seeing how Jonas and Gabriel fare in the second book   I loved this book          This book Is about a dark future where there is No color  No love  No animals  And everyone has to fit In In their community if they don t you can be released to elsewhere  secretly they just kill you  if a baby doesn t seem to be like other Babies  BYE  BYE  and when a person gets too old  BYE  BYE  when one twin baby doesn t weigh like the other one  BYE  BYE  One kid becomes the receiver of memories and had to get memories way from the past from the old receiver now known as the giver  and he has to escape his city to have everyone remember the memories and save a baby who doesn t fit in named Gabe  how will this end  What I liked about this book is the imagination  what I learned is everyone should have love no matter what    At the age of 11 Jonas and all the other kids his age are preparing to find out what they will do for their jobs for the rest of their lives  Jonas is as apprehensive as everyone when he is skipped over in the ceremony  When they come back to him he is designated to be under  the receiver   Under him Jonas receives memories and for the first time experiences emotions such as happiness  sadness  even anger  In their society everyone abides by strict rules  Jonas slowly begins to wish he could have the freedom to make decisions that he is unable to currently in the society  Ultimately he and the receiver  who is now called the giver  decide they need to do something to change the society  This happens when Jonas sees a video of his dad giving a lethal injection to a baby twin  If Jonas were to leave the boundaries of the society  all the memories would come back to the community  He decides to leave in order to help the society  However  he has to leave sooner than planned because the baby Gabriel  who has been with his family for a while is assigned to be released the following day   Killed  Jonas flees with Gabriel and escapes to the edge of the community and makes it outside the boundaries  There while on the verge of death they make it to where they can see a house at christmas time  The ending doesn t say what happens after that point  but leaves it ambiguous This is one of my favorite books I have  It is my favorite dystopian novel that is out  I love the way Jonas changes as he begins receiving these new memories  His friendships are challenged as he is forced to sacrifice his way of life in order to save a life  It also brings up the value of agency in a community  Jonas flees to bring back good and bad and to help the society be able to regain their agency  Like many dystopian novels that is a great theme that can be discussed throughout the book  It was an interesting idea though that there had to be a giver who kept all the memories  It shows  at least initially  that the Elders were trying to protect people  and that is an interesting view point to take  It seems to me to imply that it was an attempt to do good  not maintain power The way the releases are done are not graphic  but it does show lethal injection which Jonas watches  That can be disturbing as it is a baby that it is happening to  Their are some reflections of war that Jonas receives as memories as well  but again nothing gratuitous  it portrays the emotion Jonas is feeling and doesn t focus too in depth on the war itself  Love love this book  Originally Published in 1993Audiobook version published in 2001 by Listening LibraryRead by Ron RifkinDuration  4 hours  51 minutesLois Lowry has done a very clever thing in her book  The Giver   She has written a book at a very simple level that explains some very complicated things in a way that most children will be able to easily grasp  A text does not have to be complicated to express complicated ideas In  The Giver  the reader is presented with a simple  Utopian society in an undetermined future time  Everything is peaceful  Everyone is fed  cared for and everyone has a place  The children are excited because it is time for the children to go through The Ceremony  All children up to age twelve are moved forward to their next year and receive some new responsibility or right  such as the right to ride a bicycle or to volunteer after school hours  Twelve year olds are assigned to their future work assignments by the Committee of Elders The main character is Jonas  a twelve year old who has been assigned to The Receiver of Memory  Jonas is to be the new Receiver and the old Receiver is now The Giver  Through an undeclared process  remember  this is sci fi   The Giver can pass on memories to The Receiver who holds them for his community  He is to act is the living repository of memories for his people What he finds out is disturbing   Read more at  http   dwdsreviews blogspot com 2015     Imagine a world without color  without cars or planes  A perfect society where no one goes hungry  where everything is perfect The Giver is an extraordinary story about a young man finding the courage to go against the norms of his society  and finding out what it means to laugh  and love  to see vibrant colors  and to face the horrible truths that this society has placed on its people I first had to read this story in middle school  and was so mesmerized by the authors vivid storytelling that I checked the book out twice just to read it again  It was the first book that I feel in love with and I highly this book recommend this book for middle schoolers and children who love to read  Of all of the novels I have read set in a dystopian society  this one by far  had the most impact on me In the previous books  and there have been many  there was always a clear feeling of oppression with the governing body taking away the most basic of human rights In  The Giver  however  I found myself lulled into a feeling of peace and contentment with regards to how these people lived  I actually found myself sighing at the thought of being part of such a community Never mind the fact that there was no longer such a thing a free will   everything being chosen for you including something as basic as when you could leave your  dwelling   and the conversations that you were to have with your family The fact that I could be temporarily sucked in to that delusion scared me more than any Stephen King novel could     I would recommend this book to everyone  The concept of a utopian world is explored in Lois Lowry s The Giver  The main protagonist Jonas and his family live in a world where there is no war  hunger or any suffering at all  Everyone in the community is assigned a role and a spouse  Jonas at the ceremony of eleven s is assigned to be the new Giver  In order to become he starts meeting with the current who is a fragile old man who carries all the old memories from the world that was before  The memories presented to him are not always horrible but Jonas starts to wonder about his community  Jonas ultimately decides to run away with young Gabe  a baby who his father brought home and is set to be killed  The fate of Jonas and Gabe is not really made clear at the end and left for interpretation   This novel explores the concept of living in a different type of society for children  Living in a world where everyone is the same and the concept of suffering doesn t exist  I still recall the first time I ever read this book in middle school and have re  read it about five times since then  It s a book that really opened my mind and wonder about our society and others  Teachers should defiantly keep this book in the classroom and curriculum  Overall it s a book that still hasn t been adapted by Hollywood  so we get a fresh slate and imagine these characters in our own head and perceive them in our unique way  The ending of the book serves for a discussion or assignment as well  what is the fate of Jonas and Gabe at the end  Although there is spin  off books that Lowry has written  this one could surely stand on its own as a classic and should be a must read for all children in middle school   Es un 4 5  pero es mas cercano al cinco que al cuatro y es mi resena y asi lo digo xdEncontrar un libro como este en mi vida  fue un premio Supero mis expectativas por completo Cuando te recomiendan un libro que es muy apreciado por otra persona  simplemente te dejas contagiar de su entusiasmo y decides leerlo  Muchas veces nos decepcionamos porque no era lo que esperabamos y otras como en este caso  comprendemos que estamos frente a un gran libro Lois Lowry con su particular forma de narrar me acogio en sus brazos y me enseno un mundo lleno de magia y misterios    tambien compartio de un modo o otro su critica a una sociedad llena de tapujos proyectada a la perfeccion  No se puede negar que este mundo creado desde lo futurista    tiene en sus cimientos algo de dolor por una realidad que nos acoge a todos  Ese particular y muy agobiante trabajo del Dador abrio mis ojos a esa ceguera que tanto habla Saramago en sus escritos  a esa falta de conciencia por un mundo que se destruye solo Toda esta critica implicita en los libros encajo perfectamente en el desarrollo de la historia y es que la historia es un completa locura  de esas locuras que estan bien narradas  expuestas y finalizadas  En pocas paginas hizo todo y me enamoro a tal punto de no dormir para saber como concluia  El final no me molesto y tampoco me lo esperaba  En mis especulaciones no sabia a donde queria parar la autora con tan dificil historia  Sentia que la accion no llegaria  porque no era necesario    la historia iba mas halla de momentos frio  donde el peligro es la solucion a todo  Si esperar un libro lleno de peligro vertiginoso no es para ti  esperen de el una reflexion profunda No quiero entenderme mas Unicamente recomendarles totalmente este libro  porque es digno de ser leido por todos _ Si han leido muchos libros de este genero y visto muchas peliculas tambien  sentiran una especie de deja vu con respecto a este libro  a mi me paso  vi reflejada en el muchos argumentos de muchos otras historias y si les pasa eso   encontraras que este libros sobresale en muchos y eso es admirable Simplemente vayan y leanlo  si confian en mi opinion  _ Recuerden siempre sonreir leyendo  3  The Giver  is a book that I believe was written with the intention of making it s readers think  In my opinion  when one sits down to read this book they should be prepared to search for a deeper meaning because this is definitely not a surface book and should not be looked upon as one  I believe stories like this are beneficial to young adults because at a time in their lives when they are extremely impressionable  it can be interpreted to teach the importance of free thought and the dangers of blind conformity  The story is set in an Utopian society of sameness and conformity where only one person could be chosen to be different  At the age of twelve  all other young Utopian members received a profession that was assigned to them by the societies leaders  Jonas  the main character  was given the special privilege of being the society s  Receiver   This chosen individual was responsible for holding the memories of the world that existed outside the Utopia  There is conflict however because Jonas soon learns that not all the memories he will have to hold are positive ones   some in fact  are painful truths I read this book a long time ago but as I re read in recently I couldn t help but wonder how this book could be compared with our real world issues  Could it possibly be criticizing communism by showing the failure in assigning jobs to fit an ideal society  Could it be posing an opinion on abortion  Or could it be warning us of the spreading  sometimes seemingly fascist  western influence and the loss of one s original cultural identity  Overall I gave this book 5 stars because I enjoyed it back in 7th grade and I enjoyed re reading it recently on a deeper level   This book was brilliant  I am still in shock of how much this book affected me  The writing was so captivating  and the story makes you realize how privileged we are to live such beautiful and colorful lives  despite the pain that comes along with it  I connected with the characters so much  the giver himself being my favorite  I am just so angered to know that the other books in the series are companion books  so I won t know what happens to Jonas and Gabe  And to their community  Although I suspect they will encounter the real wiworldor a different dimension  aybe that will be explained in the other books  I want to know so badly now  Ce livre fut un enorme coup de coeur  ce fut pour moi plus que deroutant  ecrit avec force et douceur a la fois  Pour moi  tout est remis en question  et pour cause il est devenue un de mes livres preferes et je le recommande vraiment enormement  Je ne m attendais pas a autant aimer et a avoir une telle surprise  Il envoie un certain message   le monde cruel qui offre des choses moins bel tel que la souffrance  la guerre et la famine  mais aussi un monde tout a fait different  remplis d amour et d amitier qui permet de passer bien au dessus et ils en paraissent d autant plus magnifiques   Loved this book again  Second time reading it  The mystery behind this series has always intrigued me  So far  the book is amazing  The part where we find out what  release  means  is SOOOOO sad   Spoiler Alert Why did the baby have to die   Decided to reread The Giver after twenty years away  Remembered that it might  tag  on well to The Book Thief given the presence   and absence  of colors and the desire to find worlds full of color  Jonas  the newly annointed Receiver  is touched and taught by the Giver  the preserver of ancient memories  who is alternately paralyzed and energized by the past  As Jonas discovers the true reality of the place of Sameness where he lives  he decides to opt for freedom  and takes baby Gabriel with him  Although the ending is enigmatic  the message is positive  Choose  stand and deliver once you have sufficient knowledge of action and consequence  This novel used to intrigue students  suspect it still would  Passing along memories and knowledge is the greatest gift one can give  Wow  This book was really good  Now  you have to understand that I m not a Sci Fi person at all  Hmmm    I don t really know where to start   ok well I really liked the way it was written to begin with i guess  I generally don t like when books are written in a strange er   well strange to me  form because I generally don t adapt well when it comes to new things  I think one of the main reasons why i liked this book was because of the message in it  because you really don t know if people are lying  That s one of the characteristics of lying you can t tell the difference between what the person is saying and what the truth really is  Of course  that all depends on whether or not the person is a good liar  Another message that jump out at me was that the world would totally suck if everything we did had to go along with the  rule book  and you absolutely never got to choose what you wanted to do  Now she might not have phrased it that way but whatever  Ok just one more that I ll mention  I liked this book because i could really relate to Jonas  I have absolutely no idea what i want to do with my life  And im not very good at making decisions  but im not gonna blab on and on about me because that would put everyone that s reading this review  which is about uh   let s see    2 people   so I m just going to mention the only thing that i didn t like about this book  I like books with elaborate endings  where everything unfolds and nothing is left unknown  that s just the way I am  I felt that in this book the ending was a little rushed and i was just a wee bit confused    but that may be my fault because i stayed up late reading it   but i don t really know  And I m not a pro book reviewer so yell at me if you wish  but that s just my opinion  wait  ok good you re asleep  Being a Utopian story  it ends up the exact opposite  The way it is written was greatly sentenced and written  All readers who read it will find it astonishing and a great story for the youngsters  The entire family will enjoy it     It shows responsibility that a twelve year old needs  It would help all young children learn responsibility  You could say it is so good you would rather be released than give it up      Never judge this book by it s cover  This cover tells the entire story in it s likeness   This book is great because it has a lot of fun things going on in it  It also has a lot of mystery going on  This book seems to be a utopia at first but then it turns into a distopia  At first the book starts off really slow  but once you read it you ll understand why  The main character is a boy named Jonas  He lives in a utopian society  Everything is perfect and nothing is ever wrong  Jonas was picked for an honorable assignment at twelve which is when you get your job   When he gets his assignment he is surprised and happy  When his training begins he starts to dislike his assignment  He discovers a lot of bad things  When he finds out what his dad does he doesn t even what to look him in the eye  He doesn t like the fact that they do bad things when they don t know anything   The Giver is a wonderful story about a perfect Utopia where everything is perfect and they live in a perfect world  This is a world where no one can see color and everyone wears the same thing  This book is about a boy named Jonas who lives in this society and at 12 years old is looking for a job  Now this is a perfect society so in this town people are no allowed to have twins and if they do the doctor takes one and kills the other  you are allowed to have any job you wanted but u have to be a certain age to start   In this Utopia everything is perfect so they are deprived of feelings  They don t feel pity or hate because it was taken from them a long time ago  There is this man called the giver who has all the peoples memory  How it feels to hurt  have pain  be wounded and be in love  The purpose of his job is to find a receiver to give his memories to and it has to be someone strong because the last receiver died  When Jonas starts working as the receiver he begins to experience things he never thought her would  He also begins to see in color  I know its crazy  but the question is does he survive this  Read this book if you want to find out   Jonas lived in a world where there was sameness throughout the community  No color  no real feelings  no wrong choices  and no memories  He appreciated his life and felt like there was nothing wrong it like many other members of the community  Though it all changed when Jonas became the Recevier of Memory  He got memories of color  choices  love  pain  and other real feelings  Will he ever try to change it  Find out in The Giver  One big injustice in The Giver is releasing people killing people   This happens when someone breaks a law three times  when the old get to a certain age  and if a newchild by the time it gets to one is not sleeping well or not growing at fast as they should  The situation was not resolved  but I think it could be  It could be resolved by The Giver saying that doing this was bad and that they should change the law  This would resolve the problem because he is the head Elder and they ll listen to anything he says  I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys the science fiction catigory  Especially the book  Matched  beacause it has many similarities like getting paired with a spouse  getting assigned a job  and having basiclly no choices  Also  if this catigory of book entertains you  you might like some books like  The Hunger Games  or  The Maze Runner   I would say to really understand it you should read it at the age of about 12  I loved this bok and personally can t imagine how anyone couldn t  This book called  The Giver  it is a very confusing book  I have strong feelings on this book  At the same time it was a good book  Throughout the book it got confusing but in the middle I understood it better  The theme of this book is utopia  Having a  perfect world  But in this book my personal opinion is that it isn t what so ever a  perfect world  Lois Lowry had an extremely difficult vocabulary  but the vocabulary makes a book be a book  This author put his own utopia into this book and that s great that he has an imagination like that Well this book is about a boy named Jonas  who is learning about his community  His community has strict rules  One of them is that couples can t have families of their own  People have to inject the female to have kids  BUT they could only have 2 children  a boy and a girl  If they have more than two children the government releases them  By release I mean they kill the newborns  Now Jonas is very involved into this community he doesn t really understand what is going on with his community  Jonas is the chosen one  What I mean by the chosen one is that he got chosen by the government to be part of the comity  In this community birthdays are different than other  Each year when someone gets older it means different responsibilities  This book van be confusing but if like you read it clearly and re read passages you ll understand the text  Like I mentioned that in this book couples have a limit on having children  well this part reminds me of China  Like for example the population in China is growing rapidly and they are making a rule on only having two kids per family  When I was reading about having a limited number of children per couple  I thought about Chinas population I recommend this book to the high level readers   I thought I reviewed this already     Weird I can see why this book is a classic  It starts out so simply I thought it was for little kids  but then you realize what s going on and the stilted writing style makes sense  A beautiful  carefully thought out dystopia  Jonas is an almost 12 year old in a dystopian society where everything is extremely ordered and perfect   families consist of two parents with one boy and one girl  no one gets sick  there is perpetual peace  everyone is polite and well mannered  and when death does come it is almost always at an old age and ushered with a celebration  At the age of twelve each child in the community learns what their life assignment will be  a career that is assigned by the Elders  and they dedicate their lives to following the rules that govern that assignment  Jonas receives a special assignment   to work with The Giver   and quickly learns that his perfect world comes at a price that he could not have even imagined    mild spoilers   nothing too big   This book was extremely powerful and truly makes you think about the world we live in   yes  there is a lot of pain and suffering but would we banish these evils from our world if it meant also giving up joy and love  This is one of the most beautifully written young adult books I have ever read  Lowry s genius storytelling is so provocative because you learn about Jonas  world as he learns about it  therefore you share the shock  wonder  and eventual outrage that he feels in the book    actual spoilers   Toward the end of the book  when The Giver and Jonas are planning for Jonas to go away I was a little shocked that The Giver was pushing for Jonas to leave while he would be the one to stay behind  I initially thought it was very selfish of The Giver to make Jonas leave everything he has ever known and go to what I thought was certain death regardless of how limiting life in the community was  However  at the end of the book I realized that The Giver gave Jonas the gift of actual life  possibly the best gift anyone could receive  when I started reading it  I was immediately drawn into the book  It somehow reminded me of The Host  partly due to how everyone is given a role  etc  The Nurturer  The Birthmother  Then  it started to remind me about a book i read ages ago  Fahrenheit 451 which was also about a dystopian society  Every single thing is controlled by the so called government  Who you fall in love with  your children and what you do  I never understand why do they still continue living in that kind of society  Like little puppets being controlled  In addition  there is no colour  memories weather and so many more stuff  i wonder how they live with it  that sameness ideology is just plain freaky  Anyway  I love the character  Jonas  I love the development of the story  the pace is just nice  But  i really wanted to know what happened to the society in the end whether they changed or remained the same  What happened to Jonas after he went to the new society  What happened to Gabe too  I just wanted some answers  I really hate it when the ending is quite open ended  Overall  dystopian society based books always live to their expectations   Really loved this book   what took me so long to read it   Estoy muy contenta de abrir 2015 con este libro que sin duda estara en mi top en noviembre  Sigo en estado vegetativo por el final  pues en definitiva  no me lo esperaba y eso me genera mas ansias de leer En Busca del Azul  Una de las frases que pudieron volverme loca fue   Ahora compre dia a los animales  en el momento en que el caballo regreso del arroyo y golpeo afectuosamente el hombro de Jonas con su cabeza  percibio los lazos que unen lo animal y lo humano   El libro describe muy bien el amor fraternal  entre nuestro protagonista hacia El Dador y hacia Gabe  por destacar mis favoritos y mas evidentes   pero el amor que existe hasta en la naturaleza se describe muy bien en este trozo de libro   Que penso Lowry para dar un primer recuerdo en nieve y un trineo rojo    Por que en el final del libro  y ya no siendo recuerdo  aparece este escenario    Seria de nosotros algo mejor o peor vivir en un mundo de Igualdad   si tenemos la capacidad de entender la mentalidad humana  es malo controlarla  En algunas palabras  este libro me escogio  y se lo agradezco   This book was even better the second time  Now reading it through a literary lens it s so much deeper  I m amazed that they still call this a children s book  The giver takes place in a failed paradise future where all fear and pain in society was eliminated by Sameness  The story follows an eleven year old boy named Jonas  At the age of twelve Jonas and all the other twelve year olds are assigned jobs by the higher ups  Jonas however  is named the next Giver  As the story progresses  Jonas learns that the Giver s duty is to hold the memories of the past and advise the people based on his knowledge  My favorite character was Jonas because the reader takes a journey with him from Sameness to the pain and joy of the past long forgotten I read this book three times in the past  Two for school and one for fun  It was on my third reading that my perception on the book changed  The Giver introduces many interesting ideas in it s setting  One good example is the exclusion of color due to the Sameness  It is hard to imagine growing up without knowing the beauty of the world around us I enjoyed this book immensely  I enjoyed learning about how corrupt the society is under the paradise guise I would recommend this book to an older audience as the ideas in the book might fly over childrens books  As I read it when I was older  the book was chilled me to the bone  People who enjoy dystopian novels and it s close cousin failed paradise novels would enjoy this story Acabo de terminar de leer este libro y estoy bastante impactada  A mi modo de ver  a pesar de que el protagonista es un chico de doce anos  no considero que sea una novela muy juvenil  y mucho menos infantil  como he llegado a leer  porque dudo mucho que un nino de diez anos pueda entender exactamente toda la reflexion que lleva intrinseca la historia   Y ese final  En serio  necesito hablar con alguien de ese final  En El dador de recuerdos se trata la utopia de un mundo perfecto  sin dolor  sin ambicion  sin elecciones    Todo funciona correctamente  Todo es como debe ser  Hasta que  despues de la celebracion del 12 en la que se le asigna a cada nino el trabajo que va a realizar de por vida  a Jonas se le asigna ser el sucesor del receptor de recuerdos  a el se le traspasara todo el conocimiento de la humanidad y sera el unico que tendra ese conocimiento Es entonces cuando vamos descubriendo que hay realmente detras de esa civilizacion perfecta  y cuando se nos invita a reflexionar sobre ella   Seriamos mas felices si no tuviesemos recuerdos   Seriamos mas felices si realmente no sintieramos nada   Sin tener que elegir   Simplemente hacer lo que se hace porque asi es como debe ser La autora nos mete en la piel de Jonas y nos transmite esa necesidad de querer compartir esos recuerdos y esas sensaciones que va adquiriendo poco a poco y la frustracion por no poder hacerlo y ver como todo lo que ocurre a su alrededor llega a ser incluso perverso  Es un libro muy cortito que se lee en unas pocas horas  La narracion es corta  fluida  sin entrar en grandes detalles  sin descripciones apabullantes ni de los paisajes  ni de los personajes  ni de la sociedad  No hay romance  no hay accion  pero contiene esa intriga que te hace pasar irremediablemente las paginas para saber mas  para saber si al final Jonas conseguira abrirle los ojos a sus conciudadanos o no  Y  como he dejado entrever  el final de la novela queda completamente abierto  pero no porque haya una continuacion  por lo que he leido  el resto de libros de la saga no vuelven a contemplar la historia de Jonas  sino porque creo que la autora queria que cada lector tuviera su propia opinion sobre que es lo que al final habia pasado En conclusion  El dador de recuerdos es un libro que recomiendo completamente por su historia  la fuerza de sus personajes principales  Jonas y El dador  y por ese trasfondo de la sociedad perfecta que invita a reflexionar sobre tu propia sociedad  Memories are our history  our past  unable to be forgotten  Through them our feelings demand to be felt  The feelings of love  but also the feelings of pain  Sameness brings the loss of pain but also the loss of love  It brings the loss of any real emotions  It takes away fear but hides the depth of happiness for us to experience That is what I concluded from the book  That is what I thought of as the book continued on This was a beautiful book that I could not seem to put down  The ending was not what I expected and I don t believe to fully understand it yet   I can t say I love this book  because I don t  I don t like the idea of a world of sameness where people are treated as robots rather than humans  I don t like this because I have been socialized to believe differently  However  as disturbing as this book is  I believe that it is important  Art should  at times  disturb people to open their minds to different ideas  The Giver does just that  Over and over the theme is repeated  they don t know any better    this is all they have been taught   I believe this book is important for that reason  When trying to understand another person s point of view or way of life  one must always keep in mind that they became this way because they most likely do not know anything outside of this  I think it s important to recognize that we can be angered by that  but must also learn to be sensitive to someone who is a product of their raising  But also equally important to learn that each of us has the power to change the world I also believe there s another underlying message in this story about a world of sameness  This book was written over 10 years ago  but there are still people in this world who would prefer it everyone believe exactly as they do  and live exactly the way they live  They consider that world to be a safer place for their children  I think this book brings to the attention that often times the things we think are protecting future generations  may in fact be harming our world  It is a good thing to have different ideas  different cultures  different colors  different beliefs  We learn through those differences  In a world of sameness  there would be control in order to keep that sameness  and much of humanity as we now know it would be lost as in The Giver  This book addresses why that is a potentially dangerous idea to put into motion   Jonas s world is a world with no change  no feeling and no difference  Jonas is picked to be the new receiver of memories  A task that reveals a truth that Jonas does not except and realizes that the dwelling that he has been engulfed in means nothing  Jonas is angry with the community as well as himself  He is forced to take action  no regrets  no remorse  no turning back  Lois Lowry illustrated a fantastic young adults book that delves deep into the readers mind and makes them rethink the way they read it before and provides a meaningful experience for all who read it  It gives an ending that has many different thoughts and questions about the whole book and how it concludes itself  Jonas lives in a  perfect  world where there is no war  disease or suffering  Where everything is order and under control  When Jones turns 12  the Community selects him to be the new  Receiver of Memories   He is trained by  The Giver  who holds the memories of true pain and pleasures of life  The Giver now must pass the memories on to Jonas  There is no turning back  I read this book in a day and it was incredible  I couldn t stop reading it  This book teaches the themes of the importance of memories  the importance of an individual and the relationship between pain and pleasure   Believe it or not  I had not read this book until this year  missing out on it my entire childhood  I believe I thought that the old man on the cover was creepy      I am very sorry that I waited until now to read this classic  as it has one of the best worlds built of a book  and the topics of memory  emotions and choice are fantastically woven into a powerful coming of age narrative  The inferential knowledge is so cleverly built  and this is a book that trusts its reader to reach new levels of knowledge without making it explicit always  A fantastic and smart main character  a deep and thoughtful narrative full of joy  sorrow  and reflection  The Giver is a must read for any age  Summary  The story starts out with our protagonist named Jonas in a society where people are given jobs at certain ages and everyone is equal in clothing  food supply  and occupation  They have a selection ceremony where when you turn 12 your career is decided for you for the rest of your life  Jonas is chosen to be the communities  Receiver  which entails receiving all of the civilizations past and present memories and giving advice as the need arises  However as Jonas continues to learn about the society he lives in and understands how it works he grows continually discontent  He is no longer innocent of the ways of his community and eventually  with the help of the Giver  his mentor and teacher  devise a plan to escape from the community he was born in Response  I loved this book  and in fact the whole  series  because Lowry has a certain grace and respect with her writing that I feel like many dystopian novels are missing out on lately  She deals with a complicated issue of trying to ultimately create a perfect community  which logically in theory could be correct  but is moralistically unsound  Her plot structure is readable and easy to understand by all audiences  but is also extensive enough to delve into deeper and find connections to modern day society Warnings Sexual Content  Mention of Jonas wanting to bath a female in the community Drugs  noneLanguage  noneViolence  None  Injections is the only thing that comes close to that Witchcraft  none I loved this book even more after I finished it  again   I love many of Lois Lowry s books   Number the Stars  is another favorite  and I admire how she does not pull punches when it comes to content  I am a firm believer that children s books shouldn t be  dumbed down  and Lowry seems to believe her reader has a certain level of maturity  Some scenes are downright chilling  the  release  of the twin   and this is a book that sticks in your mind long after the last page  I am looking forward to rereading the companion books   Gathering Blue  and  The Messenger    I am also looking forward to reading the final book  Son  to see if some of the questions about the fate of Jonas and Gabe are finally answered  CAUTION  When discussing this book with others  be aware that there are some strong opinions out there  I almost got my face mauled for offering my interpretation of the last chapter     Onward to  Gathering Blue     I really enjoyed this book  I had read it previously to being required to read this book for english  I gave this book a 4 out of 5 stars because I hated the ending  I think that Lois  the author  wrote and amazing book and should have finished the story  What she did was left the ending to the readers to infer what had happened  In this story  there is a boy named Jonas and he lives in an unknown world to us as readers  In this world there is no color  no weather changes and no feelings  Otherwise known as a drab world  Jonas lives in a world where nobody makes any choices  There are many rules  some odd ones too  and at twelve  for example  there is a ceremony to decide what job you will take on for the rest of your life  Elder people decide this job for you and you get no say in what you want to be  In Jonas  case  the elders have decided that he will be the new receiver  So overtime Jonas becomes receiver from the Giver  Jonas receives memories  good ones that bring smiles to his face  or bad that make him drown in tears and feel pain  He overcomes obstacles with this new job and realizes how many people don t even know what choices that they have been revoked of  Meanwhile there have been many things going on throughout the story and most of the family problems have to do with a fostered baby  whom which Jonas loves  is going to be killed  When Jonas decides to run away  he takes Gabe  the infant  with him and the readers are left to infer what happens to them as they get to the top of a cold snowy mountain One connection that this book has given me is when children do not get ay say in what is going to happen  this though  is when everyone gets revoked of the privilege to say and think what they want  This reminded me of  Annie   In  Annie  the girls don t get any say in anything  Ms  Hannigan commands that the girls do things for her and revolt their privileges  I read this book in second quarter  but reviewed it for third quarter credit  Differences and choices might be hard and risky   But they make your life complete and enjoyable     Louis Lowry s novel  The Giver  is a dystopian piece that explores a future that is void of  bad  things such as fear  pain  war  hatred  but is also void of  good  things such as color  passion  emotion  a sense of connection  Lowry explores this work through 12 year old  Jonas  a boy who has been selected to be the new receiver  that is  the receiver of all memories and feelings  both good and bad  Once Jonas experiences these feelings and emotions  he wants to share them with everyone  however  attempts in the past have proven that society is not open to such a change  The ending  is ambiguous and the reader doesn t really know what happens to Jonas  other than the fact that he and Gabriel  another main character  escape into  Elsewhere   a place outside of the  safety  of the community a place where the old  disobedient  and disfigured are  released  into I remember reading this book for Book Club in 7th grade and I remember thinking it was pretty good  I believe this was the first dystopian novel I read  REcently  I know Lowry book has really become quite popular in the classroom and really has become a key piece of young adult literature that has been considered  serious  enough to teach  so naturally  I wanted to revisit the piece  Dystopian literature is not something that is unusual for me to read  as I really do enjoy most of the dystopian literature I ve read in the past  and I must say that Lowry s novel did not disappoint the second time around  It was a quick read and it reminded me a lot of other Dystopian literature I ve read  especially Huxley s Brave New World  which I think might be an interesting companion piece to this one  I would definitely recommend this to young students interested in dystopian literature  The Hunger Games seems to be quite popular  and would love to teach this in high school some day as I think it provides many talking points on hot topics and unanswerable questions  Much debate  I think  would spark from this book  and I m interested to see how students would react to it  Even though I read it in middle school  I definitely think this would be more appropriate for 10th to 12th grade  for I feel like an older audience could better understand the depth this book offers   Everyone on Planet Earth should read  The Giver   and I do mean everyone  children  the intended audience  and their parents  grandparents  friends  everyone  This is one of the most challenged books in school libraries  and I reckon I can understand why   there are lots of notions here that are at least uncomfortable  things like suicide  euthanasia  mind control  and loads more The gist of the story  A young boy in a utopian society discovers maybe things aren t so wonderful in his village when he meets The Giver  who is charged with passing the collected memories of the world to the boy  What results   well  that s up to you to discover  A simple enough concept  hmm  And that s the beauty of it  there is great power in these 175 or so pages  Buy it  read it  learn from it  treasure it  Introduce it to your friends and family  But do make sure your children read it and learn as well Maybe  just maybe  someone will understand why banning a book  any book  puts us one step closer to the world of The Giver  This book is set in a future society that is ruled by very rigid controls and restrictions  Children are closely observed and then assigned future occupations on their 12th birthday  Families are assigned to be together and everything runs and flows very smoothly  There are no emotions  there are no problems  When Jonas is 12  he is assigned to be the Giver  the member of the community that holds all of the memories and emotions and feelings for the world  As he begins his training however  he begins to wonder if what he is doing is best for the community  and if what the community is doing is best for the people I ve always loved this book  I can t think of a time I didn t love this book  I actually just really recently learned that there were three more books after this and I was so incredibly excited  I think Lois Lowry is a fantastic author and I admire her ability to completely create new worlds  This book doesn t have any sort of violence or sex or drugs or anything like that  although there are some memories of war  It deals with the idea of death  but it does so gently and not in a way that is going to scare or worry kids  I loved this book when I first read it way back when  and I loved it all over again now   My son is reading this book in his 7th grade English class  so I thought I d give it another read  It s a classic dystopian young adult novel  What I really admire about this book is how robustly detailed the dystopian society is   every aspect of life in the community is controlled  regulated  and dictated  A friend once observed to me that the great unequalizer in American society is the family   some are supportive  healthy  and functional  while others are destructively detrimental to healthy development  This society even manages to rid itself of the family wild card   adults who are deemed suitable for parenting are matched together and may apply for one male child and one female child  to be birthed by the Birth Mothers and raised until the age of one by the Nurturers  The idea of attraction and love is medicated out of the citizens  Family life is rigidly prescribed   certain questions must be asked and rituals must be followed every day by every family  All adults have assigned work and all children are cared for in the Child Care Centers until they enter school  What makes this a 5 star book for me is the way Lowry so elegantly reveals the aspects of the society through the narrative exposition  The writing is spare but vivid and haunting This novel really made me consider the power we have with our freedoms  When you have the ability to choose  you can make poor decisions that may not only effect you but also impact others in the community  That s the balance that we haven t quite figured out  In the community Jonas is a twelve  meaning he is old enough to receive his job  He wants nothing more than a job that is normal and involved in the community  but the elders have other plans for him  He was assigned as the receiver of memory  the most important job of the community  His community doesn t have pain  suffering  or war  Everything is perfect and in order  or is it  The giver knows the truth about the community and the generations before  Jonas must be strong enough to realize the truth about the community in order to survive   I think that this book was AMAZING but somethings in the were very sad like when they had to release the old  one of the twin babies that weighed less  the babies that weren t ready  and the people who broke the rules 3 times  Also people had the same birthday which was every December  People can only get bikes when they are a 9 and when they are a 12 they get assigned a job which means they don t get to pick their job and if you are a receiver you would have to hold all the memories of the world and the people can t have their own memories only the memories of their life which was great because they do not feel pain but the receiver does  I recommend the book to people that are 12 and up  What an astonishing book  I wash very impressed by this book it seemed as if on every page there a new detail to get your mind working  It makes you start think in a different expression and a whole new level  I would definitely recommend this book to people of all ages    The Giver  by Lois Lowry describes the life of an usual boy  Jonas  in a life of sameness in his perspective  Jonas becomes the  Receiver of Memories  because he has the capacity to see beyond  The Giver is the only other man that understands him because everyone else believes in sameness  But does Jonas   I really enjoyed the book  The book was extremely well written an was very powerful that foreshadowed the book very well  Strengths about the book were the foreshadowing and weaknesses were clarifying details such as what being released many  I would recommend this to a classmate because the writing was very powerful and it is a joy to read  If it is a series  I would want to read the others to see if it was as good as  The Giver     The books  The Giver and Maze Runner  have few similarities  but are mostly different   Firstly  this book has many similar feats  A major similarity both the books have is that the main characters value freedom  For example  in The Giver  the society lives in a state where reality is no longer a thing  Jonas receives memories from The Giver  and learns the truth behind life itself  Due to his knowledge  he acted in a liberalistic way  and forced the society to change into a society that is free of restrictive thought  Thomas was trapped inside a maze  specifically because he was a test subject for an organization  He hated being trapped inside the maze  and so wanted to be free  Jonas wanted mental freedom  and Thomas wanted physical freedom  Another set of similarities the book has is that they the main characters have one goal and one goal only  That goal is to escape  Jonas wants to escape his society because he knows too much  and Thomas wants to escape the maze because  well  its a maze  Also  the societies they live in each have leaders  In The Giver  the society is ruled by the elders  The elders oversee everything going around the community  Like a metaphorical santa  they can tell whether you re naughty or nice   These sets of books are more different than similar  The biggest difference is the societies they live in  In The Giver takes place in a controlled and peaceful society  In Maze Runner  the small village the people created  The Glades   is much smaller and just as orderly  but when Thomas arrived at The Glades  everything turned in to bloody chaos  because people were blaming him for the deaths of others  People viewed Thomas as an outlier  when Jonas is equal to everyone else in his society  Also  Jonas has a mentor  The Giver  whilst in Maze Runner  there is none  because no one is really viewed as a mentor  One obvious difference is the main character s knowledge  In The Giver  Jonas gets his memories from The Giver  and eventually knows to much  In Maze Runner  Thomas arrives at The Glades with no sort of memories whatsoever  The only thing he could remember was his name   Altogether  the books The Giver and Maze Runner have quite a few similarities  but altogether  the book s stories mostly contrast from each other  While the story line is a commonplace throughout dystopian novels  the book is still a fantastic read for readers young and old  In a society where everybody is just like everybody else  young Jonas is assigned to be the Receiver of Memory  and just like that  his whole world is flipped upside down as he learns the truth about the world  I really enjoy the use of a young boy as the protagonist  as it allows his growth to be shown as connections he has with the people around him are built up and torn down as he learns more and more about the world  The other thing I like about the story is one of the small things that tears it away from other dystopian novels  and that is the fact that the memories of the past are still around  but they are contained within one person  Most dystopian novels have no memories of the past are help within people in the society  I would recommend this book to anyone  young or old  A wonderful YA novel  Simply  yet beautifully written  Very thought provoking  I read this book when I was a little girl and I don t remember much about it all that it was boring and that i didn t like it at all  But when I read it this time I could not put it down  I loved this book but I can see why some schools band it because it does talk about killing babies and people  It is a sad story and I would really enjoy reading on in the series because it just sucks you in and you can t put it down until you know the ending  But I think it would be a great book for kids to read when they are maybe a little oder because I think they would enjoy it  But it is just not for a younger age group   I was deeply moved by this book  The end went to fast for me  I listened to it  so now I want to read it so I can better process the end  I m looking forward to discussing it with my book club friends  What if we lived in a world where all the important decisions were made for us  Who you love  where you work  when you die  none of this would be an issue because the important decisions would be made for us  Jonas  an 11 year old boy and main character in The Giver by Lois Lowry lives in a community where this is normal and individuality and emotion is looked down upon  He already stands out because he has light colored eyes  and it just makes sense when his eye color qualifies him to be the next Receiver  a person who harvests memories  and  when the time comes  passes them on to the next Receiver  Through his lessons with the Giver  a nickname for his mentor   Jonas learns about things he never knew  like emotions and colors  but more importantly  he starts to see the cracks of his seemingly flawless community  When the problems only Jonas notices become too much to handle  he is left with a decision that could ultimately determine the fate of the world as he knew it  Jonas was a unique character  especially in this book  Contrary to him barely being a teen  he is more mature and smart than normal children his age  He is very caring and also very passionate about his relationships with people as he starts to see the truth  Also  Jonas has a keen interest in little things that we would take for granted  Personally  I give the book 3 5 stars  It was very vivid and thorough as far as descriptions went   Tiny  cold  featherlike  feelings peppered his body and face   Jonas experiencing snow on page 80   On the other hand  I felt like the use of such big words sometimes made some points in the plot vague  I think Lois Lowry left the ending ambiguous so that the readers could come to a conclusion by themselves  The ending was made to suit all the possibilities of all the different ways the book could be interpreted  One critic I have about the novel is the plot development  No real action took place for ten chapters  and having a long  slow exposition is not a sufficient way to entice readers  This is a Children s Literature Book That Challenges AdultsTHE GIVER is the story of Jonas who lives in a world where there is no pain and sameness is the goal  Nothing is allowed to upset this peaceful  bland world  When Jonas turns twelve his is given his position in the community  Jonas is chosen to be the receiver  the one person who has memory of the entirety of the world including color and emotions and pain and love  What Jonas discovers is that a world without pain and discord can also mask dark realities I read this book because my sixth grader is reading it for class and I wanted to know what the book was about  I was surprised by the depth of the story and the interesting parallels of today s society where parents often try to eliminate all pain and struggle from their children s lives  I recommend giving this book a try  It is not the typical dystopian teenage novel  ATTENTION CITIZENS  IF YOU THINK THIS IS A BLAND SCI FI ADVENTURE THEN YOU ARE TO BE RELEASE IMMEDIATELY  I originally read this book in middle school and initially liked it  rereading this novel has only strengthened that feeling to increase my appreciation for not only the text itself  but also what it represents  Freedom  I love the language Lowry uses to describe the strictness and limitations the elders force upon the community  the interesting part is the way she shows that the citizens do not even know it  they are completely unaware to the fact that there was another way to live  Not only to exist for the benefit of the population  but to truly enjoy life and actually get a chance to live it  even though i feel that a majority of the characters are flat  they still play a pivotal role in developing jonas s realizations and maturity  I would recommend this book to anyone  but i believe it needs to be introduced around or after fifth grade  i think this because a child needs to be able to understand the conflicting ideas this story presents  they also need to have the capacity to understand how the community is ran and that the normal citizens in the community are limited i areas such as seeing colors  having certain emotions  and feeling pain  this may be difficult for a young age group to understand  and it is a main and key characteristic of the story  I liked this book and I think that it s a book for teens and not children  The book won t interest little kids that much so that s why I think it s more of a teen book  A very good fiction that depicts values in our lives  explains in a very creative way that life is not all about surviving but to nurture the feelings  emotions that we encounter daily  Love is all around  we just need to be human to understand the same  Rules are necessary in a social life but killing once feelings is not a way to deal with life  Yes  there are uncertainties in life like distinguishing people on the basis of color and that needs to be dealt with wisdom not by disabling the nature s color  Best fiction  I ever read  Short  Crisp  Suspense and most important teaches a life lesson  Do read  I want to be able to rate this book infinite stars  This has been and will always be my favorite book  I have read it more than twenty times since I was ten  and plan on reading it many more times before I die  No es facil hablar de una novela que ha ganado uno de los premios mas importantes dentro de la literatura infantil y que ademas es incluida en el plan de lectura de las escuelas en Estados Unidos  poco sera decir que la historia es buena  asi que usare un mejor calificativo para darle el nivel que se merece    Fascinante   Desde el momento en que empieza la narracion la escritora te lleva a otro mundo  un lugar perfecto donde los creadores controlan la sociedad formando familias de a cuerdo a las caracteristicas de las personas para lograr asi un ambiente sano y sin problemas  no existe el odio  ni el rencor y no saben de violencia por que sus sentimientos estan reprimidos para no correr riesgos  por lo mismo  no tienen libertad de eleccion y asi no hay fallas o decepciones  Pero el punto mas importante es sin duda el valor que la escritora le da a los recuerdos y no es tan dificil de entender la idea que Lowry quiere transmitir al ensenarnos un mundo sin memorias  donde no fluyen los sentimientos  demostrandonos de una manera simple que atesorando recuerdos vamos tejiendo lazos de union con amor y compasion  Leyendo un poco de la vida de la escritora  descubri que su padre  que es un hombre en edad avanzada  sufre de la perdida de la memoria y fue presisamente esa situacion lo que inspiro a Lowry a escribir esta historia  una razon mas para captar su sentimiento    The book  The Giver  is about a young boy named Jonas who is an 11  Jonas will be attending the ceremony his community has every year  Jonas will become a 12 at this ceremony and he will receive a job that he will keep for the rest of his life  Jonas soon receives the job of a receiver  for this job there are very strict rules the rules of this job are  You may not share dreams  You may be rude  You cannot share any of your training  you may lie  He didn t truly mind these rules  but 1 of them bugged him     He can lie  What if others got the exact same rule  This rule pushed his trust issues  As Jonas has a few training lessons  a new child name Gabe is under their fathers watch  The child was precious to Jonas s family unit  Later Jonas goes back to the Receiver for more training  Memories of snow and fun  yet he sees that the Receiver is in great pain  He offers to help and then receives a memory of pain  War  Also  Jonas receives the Receiver s favorite memory  the memory of love  Then Jonas learns the true meaning of  release  and is terrified to now know that Gabe is going to be released because he is not maturing properly  After  Jonas takes Gabe to a place outside of their community and sees beautiful colors such as red and green  They see snow everywhere  Jonas knows that this is the season of love  In the book  The Giver  there are many injustices  The biggest injustice i found was release  I thought this as an injustice because everyone is going to be different  Jonas didn t really know what  release  was so when Jonas was talking to the elderly woman Larissa  him and her both were excited for her release to come  The book i am writing about is The Giver by Lois Lowery this book is about a kid Jones who is turning 12 this is a big turning point in his life He learns that his community is a practical joke because nothing is perfect  Jones knows this because he is the receiver  Read this book to find out how Jonas saves his community  I recommend this book to young adults and children 12 years and older  you do not particularly need to like fantasy books to enjoy this exciting novel   3  I m pretty sure that this was the first dystopian novel that I ever read  Even though it is a novel that s targeted to kids  it s still one of my favorite books of all time   Jonas is used to living a restricted and regulated life  of course to him it isn t restricted or regulated  it s just normal   He lives in a world with no emotion  no pain and certainly no color  which is fine by Jonas  It s only when Jonas is selected to be the new Receiver  that he starts yearning for a change  and develops a certain hunger for human emotions  Unfortunately for Jonas  his Community just isn t ready to handle something as complicated as feelings  Living in a world where every major decision is made for you  the citizens aren t ready for a change  they might never be  But that doesn t stop Jonas  and it certainly doesn t stop The Giver from entrusting the entire community with one of the most important things in life intelligence  I read this book because I was browsing on the internet for some good Dystopian Science Fiction novels and it came up  I read the Wikipedia summary and plot  spoiling the book for myself I know  and decided it would be an interesting read so I put in as a to read  on a separate Goodreads account   I definitely wasn t expecting the book to be so small though  I finished this book because  one  it wasn t a particularly hard read  the book was small and the print was uncomplicated  I also finished it because I loved the story  and I loved how easy it was for Jonas to accurately describe his emotions  even though he learned they weren t real emotions   I was also very intrigued about what happened to the previous  new Receiver  all those years ago  This book can be very difficult to comprehend  and would take a very critical mind  The book requires a certain intelligence I believe  So I would probably recommend it to Andrew  He could definitely handle the themes of this book  and I have no doubt he would love and relate to Jonas   No tengo palabras para lo increible que es este libro y la exquisita experiencia que es leerlo  Es uno de los mundos utopicos distopicos mas completos que he leido hasta ahora Y el final te deja anorando y queriendo mas  Espero leer el proximo libro pronto  Resena en Gracias a los Libros  The Giver is novel written from the point of view of boy named Jonas  It is short book that when you first pick it your initial thought would be that is a light easy read but it is the opposite  While this book is does not have a lot of pages in it  every single one if those pages is filled with power  It can be a book that makes you think and question things that surround you  You read this book and it will take you throughout the story of Jonas and him becoming his own person and breaking through the conformity of the world he lives in  You see Jonas start to question things and want to discover things for himself  The writing with in this story is so simple yet so beautiful  It simplicity adds to the story and makes it that much more moving  I loved how we see Jonas act on the new things that he discovers  He doesn t just lie dormant and let things to continue on around him  Seeing Jonas grow and be willing to stand alone was so moving in this story  Jonas became his own person and realized he could not live in a life with no pain or color or inconvenience  Something that I wish was that is book continued a little bit more  I feel like the end was so abrupt and that there should have been a stronger build up to that part  I also feel like Jonas  decision to leave was to fast  I feel like he should have convinced Fiona or Asher to accompany him  You also had to know that when reading this book it depends a your attitude to get anything out of it  It can either be a  filler  book or it can be one that leaves an impact that stays with you  Overall I would definitely recommend this book to anyone  Everyone should read this book in there life   This is one of those books I wish I d read in a book club  There is so much to discuss in it about this safe haven world created for a more harmonious way of living  It s sad and disturbing  but also leaves us with a trail of hope that one boy and his mentor can make a difference  This is one of those books that leaves many unanswered questions  And that s okay  You can bring your own perspective to it on why things are the way they are  and how these people can find a new life balance again that embraces ALL the passion of life   pain  love  loss   while also embracing all of humanity   I read this book the year it first came out   so I read this when I was thirty six years old  I read it because it was  Newberry Medal winner and read eveyone of them although it is an award for best juvenile fiction  Although the book is easy to read    the message is not for the superficial thinker  This book is easily the best book I have ever read   not for the prose itself but for the exploration of my mind and thoughts and soul  I believe this book explores an age old question  Is choice worth the price of pain  An age old question and much more difficult to answer the more pain you experience in your life  The political and governmental control of the community is even more relevant today than it was when it was written  This book although read by children and unfortunately relegated to the YA section of the library  is an adult deep thinkers dream  DON T MISS IT    The Giver  is a book that should make one think  In my opinion  nobody should read this book unless they are prepared to search for a deeper meaning  This is definitely not a surface book  In the Utopian society of sameness  there was one that was chosen to be different  This different individual was responsible for holding the memories of the world that existed outside the Utopia  At the age of twelve  all young Utopian members received a profession  chosen for them by the society leaders  and Jonas was given the special privilege of being the society s  Receiver   But    He did not know that the position required holding the memories of good and bad  horror and love  and war and harmony  During his training  Jonas was exposed to the society s custom of  Releasing   Which  he was always told  was the simple releasing of the elderly or unhealthy infants or children  He had always pictured it as being a happy thing  but he later discovered that it was not at all a good occurrence  From this  Lois Lowry hoped to subtly address the issue of Youth in Asia  I believe that this book was very profitable  It had some good morals  and it had a good story line  but  as I have said before with previous reviews that I have written  iI think that this book lacked a solid resolution  Otherwise  this was a fantastic book  The Giver is one of my favourite books  I ve read other YA fiction  The Hunger Games  The Maze Runner  Divergent to name the obvious ones   and I read them before The Giver  However I felt that this book had the edge 1  This is not a book about boy meets girl or vice versa   something I am increasingly irritated by and it seems to be in every single book for teenagers  Ahhh  Save me   and it focuses on the characters and the morals  not some kind of tormented love triangle and forbidden romance 2  The ending  So many books have rushed endings which are badly tied up  This book ends on a cliffhanger and leaves you with more questions  but the ambiguous ending lets you think  Some books leave you unsatisfied  but despite the ambiguous ending I was left wanting to know more  but not unsatisfied or disappointed 3  The themes  This book actually has themes that are fleshed out and they continue throughout the book  not just lost in a confusing mess of pointless details and characters  It is thought provoking and left me with questions that didn t detract from my enjoyment 4  The whole book  a bit general  but still       it is simplistic  but not overly so  and a very easy read  I sat down the other day and read the whole of The Giver Quartet in one go   they are so easy to read  unlike some books that are convoluted that you have to concentrate so hard on what is going on   There are one or two plot holes  but I am willing to overlook that    Also  for anyone doubting whether to read The Giver   read it  It isn t that long and is certainly worth your time and for anyone who feels that this is yet another YA dystopian future novel   yet another Hunger Games  Divergent or Maze Runner wannabe  it was written before them   1993 to be precise  15 years before The Hunger Games    and is different ish   probably due to a lack of some tortured romance or extreme violence murder death  Question  Is the film worth watching  I ve avoided it so far as from watching the trailer I feel that it will not live up to the book     they seem to have put in too much action and romance in that isn t in the book and Jonas looks much  much older than twelve    And I often feel that film adaptations never quite live up to the books   I always thought of Lois Lowry s The Giver as the little book that could  Written almost like a parable  its deceptively simple story delivers some heavy  reverberating hits  I consider this little book to be a significant contribution to the genre  ranked right up there with such dystopian classics as Brave New World  The Handmaid s Tale  Fahrenheit 451  1984  and Soylent Green  I love it because of its simplicity and accessibility  it s the perfect way to introduce younger readers  especially reluctant younger readers  to some pretty powerful themes  It s a book that can only generate discussion and debate amongst the young and young at heart on the importance of personal choice  You fight for it  You don t ever let it be taken from you  Sameness  calmness  serenity    these may sound like lofty goals  comforting words  but they should never come at the cost of the individual s right to explore  question  challenge   choose  Some readers may be left unsatisfied by the ambiguous ending  I have to admit  first time reading it I was a little frustrated  But like any good parable  the ending is probably the best launching off point to a passionate debate of  what ifs   maybes  and  for sures   Other readers might be put off by Lowry s lack of detailed world building  this is a teensy book   a long short story really   and with such a small canvas there really isn t room for answers  mostly questions  There is a lot we don t know   the how and why this community came to be  But the mystery inspires some addictive speculation  especially in the context of other dysptopian tales which surely influenced Lowry here The Giver is a chilling bedtime story  as good at warning us and teaching us a lesson  as it is at entertaining us  That s a magnificent book that can do those things all at once   Jonas lives in a the perfect community that does not experience pain and suffering and love   Everything is organized and everyone is given a specific job to do that matches their talents  At a certain age everyone is given a job to train in that will become there career  Jonas is given the job of Receiver  He receives the memories from a wise old man who calls himself the Giver  What He will soon discover is that with this knowledge of happiness  love  pain  sadness  fear  and death is that he wants everyone to experience them  However  this is not allowed in the community  The question is  what will Jonas do with these new memories  Keep them to himself  Or share them This was a great book  I really loved the themes and the overall story  There are some parts that may be difficult for younger children to understand without an explanation from parents  I would recommend this book to those who have a hard time finding there place in society or need to see what special talents they have  This is a unique take on a dystopian society and I definitely want to read the other books that go along with this one  Content Warning  Some sex  some violence  This is such a good book  It reminds me a lot of The Tripods Trilogy by John Christopher  or even Clockwork Angels  It tells of a well ordered and comfortable society  built through stripping strong emotions or feelings from the residents  who appear to have happy  ordered lives In a Coursera MOOC course I took on Aboriginal Worldviews one of the assignments was to write about people who taught me something in life  then cross off their names one by one and consider what my life would be like if they never existed  I found I had also named people who taught me significant life lessons through betrayal  When I mentioned this  one of the teacher s aids stated   All of our relations make us who and what we are  and some of the most significant  lessons  we learn are not at all pleasant  I thought about this a lot while I read this book  for the third time  but the first time in years  The book is almost like a start of a Hero s Journey saga  but with a mini Hero s Journey within I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone  Some books deserve their hype  This is one of them  I listened to this on audio and it s been at least 10 ish years since I read this  It was a JR High required reading  I don t remember what we talked about or why we read it but listening to it again made me think that it s an interesting choice for that age to read  It s very deep  I found the reader to be slightly irritating  he paused in random places  but overall I thought the emotion  if there ever was any  was captured well It s quite a sad story  Thinking of a place that is all the same  with no color  no feelings  no memory  it s so very sad  This is a great book for discussions because of all those things listed  I hope that they are discussed at length in the classrooms  It made me heartbroken to hear that the father told Jonas to use a more precise word then love  What is more precise then love  I didn t remember what happened when people were  released  but as I am driving in my car  listening to what is happening to the twin baby  I almost lost it  I plan on watching the movie very soon  and I do hope that they stick well to the book  I know already that the age difference is there  at least  it looks like it  so we ll see how they adjust that  I m also looking forward to seeing how they do the black and white to color  Lois Lowry s book   The Giver  takes place in a dystopian world where sameness is encouraged  Everything is controlled by a group called the elders  They pick out everything from your job to who your  parents  will be to your name is  At twelve years old  every child is given an assignment  a job  a purpose for life  But when Jonas   the main character is seeked out to be trained for a special job called the Receiver of Memory  the most important elder  he isn t the same as everyone else   there can only be one Receiver  and he is special  The Receiver s job is to advise the elders  because he is the only person who holds the memories of the past  before sameness and communities  when real life existed  In the community  there is no true happiness  or true pain  there is no emotion or feeling  The book really tests one of the most simple yet obvious things in life    Is it necessary to have emotions or do they endanger us  One of the most emotional and most critical parts of the book is when Jonas finds out about what release really is from the giver  and a little later in the book  when he finds out that his  little brother  Gabriel is going to be released because he failed his test of maturity more than the allowed number of times  Jonas probably felt deceived and lied to  He was devastated that this was the end for everybody  it wasn t  a new adventure  as they said  His entire life has been a big  fat lie  All his life  he was taught that release was something that was joyous  a reward for services to the community  when the giver showed him the tape  he comes to the realization that shouldn t be celebrated  and it s not a good thing  It s not right that the  releasers  don t actually know what they re doing  The quote  He killed it  My father killed it   on page 150 shows how shocked Jonas was when he found out that his father had to kill the newborn baby  The author also used italics to emphasize the point  so that it shows the audience that this isn t just a regular part of the book  It shows the readers that this part of the book is important  and that it s a very critical moment  This moment shows how feelings and emotions give us a character  and build who we are  It is very important that we have emotions so that we can connect with others  and so that we don t feel that we re alone the way Jonas did when he found out the information  Furthermore  when Jonas comes to the realization  They have never known pain  on page 110  At this point in the book  the giver has just accidentally shown Jonas war  and in the memory  he was in a battle situation and ended up having to shoot someone from the opposing side  This was a very important milestone for Jonas  he realizes how alone he is  being the only one with the memory of true  heart wrenching pain and guilt  He realizes that he is the only one who knows  and will ever know  what it feels like to know that because of him  someone isn t living  someone isn t breathing  someone s family is mourning them and cursing him for murdering them  Because of you someone is dead  just another lifeless body lying in a grave  deep in the ground of some cemetery  As a result of this  Jonas now see s the world in a different light  and has become more observant on how people do things  and what their motives for their actions are  Jonas finally saw what the elders were trying to protect them from  why the communities were built  In the book  the author  Lois Lowry uses italics to emphasize her point  and when reading  this adds emotion and a real insight to how the character works  what Jonas is thinking  When you re reading the book out loud  unconsciously  the tone of your voice will change to emphasize the point that the author is trying so hard to accomplish  This passage shows that although we don t realize it  emotions play a big part in our daily lives  Although some emotions aren t the best  it s very important that we have them  in order to not make the same mistakes  We learn from our mistakes  but if we have no mistakes  how can we learn from them The Giver teaches us many lessons  but one of the most significant lessons one can learn from this incredible book is that emotion is necessary for us to function properly  It helps us in our daily lives without us even realizing  Quoting John Green from the Fault in Our Stars    Without pain  how could we ever know joy    The entire human civilization has been built on emotions and the ability to connect with others  and sympathize  Love which is perhaps the strongest of all emotions has kept the human race going for hundreds of thousands of years  We wouldn t be able to learn from our mistakes  for example  if Hitler didn t blame the Treaty of Versailles on Jews  one of the biggest genocides in History  The Holocaust wouldn t have happened  While that may seem like a good thing  it would have saved twenty million people  we now know the consequences of a massacre that big  and know that it shouldn t be done  the Holocaust taught a lesson and since then  there hasn t been another genocide so big  Taking in everything that has happened  the conclusion is  emotions are very necessary to keep us functioning  however they can t go overboard  because that s when they get dangerous  Having emotion and feeling gives us the ability to connect with others  sympathize with others  it s how the human race has come up and flourished   by people feeling each others happiness and pain  and learning from our mistakes  If emotions don t exist  how could we  Given that this story is about a seemingly perfect world  the key to the success or failure of such a cerebral tale is going to be in the execution  Things can go really well or really badly with such a topic  but Lois Lowry is such a gifted writer  that she makes this beautifully executed tale look easy  She writes with a conciseness that is a lesson in getting to the heart of the story without bogging it down with unnecessary information and detail  Although filled with hope  the ending is realistic and a perfect cap to the story  You don t feel cheated in any way because it is the only way it could have ended A haunting tale  perfectly told by a gifted writer  Interesting  I liked the protag s choice in the end      4 1 2 stars  This is a really fantastic book  I was struck by how easy it was to read  I know it is intended for younger audiences  but it reads at a higher level than some adult focused books I ve read within the last year  That was very impressive to me  I really need to raise my standards I loved how we all transitioned from drinking the Utopian Kool Aid to seeing that it s just Dystopian dirty water  The emotion and feeling of the main character really pulls you in  The loneliness  the desire to conform  the embracement of being different  and the acceptance of what it all means  Really powerful stuff Warning  My  dislikes  and questions might give away some of the dramatic surprises in the story  So stop here if you haven t read it  I didn t like that so much of the science past was not explained  How did we get to this point  Are people genetically modified so that they don t see color  Something going on in their brains  So many things pointing to mindless zombies  but yet they weren t  The transfer of memory by touch  Again  is this some sort of genetic modification  If he never experienced sunrise  is there some sort of dome  Cover  WTF is going on in this community    I suppose that adds somewhat to the mystery  But that was some frustrating mystery for sure All of these questions will make me want to read the next books to see if I can get some answers   I have A LOT of questions   And I really want to see where this story takes me  After having picked up The Giver  it has been incredibly hard to put it back down  Every task of a day has been spent restless until I have been able to pick this book to again and continue reading Amidst the typical stories or dystopia that you find today  I was expecting much the same from this novel  However  to my utter surprise and great delight this book explores more challenging ideas  For me  in particular  it captured the idea of choice  and the opportunities and difficulties the freedom to choose brings Being a sentimental person  I truly appreciated the way Lowry conveyed this through  memories  that she shared via Jonas   the protagonist  It showed the power of memory in our lives  and how they affect the actions and choices we make that shape our future  A special book and I can see why it is studied in curriculums in schools and read by persons of all ages  If want to see the world in a different light and ask questions about it  then I recommend giving this book a try   From my book review blog  www addbookreviews blogspot comReason for reading  I read this book for a Young Adult literature course at the University of Texas at San Antonio  Even though I am annoyed that it was the only  B  I made last semester  I enjoyed the books we read in this course  they included The Giver  Island of the Blue Dolphins  Lord of the Flies  The Hobbit  and Alice s Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass This short novel by Lois Lowry tells the story of a young boy named Jonas living in a dystopian society  The story s main focus is on the career assignment that the young boy is given when he turns twelve  He is chosen to take the place of the one person in his community  The Giver  that holds all the memories for the rest of the population  With Jonas  readers travel through the experience of becoming The Receiver of the memories  In addition  there are a plethora of other very intriguing parts of this book  including all the strange practices these people keep in place to maintain the order within their community  Also  I m still having mixed emotions about whether I liked the ending  because I felt that it was rather ambiguous The concept of this book is completely fascinating to me  I really enjoy books that are set in dystopian societies  but are still real enough that I have to question whether our society will ever get to where they are  Unlike most of the people in my Young Adult Literature course  I had never read this book  It was definitely my favorite book from the course  Although  I had just finished reading The Hunger Games when we started this book and I found these two novels strikingly similar  which annoyed me  it made The Hunger Games feel like a rip off    I think this is only because they are geared toward and focus on young people in dystopian societies Would I read this in my free time  Absolutely  I actually think this book was assigned to us around Spring Break  but it didn t have to be completed until a few days after classes resumed  I enjoyed it so much that I found myself reading it on my break from school even when I knew I didn t have to be doing any homework  Once I got over the initial confusion that comes with readers familiarizing themselves with a dystopian novel I was pulled into the story  I would recommend this book for readers of all ages  not just students  I know I read this many years ago and remembered it as a great book  but I truly can t believe this book was meant solely for children  This provides a great commentary on the values of personal choice and freedom as well as a warning against the ills of big government  Big Brother and collective mentality  Harder still to believe that the protagonist is only 12 and shoulders such a burden for humanity  Even more shocking is the fact that Hollywood did not screw this up and made a movie version of this book that is true to the original yet embraces the subtle changes as integral parts of the story  A great read  a huge platform for discussion of society s ills and a timeless classic  Brava Lois Lowry  One of a kindThanx Dr    2007  It seems that everyone who reads this book either adores or loathes it  which is understandable  as it offers strong opinions through the use of allegory  I would encourage you to read it for yourself  As for me  I absolutely loved it  I read this novel in my English class a couple of years ago  and it prompted many a deep and lively discussion  I love that this book has real  meat  to it  It also has a sort of sci fi psych thriller feel to it  which I love  Lastly  if you share my feelings on  jump up and grab you  beginnings  this one is for you  No boring first chapter here  Deeper meaning aside  I think you will enjoy this spine tingling  twisted story in and of itself  For those of you who have read it already  I was thinking of starting a discussion where we could probe a bit deeper  I have a steadfast rule about putting spoilers in my reviews   Comment if you are interested    The worst part of holding the memories is not the pain  It s the loneliness of it  Memories need to be shared   I love it  Though it has a slow start phase  I enjoy every little thing as time goes by  This book proves   showed that PERFECT is BORING and THE SAME is LAME  The plot is unique thought when I started reading it  I have compared it to other dystopian novels like divergent   The Hunger Games where but I love the idea of the SAMENESS and it made the book unique from the others I love also the idea of transmitting the memories from The Giver to the new Receiver  Jonas  How Jonas started to feel   have emotions  Even it is happiness or pain  I tried to imagine myself to live in that set up but i dont want to live there  Yes  it is perfect but NO FREEDOM  Humanity needs freedom  That s why when Humanity started  they started to have and get REASONS  With those reasons  we started to make choices   have freedom  This book teaches us that life can t be perfect the way we want it to be but Life is perfect by its imperfections  The imperfections of the world give us the real emotions so we dont feel numb     I love this book  Great story  Thumbs up     I cant wait to see its movie version    Imagine a world where everything is complete sameness  Everything is so controlled people don t even know what choice is Well  welcome to Jonas s world  You have no sight of color  There is one race  There are no feelings  You are assigned a job  wife  and child  Everyone has food and a house  There is no upper  lower  or middle class because there is no money  Now you will learn the difference of fairness and inequality  This society is so unjust  Only 50 children can be born a year  If there are twins they have to release one  How do they choose  They release the baby because of it s weight  The faminty unit must have 2 parent  man and woman  and 2 children  boy and girl  Here s the catch  The family is all unrelated  and if they have a family without feelings  I don t think you can really call it a family  Last of all  when you get too old you go to the house of the old  but you don t wait till you die  Your released  You have no choice  This is unjust  So what does jonas have to do   view spoiler  He has to leave  view spoiler   I reccomend this to dystopian fans  Don t expect action people  but this does have big suprises  Picture the story and you will stay focused  I rated this 5 stars  hide spoiler    hide spoiler   Better than Fahrenheit 451 not quite as good as Brave New World   I really liked this book    I know that s its supposed to be for children  but it s a pretty intense book for children  It s about Jonas  a young boy of 12  being chosen to become the new Receiver  He is going to have all of the memories of humankind transferred to him from the Giver  He learns about life s pleasures  like sledding  the warmth of the sun on your skin  and calm sailboats out on the ocean  But he also has to take the memories of poverty  war  famine  loneliness  and despair  How can all of these memories be laid upon one person  It almost doesn t seem fair  But the Giver and Jonas come up with a plan  to bring about  the change  from  sameness   It s really a great novel  It s short and a real quick read  and it s not just for kids     Lowry  Lois  The Giver  New York  Dell Laurel Leaf  1993 Characters  12

1996 William Allen White Children s Book AwardCritical response  Although Jonas and his community live in a fictional world set in the future devoid of any real emotions or relationships  I believe any reader may be able to easily imagine the possibility of how perfect dreams of cooperation and control can become a nightmare not born out of chaos but order  Lois choice of making color and music a mystery reveals how taken for granted the aspects of being human is   It is the blue print on which most of the dystopian tales of the 2000 10 decade is based on it stands out from being mechanical  there is a strange softness about it which makes it stand up against the harshness of 1984 I loved the dilemma in the end  sometimes something s are best left unsaid  I have never seen snow in my entire life  and the book made me yearn for it the sameness is something I feel everyday yet  I cherish my individuality most importantly it makes me feel like I live in a beautiful world  AMAZING This novel was absolutely amazing  I read it for school  and whilst the majority of my class of apes hated it entirely  I loved it  It was so interesting and mind opening  and the way that the author sneaks in hints about the corruption of our society is absolutely phenomenal Synopsis When Jonas turns 12  he is singled out to receive special training from The Giver  Now  it s time for Jonas to receive the truth  There is no turning back Plot  The plot line for this book was most likely my favourite thing about it  It was almost never slow and kept you captivated  and on the edge of your seat the entire way through  Overall I give the plot line of this book 5 5 BookStars Characters  The characters in this book were so diverse and interesting that they engrossed me in the book nearly as much as the plot did  I thought that the protagonist  Jonas was an extremely strong character and so were many of the other background characters  The only thing that I wished the book would have included was more background on The Giver  He was such a captivating character but it was if they wanted to hype you up with excitement and then pushes you off of a cliff  For these reasons I give the characters of this novel 4 5 BookStars Content  The content of this book was extremely captivating  It mixed supernatural aspects with others that were very realistic  The mixture of real and supernatural together create a very eerie image in your mind and provoke many trains of thought  For these reasons I gave the content of  The Giver  4 4 5 BookStars  I absolutely loved this book  I enjoyed the plot that kept you guessing but also enjoyed how it was such an easy and quick read  The ending of the book had me questioning whether or not I liked the book because it left me with a cliffhanger  But then I found out that this is only the first book of a trilogy  That is the information that really had me loving every aspect of the book  ending included  Since I never read The Giver when it was assigned to me in middle school  I was so excited to continue reading and figure out all the little quirks of this mysterious community that they lived in  I was so interested that I ended up reading the whole thing in a day  I think that this will be a relatively easy book to get middle school students engaged in  With the right active and stimulating introduction activity  I feel that students will eagerly turn the pages of The Giver  The deeper I got into the book  the more I thought about activities discussions that I could have with students  Just the idea of not being able to decide your own future would be plenty to get the classroom sparked with interest  I m looking forward to teaching this YA book to students in the future  I can t wait to continue reading the series to see what becomes of Jonas and Gabriel along with how different the community becomes after so many memories being revealed to them with Jonas  absence  This is one of those books I tend to carry around with me for whenever I get bored  It s one to lose track of how many times you ve read it  It s one of those you return to and enjoy just as much if not more than you did the first time you read it  Moore s Utopia hmm the Giver  The Giver any day of the week  This book is unbelievably valuable today  Even if you do not enjoy it  everyone has their own taste  you will still take something from it  It s a fair warning in all sense of the word  I think that the book was amazing  but it also felt really strange at certain parts    Salah satu buku yang kubaca setelah nonton filmnya  Filmnya sudah sering ditonton dan pas tahu ada bukunya baca deh Ternyata beda yaaaaa    wkwkwkw wajar sih Bukunya pertama kali terbit tahun 93 gitu dan gak nyangka aja pas dibaca tahun sekarang tetap keren  Kirain bukunya baru baru aja dikarang makanya baru dibikinkan filmnya Nah  itulah kenapa film dan bukunya agak berbeda namun esensi keduanya pas aja Aku suka film dan bukunya Kalau difilm lebih banyak adegan Jonas   Fiona  kalau dibuku gak terlalu dititik beratkan cerita mereka berdua dan itu menyenangkan  hehe Cocok dibaca sama anak anak Bukunya punya pesan moral hidup itu gak bisa diatur sesempurna kayak di komunitas Jonas  dan sedihnya harus menanggung ingatan seluruh komunitas sendirian Penggambaran komunitas Jonas keren banget dan pas divisualisasikan dapat  mungkin efek udah nonton duluan kali yee Adegan paling sedih itu pas Jonas tahu makna  pelepasan   Merinding bacanya  kesannya komunitas itu kayak gak punya hati  padahal mereka kan gak tahu makna sebenarnya dibalik  pelepasan   Hanya Pemberi yang menanggung beban ingatan tersebut Endingnya lumayan dan bukunya masih ada sambungannya  katanya sih  semoga ada terjemahannya  mau baca lagi  hehe The Giver by Lois Lowry is a great adventure that dives deep into the concept of a utopian society that is never truly achievable  I highly recommend this book due to the deep story and fantastic detail that the author uses  The main character is Jonas  who lives in a society where everyone is equal  eating the same food  wearing the same clothes  and being assigned a spouse and child  Jonas is chosen for the special job of being the  giver  of the society  who holds the memories of what life was like before this society existed  Jonas was a character whom I particularly enjoyed  Being the  giver   he receives memories of the past and begins to learn what his society is missing out on  I also like his rebellious nature and want for everyone else to know these memories as well  The author s style of writing is descriptive  especially when describing the memories Jonas is receiving  I loved reading The Giver  even though it was an assigned book for one of my classes   as the description and great view on our society today is reason for anyone to read this book  This book gets better and better with each reread  I d give it ten stars were it possible  A simple crisply written parable of human freedom starkly contrasted with social conformity  It remains an important book for our time when social conformity is often veiled in numerous disguises  The tyranny of  sameness  remains a threat to human freedom and a challenge to robust democracies everywhere  The Giver is book that raises the right questions   I had never heard of The Giver until I saw the trailer for the movie  The scenes from the film didn t interest me and I dismissed it  Then my son sent me a paperback copy as a gift  with a note saying he had read it at least five times and he wanted to share it with me I admit it took me several chapters to get into it  but by the time I was about halfway through  I couldn t put it down  I had no idea where Ms  Lowry was going with the story  but what an unexpected ride it was as she concluded the story of Jonus  the boy she had made us love and empathize with so deeply  I m grateful to have experienced this book and I will not forget Jonus because if the image of him grows dim  I ll happily read the book again   I had this book on my list of  to read  forever  I finally picked it up last night and read it in one sitting  I rarely do that  I have read quite literally hundreds of dystopian fiction type novels  This book struck me a little deeper than usual  The characters are decently developed but not as much as I wanted them to be  this is probably because the book is short by most standards and I wanted more The themes were things I come across a lot in dystopian fiction but for some reason they resonated more  I found myself thinking deeply about topics and ideas brought up in the book all day today  It was disturbing in a thousand ways  all necessary  This book can be read at age 11 125 and each person will get something different from it  I know that having a son about the age of one of the characters made certain topics gut wrenching  This should be required reading every five years for every person   but that would sort of contradict the ideas brought up in the novel    Despite that  maybe politicians should read it every week The main character of a book usually makes me mad with their dumb decisions about 3 4 of the way through every book I read  This book did NOT lag at all  there were no unnecessary scenes or set ups  I agreed completely with the main character all the way through  We need more people of his character running around I loved it  exactly the type of book that needs to be read across the globe The Giver  The Giver is about a perfect society with no troubles or pain  Many things were removed from this community  A person lived a basic life here  You re born from a birth mother  assigned to your family unit  go to school until you re twelve  have assigned another sibling of the opposite gender to your family unit  assigned you your perfect job  train with the job  work  assigned you a spouse and then children  go to House of the Childless Adults  go to House of the Old  and then you are released when you are ready  Very simple you might think  but do you really want to have no choice at all  Everything is decided for you by the council  not you  You live your life as a robot  no pain  no joy  Jonas has to live in this society  He was fine with it until he got assigned to his job with the Giver  Then  everything changed  He saw the world different  as a bigger place  He learned about the good and bad things about life before the community  He knew this life was horrible and not what it should be  Even in this perfect place  they had some cruelties  Read on to find out about the society   As much as the Giver s society is perfect  they do have some injustices  The most disturbing was what they called  releasing   There was the occasional birth of twins  The community couldn t keep both because there might be a future meeting between the two  They could not allow that  so they weighed them both  One of them was 6 pounds  the other was 5 4 pounds  They took the heavier twin away  Then Jonas s dad who was the nurturer to take care of the twins  put the lighter one on a table  He grabbed a needle and talked to it in a baby voice  He said   It s okay  the veins in your arms are too small  so we ll have to inject it in your forehead   He slowly injects the needle and pushes the liquid into the baby s tiny vein  It cries and squirms around until finally it calms down  It closes its eyes and doesn t open them again  Then  Jonas s father puts the baby in a box still talking to it in a baby voice  He slides into an opening and falls down into the trash chute  He euthanized the baby  at such young age  I would recommend this book to many adults  so they could see what could be our future  Changing small things is good but when it gets out of hand like in The Giver  them it s really horrifying  Many kids should read this too  To become a little more wise about the world and to enjoy what you have  Kids who like Ray Bradbury and his many future tales  would most likely like this futuristic novel  It makes you think more than ordinary books do  The Giver in a way is very kind hearted compared to Ray Bradbury though  Ray Bradbury has children rebelling and believing in death  The Giver has a kid seeing the world on how it used to be with all it s hardships and tries to make a difference in his society  He tries to make a change in the world  he absolutely felt that way  That s why if you re very mature and like science fiction  this book is for you  Very well written  Reminded me of Ray Bradbury in style  I think it s great when a writer leads you down a certain path purposefully but you only realize what has been done when you are supposed to  Excellent  The Giver  a book almost everyone by the age of 18 has read at one time or another during their school career  Personally  my peers were given the option to read this book or Farenheit by Ray Bradbury in eighth grade   I read Farenheit  Now  four years later  I decided to pick up  The Giver  and man am I glad I did  This little book has so much squeezed into 200 pages that has you flipping while barely registering the book is nearly over  I brought it to the beach in New Hampshire and read basically the entire thing  except for the first 50 pages I read on a bus ride  and I absolutely adored it I must say  I had NO idea what I was getting into when I first picked it up  I d heard people talking about how it was the first utopian society story  and how  weird  and  bad  it was to people who d read it in eighth grade  But this book was incredibly interesting and had me wondering what would pop up next  spoilers from here on  Jonas is born normally into a society of  sameness  where there are no colors  no music  no choices  no diversity  Everyone is the same  People are born from birthmothers and after a year of life are given to a family unit   where there would be one mother  one father  one girl and one boy  Jonas  life was pretty average until he turned Twelve   where everyone is assigned a job  Jonas is assigned the role of the  Receiver    the most honorable position in the community  He would be given memories and emotions of the past from the previous receiver   now  the Giver As Jonas  training to become the Reciever goes on he aquires memories from the Giver about snow  sunlight  and love  He remembers how to see colors and feel emotions  He feels true pain for the first time ever  And he also learns what love truly is Everything changes when Jonas learns what  releasing  actually is  In the community Old people  criminals and newborns who aren t good enough are  released   Jonas learns that when this happens the community actually takes these people into a room and injects a poison into them  killing them almost immediately and then they discard them as if they re nothing   because the people of that day didn t understand the guilt and sorrow and emotions that came with murder Jonas decided to runaway  with the help of the Giver  He learns that the last Receiver  when she was released  the memories she had gained from the past had been sent out to the people of the community  So when Jonas ran away he spread the memories he d gained out to the people  hoping that they would be able to feel again and see colors again The novel ends with Jonas  happiest memory from the past   sledding down a hill as snowflakes fell and a family waited for him during Christmas  End of spoilers I d say this was one of my favorite books  I really and truly enjoyed it and have been recommending it to my friends and family members who haven t read it yet  I d suggest it to anyone honestly  This is so beautifully written in plain and subtle prose  It demonstrates how magical the English language can be without the use of  1 words  The story is unconsciously addictive  revealing the horror of the place and people in a seemingly innocent pace  I listened and the reader allowed the story to flow without gimmicky voices  making a movie in my head effortlessly  Novels written for young adults these days are a wealth of resources adults should not ignore or miss  At first  I felt like was reading a story for children  really young children  i also thought that such a small story must poor with events that would attract me to the story even more as a reader  The story was at first simple  no mysteries  no supernatural events  events that would attract a teenage reader  as myself    no suspense and does not require that much thinking or analyzing skills  But my opinion was soon changed  When Jonas began his training with the Giver  I started to see how deep the values that the stories  simple words talk about  i realized how important and essential the things that the story holds  The story made me look at the world and see how colorful it really is  it made me appreciate the fact that everything I see is colored The story  even though it s consisted of 179 pages only  holds within the meaning of the human life itself  it talks about how the world would be without colors  without sun or snow or mountains  without families  without feelings  without choices  It talks about what life would be if humans chose to give all of these values up in order to avoid pain  sorrow  grief and war it talks about how life would be if we didn t have to make any hard choices  if everything was organized  if everything was the same It shows that the things we hate the most as humans  the pain that love causes  the sorrow that comes after a loss  the disaster that nature brings  are the things that we would want the most if they were lost The story shows how wonderful it is to be human and to love It is definitely a story that worth reading  I loved this dystopian world  Now I know why it s considered a classic   This was one of the most moving books I have ever read  I wish I had read it as child  but I just now found it the right time to read this simple and elegant novel  I now understand why this dystopian story is so beloved  It does not rely on action or romance  To me  what drives the plot was that I could rediscover the beauty of our world  while Jonah discovers it for the first time  Lowry reminds us all to appreciate what is good in life  The books lacks any bells or whistles  I see it as the perfect dystopian novel  I re read this book so I could watch the movie  I absolutely loved it  My 12 year old daughter also liked it  Said it was different but good  I did not know there were three more books  can t wait to read them    Freedom of choice  This pharse can represent the book  The Giver  In the book  people live in a perfect society except that they are not allowed to choose anything such as jobs  family  or meals  There are no crimes  injuries  pain or happiness from loving each other  Their emotions are thoroughly suppressed by the committee  If a person satisfies the circumstance  he or she can live without anxiety  However  this book tries to tell us that living without choice is not a real life despite convenient and comfortable lives  Sameness might contribute to ultimate equality and peace  but differences give us more meaningful lives  Colors are different  music is different  and feelings are different  All of these elements are precious for people because they make lives worthwhile   In western culture  the chosen one is very common and preferred  I can see the chosen person in many books and movies  Likewise  Jonas  the main character  is selected to be a receiver with a special gift  He is different from other receivers  As he realizes the community is wrong  he takes action to change it by escaping the society and giving people their feelings back  It is a pity that I do not know what happens in the book after his leaving  Do the people gain their emotions  What happens when they realize their actual feelings  Does the community still exist or change or collapse  What about Jonas and Gabriel  Are they rescued by other people living outside of the boundary  I think the author is unkind  She should have revealed what happen later  She should not leave the reader in endless wondering   Why is the future society described such a gloomy one  Mankind has tried to make our societies better  but conflicts always exist  Are we never meant to build a perfect world like the Garden of Eden  a very powerful book  it also shows that our world isn t so confined afterall  I happened across this book as a very young girl  sitting cross legged in my local library s children s section  I don t know what made my hand reach to take it off the shelf     I had never heard of it before  which in itself is amazing to me now  However it happened  I took it home and read it straight through  I was enthralled and amazed at both the writing and the story itself  Lois Lowry is an epic storyteller  and the story of The Giver was one that  in many ways  led me down my own path to becoming a writer  It opened my eyes to so many possibilities of depth of plot and meaning  The Giver is truly a classic  in my opinion  and drives home an eye opening lesson of humanity for any child  teen  or even adult  who may choose to read it  A young adult modern classic I somehow managed to miss in my youth  The Giver is no less affecting and thought provoking when read as an adult  It s smart  sombre and searching  a book that  for its remarkably brief length  just over 200 pages in my edition   covers a staggering range of the deepest  richest ideas humanity has grappled with for centuries  It s tough to summarise the book without giving away so much of what makes it a joy to read   The word  joy   as author Lois Lowry subtly points out in her novel  is not an 100  accurate use of the term and therefore  in effect  a lie   There isn t a great deal of joy to be had in the reading of the book  Not that it isn t well written  it is  It s just that this is a very solemn  thoughtful and almost ominous novel  so  joy   in a very real sense  is a misnomer But it is a very worthwhile read  this tale of young Jonas and his community  Lowry meticulously and very cleverly constructs the world in which we find our protagonist  slowly peeling away layer after layer to reveal the true nature of Jonas  life and society  More effectively than most  dystopian  novels these days  Lowry s community at least hints at how this evident dystopia might  indeed  be considered a utopia by its citizens  That s the frank and bitter tragedy of it all  when it becomes clear just what Jonas  role in his very orderly  ordered community must be  The title of her novel  The Giver  holds in itself a wealth of meaning and sadness too  Usually a term associated with generosity  the role of the titular Giver folds itself into a story of human misery and tragedy  and the lengths to which this community would and did go to spare itself that pain  Through it all  Lowry s novel unfolds at a quick  uneasy clip  its mystery unspooling slowly even as its philosophy deepens and its history and heartbreak grow all the more profound  This is not merely first rate writing for a young adult novel  it s first rate writing  period  A question I have about this book is how would the first Giver stay out of trouble when he would reach the unknown lands  If I was Jonah  I would have thought out a better plan than doing it right away of escaping the city  The first Giver reminds me a lot like of my teachers  because they both teach and they both amire and encourage students to believe in what they believe   The Giver  is a short novel written by author Lois Lowry in 1993  It has dystopian character and you really can say it was a pioneer  written 20 years before the whole genre dystopie became popular Story Jonas lives with his mother  his father and his sister Lily  They re his family  In the community he lives  the Elders are the government  They controll the society  There are rules everybody has to follow and it s good that the people don t have to make choices by their own  What would happen  if someone makes the wrong decision  When Jonas becomes a twelve  he should be given a job by the Elders  A job like caring for the Old people like his friend Fiona or like working with the newborn babys like his father  But he is chosen to be the next  Receiver of Memory   And soon he learns what he never was allowed to know Characters Jonas is something special  He is chosen to become the most important person in the community  But it s nothing special that the main character in a book is different than the others  I smiled about this  but depending on the fact that the book would otherwise be boring  it s a cliche you have to deal with Nevertheless  Jonas is very grown up for a twelve year old  I think  He starts to question the community and he is willing to give his important position up to save the live of someone who can t chose for himself The Giver is an interesting character  He is very old  very wise and some kind of rebellious  He doesn t want to live along in the society anymore that  in fact  is the one who makes the wrong decisions  One the one hand  he is like an old grandfather  on the othre he is like a prisoner  captivated in his position The secondary characters are well written too  and they complete the picture of a community where all the people are equal and nobody questions the system  not even Asher who seems to be the kind of boy parents would call  bad company  Writing It s amazing  how Lowry can describe a whole community  their rules and a plot in such a small book  I really wished it was longer  There would be so much more to tell  But I think she finished the story at the right time I liked the ideas in the book  like the system where the children get  new things  every year like a new jacket or a bicycle  These might just be small aspects  but they make the story complexe and interesting  I couldn t stop reading and that s always a good sign I remember  that I read about the thing before  which is the most important discovery for Jonas in the memories  but I totally forgot about it  It came really surprisingly and I think it also is such a great idea   the whole memory thing is  I give the book 5 of 5 memories to discover it yourself and enjoy it as much as I did     Book Title  The GiverAuthor Lois Lowry Review  I liked the book The Giver very much I like it because even though all the events lead to sad conclusions the happiness largely outweighs the sadness The two main settings were a dull dark city and the second within that is a room where the Giver lives The conflicts were that Jonas is horrified what people can do without true feeling the pain that his job gives him and escaping with himself and another  a little one  I would recommend this to Caleb Allen because he likes he might like it  This book is about how experience and memories change a kids life forever  It is about loss  It is about how someone can attain maturity at a very young age by making choices about something that will help other people  The Giver is about a perfect society where there are literally no problems  The kids at a certain age are told what job they will have for the rest of their lives and who they will be with  Jonas the main character is told he will be the receiver  This job is having all the memories from a normal world and how it can help the city progress  but obviously they only want one receiver so not everyone has these memories  This books shows what is lacking in perfection though it seems like it would be easier we lose a bit of humanity when doing this  Because we are getting rid of all emotions from sadness to happiness  When we cannot feel we lose who we are because if we cannot feel happiness then we cannot understand what makes us happy  And if nothing makes us happy or sad what is the difference between us and a machine No content warnings This book was extraordinary  It was very interesting and fun to read  What happened in this book made you want to keep reading and reading  The writing was beautiful and powerful  The strengths of this book were that it was just so different from the real world  to where it was extremely interesting  There were no weaknesses in this book from my point of view  I would defininitely recommend this book to a classmate  This book is apart of a series and I just started the second book  called Gathering Blue   This book has stuck with me  It is powerfully thought provoking  I was changed after I read it  This and  Ender s Game  are two peas in a pod  I thought this book was very interesting  It had a lot of funny  sad  and happy feelings to me  I hope I get to read this book again once  Now this is my favorite book of all time  I m definitely one of those people who decided it was time to finally read this book now that the movie has been released in theatres  I also understood that this story was sort of unofficially the  grandfather  to all the present day dystopians we all have loved so I wanted to see what all my reader friends have been talking about The Giver was written 20 years ago and I was pleased to have found that the concept did not feel old  Perhaps because the world that was created included elements from a more simpler time  without computers and cell phones   and very few cars  The concept of this world  although very far fetching like most dystopians  still seemed somewhat appealing and parts of it seemed to make sense  however distorted that sense was  you ll understand that  I think  as you read  The people in this very orderly community seem to want for nothing  Their lives purposely lack any intense emotions with a little medicinal help to ensure the serene flow of their society  as well as strict corrective consequences  prettied up  by plausible and literal  albeit deceiving  explanations  Using a precise language to more efficiently explain their feelings had become an art and part of their daily routine  and if one wandered from the  cerebral flow   accepted discipline was the result  Perhaps hidden in that language  however  were some rather dirty little secrets  too   Of course  This story revolves around Jonas  who  like everyone else  lives in what appears to be an idealistic society  They do not know anything different than what they have been brought up in  Everyone has a specific job to do  Sameness  nothing standing out  is key  However  one person is  different   The only person allowed to hold the memories of a life before this society evolved  is the Receiver  He alone knows of the world s torrid history of strife  starvation  war and misery  He alone also knows the intense feelings of love  real friendship and family  joy  warmth and pleasure  His time is coming to an end  however  and the torch must be passed on   to a selected member of their community  It is considered an honour to be the Receiver  however lonely this HUGE responsibility is  Jonas has been selected by the Elders to be the next Receiver  This orderly society cannot have TWO Receivers  so therefore  the one passing the memories to the next Receiver  is now known as the Giver It was a very provocative read  It had me thinking  like Jonas before his time spent with the Giver  how appealing and sensible his life seemed  until he slowly started to understand the truths  I quite liked Jonas  and the Giver  And perhaps  all the other blissfully ignorant characters as well because the author portrayed them so well I prefer most of my reads to have real adventure and some heart stopping moments  so I was quite surprised that this book still appealed to me so much despite the minimalness of it  Another element I love in my stories is a good love story  There were different kinds of love in this story  but not the strong  romantic kind  and yet  I still loved it  I really enjoyed the Giver  it does have subjects that could concern some adults  but the careful and sweet writing helps cushion the blow of reality  All my kids have read this now  with my guidance  and we have all enjoyed it tremendously  But we all want to know  what was on the other side of the snowy hill  Looking forward to the Gathering Blue   0   The book  The Giver  by Louis Lowry is a very unique book about a utopian society  Jonas is a Eleven in his community and is about to receive his role in the community  Jonas becomes The Receiver of Memory  He is to receive special training form The Giver  The Giver hold all memories in this community  It is up to Jonas now to hold all the memories in the community  The book  The Giver  is a fantastic book that I would recommend to all my friends This is the first book in a series of four so after you read  The Giver  you will want to read the rest  I did and there fantastic  This book also leaves you on huge cliff hangers that make you wanting to keep turning the page  The Giver is one of my favorite books and would recommend it to everyone   Jonas  the protagonist in The Giver  grows up in a world of sameness  A world with no color  no emotions  climate control  and absolutely no choices  By age twelve everyone is given a job in their utopian society  Since there is no choice  citizens are given a compatible spouse  Each couple is given two children  The babies are born to Birthmothers  who never even get to see the babies  During the first year of the babies life they live in a Nurturing Center until they are assigned a family unit   Everything is run in a flawless manner  People are as polite as can be with no controversy  The society has very strict codes to keep it that way  If you are unwilling  or fail to comply to the codes you are  released   Also known as death to us which is unfamiliar to them because death would cause emotion and that is forbidden   By age twelve  Jonas is given a highly honored job  Receiver of Memory  He will be the keeper of the communities memories even before his time  This is a very important job because someone must know these memories so mistakes will not be made a second time  war  starvation  and pain  This book is very deep and though provoking  At times reading it I could not imagine having my own children read this book  That thought alone is what makes this book a good one  It requires the read to think and to weigh out this utopian society  the pro s and the con s    There are many different things you can do with this book  You could have your class come up with their own Memory book  Memories they do not wish to keep  You could then have a deep discussion about how those memories have changed or developed you into your own individual self   This book would be a great book at a six grade level  There are many different avenues or projects that you could do with this book  One that keeps popping into my head would be the great discussions small groups or the entire class as a whole would have  What if you were given Jonas  fathers job at the nurturing center  could you do all the job tasks such as  releasing  a small child  How would you deal with the daunting memories if you were in Jonas  shoes   This book was amazing  I couldn t put it down  I highly recommend that you read this book it s so well written and very interesting   I personally enjoyed reading the book the Giver It was very interesting  I loved reading about all the different rules and regulations they had  I thought it was a weird and interesting way of living  i would not want to live in that kind of town where you can t express your feelings  there is no color  no weather  and every where you look you see yourself  The thing was no one knew about any of these things  All they knew was  all the rules  everything was dark and gloomy  and basically having your whole life given to you on a silver platter  Overall I loved it Jonas is a boy who lives in town that is very depressing  to me  To him it was normal because that is what he grew up with all of his life  Then when he turned twelve he got an assignment that changed his whole way of life  Jonas  assignment was  The Giver   He went to a place every day where he would get transmitted memories from the past  Where everything was how it is in our lives today  The first memory Jonas got was him sledding down a hill in the snow  That memory changed Jonas  life forever This reminds me of the Great Depression  Even though I wasn t living in it I had heard a little bit about it  It was a very dark and gloomy time where people were broke and didn t have jobs  Every one was very depressed about this  It was a very hard time for everyone especially for parents with kids  This reminds me of the Giver because everyone is dark and is very upset for the most part  People are very depressed and confused   I read this for the first time in an Education class in college and was blown away  Totally addicted  I couldn t help thinking of this as 1984 for Jr High    and I would still call it such today  as I have just finished teaching it to my fourth class of 8th graders  I teach 1984 to my one class of seniors at the same time that I teach this to my 8th graders and feel just swallowed in dystopian issues  with so many similarities between the works  Yes  it is a kids book  but like the Harry Potter series there s still something that can be gained from reading this  perhaps to your own kids as they are moving through adolescence  My students respond to this book SO well as Jonas is himself moving through puberty  learning to deal with  repress  feelings of attraction and sexuality  and discovering that his individuality  his sense of emotions  while being as trying as we all know they can be  are in all actuality that which makes us human and that which should be make us grateful to be alive  It s great for the kids who feel no one understands them and only want to talk about Love and Pain     Still  there s no denying they relate to it  I have students from 3 years past come tell me that it s the only book they ve ever read cover to cover  the only book they ve ever enjoyed  the only book they still remember every single detail about  I ll teach this book as long as I teach 8th grade   No one told me that this book would make me sad  My sister and I had listened to the audio book  but had to return it halfway through  so when I found this at the library I was happy  It s a good book full of unexpected feelings This story is very well written  The lady who wrote it is very educated  or so seems to be  Definitely better than the first book to the Matched series  Though it may be boring at first  it gets better in the end Would I let my sister read it  Yes  I think she would like it okay  There is a really horrible part though and it s real rather shocking  I literally gasped  covered my mouth  and was so pained by the words that were written  It is only one part  but it changes the whole plot  Not for younger minded kids  But good for mature ish minds Would I read it again  No  but I ll read the next book  watch the movie  and talk about with my friends  This is the last book I read with my mother before she died in 1995  She was an elementary school teacher and we were reading our way through the Newbery s together  It is also the book that caused my young son to cry  He was in the sixth grade and could not accept the author s decision to leave the fate of her characters undetermined  Oh  to be assured that those we have come to cherish will be okay  I think for him The Giver was one of his first awakenings to the uncertainty of life  Bless that young and tender soul  Reges reges regen el kellett volna olvasnom

future  It is about a community where everyone lives like robots and sees everything in black and white  Jonas  the main character is chosen to be the receiver of memory so he is the only one who knows what happened in the past  I really liked this book  it made me see my life in perspective  It was definitely confusing though because sometimes I didn t know where he was nor what he was doing but I figured it out  Also  it was sad because they were living a terrible life and there was no love  I don t want to read the next book in the series because it isn t going to be about Jonas so I don t really have an interest in reading   Jonas s world is perfect  Everything is always the same  Everything is perfectly organized  Jobs  children  homes  and even feelings and choices  The Community is always the same  At birth children are assigned numbers and given names at the ceremony of One  Each year every December  Ceremonies are held for each age group  At One children are named  at Nine children receive a bike  and at Twelve  children are assigned to jobs and become adults  Only Jonas isn t assigned a job  He is selected  He is Selected to become the Receiver of Memories  The current Receiver will pass on memories of true happiness  color  warmth and love  Jonas begins to discover how much he is missing Loved this book  The Giver had deep and moving morales  I don t usually enjoy books that are  deep  or  moving   but this book was legitimately both  I can t say much without spoiling things  but the concept of n true feelings was shocking to think about  I know that some people really believe that children or animals cannot feel thing like adults can  I am not one of those people  but this book showed that connect applying to everyone  One very shocking thing was that no one told each other that they loved them  Not even parents to children  I loved the morales of this book and thought them very meaningful   With the chant  Jonas knew  the community was accepting him and his new role  giving him life  the way they had given it to the newchild Caleb  His heart swelled with gratitude and pride But at the same time he was filled with fear  He did not know what his selection meant  He did not know what he was to become Or what would become of him  In the community in which Jonas live  everything is in perfect order and everyone had equally perfect lives  For children  each year they receive different attires to show their growth  comfort objects  jackets with buttons and pockets at the front to show independence  and bicycle  When people have grown into adults  they have to apply for a spouse and have to wait until the Elders found the perfect match and made them into a family unit  They also have to apply to be able to receive a child  and they can only receive a son and a daughter to complete a perfect family unit  The most important milestone in this community is when a person become a Twelve  It is when the Elders decided what a person is going to do for the rest of his her life  receiving their Assignment  And Jonas  who s going to be a Twelve  felt apprehensive about it    Read the full review here http   www thebookielooker com 2014 0    The most interesting book about a dystopia I ve ever read  The book The Giver is one of the best books I have read  At first when i saw the cover i thought it was going to be a lame book and i would be bored but when i started to read it   it was great  This is one of my favorite books  i liked everything about it  I did not like the ending though  it left too many mysteries as to what was going to happen  I enjoyed how the book went fast and that it was very detailed  It does has some hard words that you may or may not need to look up though  There are more in the series and i am looking forward to reading them  I liked the attitude of the main character  Jonas  he was basically the hero in the book   i guess you could call him that  He changed from being a normal boy to a boy that knew more about the world thanks to what the giver taught him  The book did get boring at one point to me though but it was only for a bit  Like i said it is a very fast book I would recommend this book to 8th graders or 9th graders or people that like a world controlled by the government for example hunger games fans may enjoy this book    Either way i feel that many people would enjoy it  I think 7th graders should not read it though  It may have some things that they should not hear or may be too immature to hear  Also  there is a moie so once you ve read the book you can watch the movie and see which you will like better  Awesome  Thought provoking story  What would it really mean if we got rid of danger and pain  What price would we pay  Is love wroth the risk  Is life without hurt worth it   Full disclosure   it s only 179 pages  I read this book because the movie is coming out and I wanted to read it prior to seeing the movie  It always amazes me when I read older books how they shape new creativity The Giver is set in the future where the people live in a bubble of  sameness   no color  no emotions  no feelings and certainly no war  At the age of 12  Jonas is selected as a Receiver of Memories as his job title while his playmates are selected for various other jobs  As the Receiver of Memories  Jonas fills his time with The Giver who transmits these powerful memories to Jonas to keep until he is old and can no longer keep them  However  these memories are from a life long lived by those beyond the bubble and soon Jonas is fueled with knowledge and a plan  Okay so basically I just finished reading my first book  I started it yesterday  D  for this year and I must Say I am very glad I chose The Giver to be my first read of 2014 Why so  The story is so inspiring and EYE OPENING TBH at first it sounded a LOT like Divergent  I mean a ceremony where you decide the rest of your life and the protagonist happens to be the different one  the one who DOESN T FIT IN    Well doesn t that sound familiar  Well i couldn t say that the Giver copied off Divergent because this book was out BEFORE Divergent  That was what I was focusing more on the beginning of the story but when Jonas finally met the Giver and he started to receive the memories from the Giver    I started to visualize and understand the story better Lowry brilliantly describes the world in this short novel  How there is hurt  death and pain everywhere and that we cannot escape it  I so love how the author created this imaginary community where in the citizens see nothing but goodness and perfection and everything around them is colorless  Literally  I love how the people feel no love at all  It s an alien world  It s alien because of it s perfection  like no one made mistakes  For me this describes how people strive to become perfect beings but lack the knowledge that PERFECTION isn t what people think Perfect is dull It s lifeless And this book showed that being imperfect is not something to be ashamed of  And no matter how hard people want life to be perfect it will NEVER be I mean the people in this community basically they don t get married they don t have kids they don t even choose the job they like because OTHER PEOPLE CHOOSE FOR THEM  Even the person they are supposed to be with for the rest of your life or your jobs and even your kids are being CHOSEN FOR YOU  I just think that s sick  Because people want everything to be scientifically right that other people had to choose what their life should be like One particular part actually hit me so hard I had to stop reading for a while to reflect on it  There s this term they use   Release  It s like when an old person comes to the right age he ll be sent to a far away place  same thing happens to babies who are born not normal  The moment i heard about this release thing one thing immediately came to my mind  It s death  But Jonas  the main character  describes this release thing as something so beautiful and really being able to go out of the city to that Elsewhere place and I started to believe in his words that it wasn t really death it was just giving people their freedom  Then one chapter Jonas  father performed a release on a baby which weighs like five point six pounds only or something  Jonas  father is a nurturer by the way  I was wondering why did the father used a syringe on a baby   How is that related to a release  Then when the baby wasn t moving anymore and it went all limp I knew  I had chills  Idk why  Because I knew from the start it was death  I just fell into the words of the protagonist What scared me the most os the father wasn t even bothered that he killed a baby  Like it was a natural thing to do  He even put the body on a carton box AND JUST THREW IT AWAY  This goes to show that when one is imperfect people just don t see themas a PERSON anymore  That they are someone that is supposed to be ignored and isolated I ll be honest  of all the books I ve read this one is hard to explain  I feel the way Jonas feels    I KNOW it but I can t seem to EXPLAIN IT But guys you should really read this book  It s really eye opening and amazing 5 5 stars definitely  is a science fiction novel  Then inside a utopian community  where people are living a life of monotony of everyday life  There is no danger  no different  no worries  no happiness  no sadness  no sun  no seasons        Utopia is Greek  meaning Utopia This book describes the story takes place in a utopian world  In this world  everything is under control  people live and work  need to worry  there is no war or painful feeling  We have to do things early is determined at the outset is good  there is no possibility of change  The children are growing up in a good unified mode specified  When the 12 year old Jonas become the new  memory to teach people   he suddenly found that the support of this community is just a lie  So he decided to change everything       Reading this book  I discovered that in fact the world is not without pain operator called perfect  In Utopia  there is no pain  but they did not happy  In our real world  even with the pain  our illness and death  we created a joy and happiness  Because of the feeling of unhappiness  we know that happiness is wonderful thing  In the utopian world described in this book  people do not love  they do not know what love is  do not have children  their partners are elders based on their personality  interests  good distribution  and even children for their pregnant mother Health  Here you see dystocia  see the bad son  because they have arranged everything for the elderly  will not bring trouble in their daily lives  Here  everything is so tame  However  there is no love in the world  will be a kind of how the world  No happiness  no sadness       In the utopian world without color  because the color would create the difference  so there will be different  not the same as it will derive a lot of problems  so they are hard to tell the color  I imagine colorblind has been a very painful thing  it can not distinguish colors  the world is only black and white  as well as ash  It makes me very grateful that the world is colorful  although sometimes not the same color to make people become  like skin color  eye color  and hair color  at least we still live in a world of color  Also  there is no music  no melody  They can not imagine the melody in the ears  is a wonderful feeling  what a beautiful voice Four Seasons is in this world that does not exist  Here there is no sun  no snow  no red maple leaf  and no rain  Although they do not go hungry in this world  do not worry because life  but if this is the condition  I would rather not  Although our world is not perfect  but we still see color  visible snowflakes  see the sun  hear the music  Even when the world war  but we still have love  Although we have a lot of misfortune in the world  but we have hope  there is a surprise  a miracle        Loved this book I read it for battle of the books and It is amazing The story plot is this The setting is In a community that everything is same less  There is no colour no uphill or downhill No rain sunshine or snow The main part of this community is you don t get to choose who your  mate  is what your job is or what your children are The children don t have birthdays     there are so many things wrong with this community This book is about an eleven year old boy called Jonas who lives in this community When he turns 12 and gets given an apprenticeship he finds out many more secrets and wonders about his community and the outside world  Tadinya saya mau baca ebook nya aja Penasaran  karena ada filmnya Tapi akhirnya saya beli versi terjemahannya lebih karena alasan cover nya bagus banget  yang setelah kelar baca  harus saya akui bahwa ini merupakan desain cover yang sangat cerdas karena tidak hanya paduan warnanya yang indah di situ  melainkan juga karena adanya makna simbolisme dari gambar gambar dan pemakaian unsur warna warni di sana   OLalu kebetulan juga sedang ada diskon 30  di toko buku  jadilah batal baca ebook nya  paling gak untuk kali pertama membaca buku ini  berhubung saya kemudian malah jadi tertarik membaca versi bahasa aslinya begitu kelar  sekaligus penasaran juga dengan buku lanjutannya sih   PPertama tama yang harus ditegaskan adalah bahwa buku ini masuk ke kategori fiksi spekulatif  dan tidak tepat kalau dianggap sebagai murni sci fi atau fantasi  meskipun ada elemen fantasinya  Buku ini dipenuhi simbolisme  diwarnai dengan hal hal ironis  dan punya nuansa surreal  Tidak ada hal hal yang diceritakan dengan sangat jelas sekali Tapi ini sudah cukup  bukan suatu kekurangan  karena selama tepat sasaran sesuai dengan yang diinginkan penulisnya  maka ya    akur Saya menyimak kalau ada reviewer yang tampaknya kecewa dengan buku ini untuk alasan yang gak terlalu tepat  imo Berhentilah menggolong golongkan buku ini termasuk ke dalam genre A atau B  atau seharusnya begini  bukan begitu  dan tidak bisa dibandingkan disejajarkan dengan karya X yang lebih baik dalam menyampaikan ide Y Buku ini adalah  The Giver   dibuat seperti itu  dengan tujuan tertentu  apa pun maksud penulisnya  Kalau harus begini dan begitu karena buku begini dan begitu harusnya ditulis dengan begini dan begitu  maka ya  lagi     tulis aja sendiri buku begini begitu itu  xPKalau bukan selera  ya saya rasa gak perlu memaksa sebuah buku menjadi masuk ke dalam kategori selera kita  kan   __  The Giver punya latar post apocalypse  meskipun tidak ada deskripsi visualnya di novel  semuanya hanya disampaikan melalui kisah kisah Mulanya Jonas  sang tokoh utama  mengalami kehidupan sempurna dalam komunitasnya layaknya utopia  namun saat usianya menginjak dua belas tahun  dia mendapatkan penugasan yang membawanya kepada kebenaran tentang kehidupannya  kehidupan semua orang  dan kemudian mengarah pada realisasi akan kondisi kehidupan mereka yang justru malah sebenarnya merupakan distopia Sangat menarik  merasakan pula kontradiksi antara dua perspektif atas suatu kondisi yang sama  Di satu sisi  kehidupan Jonas adalah utopia  namun di sisi lain  sekaligus distopia Penyibakan plot dilakukan dengan alur penceritaan yang lancar dan lumayan mengalihkan sehingga walaupun sepanjang membaca pembaca diliputi kecurigaan atas kenyamanan yang diceritakan  namun pada akhirnya tetap merasakan keterkejutan dan pukulan telak karena rasa emosional yang telah terbangun dengan baik melalui prosa prosanya tante Lowry  yang tadinya saya kira laki laki   v  Tidak ada kisah romance dalam buku distopia ini  jadi penggemar kisah percintaan  jangan berharap terlalu jauh   DBuku ini adalah buku untuk refleksi  sarat makna  sebuah buku pembelajaran  bahkan minim hiburan  kecuali kalau kamu termasuk ke dalam pembaca masokis pencinta twist yang ironis  seperti saya  hahaha  xD  eh  Dan berhubung niatnya reflektif  maka akhir dari buku ini juga menyisakan tanda tanya yang memang jawabannya paling tepat diberikan kepada pembaca untuk disimpulkan sendiri Benarkah untuk menghakimi Apakah pilihan yang dibuat sang tokoh utama adalah sesuatu yang tepat Siapa yang salah dalam kehidupan ini Manusia Sistem Kebenaran Kebohongan Kenyataan Ataukah     harapan         PS Catatan untuk versi terjemahan Selain cover nya yang keren itu  bahasa terjemahannya lumayan konsisten sehingga mudah dipahami dan dapat dibaca dengan lancar Kalau saya sampai memberi 5 bintang untuk sebuah buku terjemahan  bisa disimpulkan kalau saya puas   DKekurangannya adalah masih adanya sejumlah typo dan lumayan banyak hal  sepertiini   Ya itulah  banyak banget dua kata yang bergabung menjadi satu tanpa adanya spasi  dan saya cukup yakin kondisi itu bukan menyesuaikan dengan versi aslinya seperti dalam kasus kata  anakbaru  Mungkin ini bisa jadi catatan bagi penyunting atau proofreader nya   view spoiler  Saya masih bingung mengenai siapa sebenarnya yang mengoreksi naskah terakhir kali sebelum buku terjemahan naik cetak   __   hide spoiler    I read a book called  The Giver  by  Lois Lowry  I really enjoy this book because I love grammar and I also watched the movie  so I know how to understand this book  Without watching the movie I wouldn t be able to understand it  When I had read this book I found words that were unheard of to me  For a couple of these new words I looked up the definition  This book really helped me understand how lucky I am to live in such a free and colorful place  Without this book I still would ve thought that this world was such a bad and terrible place  I also recognized that we are lucky to have parents and or guardians that love us  I can not wait to read the second book  I think that I will enjoy the second book  I would love to read or hear what other people think of this book  I may also want to suggest this book to people who are into mystery and grammar books  This is a classic book  really amazing  It s very well written  Read it  In the book The Giver by Lois lowery it is about a boy named Jonas and he is living what him and his society call a perfect world  Every person that lives in the world is given a job when they turn twelve and does this job until the day they die and then somebody else takes their place  Jonas is given a job and he has a very special job because he is given the job to be the receiver of memory  The receiver s job is to learn all about the real world and is given knowledge from the previous receiver that will retire after he has given all his knowledge to Jonas  The job is called the receiver so that this one person in their  perfect  little world knows the real knowledge and gives it to the next giver when it is his time  The book is called the giver because Jonas builds a good relationship with this person and also because he is the one who gives the knowledge to Jonas  Jonas is able to ask anybody any question about his or her jobs even if it is rude  And the final rule to his job is he cannot tell anybody about the knowledge he has received and he can even lie bout it  During his journey through learning about the real world he found out about a lot of great and amazing things such as color and twins etc  that all the people in his world didn t have  Although to every good there is a bad and he learns about the things like death  loss  and other terrible things that his society does not normally go through   Jonas and his family are taking care of a sick baby named Gabriel  and he does not get better within a year or two he will have to be released from the community  Also  speaking of babies  Jonas s Father has the job to be a nurturer  The nurturer is the person who takes care of the babies in the community  although the bad side to this job is occasionally he has to kill some of them too  The reason why is because  one  they don t allow twins because they claim that is  too confusing  and should not be tolerated in their community  And also if they are too sick he will have to kill them unless they are like Gabriel   By the end of the book Jonas has received all of the knowledge he needs to know about the real world and runs away with Gabriel to find the real world that has color  twins  but also loss  and death  He takes Gabriel with him so that he is able to give him all the knowledge he received when he gets older probably so that he can be as wise as his good friend the giver   Ms  Lowry is not unique in her beliefs of individuality over collective good  in her quest for freedom in place of security but rarely has an idea made me put down a book to meditate on the depth of its message  The parallels she makes  so relevant to our time so strife with the need of security and constant fear of the unknown  Where everything has to be planned and there is no room to color outside the lines Previously where I was constantly peeved by the absurdity of the believers and their worldview  I realize now that the ability for them to practice their belief system no matter how absurd  is the foundation of a society that accepts and celebrates all that is different  This book has left me patient  understanding and in general a better man  Great writing style  This is a refreshing book  I ended up reading this late in life because of a very good friend of mine and I can t remember why I never read it before now  It s a wonderful book  made even more wonderful because Lois Lowry came to our library to speak about it and how she came up with the idea  Her grandfather was dying and she was imagining a life where you could just take a pill and everything would be better  I think this is one of the best pre 2000 post apocalyptic YA novels  It set the bar so high that I m not sure anyone has reached it  Hunger games may have come the closest   Everyone should read this book  it caters to more than fans of sci fi  This as another book set in a controlled community that has become so popular these days   The Giver  came out in 1993 though  so I guess it is one of the first of it s kind  This book is very unique  It takes  controlled community  to a whole new level   one where you don t get to choose the clothes you wear  the job you have  what you do with your day  when you get to ride a bike  or even the words you say  Every choice is made for you  This was the life of young Jonas  until he received his job assignment to become the community s new  Receiver  and was told that he is suddenly allowed to be different  He can ask questions  lie  and even be rude  His life is turned upside down and through his training he realizes that he s not satisfied with the way the community is run  What will he do about it though  The Giver  is a book that will make you ponder things that you have probably never thought of before  and it s thought provoking contents will stay with you long after you have finished reading  It s reasonably easy to get through and there is nothing questionable about the content  I recommend this book for all ages  I listened to the audio version of  The Giver  performed by Ron Rifkin  His voice had great tone and his inflections and changes of voice were appropriate and really added to the mood of the story  This 1994 Newberry Medal winner is most certainly one most middle schoolers should read  I don t know that all the students will be able to relate to such an unsettling theme as to have no choices in your life  I do believe that it will get many of the students to thinking about our lives and how we do have choices and how amazing those choices can be to be able to change a life  Lois Lowry s choice of words is such that students would not have to dig deep to understand vocabulary  yet  they do have to consider her usage of everyday words like  red and snow  and how she describes them to someone how has no idea what they might mean  I think to read in class  the students could consider the pros and cons of having everything just so for all of society  Is this a utopian or dystopian society  Lots of questions would arise in some classroom discussions on government  family and environments of living   I ve loved this book since reading it in middle school  I understand it more rereading it as an adult though  It definitely is one of those books that makes you question  what if   It puts a whole different perspective of what our reality could be  or wouldn t be  if things were different  Imagine a world without color   We really can t because it is what we know  imagine that in reverse  if a world with color was something unfamiliar  not even knowing what color is  This book puts a whole new perspective on almost ever aspect of life  I never got to read this book in grade eight like some of my school mates  We were all divided into small groups and each group got their own book to read together  The Giver by Lois Lowry was one of those books  but unfortunately it was not mine  I ve wanted to read it ever since  and seeing the trailer for the soon to be movie prompted me to finally read it  I finished it this morning  and I can honestly say I loved and wish that I could have read it when I was younger  Would I have understood the deeper meaning  Probably not at first  but I would have loved to have been a part of that classroom discussion  As much as I wish I had read it when I was younger  I am also glad I read for the first time as a 22 year old adult  I think I have a better understanding of some of the themes and I am definitely mature enough for some of the more  disturbing  themes  Had I read it as a 12 year old  I m not sure if it would have turned me off or not All in all  this book is definitely worth a read  It s a quick read that won t take long at all  but does require you to think  I am looking forward to the movie  The Giver is an amazing and spontaneous book that is written from the point of view of a 12 year old boy names Jonas living in a society that has managed to eliminate all war  pain   fear  Mostly everyone looks and acts the same  There is absolutely no choice at the community  At age 12 every member of the community is assigned a job based on their qualities and likes  When citizens get to a certain age and maturity level they can apply for a compatible spouse  each couple can only have two children  one female and one male  The children are born from a birthmother who actually never gets to see their baby  Released means death  but its never fully described this way  people in the community think that release means being sent to Elsewhere  Being release doesn t always means a good thing  citizens who break rules or fail to adapt properly to the society rules are also released but not sent to Elsewhere and this is actually looked as something   un appropriated   on the community  Jonas is assigned to be the receiver because he can actually look beyond  no one the community besides him and the giver can actually do this  Seeing beyond means looking at colours  listening to music etc  Jonas starts receiving knowledge and wisdom with the memories as well as pain that s something no one in the community has ever acknowledged  The Giver transmits memories to Jonas about past events like war  Christmas and more  the reason Jonas should have this memories is for him to have wisdom to help the community in cases of danger  The people don t have a choice to avoid problems its what the elders decided it s been like that for years  The community had achieved at such a great price  a community without war or pain  But also a community without colour or art and most importantly books  Jonas   The Giver come to the realization that there s is more to life than the community itself so they make a plan for Jonas to escape and find what more there is to the world than just this community  This novel is very very well written the way the details are explained on the novel is very complete  The reason I rated this novel very high was because of how eye opening it actually is  It is its fairness that makes the novel so riveting and thought provoking  and so perfect for triggering discussions  This is a not a book that s appropriated for everyone I would recommend the book for kids who are 13 and on  it has some strong parts for example releasing babies witch is later on learned that its actually injecting a baby to death  There are also plenty of sexual references but again this is why I recommend this book for kids from 13 and older  This book reminds us of the amazing gift god gave us  the freedom of choice  I highly recommend this book everyone it s a really huge eye opener   Disturbing  It made me feel angry  sad  impotent  It s a relatively short book  but oh so potent  The open ending was a very good touch  A true dystopia  This book was very interesting for me  even though I read this book in English class in 8th grade  This book is basically about a society with people very similar to us  but having a slight difference in their life  The author tells us about a utopian society in some sense  Some of the events in the book makes the book more fascinating  Also  the plot and the wording of the author is very clear  which lets low level readers able to understand easily  But the actual meaning and symbolism behind it took me quite a while to understand    Es un relato simple y muy basico  no habla de nada que desconozcamos  y a primera vista  pareciera otra sociedad utopica con poca logica o proposito  Les digo que   El Dador   no merece ser comparado con ninguna otra distopia  no con Divergente o Los Juegos del Hambre  pues a diferencia de aquellas  el valor de la novela de Dowry yace en su significado  no en su capacidad de entretener  que a decir verdad  es igual de significativa   Para leer la resena completa http   escribiendoellibrodelavida blo    I have never written a review before but felt compelled  I gave this book 5 stars because it was left in a somewhat bleak place  or did it   giving the reader the chance to imagine the ending for Jonas and Gabe  This book is a classic that should be read it demands your attention  not all great stories come with a happy ending or even straight forward meaning  This is a thought provoking story that will haunt you for days after reading   Imagine a world where you have never felt love  happiness  pain  sorrow  anguish  joy  or anger  a place where you never questioned society  A world of no colour or words  a place where you never had choices Lois Lowry takes you on a journey along with Jonas a young boy with integrity and sympathy based in a community where everything has sameness and to be different is wrong  He becomes the communities receiver of memories a highly honourable role and learns of what it is to feel for the first time  The community is not always what it seemed the Giver and Jonas take a chance on changing their world A must read  dystopian at it s best    Someone recommended this book to me so I decided to listen to it on audio book  The Giver had my attention the entire time  I loved entering into the futuristic world and seeing how things could get out of hand if we were no longer given free choice  Not being able to choose who you wed  or a job  or being able to freely love  These thoughtful images had me thinking as I listened  I have read this book around five times now  I truly enjoy it and recommend it  The Giver is a good book I expected it to be far from what it was like in the movie  but it was quite similar This book is set generations into the future  in a community Everyone seems to have no emotions or aspects on life  Jonas  a soon to be  twelve  lives with his father  mother younger sister Lily  and a newborn named Gabriel that they were keeping in their dwelling at night for research During his Ceremony of Assignments  they reveal that Jonas has Given the assignment of new Receiver He reluctantly takes the job  starting his training with the  Giver  Jonas soon realizes that life for him and the rest of the community wasn t always the way it it Their used to be pain  sorrow  sadness  happiness and love Jonas wants to find that After a year of training with the help of the Giver  Jonas makes a plan to both escape  and save a now one year old Gabriel from his  release  He takes Gabriel on a journey that could help save his life  or end it for them both I would recommend this book to people who have seen the movie because it would most likely be easier to visualize the settings  and people I deifinetely rate this book a five  This book will always have a special place with me  I ve read it so many times  5 bintang berkilau buat buku ini  Ide ceritanya bagus banget   buat penggemar hunger games dan divergent  buku ini sangat wajib dibaca   Mungkin sy akan lbh menikmati membaca buku kl penerjemahnya ga memakai kata2 yg  langka  yg memaksa saya untuk bertanya ke temen editor dan penerjemah  Ini novel kan  Pakailah kata2 yg umum   ga usah pake kata yg bikin kening berkerut dan bertanya2 ini apa artinya  Itu mengurangi kenikmatan membaca lho   Since Lois Lowry s fourth and final book of the Giver Quartet   Son  came out a few years ago  I figured I should re read the whole series again  Luckily  they are quite short and I listened to this one in less than two days  I can t say enough good things about this book  It s one of those books that can be re read again and again and you still find something new and interesting about it  I loved Lowry s ability to create a dystopian world in less than 200 pages  She had me hooked from the very beginning The reality is that there are both good and bad parts of life  In Jonas s society  all of the  bad things  have been taken away to create a  perfect  world  Everything is the same  Everything is provided for  There is no pain  No suffering  Everything is decided in the best interest of the people  When Jonas is choose to receive special training from the Giver  he begins to realize that the world that was created  is also missing the love  pleasure  and pain of life before  As he is slowly introduced to the memories of the past  he also sees the true horrors of his society One of my favorite aspects of this book is the simple layout of a world where everything bad is taken away  Every negative thing about life could have a solution  but at what cost  See my full review here  http   onceuponatime bookblog blogspo    I thought that the book  The Giver  by Lois Lowry was an amazing book about the disadvantages to living in a perfect utopia  What I liked the most about this book is that it is full of symbolization and hidden metaphors that gave slight and subtle clues about Jonas being able to destroy the  perfect   black and white world that they lived in  along with his baby brother Gabriel  I also liked how Gabriel was given the same abilities as Jonas  so it doesn t leave the reader wondering about who would take Jonas s place once Jonas died  Another part of the book I really enjoyed is the descriptions  especially when Jonas is visualizing things for Gabriel and himself on their journey  However  one thing that I disliked about this book was the ending  I thought that the ending was too vague and could have been continued a bit more  mostly the part about the music  Although I really liked the last sentence  I think that the ending could have been a bit better  Overall  I think that this book was a really good read  and I m glad that I have read it  OMG THAT WAS AMAZING HOW DID I READ IT THAT FAST     EDIT    rereadStill possibly the best and most meaningful book I ve ever read The Giver is written for children  and it s fairly obvious in form   the book is easily read in a few hours  It s far from simple in content  though The book takes place in a future world where society has become highly regulated  Young children are assigned to families  and children are assigned their future careers based on aptitude  In a society marked by its stability  one person is selected to bear all the memories of the world prior to the founding of the Community I really enjoyed it  It s a fairly weighty exploration of morality  death  individuality  all that lovely stuff  And while the ending had me bawling  I can t wait to share it with my son when he s old enough And there s a movie coming out soon  The truth is that I was surprised this book  It is a highly recommended book in my opinion  How have I never read this book  SOOOOOOOOO good  At Sameness  everyone is  equal   As you turn 12  every member of society will be assigned a specific role by The Committee  No need to worry about choosing the wrong partner for life  for the Committee will be doing the thinking for you instead  pairing you up with one whose attributes would complement yours  Should you desire a child  you can fill in the application  Every dwelling  notice how it is not called home  is allowed to have only two children  one son and one daughter  When puberty hits you  no need to go through the complexities of teenage life for your  stirrings  can be cured with pills  In this perfect world  no hot girls would call you out for being fugly  for everyone wears the same attire in the absence of colour  The rule also forbids anyone to call out for other people s differences  Mirrors are more of a decoration instead of a functioning object so nobody ever really bother with how pretty or ugly they are  Your skin is never too dark  or too fair and you don t have to worry about being dragged by your cultural baggage It sounds like a perfect world  War and starvation is a foreign concept  but so do death and love  But would you forego the ability to think critically  the experience to appreciate differences  the ability to understand complex concept of emotions  e g death  love  loneliness  sadness   familial ties  and most importantly  the freedom of choice to fight for your rights for this  perfect world   Would you rather let yourself be treated as commodities  whose purpose only to serve society and be willingly  released  to Elsewhere once old age has taken its toll on you  t the book club I run for middle school students  I was shocked to find out that many of them haven t read The Giver  I explained to them that before our beloved Katniss in Hunger Games or Cassia in Matched  there was Jonas and The Giver  Jonas lives in what seems to be a utopia at first  There is no crime  everyone has a job  there are no wars  etc  It sounds pretty much perfect    that is until Jonas finds out the truth about his society  At twelve  he finds out that his job will be the Receiver of Memories  which means he will obtain all of the memories of life before his community ever began  As Jonas goes through his job training  he learns the truth about his community  which quickly turns out to be a dystopia  Jonas decides boldly that he needs to find a way out  Lois Lowry s The Giver  which won the 1994 Newbery  is a modern classic that shouldn t be overlooked by adults and teenagers alike  Lowry is a masterful  My review could never do her justice  She creates an unforgettable world that  to this day  is still very vivid in my mind  I first read this book when I was in middle school and was completely blown away  I had never read anything like this and then many years later  I had the opportunity to student teach a unit focusing on this book to middle school students  I absolutely loved it  the book sparked such amazing discussions and lent itself to some interesting debates and activities  If I were to teach the importance of setting and world building in a writing course  I would refer to Lowry and The Giver  she does this expertly  I mentioned previously that many of my avid readers  much to my surprise  haven t read The Giver  Therefore  this is a book that I ll be recommending to readers that are fans of The Hunger Games and dystopian literature  which seems to be all the trend lately  In sum  this book is outstanding  It s dystopian young adult literature  or should I say anti uptopian  at its finest  If you haven t read The Giver  you ABSOLUTELY must get your hands on a copy   The book is based around a young boy named Jonas  In his community  the elders tried to make everyone the same in every way  They also tried to make the community perfect in any way possible  They did that by taking away animals  Jonas is an apprehensive 11  He could barely wait to see what job he was assigned  He was took by surprise by his picked job  He was chosen for the Receiver of Memories  He gains training by the Giver  the previous Receiver of Memories  Through the experience  he learns pain  loneliness  hunger  sadness  happiness  love  and the truth  One injustice was the pills  What happened was when the children got stirrings  or urges  they got pills  Then they took them for the rest of their lives  No  the problem was not resolved  I would have liked it to have been resolved if the elders just let everyone s emotions be the way they were meant to be  The pills made it impossible for people to feel love for another person  so their emotions were completely blurred  This was one of the most major injustices in the novel  The Giver  I would recommend this book to 12 year olds because of the slight adult themes  It is also a very good book that takes a higher level of thinking to read this book in full depth  It is a fun book to read and most people would enjoy it  It speaks of death of a young child  Overall  this is an amazing book  This book was great  This is one of the rare occasions where I watched the movie before I read the book  and the movie is actually what made me want to read the book in the first place  In fact  the movie added certain elements that the book didn t have which made it  maybe  just maybe  even better  I think just being able to see the visuals that Jonas is seeing is one of the things that made the movie so great Anyway  on to the actual book  One thing I do have to say  is that the ending is a bit on the confusing side  When I finished it  I literally said out loud  What just   what    I think he   died       But  after thinking about it for a while  I sorted everything out and realized that the ending was really good One of the things I loved most about this book is the post apocalyptic world  where sameness is the only way of life  A perfectly conformed world  where everything is without color  and everyone is without feeling  It eliminates a lot of problems  but it eliminates joy as well  It s quite a terrifying thought  but it gives you a lot to think about  That s another thing I loved about this book  it makes you think  All in all  this was a terrific book and I would recommend this to anyone   The Giver takes place in a dystopian society were everything is perfect and everything is the same  People do not have feelings  they cannot choose their job and do not what color  music  oceans  love etc  are The book is about a kid named Jonas and he was chosen to be the receiver of memory  During his training he feels pain  love  and happiness he also gets memories of the past  When he finds out about all the emotions  colors and everything outside his community he want his community to experience the same My favorite part about the book is the ending when you get left wondering if he finds elsewhere of if he doesn t I recommend this book to any one who likes book with emotions  adventure and suspense   The Giver is one of my all time favorite YA novels  and books in general  It is the story of a community who does not feel  A young man is selected to be the receiver  and the Giver  gives him the memories of the community s past  He is faced with much opposition and dispair as he witnesses these things  Jonas  the young man  realizes he needs to escape this community in order to feel  to love  to hurt  and to grow  He does this to protect himself  and even along the way  realizes he loves others  and does it to protect them as well  This book relates so well with it s readers  It s one that keeps you thinking  and helps you to reflect on your own life  Content WarningsLanguage  NASexual Content  NADrug Use  NAViolence  NAWitchcraft Supernatural  Jonas has visions of the past and of the future I loved it  Period  The Giver asks the question  What would you sacrifice for the perfect world  Anything you say  Are you sure  Would you sacrifice color and the sun  hills and rain  snow and rainbows for peace and plenty  More importantly would you sacrifice love and the ability to choose  Welcome to Jonas s world A world where there is no starvation  no wars  no pain and no suffering  The perfect world created in the aftermath of devastation  But here s the problem with this Utopia  it isn t one  There is no such thing as freedom because everything is chosen for you by the Elders  Elders who  just like the people  cannot remember the past  But there is one who remembers everything for all  The Receiver  soon to be  The Giver  Lois Lowry is brilliant and amazing  This book is quite short yet she manages to pack in this amazing moral social political issue into without it feeling rushed  fake or overdone  I loved the book  of course  I m a sucker for Utopian Dystopian novels  I love to sit there and analyze everything  I really am addicted and the Giver gave me my much needed fix  I can t wait to read the next ones   The Community is a utopia  There is no pain  no wars  no fights  everyone is polite to each other  everyone is the same skin color  or  rather  no color  and everybody has their own place in this world  There is a division of labor  each family has two children  one male  one female and the family units regularly talk about feelings of each of the member of the unit in order for everybody to be happy  Everything is under perfect  and I mean perfect  control Jonas is eagerly waiting for the Ceremony of Twelve where he will begin his training in a specialized field which the Elders of the Community had chosen for him and where he will be a step closer to becoming an adult  However  the Ceremony holds a surprise not just for Jonas  but for the whole Community  The atmosphere of this seemingly perfect world was so vividly displayed that I felt disturbed and creeped out the whole time while reading it  This completely sterile surrounding made it clear that something is not so right with this world and made me eager to know more about it  The only thing about it that displeased me was not so elaborate account on the whole structure and organization  I expected somewhat deeper insight on the reason why this world is set up the way it is and how exactly the  government  is systematized  But then again  the story isn t so much about contradicting the system as it is about the discovery of everything that makes us human The people of this Community are stripped of their senses  emotions  feelings  spontaneity and everything else that differentiates human beings from animals or robots  But these people  they are flesh and blood robots  programmed to do exactly what they are told without any signs of regret  guilt or even true happiness and fulfillment  This book tries to bring to consciousness the things that we take for granted  The feeling of snow or sun on our skin  the liveliness that colors bring to this world  the sound of the ocean or the rustling leaves  genuine emotional states but also the unpleasant situations that bring us pain and sorrow  But all these things combined are what make us feel and think and  ultimately  be So  this book is very plain and downright and concise  There is nothing unnecessary or even remotely  well  remote from the main story  which actually gives the same sense of perfection and sterility which is what the whole system is made of  But this is precisely what focuses us on the true meaning of the book which is one of the most optimistic and beautiful ones I ve read  Ever   Jonas  a 12 year old boy  was part of a  community  where there were no differences  Everyone lived in the same style  the  committee  decided what was going to be your job  public speakers were installed everywhere where they could listen to you  and a whole set of rules were placed to limit individual liberty  Once Jonas is selected as the Receiver  he starts to discover many things such as emotions  colors  and the true reality of what he is living  The memories start to reveal many aspects of the hidden life that citizens are abstained from experiencing and Jonas embarks on a journey to explore the real world  It continuously reminded of the Communist system  which isolates its citizens from the real world  Captivating book   Jonas  a boy that lives in a perfect society unlike ours  There world has no conflict  choice   inequality and everyone obeys to the rules  Everyone once there 12 are assigned there jobs  but Jonas is selected for a special job  He taught by a mysterious man that calls him the Giver and over time  Jonas learns about love and feelings and how his society is wrong i love this book because the plot is amazing and I couldn t stop reading it  I think the plot has a original idea but a unusual one to write about  I love how Lois Lowry wrote about there society and how perfect yet wrong it was and it brought to think about how imperfect humans are and how we should respect our differences  Also  the book showed how love and feelings are very powerful and listening to your heart and doing what is right no matter what other people do  I would not recommend this book for everybody because the story is very powerful and a little bit serious  which some people don t enjoy  All in all  I think it was a excellent book   I highly recommend this book to lovers of dystopian utopian themed novels  This book is definitely being added to my all time fav books list  This was the first time I have ever read the book  I was never assigned to read it in middle high school  so I never really thought to pick it up  The story is beyond fascinating and pulls at the seams of your imagination  Jonas  an eleven year old boy  is given the hardest  most painful job in The Community as being the Receiver of Memories  At first I was unsure what that title entailed  but as I kept reading I understand now  The Chief Elder described it as being painful  however painful isn t the right word to describe it  precision of language  as they say   It is grueling and burdensome for Jonas to hold the weight of the world on his shoulders  so that The Community can continue on living in peace without knowing of the past  Lowry s use of language to write a book about a world with no love  no feelings  no color  etc  is phenomenal to say the least  Even without all of that  there is such descriptive language that makes the book come alive  This is one of those books that you can read over and over again  and it never dulls or bores you  It is definitely worth reading sooner than later  I had not heard of this book until friends who are not at all avid readers mentioned they had to read it for school  Their reviews were great  which is more than I can expect as feedback from them  Once I started reading this  I fell in love  This book was perfect    it slowly exposes the world Lowry has created  not providing the whole picture at once  This style just keeps you guessing  until the explanation is provided and you can t help but smile at the simplicity and wittiness about it  while you wonder  How did I not think to figure that out    Overall this is a great book in which the theme greatly touches a society s attempt at eliminating all that causes misfortune and pain throughout the world  The problem is that most of what can cause this  is also what brings joy and love into an otherwise monotonous life  The book really gets the reader thinking on appreciating the simple things in life  For the main character and for the original Giver  a life without these feelings  might not be worth living at all   Amazing story  Really well told and fantastically presented  I d managed to scrape though my honors english courses in high school without ever being assigned to read this book  Now that we are deep in the excited era of dystopian worlds this book seems small and simple when compared to all the others in the genre  But I think that is what makes it such a great novel  It s what won it the Newbery Medal  This book is short   less than 200 pages  It took me three hours to read  But it packed a lot of emotion and by the end it made you think  At the beginning  the idea of living in a world where there is always peace seems like a really serene way to live   I will admit that going into this I knew 0 things about this book   like the only thing I knew was it had something to do with memories   The book begins with you in this perfect peaceful world  where people share their feelings and everyone is happy  The community works in perfect unison  Children are perfectly polite  But after Jonas become the Receives and being to get the memories you realize what a terrible way it is to live  I didn t realize until the book was more than halfway through that this community literally lives in a world that is gray  all for the sake of sameness  As Jonas remembers what pain  and loneliness  and love is  you can feel it with him  It begs the question of what you would sacrifice in order to live in a perfect peaceful world  If you give up all your painful memories you have to give up all your good ones too  It leads you to really understand that in order to be a rich  compassionate person you need the painful memories as well as all the lovely ones  Its neat to see that this was written in 1994 and still stands up the test of time next to the blockbuster dystopian novels  It seems all dystopian novels have the same concept   that our future is destined to strive to be the same  Equality taken way too far  Peaceful communities turned bad  Its something we are scared of  We want to put war and poverty and bad things behind us   but we learn from those things   The Giver is a book that really shows that  It saddens me to watch the trailer for the upcoming film and see that they have added and distorted so many parts of this novel just so that it will fit into the movie world of dystopian films   This book was written in the early 1990s and I never read it until I saw the movie  It s a utopian society where everything is controlled by rules  When children turn 12  they are assigned vocations  Jonas is chosen to be the Receiver of Memory  where he was isloated from his family and friends while he receives history memories from the Giver  He experienced everything from snow storms  hunting of elephants  to wars  These memories caused great pain as well as joy  Jonas finds out that he has been raised in an atmosphere of  sameness  where nobody has choices  Since I am LDS  this book for me  details how the world would be if we followed Satan s plan  We believe that before we were born  we lived in a pre existance with our Heavenly Father  and older brothers Jesus and Satan  Both of them presented a plan of salvation in which the population voted between them  Jesus s plan involved receiving physical bodies on earth where we could choose between good and evil and learn from the experiences that were the consequences of those choices  Jesus would come to earth and atone for every individual s sins  By his supreme sacrifice  our sins would be able to be forgiven of we repented  all the credit would go to his Father   and we could return to live with our Father after our mission was complete upon the earth  Satan s plan  on the other hand  was to make everyone choose the right and that we would all return to live with our Father  Not one person would be lost and Satan wanted all the glory for the success Since we are here on this earth  we all chose to follow Jesus s plan  and I am grateful for that  I don t know if I would have learned anything in a forced society where everthing everybody is the same  We would have avoided all pain in our lives  but who would want to miss the joy also  I loved the concept of the book and movie  It really made me think deeply         Amazing  I wonder if I could use this in Intro to sociology   This book is one of my favorites  I read it in the seventh grade and it started my love of dystopian novels  I think that it is a great book for adolescents  because it deals with the themes of growing up and standing up for what they believe in  YYYYYAAAAAASSSSSS it was amazing and can not wait to see the movie this book is worth SSSSOOOO much more that 5 stars      The Giver is a novel by author Lois Lowry The book is about a boy that has turned the age in his community where he is assigned a job His community is no ordinary community though because there is no color and no emotions  Jonas gets the job of an receiver  someone that basically receives emotions and colors unique from the community His job is to train and receive memories from the Giver a wise elder that Jonas will replace With Jonas es new intelligence he is trying to help the community and make it less plain  something the elder disagree I think this book was very excellent because it describes a world without color and emotions which is plain  It also puts you in an interesting perspective like your really learning new things we already knew about I think people will enjoy this book because it something very different    The Giver   I didn t know how to underline so I have to use quotations  by Lois Lowry is about young Jonas  Jonas s world is perfect  literally  Their is no such thing as fear  pain  sorrow but also for the sacrifice of love and joy  There our also no choices for him to make all of his choices are decided by the Elders  When Jonas receives special training from the  Giver  he discovers all the joys of the world have been hidden from him  Now Jonas tries to spread the truth  As this epic adventure unfolds he finds out who he really is and what love is  The story begins as Jonas  a young boy approaching his twelfth birthday  Everyone shares the same day as their birthday and much like a graduation from one school level to another  children look forward to each year as new opportunities are given to them  The twelfth birthday is the defining one  though  as it is then that their life s work is chosen for them by the Elders  The career given to our young hero  is the main thrust of the book  This book is written in a dystopian setting  with the world order very different from today s society and cultures  Well written and required reading in many schools this is a first in a series  I highly recommend this book  This is a great book  It really shows us how lucky and free we are    Lois Lowry s The Giver was a great read  The plot was well set and unfolded in an engaging form  The main character sought and discovered all the questions and answers I had about his role in the story  The conflicts he had were difficult and interesting  Overall  the story was enjoyable The ending of this novel was a bit confusing  I had questions about what happened to the protagonist and what he would do from there  If I could change the ending I would make it a bit more clear of what the main character came across or rather where he ended up  However I did enjoy the given ending for the same reason  Not fully grasping what happened to the protagonist made me want to know more  An amazingly influential and eerie read  I can see why it is read in schools as it gives teachers loads of chances to teach new words to students  with the rule in the communities that you have to use accurate words to describe your situations   and has many important themes that children teenagers adults can learn from  I rate it 5 5    for uniqueness and meaningfulness Honestly this book had always been on my  to read  list  even before joining Goodreads  But with a movie coming out  I figured I had better read it first  and I m glad I did This book is an incredible read  I can tell from the movie trailer that they have changed some things  which is to be expected   No Spoilers   They seem to be small things such as Jonas getting a daily injection in the movie  as opposed to pills in the book  This book makes you wonder where we are headed in a society where the ultimate goal was apparently  Sameness  Outside of the book  in todays world   it becomes increasingly difficult to express different opinions  beliefs  or preferences without being labeled hateful  intolerant  or just being openly mocked  You would think in 2014 that racism wouldn t still exist  It is prevalent even in my own country  You would think that we had done away with the biggest moral failures of the modern age  but instead we still live in a world that has an active slave trade  genocidal war  and a growing drug industry   but now  back to the book   In The Giver  we are lead to believe that these kind of problems used to exist in the world  but the difference is that rather than work through all of the problems to celebrate differences and make the world better  there was a massive knee jerk reaction to make everything go to  Sameness  with only one member of society remembering how things were  or could be again without  Sameness   This book is beautiful in it s simplicity  There is no explanation of how The Giver is able to impart things to The Receiver  there is no explanation on how the various tools used in  Sameness  work  There is no climactic battle or major villain evident  and there is certainly know lingering love story triangle  All of the things that most authors today so readily use as crutches are cleverly avoided to give you a truly grand  what if  story  At least  the way I read it made me put myself and my world in this book to wonder if we could ever possibly arrive at such a destination Even the ending made you think and wonder what was still to come I really hope the movie does this book justice  since films rarely do when coming from literature  As I understand it  the other books don t have the same characters  or at least not mostly  I am still intrigued enough to see what else the author wrote about this world  This book is relatively short  but pretty impactful  I would recommend it to anyone  I truly enjoyed this book  it is really well written  I hope the next book in the Trilogy is just as good  This was a really good book but I really want to go and read gathering blue since thats the 2nd book I really want to know whats happening  This book  while short in length  made me think more than any other book that i ve read  The story revolves around Jonas  Jonas lives in a world where everything is constant and the controlled  People are assigned their own jobs  clothes  and even spouses  There is no color to be seen  just varying shades of black and white  The only memories that anybody remembers are of the plain world that they live in  not of the beautiful world that we know  that is of the past But there one person who knows of the past  He recalls things like love and war  happiness and anger  He sees color  His name is the Giver  He transfers all of his memories of the to Jonas  He helps Jonas realize that the world he lives in is plain and mechanical  This book made me think about the idea of a world without the common aspects and morals that we see in our lives  Jonas  extreme feelings of anger towards the unfairness of the system is riveting  He sees that all of the people of his community have been striped of the most enjoyable things in life  and yet they have not a clue  This is what drives Jonas to do the unthinkable  He run away from his community  from his family and friends  He tries to escape to a world where he belongs  The ending of this book leads the reader along a terrifyingly intense journey which has a controversial end  I enjoyed this book very much and recommend it to all people  I can t believe this is a book for middle schoolers  I didn t remember one word of it from school and I m glad  I m blown away with the last 35 pages  Overall the book is straightforward  easy to follow  and had no excessive story  As far as a concise and complete story that is also well written and easy to stay interested in  this is easily getting four out of five from me  I m trying to be as vague as possible with my immediate reaction to this book  I apologize for any spoilers but the ending is exceptional  It is a relentless never ending struggle dealing with all the elements that only that one young boy could have handled with his one year of experience  and his co travelor receiving some of his experience was the only possible companion to keep up  Beautiful story of fighting against the unknown for love and to do what is right despite being completely unconventional

read it with in a couple of hours  When I first read it  it was in the eighth grade  Which now that I have read it with a few more years of growing and understanding  it s an incredibly dark and deep topic to teach children  It should be a book they do in high school for the meaning alone  I got to thinking as I was reading it  what if a world like the word Jonas lives in becomes real  We just kill off a helpless baby with no more than a  bye bye   I guess the world of The Giver really hit home with me because my life pretty much revolves around love  art  music  and reading  and so many things the people in The Giver did not have  As much as I love dystopian and  utopian  books  they really terrify me  It could be impossible  but what if that really did happen  On the other hand  if you don t think about the theme and the meaning  at least for me the meaning I got was pretty deep   it s a pretty messed up and weird book  That was my thoughts on it when I first read it  The whole color and black and white thing went over my head until my older brother told me  I believe it s not a book for younger children  i e  eighth graders and I saw sixth graders in a review of this book  but for high school students  One theme I saw looking at the reviews was about  a story about growing up and confronting the world outside of the safe haven of childhood   I do not really think that younger kids could really grasp the deeper meanings of this book  I sure didn t when I was in eighth grade and that was only a couple years ago  All in all  I really did enjoy this book  It hit closer to home for me than it will with others and I know some people will not like this book  but I hope people read it before seeing the movie that is coming out soon   I hesitated only a few seconds in giving Lois Lowry s  The Giver  a five star rating  Years before the dystopian worlds in  The Hunger Games  and other band wagon versions were created  Lowry wrote a clear  stunning and frightening description of the community young Jonas lives in  Any facet of life that involves choice  color or emotion has been rigorously expunged  Children are grouped by their age and each year s Ceremony brings the same advancement for all  As Jonas  sister Lily turns Eight  she  received the identifying jacket that she would wear this year  this one with smaller buttons  and for the first time  pockets  indicating that she was mature enough now to keep track of her own small belongings   Each Twelve is given their life s assignment   Nurturer  Laborer  Fish Hatchery Attendant  Birthmother  et al   and once their usefulness ends they are Released  Jonas  recognized with special traits  trains to be the new Receiver of memories and the awakening of his senses causes him much anguish  Lowry has created a haunting book whose aura will endure   The Giver  is now the first in a set of four and I look forward to the remaining three   Gathering Blue    The Messenger   and the recently released  Son   This story takes place in a society that appears to be a Utopia on first glance  It follows Jonas after he is selected for the job of Receiver of Memory  who stores all the memories of the past  The society has adapted a sameness eliminating color  climate  memory to preserve structure and equality  As Jonas receives more memory he struggles with new concepts and emotions that challenge the community and the way he lives  This was a great story  it displayed the community first as a utopia then revealed it as dystopia which served well as an illustration of how close the two are based on the decisions a society makes  It dealt with some very heavy material in an appropriate way but without sugar coating it  I admit I was skeptical about reading this upon learning it was a  children s book   I m glad I was able to look past it  I continue to be floored by the negative reviews of this book  And   perhaps it is my lack of Christian persuasion   I wasn t left with the impression that Jonas was some kind of Jesus Christ figure That being said  the book was an extremely quick read   both because of the shortness of the story but also of my intense interest in the story as it unfolded  While I realize there was some simplicity to the book   it was written for children   I found the book to be thought provoking for adults and worthy of some critical thinking and imagination The points the story makes are certainly relevant to this day and age  What a book that can provide for readers of all ages  How interesting  It is a testament to how great Lois Lowry s writing is that I started reading this and was thinking to myself  Hmm    this doesn t seem like a dystopian   All that she puts into this I loved  The society was brilliantly written and it takes subtle hints to realize that this is a sad community  BUT it s a community that does care  I don t think they MEAN to be dystopian but really  does anyone when it starts What I enjoyed most  other than the progressive dystopian feel  were the characters  And the overall feeling of the story itself is remarkable  Every word seems to be placed just so the reader can understand the true ideas of this society  and the ramifications behind such ideals  I don t think I actually started feeling slightly shocked until more than halfway through As a pretty short story it is remarkable how much information was put into this  And not once did I feel bogged down by that information  It was given out at a reasonable pace while still showing how the characters live and react to certain things The only slight hiccup was why things happened at the end  I understand and agree  technically  but I would have wanted more than just the one catalyst for such a brave move  Maybe I m just mean but I would think that he would need more for such a move but then again such things take a decision at the spur of the moment    something that I m going to have to think more about  Absolutely fabulous  I enjoyed it so much that I am going to pick up book two NOW  4 5 5 Timeless  Written for junior high students  it is appropriate for adults too  Elicits good conversations and works well for book club members  This book was really different for me  I usually read book with a lot of action  instead the action was internal for most of the book  Also the book also had me rethink and think about a lot of things  First in the giver no one can see color  Except for the giver and the receiver  So that got me thinking what if we don t see the same colors  There is no way to describe a color we use color to decibel things  so my bred might not be the same as your red  To tie in with that you also can t hear music  Just think about it  Never hearing the sweet sounds of a lullaby or never getting to hear your favorite song over and over again  They called that seeing and hearing beyond  And that got me to think what is we can t see or hear beyond what if there is something greater than music or even color out there but we ll never get a chance to see or hear it  Something that almost had me to tears is when Jonas just learn the word love and later that day he ask his family unit if they loved him  and instead of say yes of course they scolded him for using such a strong word and said they just enjoyed him  So over all I laugh I cried is was a roller coaster of emotion my friend   Sarah MinchinMs  Goldberg English period 330 March 2015 Independent Reading Book Review The Giver by Lois Lowry is not only very intriguing  it has tremendous strengths  barely any weaknesses and is a great read for all readers interested in a wonderful story The Giver is a dystopian novel about a young boy by the name of Jonas who is not like the others in his community  Through the book we see Jonas s life  and how he is considered  different and special  where he lives  I enjoyed how this book was written in such descriptive detail  One part of the book that really stood out to me was where Jonas learns what a sunburn is   This time  as he lay basking in the wonderful warmth  he felt the passage of time  His real self was aware that it was only a minute or two  but his other  memory receiving self felt hours pass in the sun  His skin began to sting  Restlessly he moved one arm  bending it  and felt a sharp pain in the crease of his inner arm at the elbow   108 109 Lowry   When I read these few sentences I really could feel what was happening  Lowry described what sunburn was and how it happens perfectly to someone who was clearly new to what it was  That is what mostly intrigued me to read this book  it just showed you a whole other side of the world that we see as the norm   I wouldn t say that this novel has weaknesses  but if you are the type of reader that takes a longer time to piece things together  you might have a harder time understanding this book  At first  I was unsure of what was originally happening  but as the book progressed  I became more aware of what was actually happening  Since this book is not like our world  its more complicated to understand  An example of where I was originally confused was where they began to talk about feelings   It was one of the rituals  the evening telling of feelings  Sometimes Jonas and his sister  Lily  argued over turns over who would get to go first  Their parents  of course  were part of the ritual  they  too  told their feelings each evening  But like all parents    all adults    they didn t fight and wheedle for their turn   Lowry 6   Instead of just talking about how you feel  in this world they had a set time  Eventually  after reading further you would understand more of why that happens  but initially it is a bit confusing   In a few areas when new things are introduced it just takes a little longer to understand fully what s going on  This book is not just another book  It s not just another Hunger Games or Divergent  While reading this book I could really feel the emotions and what was happening because Jonas and I are very close in age  When Jonas first learns that his father had killed his twin its described that   Jonas felt a ripping sensation inside himself  the feeling of terrible pain clawing its way forward to emerge in a cry   189 Lowry   When I read this whole section about death  I remembered when I witnessed a death  I noticed right away that I felt the same feelings that Jonas had experienced  In certain parts of this book  what Jonas is learning about and how he reacts to it is very similar to how little children experience new things in the real world   While reading this book I found myself not having any difficulty  I am not usually a big reader  but this book always kept me on my toes and I never wanted to put it down  Therefore  I didn t have a hard time finishing it by the deadline  I would say that this book is appropriate for students my age  or even younger  The only thing that may be difficult for people reading this book is its concept of a different world that has different ways of life  If you are the type of reader that likes more realistic things I don t think you would enjoy reading this book  Overall  this book is a great read and I recommend this book to readers that just want to read something interesting about a different take on life  Work CitedLowry  Lois  The Giver  Boston  Houghton Mifflin  1993  Print  One of the best books I ever read  as a teenager I highly suggest this book to young adults  One of my all time favorites Jonas is an eleven year old boy  living in a futuristic community  In this community people thrive off of sameness and non prejudices  due to the decisions made by the Committee of Elders  Every year in December there is a ceremony  where the children advance to a new stage in life  This year  Jonas was going to be assigned to his job placement  To Jonas  surprise  he is not assigned but selected to be the new Receiver of Memories who will succeed the current Receiver  A Receiver of Memories is the one person in the community who has access to all the memories of the past  Jonas works with the Giver and obtains memories of color  music  weather  pain  love  family and death  With these new memories  Jonas decides to bring this awareness to everyone in the community  He achieves this by walking far beyond the community into elsewhere with Gabe  When Jonas leaves  the memories he has received from The Giver will be let loose  The people will have access to the memories that will  in turn  give them knowledge about things that have been missing in their lives From reading this book  I have a whole new appreciation for the things I do have  Throughout reading this book I often thought  life would not be so bad without pain  but without pain  we would have no appreciation for when times are pleasant  I really loved the simplicity of the writing in this book  People of all ages and genders can pick up and read The Giver  and get something out of it  There are many interpretations and impressions you can experience when reading this book and that another thing I love about this book  The Giver is an inspiring book  that makes you appreciate what you have and changes your life Content warnings  none This is a book about a boy named Jonah who is passed down the job of being the  giver   Nobody is quite sure what the job of the giver is and initially he s not supposed to tell anyone  after all it is quite the job  After becoming the  giver  he starts experiencing things he s never experienced before  From seeing colors for the first time  to experiencing true happiness  and to even experiencing pain  he lives through the memories of people passed on through the giver  I think this is an awesome book because it teaches about conformity  Sometimes following the rules isn t always the best thing to do  I think it s crazy that in this story these people didn t know what colors or real feelings were  It s so interesting to me that someone was able to create a unique story like this  I can t imagine living in a grey world where everything is the same  I definitely recommend reading this book for anyone in middle school and older  It encourages students to question things and try to see the world differently than they already do   The Giver by Lois Lowry is an exciting book that is based in a perfect Utopian world in which there is no pain  suffering  difference  war  color  or emotion  Nobody is ever singled out  or neglected in any way  whether it pertains to food  pain  or friends  There are no choices  every person is assigned a role in the Community and that role is never questioned once given  Everything in Jonas s world is perfect  view spoiler   When Jonas turns twelve and becomes an adult  he is singled out to receive special training to become the Receiver of Memories  who holds all the memories from the past before Sameness  The memories that are dangerous and would keep the community from being controlled the way it is now  Jonas s job is to hold all the memories of true pain and pleasure of life  and now that it s time for Jonas to receive the truth    hide spoiler  I enjoyed this book because Lowry does a beautiful job of sparking your interest in Jonas s world and it also makes you just the right amount of upset  It makes you think about Utopia and how it would work  if it worked  It s a beautifully written book that has all the twists and turns that make a book award winning  I would definitely recommend this book to anyone looking for an easy read that s very engaging and interesting   Grade 6 9  SLJ  Lois Lowry doesn t disappoint in this novel  much differently written from her other amusingly witty adolescent tales  This novel is part of a quartet  The Giver being the first installment  It tells the fictional tale of Jonas  a boy entering adolescence in a structured  futuristic society  One walks with Lowry through Jonas family unit of Mother  Father  and his younger sister Lily  although none are blood related  In this society  everything is structured  including birth mothers  and chosen spouses and parents  by the Committee of Elders  Memories are given to the Receiver in the society so as not to distract or burden other members of the society  The plot develops as Jonas is chosen as the next Receiver and how the memories affect Jonas as given to him by the Giver  A question is also raised as a new child  Gabe  is born but is not developing according to the strict guidelines set by the Elders and has been labeled Uncertain and given an extra year in the Nurturing Center  Shall he be released  and what happens when the old or newborns are released  School Library Journal recommends the content to be grade 6th through 9th  but I would recommend through adult  I have loved other Lowry books and this did not disappoint  I think others will be left wanting to read the sequels as I do  The themes of a utopian society  sameness  moral aptitude  and compassion are a ribbon throughout the text  This novel can be read aloud or as assigned class reading  Newbery Medal  1994 I personally thought this book was great as you probably know from the star rating  It was set in a dystopian future which though it s fiction seems as it may be a reality one day  I felt really angry that all these people were being hidden from the truth  Not only the truth but plain pleasures in life  No freedoms or rights  this theme may see  familiar but I believe that Lois Lowry added an interesting twist because  unlike most books in which people would be angry  in the giver most people are quite happy and peaceful  Except for Jonas and The Giver that is  because they understand  No further detail  Anyway  I could really visualize the scenery in the book  Lois Lowry dedicated this book to all the children whom we entrust with the future  These days all the children seem to be figuring things out on their own sooner or later they will be figuring out the future  Maybe we need to be watching children a little more closely  or at least that s a theory I have  All in all I believe the giver had many surprising twists and interesting plot and unforgettable characters  I can see why it won the new berry  and why it s still one of the top books for young adults   or maybe a bit younger  Set in a world of sameness and oneness  where everything that you do is assigned  or rather  dictated by some wily ancients  how would you ever find your identity if you ever get the faintest idea that you could have one  Colors do not abound  everyone gets the same clothes  toys  errands  even the same education as a youth  and your family   you get that through wretched situations of unfortunate women who are compelled to give birth if the community so desires  It s completely  another world  where the people are settled with this predicament because they are not aware of a better world in the outlands   save for  The Giver  The novel was quite short but the plot is unquestionably shrewd  I ll expound few lessons I ve learned from this book 1  I remember that scene where Jonas  sister was fussing about a boy from another community who went against their rule If you ever find yourself troubled with the shortcomings of another person  try putting yourself in his shoes   from there you ll understand  2  Myriads happen in the world   it s a pool of emotions and a web of simultaneous events  Relaying your fears and concerns to a trusted friend could lift you up from the burden 3  Under the peskiest circumstances  it is noblest and most fulfilling to put others   especially the people you love  ahead of you  always  like what Jonas did for little Gabe 4  As was quoted in the  Da Vinci Code    Life is full of secrets  you can t learn them all at once  True enough  I ve learned from  The Giver   that most of life s revelations are enthralling  even beyond comprehension 5  Sometimes you have to go against the current and endure snide comments from the society to get to your own fulfillment that s just patiently waiting for you I d say this book by Lois Lowry is one heck of a must read  The concept is one of a kind  Splendid  I don t read many books in a day  I m a little busier these days than when I was a Peace Corps Volunteer in Thailand  reading 3 4 books a week     But yesterday I was transported from my real life into the dystopian world of Jonas and his family  They live in a very safe  very predictable society full of rules  with a wizened group of Elders that make decisions on behalf of all the citizens  How dangerous it would be if the citizens made choices for themselves  These Elders  with the rules they make on what children should wear and do and say  teach Sameness  nobody stands out under the age of 12  These Elders choose what person will be partnered with what other person  which child shall be given to that couple  what job will be assigned to each citizen  and which babies and older people will be  released  from society because they are not needed  or no longer needed  At first  the society seems just fine  different  sure  but not bad  Then  Lois Lowry expertly unfolds  with the help of Jonas and the job he s chosen for  what the society lacks  color  knowledge  feelings  true experiences  and free will  The elders don t believe that the citizens can handle free will and all the choices that come with the rest of those other things that  through generation after generation  they have taken away  It is dangerous for citizens to have the power of free will Jonas decides that he cannot live in a society void of color and feeling and choice  He risks safety and predictability and comfort  the alternative  a real world full of color and peril  feelings and experiences  is worth it to him I was surprised by how swept up in the book I was  how much it made me think of my own little bubble of a life  and how much it reminded me of a childhood favorite  Brave New World  that now I want to reread sooner rather than later  I also need to get my hands on the sequel to the Giver because the end of The Giver is a huge cliffhanger  And   does anyone want to go see the movie with me  Simple  beautiful  moving story  I am left wanting to know more   what now     This is written so crisply and directly you cannot resist turning the page  LOVED this book  This was a very thought provoking futuristic novel about a boy who lives in a seemingly perfect society  He is the one chosen to be the next  keeper of memories  and therefor finds out that his seemingly perfect world is one without real sadness or real joy and he longs for everyone to have the real world back again  While it brought up some issues that I felt were a little mature for my young children  I think it would be a great novel to read with and discuss with teenagers  It really made me think about the importance of freedom and learning from our history  etc  It also made me appreciate life s unexpected joys and sorrows and made me more desirous to keep our world that way  I loved how the author made things seem so picture perfect only to unravel the truth of what that world lacked in the end  Main character Jonas lives in a utopian society  We see the story and the town through his eyes  Being a young character  we see everything purely and simple and blunt  He doesn t tell much about this town being different  because he knows of nothing to compare it to  It is his world and he  like everyone else  obedient and conforming to the ways which he grew up knowing  He constantly is letting the reader know of rules  To him  he is generally speaking them as if they are normal and necessary  The reader s mind is spinning thinking about how absurd the ideas and rules are  For example there is one that says you can t be rude or that you have to apply for a marriage and only are allowed two kids  which you can t even name yourself  They also get assigned a job like Nurturer  which Jonas  father is  or president of recreation like Jonas  best friend Asher got   There are also women assigned to be birthmothers  I thought this was the most insensitive thing that I ve ever heard  They are just machines that give new droids to the community  I can t imagine a world with no pain  no real joy  Jonas asks his parents if they loved him  They couldn t answer that question  they didn t know what to do with it so they just chastised him for his use of words  When Jonas gets chosen to become the new Receiver of Dreams he experiences reality  Then  he starts seeing things differently  He becomes to realize the injustice and unhappiness of his life  But you have to think  is it really better to get placed in reality or is better to just have that utopian life  free from real sadness and problems that we see around us  If you know any different you would of course need color  need music  need love  But what if you didn t know it  Would your life still be complete  My gut says yes  But  I would never want the world any other way  How could you truly appreciate the joy when you know no pain  I think this was an excellent book and idea that Lowry thought of  I read it within 4 hours at the park with my sister and I felt it was incredibly easy to read  The ideals within it made me think how appreciative I am for the simple marvels in our world  What would life be without music  What if there were no colors  To me  something can not be inspiring visually without colors or without abstract ideals  I wouldn t be able to be given a husband  children  and a job  It wouldn t make me feel like an individual  I just finished this book  and all I can say is   WOW   It took me a little bit to really get going  but once I hit the midway point I didn t want to stop reading  Lowry has this wonderful ability to suck the reader in and make her want to keep reading  to the exclusion of all else  I found the way she dropped bits of information in the least obtrusive way possible very intriguing  She rarely comes out and says   Oh  hey  this is how things are   For example  The society in which Jonas lives has been founded on Sameness  Everything is the same  Pointing out differences is rude  and one can be chastised for doing so  Instead  everyone talks about what is similar  But this Sameness ideal has been taken so far that there is no color in the world  But Lowry never comes out and says that straight out  Instead  she first gives us a hint by saying that an object had flickered somehow  just a bit  when Jonas was looking at it  and this happened several times  Finally it takes the Giver telling Jonas that he s finally being able to perceive color for the reader to realize that they live in a very  very colorless world  and that s almost halfway through the book The book points out an interesting notion  What  if  we were all the same  What if there were no pain  no feelings  no motivation aside from the pleasure of a job well done  It takes all the fun  the joy  the excitement out of living  It s what makes us human  not robots  And Lowry has done an excellent job of proving this to us  Jonas is turning twelve and he s been assigned the role of  The Giver   While in training he s exposed to the memories of the past  including those of war  famine  and torture  but notwithstanding those of joy  love  and bliss  He is the only community member to feel the surge of emotions that the Receiver bestows on him  His job from here on out is to aid in some of the decision making that the Council charges it itself with  but cannot make  because of lack of experience  While in training  Jonas discovers the true meaning of  release   and is immediately pained with the reality of it  Everything he has even known and come to believe is too disturbing for him to bear  His world is made up of lies  Jonas is faced with a critical decision  Continue living this life or abandon it forever  It s been 21 years since its first publication  and 20 years since it won the Newberry Award  And it s taken me that long to read the book  This is such a good read  I m actually glad I read it now as an adult  because I don t think I could have understood all of the underlying themes in this story as a young in  Experiences  of all kinds  will definitely make this read a memorable one  The Giver is one of my favorite books   I think this is a really good book because it makes the reader travel to a world of black and white   The book gives the opportunity to the reader to compare reality to fantasy  I recommend this book for people who travel often  After reading this book I felt that anything can be possible and the way of seeing the world can change after decisions made by a group of people   Wow  Plain wow  This book surprises me at every line and pages  I m grateful I read this one  Definitely need to read the second book  Jonas here is a smart and an organized child  He lives in a community where there is a perfect life laid before them But it started to change when he was given the title of The Receiver to be trained by the former yet still Receiver of the community now called The Giver  He lived with his Father and Mother and his little sister Lily  Though they are not blood related  Sameness  It s what everyone is  No bragging  No arguing  Apologies are accepted  Two child policy      Things are shared and recycled  Words should be precise  But to end with  They has no emotion they just use words to express something but not with a feeling  And the world is colorless  OR rather in a gray scale Having to know something greater than what world he lives now he must take on a different journey  a strange and not a familiar journey that involves leaving his lying parents though they didn t know much of that  and a talkative sister  But he takes someone with him  Could they survive  Only bringing memories with them  Could they endure what awaits in the path they have taken     I m not surprised when  RELEASED  meaning was given out  but I did  When the baby was released  it s so many emotions rambled together  Like how can they do that  its just a baby  and for chrissakes what s wrong with a twin babies what s wrong with you people Well what I m so surprised about this  is The Giver s daughter  Not gonna say more  Haha And at last  I ve read a dystopian book which has a Male protagonist  The End  Wala na naman kwentang review galing sa akin  Haha  Iki gun once bitirdim  kisaca  Yazar Aktarici ve toplulukla ilgili biraz daha bilgi verseydi daha iyi olurdu  Ama konu  verdigi mesaj  anlatilanlar cok guzeldi  4 5 tan bes  This has been one of my favorite books for a long time  I first read it in elementary school  4th or 5th grade I think  and I loved it then as well  The whole concept of the seemingly  perfect  society is fascinating to me  I really liked that you only found out what the society doesn t have as you read further into the book  About a third of the way in I was sure that the society they lived in needed to change  And the ending  well  that is my favorite part  You don t know  There isn t closure  It leaves it open to your imagination  unless of course you read the next three books   I love books that make you think and this is one that does that  I think it was the first one I read that really made me think  Maybe that s why I love it so much  Young adult fiction is an additional challenge  because authors find themselves more limited in terms of style and explicitness  The Giver started me on my life long love of dystopian stories  and Lowry admirably manages to convey the horrors of a futuristic authoritarian world without resorting to intestine slapping  eyeball smushing freakshow  LOOKING RIGHT AT YOU  CORMAC MCCARTHY   Not that I don t adore intestine slapping  eyeball smushing freakshows  but I believe writers should master simplicity before they attempt excess  The Giver was an excellent book  I thought that it was very strange and exciting at the same time  It had a great story that kept wondering what was going to happen  It made me think about how our life compares to the book  I couldn t imagine what I would feel like in the setting of the book  The writing in this book is effective to me  I think this because of the strange words they have  The words are very different compared to our everyday language  It effected me by seeing if that we used those words instead of some of our words  I thought it was a little bland at the beginning but  then it started to speed up later on in the book  The novel is a great book to read for all ages  It would surely excite anybody who reads it  If you want to read an exciting Utopia themed book  then this is for you  The Giver was honestly one of the best books I have ever read  One thing that I will point out is the ending to the book  The ending  although fitting for the story  in my opinion  is not fulfilling  The ending of the book is very vague and feels incomplete  It leaves a ton of questions like  Did Jonas Die  Did the memories get release  What happened to The Giver  I wish that the author  Lois Lowery would make a sequel  I know there are already sequels to this book   where Jonas goes back to the community or something to do with Rosemary   I loved this book  I loved it because it made me think about what it is to be human and our experiences and what it is to be human and in this book an alternative is presented that to us now seems pretty grim   this however is my interpretation of it  a different reader may think something else   This is the joy I got out of this book  because I know that my experience with this book is probably different than others will be  This is a book where you bring yourself into it and makes it a very unique experience  That is why I know this book gave me a lot of joy  I will say I highly recommend reading this and honestly can t wait to see how this will adapted into a movie   4 5 5This book was so good  I really enjoyed the premise of the book and how simple things  like color  were foreign to the people in this community  The ending was completely open ended and I wish we got to know more about what happened  I couldn t give it a 5 5 because I was a little bored after Jonas was given the assignment of the Receiver  but it was still a great read  At first  a bit skeptical to pick up this book and start reading  I wasn t totally convinced that I was going to be satisfied with this book   My stubbornness to only reading books within my so called  comfort zone  was kicking in   The first few pages passed and I was a bit confused  not quite putting my full attention onto comprehending what Lowry was trying to point out at the very beginning  And then it hit me  after re  reading   I though that it was amazing how a character  multiple characters  were going about a basic story line in such a strange  colorless world  I was utterly intrigued from every page after my realization and found myself finishing the book within what seemed like only a few minutes  I was mesmerized with this world that this little boy was forced into  I was mesmerized by just the idea of how a community would  care  for themselves  And what the deciding factor of loving this book for me was  was that I was able to read this book  cover to cover  with complete normalcy  At first I was skeptical  as said at the beginning  but after re  reading  fully understanding what was happening and understanding the unique form of symbolism used  I felt like the atmosphere in this book was completely living capable  Loved it  Loved it  Loved  It   Before starting this review  I just want to say that I ve written 200 words already but my finger slipped and deleted everything I wrote   control z you say  Now  why doesn t my android have THAT function   Hear that Samsung  Please   finger   don t slip on me now The Giver was the first Utopian Dystopian or anything ending with a  ian book I ve ever read  I was 12 at the time and it was a book assigned in our Literature class at school  I was reluctant to read it because when I read the blurb  everything is equal  Everyone is equal  I should say  There is no pain  There is no colour  There is no music  and there was no war  Everyone was   content  and took special pills to control their hormones and whatever feeling deemed to tip their balanced scale Jonah was assigned a prestigious occupation as The Giver   or The Receiver since he has yet to learn  It s a prestigious and dangerous job and the society believes he s the right fit  Being The Giver means you get to keep the memories of pain  war  love  colour and music I shan t say more otherwise I ll be spoiling you guys  and maybe I m a little afraid my finger will slip again  Lois Lowry does an excellent job describing what is so NORMAL to us  to someone whose never experienced it before This story is recommended to anyone of any age  go ahead  give it to your ten or twelve year old   cos when I was that age  I was intrigued  It ll start making you think about all the things you take granted for and possibly give you something to think about  YAY MY FINGER DIDN T SLIP   I really enjoyed reading this book  It has been one of my favorites for a long time now and rereading it I can see why  The book is based on a science fiction genre  which makes the book seem almost futuristic  The author does a really good job at being specific with her words bringing the novel to life  With detail and a lot of suspense  these are both reasons why I enjoyed this book  I liked reading this book because of how much detail is put into  I also really enjoy how the suspense flows throughout the book   The Giver keeps on giving  it s a layered reflection on totalitarianism  The deeper you look  the more there is to see  Yes  The Giver is a phenomenal book  Lowry s answering an important philosophical question that goes something like   Why do bad things have to happen   There s a lot of discussion about exposing children to the pain and suffering that s a part of life  right  I think this book is the best cautionary tale in that discussion  If you try to strip away everything that hurts  what will you have left  Science Fiction at its best  I borrowed this book from my office mate  and I felt like I should have bought a copy in the first place  I love the book  It deserves to be in in my favorite shelf  It was so interesting  The concept and the writing style is great  While reading it  I can t stop thinking how better it is from Hunger Games and other dystopian and utopian books  I think better is an understatement  the Giver is the best   But I love Hunger Games in a different way  There are several things that made the book incredible  the mystery of Jonas role in the community  the introduction of color  happiness  and pain and the concept of Elsewhere  Release and Sameness I m just confused about the ending  Can somebody tell me what happened there  But despite the ending  I still love the book  So  the last time I read The Giver I was in the fifth grade  like 15 years ago  With the movie adaptation coming out later this year  I had the urge to re read this short  quasi dystopian novel  This time around I was struck with idea of innocence  and how much Jonas s training with The Giver represents the loss of childhood innocence  that frightening realization that the world is not exactly this perfectly happy place Anyway  after watching the trailer for the upcoming movie  I have this feeling that it s going to be a terrible adaptation  It s not even in black and white  Jonas is too old  and you can already tell that the movie is going to screw up the the somewhat ambiguous ending  Actual rating 4 5 5After seeing the trailer for the upcoming The Giver movie  my interest was piqued   like a kitten seeing a bird and thinking  that bird shall be mine for supper  A dystopian setting with a YA protagonist  A cast including actors from True Blood  Dawson s Creek  Vampire Academy aaaaand Taylor Swift  Yes  I would definitely have to see this movie  But first  I wanted to read the book  I can t tell you why  exactly  because the cover is anything but appealing  Maybe just because I m addicted to book movie adaptations and because I feel super well read when I can say  Oh that movie  Yeah  I read the book   IMSOSMARTZ   But regardless of my motives  I m pleased I did read it  The Giver is rightfully considered a true classic in Young Adult literature  written in a time  back and back and back   actually  1993     when the abbreviation  YA  meant nothing to readers or writers yet Even though the main character in The Giver is only twelve at the beginning of the novel  in the movie they aged him up to about 16  I think  which is the standard age for YA these days   The Giver definitely ticks the most important box to be considered as Young Adult  letting go of your childhood innocence and learning the importance of freedom of choice  and the consequences of the choices you make  It ticks all of the dystopian boxes too  By changing everyday words like  family  to  family unit  and  bedroom  to  sleeping chambers  etc  the reader realizes that this world is much the same as ours  but also that something s slightly off  Even though what exactly that is  is not by any means unpredictable for your average dystopian reader  it will still give you chills to experience the discovery of what s beneath the perfect veneer of his life though Jonas  eyes  Especially his relationship with his parents becomes truly unnerving towards the end of the book  His relationship with The Giver and Gabriel  on the other side of the spectrum  will warm your heart  This book is anything but action packed or even all that suspensefully written  yet I felt myself constantly sitting on the proverbial edge of my equally proverbial chair  I much prefer the couch for reading     whilst racing through the short chapters of it  I felt very invested in the characters and their lives from page one  I often lack that connection when a book is written in third person perspective  but I easily overlooked it in The Giver as I climbed into Jonas  head and world The only criticism I can come up with is  why on earth is this book so short  This makes it a speedy  though I wouldn t say  light   read  sure  but I feel kind of like this was a skeleton draft that still needed to be fleshed out  However  there are still 3 more books in this series  so I ll reserve my judgement on that topic until I ve read the entire series  I m very curious about the movie  released on 15 Aug   Even though it appears as though they changed a lot   starting with the MC s age and making the romantic element about 99  more prominent   and a lot of fans were worried about that  I understand the choice to do so and am sure that it will not in any way make the core message in The Giver any less meaningful to the broader public it will soon be able to reach PS  I wonder if Beth Revis  Across the Universe  and Ally Condie  Matched  read this book before they started theirs  because I can definitely see what might ve sparked their stories in The Giver  This is why it s a good idea to read a classic now and then  instead of only reading the novels that were derived from them   A piece of advice I could stand to follow myself more often    My teacher read me this book in class and it is wonderful  Lois Lowry tells about what it s like to have to have and show great responsibility  to have to have patience in order to get something  and to get a job that almost nobody else gets  This book is awesome  From the suspense when Jonah s at the ceremony of Twelve  to the amazement when he starts to see color  to the wonderfulness when he learns about snow and sledding and hills and sunshine and sunburn and sameness  It is a truly amazing book and story  My teacher loves it  my classmates love it  and I love it  I highly recommend this book to people of all ages  I cannot wait to see the movie in August   The Giver was my introduction to the dystopian genre  I remember loving it over a decade ago  and I decided to re read it this summer  I was a little worried I wouldn t like it as much   that maybe I had held it up on a pedestal all this time  because in my young mind I thought it was incredible  Luckily  I wasn t disappointed  It was just as good as I remembered It s a beautiful  harrowing story that will force you to think about your own life  the way you choose to live it  and the way you interact with society  It s not necessarily groundbreaking  as it s clearly not the first novel to have introduced these ideas  but it had a profound effect on me as a child so I am rating it as such If you haven t already read this  I highly recommend it  OH MY GOODNESS  That s really all I want to say  This was a phenomenal book that I wish I could thoroughly hate  but I can t  To fill a reader with such emotion takes a great author when an eye for detail  This book makes you want to cry or chuck the book across the room  It makes you want to jump inside and give every single one of those weirdos a piece of your mind  It also requires a little meta thinking  realizing that no one else in the book knows what you and the Giver know  It s crazy amazing and I love hate it I would definitely recommend it to everyone except for those that don t deal well with things like wrongful  release   This book might originally feel like it is meant for tween audiences but I would not give it to my nine year old little cousin to read  There are some things that they might not understand at first  but once they do they are kind of scarred for life  They re not yet ready for this kind of awesome horror Warnings Murder  Jonas  world is perfect  Everyone in the community has equal oportunities and no one has to make any choices because everything is decided for them  When Jonas becomes a twelve he is selected as reciver of memory  As the new reciver it is his job to keep the memories of what life was like before sameness  Soon  when Jonas finds out that Gabe  a baby that comes to stay with Jonas  family  is going to be released he must think of a plan to save him  In the book The Giver the founders of the community don t want citizens to feel pain  so they take it away  However  without pain one can t know what happiness feels like  Everyone in the community may think that they are happy but they are really just content  When Jonas is selected as reciver of memory he realizes that there is a completely different world that no one in the community will get to experience  He wants to share this world with others and he thinks that it is unfair that the community has done this  Jonas resolves the situation for himself by running away and eventually find this new world called Elsewhere  I would recommend this book to high schoolers because I think that there are some deep concepts that require greater knowing of how the world works  I think that reading the book and understanding the book are two different things  For example  a third grader could read this book  but a high schooler would be able to understand and analyze the concepts of justice and fairness  Before I read the other books in the series  I wanted to reread the original classic  The first time I read it I was in fifth grade and I absolutely loved it  Still do  It s simple prose  nuanced meanings and compelling narrative all make it a fantastic read  Jonas is a great character and I love watching him discover the truthful pain and beauty of the world  I love how brave he is at the end of the novel  risking his life to save the baby Gabe and embark into the unknown  Love love love  Read it if you haven t  Sameness was never a concept that crossed my mind  but that was before this book  After finishing the book  it left me a feeling of emptiness  like I desperately needed to know what happened to Jonas  but in the last sentences of the books  Lowry leaves us an insight of the future of the characters and the society that Jonas has left behind  This review was originally posted on Caity Reads I absolutely love Lois Lowry s writing in this novel  It s a beautifully crafted story that has stuck with me in the days since I ve read it  And we all know those are the best kind of books  To be honest  this book is rather heartbreaking  But it s also very touching in the fact that a twelve year old boy made a gigantic sacrifice for the good of his people and to save another boy who had no chance  I loved the main character Jonas  from start to end  The world that Jonas lives in comes off as a utopia  at first  There is no unemployment  no war  no pain  But then comes the realization that they also have no choice  no freedom  no love  They do not choose their own occupation  their spouse  they do not have their own children Can you imagine a world in which you could not control your own life  Make choices for yourself and what you wanted  That is the world that Jonas lives in  It brings forth a question that I think is very important  Would you be willing to sacrifice those things for utopia  Because I know I would not  I will definitely need to reread this soon  I believe it s one of those books that you will learn more from the more you read it  The world building was great  the characters were awesome and fit their roles nicely  this novel was just great Overall  I would definitely recommend this  It s a novel about growing up and realizing that the world is not perfect and that even in a world that is supposedly perfect  things are wrong  It is definitely an emotional read and will leave you thinking about the events that take place  The book is  awe full   Read again after a 16 year gap  I cannot recommend this book more highly  Others can tell you what is about  but I can only tell you that you need to  feel  this book as you read  Do not be distracted from the meanings of everything  Long before there were other dystopian novels  and there are some great ones  this one was just terrific  Enjoy it in nature with all the colors of the world present  Read it with a loved one or your favorite animal friend  You will not regret a moment of this read  Savor it  Another book that was handed to me by my 11 year old son  with a  wow  you have to read this   I m so glad I did   what an amazing amount of thought provoking  innovative storytelling is packed into a short and easy to read book  The world created in The Giver is a futuristic possible  and has set my son now to reading everything  dystopian  that he can get his hands on  The Giver s societal structure is frightening  but not at all implausible  which is probably the definition of good dystopian literature   There s also a lot to be said in here about the roles of children and adolescents   what they re capable of  and what should be expected of them  It was an eye opener for both of us   I love this book  It s about an attempt to make a perfect world after mass wars  But we all know that there is no such thing as PERFECT  The main character Jonas decides to think for himself after being named as the successor for the keeper of memories  The things that are transferred to his mind help to set in motion a series of events that will change everyone s lives  But will it be for the better  This is a good example of the butterfly effect  I ve been wanting to read this book for years  Somehow I missed it in my public education days and never knew when I was going to get around to it  so  thank you Sis  Soper  for facilitating the reading of this glorious little book The Giver  as most people know  is about a utopian community in the future where all pain and differences have been removed  Life is so tightly structured that deviation does not occur to anyone  Twelve year old Jonas begins to learn of the diversity of mankind s past and has to make a choice about which world he wants to live in  the safe but sterile community or the vibrant yet painful beyond I love the supernatural conventions of the book  the way memories are physically transmitted and able to be experienced  the literal way Jonas is able to see the world with new vision  the presence of magical qualities despite the practical environment  The idea of  magic  or  supernatural  is not overplayed or discussed  and I like that  It makes the magic seems like the true reality  and it is up to each individual to choose to see it or not Choice is a great theme here  and also the duality of happiness and pain  that one only exists with the other  and that individuality and unpredictability are virtues of variety and the human spirit The book is different than I thought it would be  I expect neither the robotic world that the book opens with  lifeless and monochrome  nor the method of Jonas s learning  nor the the weakness of his teacher  The book was much simpler than I expected One thing that might make some kids uncomfortable are periodic discussions and depictions of death  and an early reference to sexuality  But  obviously  the uncomfortable nature of these topics make them valuable  and I think any kid age 10 and up should not be begrudged this book  The final scene is perfect  The Giver is a book that captured my interest after reading just a few chapters  The cover or summary does not do the book justice  It is rather plain  which gave me the impression that it would not be interesting  low and behold was I wrong  Judging the book by its cover was the wrong way to go  this book caught my attention and will forever be one of my favorites  Jonas  the main character was a curious boy  who was not satisfied with what seemed to be an ordinary life  In the beginning of the book  readers are introduced to how children in this community grow up  their privileges  and the ceremonies that occur as they become older  Jonas  biggest ceremony which would give him his assignment for the rest of his life was the main focus  His job as  the receiver  was not an assignment  but a job that he was specifically selected to do  This was most important job in all of his community  His training with the giver and flashback to memories left untold were what captured my liking  I sat down to read thinking I would only read a few chapters  I ended up finishing the book the same day in two sittings  The colorful passages and thorough descriptions made it hard to put the book down  As Jonas began to unravel what his life really meant  I became invested in his  story   He soon realized after many training sessions that his life was just a set plan of events  never changing  He was not satisfied or happy with this  determined to be different and change his future  he set out to save himself from his current life  He brought along Gabriel who happened to be a baby who his parents were caretakers of  He brought him because Gabriel was headed for  release  which is a cruel concept  euthanasia  Jonas had previously not known what  release  meant  but the second he found out  his morals and opinions drastically changed  I loved reading about him standing up for what is right and searching for love true happiness  His mission was to find a life greater than his current one  a future worth living full of love and feelings which he had never known  I give this book five stars because it is truly a  heart grabber  and a touching book  It is fiction  but the story is so applicable to real life in that we all want joy and happiness  we all want to love and be loved  This book is good for people of all ages  I cannot wait to have my future English middle school students read this literature  It was so enjoyable to read  that I intend to finish the other three books in the series that were written after this one   Although I have finished this book few weeks ago  I dream about the world every day that takes place in the book The Giver  This book is good for casual reading  It has an interesting story theme and does not require high English vocabularies  The World that takes place in this book has lost their memories  But  everything is perfect  Committee of the Elders  the governors of this world govern their nation like European Socialists  All people who are capable of having families deserve to be a family member  There are no acceptations  Not intelligent enough children gets killed  not intelligent enough adults get set to labor camps  Only 50 kids are reproduced each year  One day  a father chooses to bring a female infant home when he already has 4 family members and the regulation says maximum of the numbers of people per is 4  Also  a teenager named Jonas becomes the most important person of the country  He becomes the one who gets to get the lost memories back from someone  When the community rules mention not to lie  But one day as Lois Lowry writes        all been instructed  You may lie      95   the only person who has the right to lie  The memories may be exposes or falsely exposed or  not mentioned in public  Read the book to find out how Jonas acts as the receiver of the memory  Wow  I  Don t  Even  Know  What  To  Say  It s clear that this book was written for young adults  and probably young adults from a few generations from before my time  Despite the simplicity  there s quite a deep message throughout the entire book  For those with a dystopian fetish  you will find yourself enthralled in Lois Lowry s ability to create a dystopian world without borrowing ideas from other written dystopias  I find Lowry s dystopia to be closer to reality  despite the main characters gift   thanks to the complete lack of respect to human life and the connections people make with bonding relationships  Instead  babies find themselves having to meet requirements in order to live  You are forced to speak about your feelings  and if you begin to feel love    you take a pill  While parents care for children  they are not their own children  nor are the parents completely connected with them  Children are merely beings whom need feeding  clothed and teachings on the way of life  Feeling is absent The boy s gift is a fresh twist  for me  in which dystopia is mixed with magical sci fi  A great way to weave in two genre interests in one book I definitely recommend this to anybody   I ve just finished The Giver and I loved it  I m pretty excited to complete the whole series Although it s utopian  I m just going to enlist this book in my   post apocalyptic dystopian shelf  Because this is not actually sci fi either  The world is perfect  No war  no hunger  no unemployment  no crimes  The world is peaceful and everyone s life cycle is tied in a set of rule  Nobody is allowed to feel the deeper and purest emotions and everything is controlled and watched where nobody complaints  But Jonas is different  He had always sensed he was different  he could see which his friends could not  In a world of sameness he started to see colors  Jonas gets selected to become the receiver of his community and learns their past though the Giver s memories  fells the emotions from which their leaders are protecting them This is such a great book  The relationship between the Giver and Jonas was really touching  Jonas decides to go to Elsewhere to set the memories free  his people to feel the emotions and colors of life                                                     I will finish the series and write a combined review of the series in The Giver Quartet book  This book really left me thinking and happy that our life s aren t restricted like the life s in this book  It s great that people really are happy and don t know about hurting  love and sadness but that s what makes us human  I am happy that Jonas decides that what the community is restricting isn t the right way to leave  He has amazing courage to go against everything he knows to try to make a difference  I like being able to have freedom to choose to love  to think and see vivid colors  It is sad that there are Countries out there that restrict births  rights and freedom  This book has similarities like Divergent  So if you love books that keep you thinking and challenge you then this is the book for you  Can t wait to go see this movie this coming weekend  Thanks Lois for making a book that has many controversies  Not too many people cross those boundaries  I highly recommend you read this book   I couldn t put this book down  I thought it was a great story  although it really disturbed me  When Jonas watched his father  release  the twin  I felt sick  I really don t think this book should be directed toward younger kids    The Giver  by Lois Lowry is a very interesting fiction novel  Lois Lowry communicates to the reader about how feelings can impact your life greatly  In the novel  Jonas  the main character  lives in this  perfect world  where there is no conflict  no real feelings  and no pain  There is so much about the town they live in that would make you think  How can these people live like this  However  the people of this town never wonder why their life is so strange because to them it is normal    except Jonas  When Jonas is assigned a very important job  The Giver becomes his trainer  Jonas begins to learn what feelings are  pain  warmth  happiness  sadness  and love  After about a year of training  Jonas begins to start questioning the life he lives in  and he wants to change it  When he makes this decision  The Giver and Jonas come up with a plan that will change Jonas s life forever  In my opinion  this book was very interesting and made me want to keep reading  especially towards the end    The book just keeps getting better as you read and I am excited to read Lowry s next 3 books as well  A very short book  I finished it in just over two hours today but it was efficient and not a page was wasted  I first read the book in 6th grade so that was quite a long time ago and had forgotten almost everything except the ending As I read through it again  I was astonished at how effective Lowry used the literary tools to tell such a complex story in such a simple way  The vocabulary isn t extensive but it works  The dialogue isn t perfect but it works  The characters are a bit simple but that works to the novel s advantage because it puts more emphasis on the story and moral dilemmas that are brought up I certainly recommend this to anyone and everyone  It s simple  quick  enjoyable and thought provoking  I ll be starting the sequel tomorrow and am very exciting to see where it goes  The ending of the first book is enough for book clubs  friends and families to discuss for a very long time KCCO  The Giver  is about a boy named Jonas who lives in a perfect world  Everyone doesn t lie  feel fear  or pain and everything is controlled  even the jobs are chosen  When Jason turns twelve  he is chosen be The Receiver and gain memories and training from The Giver  The Giver holds memories from the real world and Jones has trouble comprehending the truth  I gave this book four stars  because I enjoyed everything about it besides the ending  To start  I liked how in the beginning  Jonas praises his utopian society and then  he does not like how perfect everything is after gaining memories from The Giver  It was interesting to read about his experience and his confusion  Also  when The Giver gives Jonas the memories of fear  pain  and war  I liked how it made me think  You can t have love without pain  that s why there is no love or pain in the society  since no one has any choices or opinions and everything is controlled  I liked how this made me contemplate   Would a perfect world life be a good one  Lastly  I enjoyed reading the details in the book  I thought that all the details were purposeful and very well written  The only thing I didn t enjoy as much was the ending  I didn t feel like it gave me the closure that I wanted  In conclusion  I would recommend the book   The Giver   although the ending is a little disappointing  Jonas lives in a perfect world  there is no war and everything is under control but when jonas turns twelve he is selected to be the next Receiver of Memory  The former Receiver of memory will teach Jonas everything he needs to know about being a receiver  but can Jonas do this task  I think this book was amazing I definitely think that you should read this book if you haven t already   I was never asked to read this book at a young age and I guess I m a little glad about that because I probably wouldn t have appreciated how well written this book truly is  Love it  WHY HAD I NOT READ THIS BEFORE NOW   Oh  right  The cruddy description   cover  I m glad that I read this as an adult and not in my youth  though  I wouldn t have been able to fully appreciate the depth and gravity of it  Towards the end of the book  despite not being able to put the book down  I found myself stopping at the ends of chapters and thinking for several minutes  Thoughts like  But that would mean     GASP  But then    Can I even imagine      I haven t read a book like this in a while that made me think of the concepts of that kind of reality  and picturing life as those people  beyond what the writer tells you  There were many jaw dropping moments  I can t wait to read some discussion questions on this astounding book  I have always loved this story  Now I ve just had a chance to share it with my daughter who is almost eleven  This was her first experience with a story of utopian society  It s easy to forget how the innocent look on the world when they read or hear a story like this  The whole breakdown of the image of a perfect society is flawlessly crafted  My daughter couldn t sleep after the release of the newchild  so we went ahead and finished the book  It was such a joy to hear her identify the scenes so artfully described  Now I remember why I loved this book so much  The last scene is wonderfully open ended  and the whole book makes for wonderful discussion topics  I would say this is a must have for any collection  The Giver was about a boy named Jonas who lives in what he thinks is a perfect world  Once he turns twelve he gets chosen as the receiver of memories  meaning he holds all the memories of the past lives  Imagine holding all the memories of past lives  good and bad and being able to experience them  even memories of pain  Through these memories  he learns the dark secrets of his perfect world  I would recommend this book to anybody who likes science fiction  This book is part of a series so I will continue to read the series  You will probably be up all night reading The Giver  This book was very enjoyable  It was interesting and fast paced  I liked how the author developed the characters and the relationship between the Giver and Jonas  I like how it questioned the way of life we usually take for granted and mixed it up  making it a compelling story This is the story of the close relationship between Jonas  a young boy and an elderly man known as the Receiver of Memory  It takes place in a time where there are no conflicts of any kind in their world  no poverty  no wars  no problems  no lies  no emotional drama  etc  All needs are taken care of and no one questions anything  Jonas lives with his parents and younger sister  As he approaches the age of 12  Jonas begins to wonder about his assignment in life  This assignment is chosen for all 12 year olds by a council of people who have been watching the children  learning about what they do best and enjoy best  Jonas is give the esteemed assignment of Receiver in Training  He is to go under the tutelage of the current Receiver  known as the Giver  They develop a very close relationship  The Giver allows Jonas to have some of his memories  which include memories of many past Receivers so Jonas experiences love  happiness  conflict  and pain  He questions why these memories are not shared with the community and together they come up with a plan to change the way things are  But Jonas changed his part in the plans when he learns that Gabriel  a baby boy he had come to love  was going to be  released   or euthanized  the next day  Jonas takes Gabriel and they flee the community to go Elsewhere  where they can start anew   This book was absolutely fantastic  I never read it as a schoolkid  when most of my peers probably read it for the first time  but I am actually glad I read it first as an adult because there are themes in it I don t think I would have comprehended as fully as a child  It is definitely a book everyone should read  The movie based on it that just recently came out   meh      It was good on its own  but it was  definitely  an adaptation  The very best part about the movie  for me  was Jeff Bridges  performance  I think learning that he had been rooting for this movie to be made for so long probably helped to fuel his passion  I m sure there were more motivating factors for him  but to know how passionate he was about the book and bringing it to the screen also got me through the parts of the movie that were really inaccurate to the book  Some aspects were spot on   but there were just so many inconsistencies  It drove me nuts   FYI  the second thing I really liked about this movie were the locations  filters  angles  and just generally how the movie was filmed  Most of the other aspects  I found pretty sub par  though the acting was pretty great  too  Anyway  when it comes to the book  it begs to be read  and everyone who hears it should answer the call  Just don t have high expectations about the consistency and similarity of the movie  The Giver is about a young boy name Jonas who  when he turns twelve at the ceremony of twelve  is given the greatest honor in the community  being the Receiver of Memory  He was chosen to be the Receiver is because he has light blue eyes like that of the giver and those with light blue eyes have the ability to give and receive memories  Being the receiver has only 8 rules  1  Go straight to the annex after school  2  Go to your dwelling immediately after conclusion of your training  3  From this moment  your excused from any rules governing rudeness  4  Don t discuss your training with any members of the community  including your parents and elders  5  From this moment  you are prohibited from dream telling  6  Except for illnesses unrelated to your training  don t apply for medication  7  You are prohibited to apply for release  and 8  You may lie  These rules govern how Jonas lives his daily life from that point forward but as he s doing this  he also learns of the secrets of the community and why it is the was it is Who might be interested in this book are people who like science fiction books and a dystopian society type books or community in this case  The reason being is that because in this book no one can see color or feel true pain  there is no hunger  war  sex  music or love because the Elders took it all away a long time ago but Jonas  the Receiver of Memory  and the Giver know of all of these experiences  My overall satisfaction of this book is that I really loved it  I am a person who like science fiction books as well as dystopian societies as seeing that I have read the hunger games  Also  I really like the character development of Jonas  he was one day a regular citizen of the community and now he s the Receiver of Memory experiencing things that no one has ever experienced before except the Giver  Also when he learns of love  he starts to realize that he has feelings for this girl named Fionna  but she doesn t feel the same way because she can t  I also found that interesting  Funny how I got hooked on this book   a girl I tutor privately had to read it in English class and told me what the first few chapters were about  I was so intrigued that I picked it up at Kobo and started reading it  finding an audiobook version somewhere along the way so I could keep  reading  while walking to work  It s not as hip as some other dystopian YA books out there  but it s very  very cool  I can t wait to read the rest of the quartet  If you like mysterious books with strong characters and plot twists  pick this one up ASAP  I read this book as a kid in sixth grade for school  They could never make this book into a good movie  so I hope no one ever tries I like the story of a sheltered society with kids taking drugs to avoid emotions  very relevant in my eyes  Breaking free can be hard   I really enjoyed The Giver by Lois Lowry  I feel like every child will probably be eventually forced to read this book someday in school  that s how I had to  I love the theme of this book I feel one of the main reasons that every kid is forced to read the book is that because of the message that it gives to kids is that  one being able to see color is good  and being different is great  The giver is the four book series  the next two books are about other kids from other communities who have the same ability as Jonas  And the last one Son is about Gabe when he is older who was the child that Jonas met and rescued because he had the same ability as Jonas and in this one Gabe meets his mother  Would I read the other books in the series yes  yes I would and I would recommend this book to other people  So I gave it 5 out of 5 stars because this book is really good and it is a very easy read     It s the choosing that s important  isn t it   If there is one book I wish everyone could read at least once in their lives  undoubtedly  without a second thought  it would be this one  Lois Lowry constructs a story that is so haunting and thought provoking and unlike anything I have ever read before  While this may be a story about a fictional utopian society  the similarities between the world Lowry has created and the world we live in now are almost all too similar for comfort The story is centered around a futuristic society where there is no pain  no war  and no fear  It s a society where everyone is the same  where equality is cherished  Life is perfect  When they turn twelve  each member of the Community receives their job for contributing to the Community  The Giver follows Jonas  who is almost twelve and about to receive his job assignment  Little does he know how the job he will be chosen for and the tasks associated with it will change his life forever Lowry s characterization is superb  While the government has tried their best to make every citizen the same  it s these small differences that make them stand out in such a monotone society  From Jonas  curiosity and love of the truth  to his hilarious best friend Asher  to the nuturing Fiona   each of these characters hold a special place in my heart The best part of The Giver is how highly thought provoking it is  What would it be like if we were all the same  without anything to make us unique  Lowry makes us truly realize the wonderfulness of our unique talents and gifts  and demonstrates that we should embrace them with all our power and not let them go to waste With its brilliant and thought provoking storyline and ending  Lowry has created a tale that is a must read for everyone  The story will linger in your head for days   even weeks   and Jonas  the Giver  and Gabe are characters you will never forget   For the first time  he heard something that he knew to be music  He heard people singing  Behind him  across vast distances of space and time  from the place he had left  he thought he heard music too  But perhaps  it was only an echo    I thought it was a well written well thought out book  It interested me and compelled me to read more  Although i had read this before  the second time through I saw more ideas that i hadn t seen before  I liked the end it was well thought out  The book doesn t answer all your questions but it is a very good read  I like the main character he is a dynamic character  I hope that every person who sees this review will read the The Giver and enjoy just as much as i did  The title actually corresponds with the book and you learn very early what it mean  Some books at the end is when you figure out what it means which i don t like nice to have a switch up  Overall its a very  goodread  and i put my stamp of approval on it  The Giver is probably one of the best books I have ever read  Jonas  the main character is part of  The Community  along with his family  And  The Community  is really a  perfect world  so to speak  a Utopia  where everything is monitored and there are standards for everything to keep the sense of perfection in the community  A conflict that occurs in the book is that Jonas notices that things are sort of changing for him  and hes not sure whats changing but he notices it and he want to find out more  He later founds out that he starts to see color and finds out about the vibrant world of many colors in the world  This book is an absolute master piece I love every page of it and just the plot of being in a  perfect world  should make you want to read it and that way you could see all the imperfections of being perfect   Jonas  life changes when he begins his twelfth year  when he is 13 years old  Jonas lives in a society without pain  lies  some would say that the society is Utopian  great  honest  However  Jonas begins to learn the truth when he begins to meet with the Giver  or the old Receiver  Jonas begins receiving memories of the time before  filled with color  light  joy  pain  and everything we may experience now  Jonas finds life in society more difficult to live in with this knowledge  but what can he do about it  I absolutely love this book  it is one of my favorites  It sometimes seems as though life can be overwhelming  but the emotions we have  the experiences we have  are such blessings  really Lois Lowry does an amazing job creating this society  and showing the beauty of the world we have and live in now  WARNINGS  Slight violence  The Giver  is the story of Jonas  a 12 year old boy who lives in a perfect world where there is no war  pain or hunger  in this perfect world  everyone lives are planned from the minute they are born until it is their time to died  Jonas s view of his world is changed dramatically when he is chosen to be the receiver of memory under the tutelage of The Giver  who Jonas will eventually become  The Giver shows Jonas that the world he lives in is not what it seems and Jonas must find the courage to go what is right and he does  The Giver  is a book that I have always wanted to read and I am pleased I read it  Jonas is a well written character and I enjoyed experiencing the changes he goes through as the world he knew changes and he begins to see the world differently  The Giver is also a interesting character  he carries the memories of the past  a past that helps decide the future  I enjoyed  The Giver  and I am looking forward to reading the next instalment  Gathering Blue   My favorite book My favorite book I ve read this so many times  it is one of my favorites  there so much imagery and has a cliff hanger ending  I think this book was actually one of the best books i ever read   I read it once already when i was in sixth grade but reading it again gave me a chance to reexperience Jonas situation and to understand more the book and find more details that explain some questions that i had when i had read it the first time   What i mostly like about this book is its ambigious ending You dont exactly know if Jonas and Gabe lived or died so it kind of gives you a choice to choose the ending you want  I also enjoyed how at first i didnt really know what was going on with the plot and the characters since they were all in a controlled enviornment with no poverty   hunger   sadness and etc So it made me want to keep on and on reading so i could understand what was going on  I find it amusing how at first it sounds like the community Jonas is in is perfect and that everybody would love to live there but actually you are sacrificing the whole point of being human  Its like you are giving away your humanity just to have a safe life   No more hunger   pain   feelings   color or memories I agree with Jonas that it wasnt worth it giving up all of those experiences just for a safe life   what would the purpose of life would be then  The Giver was a book that had compleatly oblivorated all world injustices  The world was perfect  no one was ever killed  nor was anybody loved  They tried to create a utopia or so that may be  A young boy named Jonas had a perfect world until he was twelve  He was given a job that would change his prespective compleatly  Jonas will recive a job where he will learn the meaning of pain love and guilt  The biggest injustice in the Giver was the concept of release  It happens when the elderly get to old people moved there by accident  and to he smaller twin  Those people have to apply for release or it just comes After they apply for release they are injected with a liquid  Slowly  the injection will get to their nervous system and they will die  When young Jonas found out he was asstonished  The injusice of release was probably not resolved because of the fact they didnt know they were killing the people The situation affected Jonas because he now has feelings and he wants to stop it and save his little friend  I recomend the book to people who want a utopia  People who want a utopia can the up sides and the down sides of a utopia for example  They will learn the concequences of no choice the and the up sides to havinhg no choice  Another reason i recomend this bookto those people is because the book the giver is all about life leasons  For example it teaches about  pain freedom of choice and  predujust that a utopia is said to get rid of  I m an idiot for not wanting to read this book for so many years  Word of advice  read the first book in a series before reading the second  because they never  ever make sense  I blame my teachers for making me not want to read this book  Ever I may have to give Gathering Blue another chance   Absolute love for this book  I wish I d read it earlier  100  recommend  I read this book at school for my english class  In fact I was in an advanced course at the time so I was actually really young  around 11 years old  if I remmber properly  and I must say it blew me away  It challenged my way of thinking  it challenged my reality and it absolutelly tought me a concept I a  at that age  had never fully understood  perfection is not the absence of error and differnce but in fact is the strength of choice  of uniqueness  it showed me the importnace of having your own voice and your own mind and how we should always thrive to get out of the shadows  A decade and some has passed since my first encounter with The Giver  and know I can actually start seeing the actual inpact it had in my life  I d say I have to thank my teacher at the time for showing me this book and challenging me to think not just blandly accept my world but challenge and accept challenges back  I read here that some believe this book doesn t say anuthing new or have a wow momment  yet I believe that it is a book from which you never stop learning from  Everytime I read this book at different stages of my life I see new things  I ground myself more in the fact that life is beatiful I it never stops to amze me  I believe that every child should read this book  but not just yes read it kind of deal  it is a book that must be broken down to its essence and thatit must promote thought    I guess I am lucky for my love words  in fact I love them so much that I learned various languages  including english  in order to actually hear the voice behind the writting  This book was one of the first where I actually heard a voice not just read some words  The novel The Giver that was writing by Louis Lowry is know in countries such as Canada United States and Australia  Its been criticized many times for the because of things it explains In the book  Many may interpret different the symbols and the message the book is trying to send  In the giver they live in a society with no love   color or pain  and when Jonas is shown all these different types of feelings his mind is completely changed  These different thing that may b though as bad or never seen as something important is a message showing that these thing should be more appreciated by people who have it    One of the first signs that Jonas was going to became the next receiver of message was that he could see color little by little  The first time he was known to see color was in Fionas hair  Every time he saw her hair he wanted to see more because he liked that feeling of seeing colors  This shows that we see color and it is was makes things different and makes humans like them more  When Jonas saw the different colors when the giver showed him he realized the things he saw on Fionas hair and he loved it  He also realized that it was unfair that everyone could only see black and white and couldn t appreciate the colors   Another thing that is stopped in the in the community is feelings for other people  Even when people are getting married they don t choose their own wives and husbands  The elder decide who they will marry by the similar personality traits  They never fall in love and when they start to get feelings or felling that get when puberty is reach they take a pill so they wont feel it no more  They also take pills so they don t feel pain  This shows that they cant fall in love and they don t have any other type of feeling either good or bad  They are considered neutral feelings but they are better to have bad so good ca be appreciated  Also they are not like other humans that can fall in love and have feeling for others   Another quality that the community doesn t have that makes them different from humans is individuality  Including the fact that no one in the community except the receiver of message is able to feel love pain and see color  no one is different except jobs and gender  They don t get to pick their jobs and they all start at the same age  They have to all dress the same and eat the same things  They also live in the same house and have the same amount kids and future all end up the same  The message in this is that human individuality is what makes every one unique and what makes each other interesting   In conclusion the book The Giver is a great story but the society they live in is not what I would like to live in  The fact that they don t have pain is good but with no pain the good feelings wont be appreciated  but they also don t get the best feelings  The also don t get to make many choices themselves like jobs and who they want to marry Their world is very limited and they don t get to do things at their own times everything has to be done the same from as everyone else   Amazing  So provocative  Another world  bizarre  A quick read and worth every minute   You don t really know what s coming your way but you know that it is interesting  I can t wait to read about Jonas s celebration of the 12 s   The topic of this book at first may sound chessy  But it really touches me as I read further and further  When I read the last chapter  I was so attached to the main characters    It s so touching   The GiverLois LowryThe Giver is a children s novel by Lois Lowry  It is set in a society that is at first presented as a utopian society and gradually appears more and more dystopian  The novel follows a boy named Jonas through the twelfth year of his life  The Giver is a book that takes the reader into a world that has no fear  pain  snow  sunshine  music and colour  Jonas  who is the main character  is selected at the age of 12 to be the new receiver of memories  The receiver of memories is the only person in the community who can feel pain and fear  the only person who knows of snow  the only person who can listen to music and the only person who can see colour  The Giver  who is the old receiver of memories  transfers important memories to Jonas  Some of the memories are cheerful and some are painful but Jonas has to feel the pain  Jonas  father works as a nurturer  and they take care of the newborns and decide if the newborns should go into a new family  In the community if somebody gets released that means that you are going to die  Jonas  father releases newborn if they are not up to standards  Old people get released when they get really old and they are useless to the community  When the book ends with Jonas  and Gabriel sledding down a snowy mountain  you want to know what happens next and I think Lois Lowry made that ending to start a series of books  The book was leading up to a plan  and the plan occurred in the last five chapters  Lois Lowry made a mistake  instead of ending the book off there he should have proceeded further on in the book because the climax of the book was the last five chapters  Instead Lois Lowry should have told us what happened to Jonas  family after The Givers plan  That would have made the reader want to know what happens to Jonas even more  The thing that makes this book fabulous is that the book was published in 1993 and Lois Lowry wrote things that people today could not write  and that is outstanding to me  I think everyone who reads this book would want more in the end  before the climax  most of the things Lois Lowry wrote was not important to the reader  I want to read the second book because there was not enough to read in the first book  but for the second book Lois Lowry probably did the same thing  In this book  I see the realization that people s lives are very different from what you perceive as a child  and that it s going to happen to you  too  That those who were the center of your world not so long ago  family and childhood friends  may drift away and become distant as you make your way through adulthood and form new unexpected and vitally important relationships that overturn the world you are used to  There isn t much characterization  so I didn t form an emotional connection with any of the characters  not even with Jonas or the Giver  two central characters   Asher and Fiona  particularly Fiona  are introduced such that you assume they will play greater roles in the book than they do  I don t feel like I knew Mom or Dad or Lily at all  While the lack of an emotional bond with these lesser characters may be due to the nature of their community  Jonas and the Giver should really be more sympathetic  in my opinion  The description of the community itself is sparse  There is so much more that could ve been described about this  utopian  community  I feel like Jonas  selection  his revelation about Release  and his eventual choice could ve been built up and framed better  I feel like I got the quick version  While I appreciate it s overall message about the importance of individual differences  human emotion  etc   I felt like the book was a bit heavy handed with its moral  Jonas  initial support of his community and gradual change of heart seems intended to present both viewpoints  but doesn t succeed in my opinion  The book s agenda was clear to me from the beginning  It also doesn t present alternative possibilities  such as a world without Sameness but also without war  a world without Release but also without starvation  etc   the choice is either here  with Sameness and no colour  or Elsewhere  with pain and suffering  In overall  I feel the book could have used many more things  But it was good for an introduction to a new series of books  I would rate this book 8 10 for children because it also contained ideas that children should learn  But on the other hand the book lacked many thing for young adults  I really enjoyed reading the giver because it was simplistic in the plot line and it was easy to read yet its words were very meaningful  I would recommend to anyone about 4th grade and up for much of the same reasons   I also liked the book because it made me think about things I usually just take for granted  Take color for example  All the people in Jonah s community except for Jonah and The Giver and possibly Gabriel didn t even know that they couldn t see color  one of the things I love most about our world  I don t think I could ever be happy living in a place where all the beauties of life have been taken away from me  the only problem being I wouldn t even know they ever existed   I think the author write this book to show people the need for individuality to live a full life  She shows us that pain is necessary in order for happiness  If you take out all the emotion  you may be sparing people from sadness  but they will also never be able to experience love  Lowry shows us that we cannot always blindly follow society but that we should try to change it   Some foreshadowing is used when Jonah sees the apple  change  and you can begin to assume that there is something different about him    a boy named Jonas is about to learn about what his community really is made of he sees is what nobody exept what the job holders know  and they don t even know what there doing is wrong  His world is perfect until the day he recieves his duties as reciever of memory and is shocked by what he can now do which nobody else can as far as he knew until he saw a release preformed by his father  He understands true pain that no one else could ever imagine or think about  He felt true emotions and realized he and the GIver were the only ones that could feel anything  In the Giver the main injustice is them not bieng able to know anything exept whats going on around them  The Giver and Jonas are the only people who know about the past  They are forced to feel the pain and sorrow of the entire community  The situation was rezolved by Jonas leaving and forcing the memories back on the community  He suffered pain through his journey  but he found a community and saved Gabe  Jonas felt sorry that nobody knew the truth or history of the world exept him and the Giver  The community i assume colapsed under there own ignorance  I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone  It suites all ages with little violence and overall is a amazing book in mine and many peoples opinions  I think it has a great plot and storyline that a easy to follow  I love this book and i hope everbody gets a chance to read it  I personaly want everybody to read it along with everybody who reads this review   Finally  after 2 1 2 years  my book club has finally gotten to my pick     I ve been wanting to read this one for years  so it was an easy choice when it came time to make our book club selections  But more than that  this book is full of ideas ripe for discussion  and it s short  so it s easy to stick with to the end  Clearly I win at picking books    This book  It definitely gave me the feels  which sadly most of the characters in it could never understand  It s hard to imagine a world where the word love is ambiguous and meaningless  A world where all you can see is shades of grey instead of color  A world were you can hear  but have never heard a note of music  And yet we are slowly introduced to such a world through Jonas  eyes  At some point in the distant past  the society that Jonas lives in made a choice  it s better to be safe than to be free  It s better to be without choice than to choose wrong  It s better to live a tranquil  expected life than have to go through pain and loss  But when freedom and joy was taken away  the people were essentially neutered of all their emotions  I m not sure if it s something that was done surgically or chemically  or if it s something that evolved over time  but at some point  people became content with being assigned a job  a spouse  kids  They let go of control over their own lives  They became ok with euthanasia for the elderly  even if they re healthy  and ok with killing babies that don t fit into their parameters of  normal  The role of the Receiver is a really interesting one  At some point  the people figured out there was no way to maintain the  sameness  they desired for their world if people could remember things like joy and pain  beauty and sorrow  Somehow  though the process eludes me  they were able to pull the memories from people and give them to one person  who became the holder of the memories  This person was destined to live a lonely existence  unable to share his emotions with those around him  because they had no capacity for them  Once the memories were pulled  they were passed down through the generations  Every Receiver eventually became a Giver  passing the memories onto another generation of caretaker  These people were given a vaulted status in the community  but for that  the price they paid was heavy  to carry the burden of the years past  and to be there to advice the community council when something happened they didn t expect Through the sharing of memories and their long conversations  Jonas and the Giver discuss many things  but one of the most important seems to be the fairness of the whole system  Why should one person be responsible for holding all that pain and sorrow  Jonas knows that war exists  and so when he sees his friends playing war games  he wants them to stop because war is serious business  Unfortunately  he has no way of explaining that to them  because their brains would not be able to comprehend those concepts  But it s not just the bad memories that Jonas wants to share  he also things everyone should get to share in the good memories  To see the blue sky  green fields  red apples  to feel the exhilaration of speeding down a snowy hill  to feel the thrill of love and desire  When he passes on happy memories to Gabriel  Jonas gets a taste of what it s like to help someone else  and what it could be like if everyone felt as deeply as he does There are several things that bring Jonas and the Giver to their breaking points  Rosemary  the previous receiver  had a huge effect on how the Giver approached giving memories to Jonas  and though she is gone  the pain of her loss really transformed his view of the world  view spoiler   especially when we found out that she was his daughter  hide spoiler    For as much as Jonas was learning through the memories  I think his heart truly broke for the first time when he realized that his father had been lying to him his whole life  In many ways  when he became 12  Jonas became an adult  but the one vestige of childhood that he clung to the longest was his belief in the innocence of the Release  He truly believed that when one was released  they were sent to another community to live  When he finally saw the video of his father killing the spare twin  Jonas was horrified and broken  And to know that every other adult knows the truth and simply accepts it  to know that sweet  tender Fiona knows the truth and doesn t care  is just shocking to Jonas  They eventually come to realize that living any longer in such a community is impossible  but the only way to break the cycle of sameness was for  view spoiler  Jonas to leave  and for the Giver to help the community through the transition back into remembrance  This is what would have happened regardless  but when Jonas realized that Gabriel was going to be  released  because he couldn t sleep through the night alone  when he realized that his sweet voiced  teasing father was going to calming kill the toddler he d spent the last year and a half caring for  Jonas couldn t do it any more  He had to take Gabriel  and leave right then  Because to Jonas  the possible destruction of the community was worth the risk to save the life of a giggling little boy who didn t deserve to die   hide spoiler  The thing that confuses me the most in this book is actually the whole process of the memory transfers  How were the memories taken in the first place  How is it that they are  set loose  when the one holding them dies or moves out of the community  Maybe I am trying to be too sciencey when it is all conceptual  but I really am curious The last thing I have to mention is the ending   view spoiler  The first time I read it  I ll admit it  I said   Huh  Did they just die  What just happened   So I re read it  a few times  because it s definitely an ambiguous ending  On the  THEY RE DEAD   side  you have the strangeness of the situation  Just as Jonas and Gabriel are at the point of near death  they reach the top of the hill that looks suspiciously like the hill from his memory  and there is a sled that is just like the sled from his memory  and at the bottom of the hill  is a house with Christmas lights  JUST LIKE IN HIS MEMORY  Coincidence much  It s entirely possible that Jonas passed out in the snow  and he and Gabriel died a quiet  painless death  But the interpretation I m choosing to believe is the  THEY FOUND A HOUSE   side  Yes  those things match Jonas  memories  but he d already given away all those happy memories to keep himself and Gabriel going  so it s not like he still had them anymore  The last memories he d been having were his real ones  from his own life  Also  he heard music coming from the house  something he had never actually heard before  because the Giver never shared that memory with him  So yes  I will choose hope  and live with the knowledge that Jonas and Gabriel made it to the great Some Where  and are living a happy  full life with their seeing colors and pretty blue eyes      hide spoiler  More than anything else  this book is clearly one of the forerunners to the wave of dystopic fiction that has become immensely popular in the past several years  I have no doubt that books like Delirium by Lauren Oliver  Matched by Ally Condie  Wither by Lauren DeStefano  and Pure by Julianna Baggott would not exist in the forms they are now without the influence of books such as The Giver  This is definitely a prime example of the genre  free of the romanticism of some of these later books  and more straightforward in it s themes and the questions it brings up  I m really glad I read it  and I hope you will  too  Review  The Giver is a book that sends you chills  one that you can pick up but certainly can t set back down  It truly is one of a kind and it places you in Jonas footsteps as he goes through feelings and memories he didn t even know existed  I don t think I could ever enjoy a book as much I did this one Summary In The Giver  it shows that you never would have thought memories or feelings were so important in our every day lives until Jonas became the Receiver of Memory  The Giver is someone who holds all of the memories and pains and happiness in a lifetime with the Receiver of Memory gets those memories when the Giver becomes far too weak to hold them  Only these two people get to know anything more than greyscale and work  The town Jonas lives in is in a place full of only polite people where no one understands what being mean is or they will get consequences if those actions are shown  Jonas sees glimpses of the color red in an apple one day and he never knew what that color was called or that it was even a color  But he did know that everyone s eyes was only blue  No one was different from each other and everyone had to act in equality  Jonas was chosen as his job to be the Receiver of Memory after years of practice  trying to find which job was right for him and what they selected for him  He is transferred memories of all kinds such as war  hate  love  sledding  colors  tastes  anything you are used to living with today  Imagine a world without it  Jonas begins to realize he likes a girl  and is not allowed to take the pills they give him when he starts dreaming of things because of the special job he has  This girl doesn t know anymore feelings than kindness  His parents don t love him because they think that isn t an appropriate word to use  Jonas ploys an escape with the Giver and brings his new baby brother Gabrielle that his father brought home from work to take care of  If Jonas didn t take Gabrielle  his father would have killed him because no one has any feelings about anything other than what is right and what is wrong  To him this was right  Jonas walks on for miles to a town that includes all of the things and animals that Jonas remembers in his memories along with Gabrielle and they finally escape an artificial town  to a real one  The Giver is a book like no other  one you can truly take in a beautiful perspective of  I had never read The Giver  so it seemed necessary to read it for my book log  After hearing about how great it was for years my expectations were pretty high  I was not let down  Lowry just pulls you into this weird world of sameness  and you just don t ask any questions  it seems pretty curious but a pretty ok way of life  You re attached to Jonas  family unit  his friends Asher and Fiona  you re excited about the birthday ceremony and the job assignments  Everything about Jonas  world seems so comfortable so safe  it s easy to like it and want to be part of it  I think that s the real trick as Jonas starts to shed his love of his world  we can really feel his disillusionment because you don t want to let go of how perfect you thought their world was  As an adult reader I have some questions  like how did they make it so it doesn t snow in their world but if you walk far enough it does  and how they got rid of color  and how he had a memory of the sled since that was something that was going to happen to him in the future    but Lowry had just spun such a beautiful story it was a very small thing to forgive those tiny flaws  I loved this book  It was so beautiful in its simplicity and it forces the reader to think and while reading it  not even thinking about the underlying themes  there are jsut moments when your mind reels back and your inner voice says wow   in a roundabout way  it makes you realize truths that I don t think would have had such an amazing impact if they were told in any other way  it made me realize the very importance of feeling something  I don t know why but at the end of reading it  I had this sudden amazing shift in my way of perceiving moments in my past and current life   there was this underlying gratefulness for the fact that I was able to feel  Feel the awkwardness  the turmoil  the love and the joy  And it was utterly amazing and enjoyable and interesting at the same time  What more can you want from a book  And the way Lowry was able to present the ever subtly deepening message by constructing an entire world showing the alternative  it is superb  I love it  This book changed my life Picked this up and read it in about 3 hours  I don t really expect much from books written from a younger person s perspective  like Jonas   but because of the setting his  voice  is very mature I really loved this book  It was tragically beautiful and genuinely makes me see things differently A brilliant book  and definitely one i ll read again soon However  I don t think I will necessarily read the sequels any time soon  or at all   Not because I don t want to  but because this book ending was one I actually liked  It s the type of book ending that gives you a sense of satisfaction that yes  you don t know what s happening or know what will happen  but you can imagine what will happen  and you re happy with it   I m also afraid of book sequels because after the first book  at least in my experience  they tend to go downhill from there  Allegiant  anyone   The first book was lent to me back when I was  a twelve  and to this day Jonas  story stuck with me  Lowry  her characters and the teacher who lent me the book introduced me to the concept of  getting lost in a book  and was just the beginning of my unofficial career as a speed reading bookwormNow 12 years later I decided to reread the series and it didn t disappoint  All the books  especially the first two were great if not better then when I first read them since I now understand so much more  I rarely get to just sit and read anymore  but this was a great series to just get lost in for a day  I was amazed how after all these years I could still remember reading certain poignant passages  and even had thought about them over the years while reading other books  and it was delight to reread them  I felt that the ending of the giver was going to be like the movie  Grave of The Fireflies   but it better  A nice sweet ending that was prefaced with a really dark morbid kind of turn I didn t realize in the beginning that the people were all black and white with no concept of deep feelings and stuff  that came clear to me later  The notion of seeing color and feeling love was pretty romantic I did connect the society that Jonas lived in to parallell our society today that seems more cold and misunderstanding words I just finished reading the book so I m definitely going to let this sit  I would 100  recommend  and I guess there s a moving coming out too  This is the original ya dystopian novel that started it all  The prose will rarely be matched  The idea may seem less original after all of the recent releases but this is THE original and still knocks my socks off  Writing a review for this masterpiece is really hard as it comes very close to perfection The story follows Jonas   a sixteen year old boy who gets chosen to be the next keeper of memories in a dystopian world freed of individuality  As the book progresses we learn a lot about the new community and it s rules of equality and  sameness  which is the main point of the book  If you are familiar with the genre of dystopian YA fiction you will catch up on the negative points of this system very fast and probably wonder how the people inhabiting this world wouldn t see them either  but I think Lowry just explained it perfectly without even mentioning anything  It s how they grew up  The whole story feels incredibly real  As if The Giver is an actual history book telling a story that once happened which is an amazing feeling  Even though not much happened I found myself constantly picking it up again and wishing I would have more time to read  Lowry describes so many small things in a beautiful way that doesn t drag the story immensely or gets annoying at all The characters are another thing that make The Giver a nearly perfect book  Jonas and all the other characters act reasonably and logically  None of them seems to be just there or  worthless   I loved seeing how Jonas  grew up  during that year of being the keeper of memories and I loved even more how the relationship to his friends changed thanks to the knowledge he got  This made it feel even more real as it would be the obvious thing to happen  something I missed a bit while watching the movie after reading the book  Overall the only bad thing one could say about The Giver is that there wasn t much happening  Most of the book contains of explaining the system  the world they live in and relationships  I loved this  but I can see people being annoyed at it or disappointed  I lastly can only say that I can t wait to get and read the other books  too as I now need to know what happens next  A profound  life affecting work of art that every Middle School student  must  read  and everyone else who s older but hasn t yet  For good reason  this book is typically listed among the top 5 children s chapter books of all time  in good company with Charlotte s Web  Wrinkle in Time  Harry Potter  etc   Lowry s ambiguous ending is delicious  I haven t read the 3  sequels   but I understand that we learn from those that Gabriel  and hence Jonas  lives     But the original ending  without the knowledge of sequels  certainly leaves it up in the air  Do Jonas and Gabriel die a frozen  hallucinatory death  though with happy  warm memories   I m hearing Thomas Paine here   Give me Freedom or Give me Death      Jonas chose BOTH   Or does Jonas actually use his power to see beyond to  know  that an actual red sled and a receptive town await him   his fugitive  brother  just beyond the steep  snowy hill in Elsewhere I  STRONGLY  recommend the Gift Edition with illustrations by the superb Bagram Ibatoulline  Edward Tulane   His art only adds to the Utopian Dystopian setting with great strength Extremely recommended for upper grades   older  due to some mildly disturbing content  not best suited for younger readers listeners   This is a classic dystopia that I think everyone will enjoy  It s a quick and thought inspiring read  The basic morals under question will have you wondering for days   what is right  The way that Lowry builds up the world of the Community and then tears it down again once Jonas gains knowledge is magically frightening The community  to me  is built on Maslow s hierarchy of needs  where it is an ideal civilization and everything is 100  fulfilled  Food  safety  community  esteem and self actualization should be at it s peak in the community   but at what cost  Read the book to find out  I think what makes it different from other dystopia s is it s many possible interpretations  Lowry herself said that she would never write a book without hope   but to you  does The Giver end on a hopeful note I have read the book several times and each time I think that it might have hope but not in the way that the Giver himself intended  I have always felt that the Giver  an adult in a children s dystopia  and therefore never trustworthy   has an agenda that is not as benevolent as it seems  He knows  and knowledge is power  He knows what love is  he knows what life is and he knows what death is  He knows at what cost food for the entire community comes  sameness  no colour   he knows that he really isn t safe  that when he passes on his memories to Jonas he will be  released   There is no such thing as love or loss or pain in the community  He knows that while his community gives him honour he doesn t have power or a real utility  for how much longer will there need to be a receiver    What the Giver really wants  in order to achieve self actualization  is to actually be useful and needed by the community  is to fulfil the basic drive to survive and succeed  He hatches a plan  Naive Jonas plays right into his hands  Jonas also wants to be useful to his community  to give them all the things that he thinks they need  and also agrees to leave the Giver behind   to help them  In order to self actualize  save the community from sameness and lack lustre lives the Giver plans to send Jonas off to his death  and Jonas agrees to go   Do you really believe that proximity to the community will release memories from Jonas  mind back into the community  I do not  When Jonas does leave he retains his memories and actually passes them on to Gabriel    but I m getting to that   But Jonas doesn t follow the Giver s plan  instead he leaves early and takes the new child Gabriel with him  to spare him from release  Without knowing it  I think that Jonas has escaped the Giver s sinister plot  But does this steal the hopeful ending from the book  If Jonas doesn t die  or rather since the memories mostly belong to Gabriel now  if neither of them die  then the memories aren t released onto the Community and everything goes on as usual and they choose a new Receiver of memory  If Jonas and Gabriel die  then the Giver s plan is actualized and the community has the memories  and power is relinquished to the Giver  Are either endings hopeful   Prior to reading its entirety  I already find it interesting based on its summary and the reviews I ve been reading from the net  The book focuses on Jonas who lives in a community they call Sameness  Here  everything is in order   from the creation of a family unit  the educational system  the jobs and even deaths  It s a seemingly Utopian world where everything seems to be running fine until Jonas was selected to be the receiver of memories  They are memories of the world s past   color  emotions  animals etc   After learning   receiving these memories from the Giver  Jonas gained the wisdom to really see beyond his eerily orderly community and decided to seek changes  Knowing this is close to impossible  Jonas asked the help of The Giver   but the only way he could create change was to escape from his community The book was surprisingly fast paced and thoroughly concise  The idea of this utopian society was well dissected  Published several years before The Hunger Games  I could say that there is some sort of similarities or at least a feel of similarities between the two  For one  you could easily compare Sameness to the Capitol and its Districts  Perhaps  it s the strict compliance of its law  The advance technology  And even the distribution of jobs  And what s so profound about the two is the fact that in The Giver  the community was made to forget the memories that they deemed unpleasant or unnecessary whilst in The Hunger Games  people in the districts were always reminded of a revolution against the Capitol s oppression through a cruel game   and its people were deprived of something that they have  the right to  in the past  There is some sort of ironic parallelism between the two that ultimately symbolizes a lot of things that s happening then and now Incidentally  the book has three accompanying novels entitled Gathering Blue  Messenger and Son which are all set in the same future  eer    time It was a nice read that will make you eager to learn more  to continue with the journey with Jonas and Gabriel and see what has become of them I fervently wished that this book would find its way to the schools here in Pampanga  my province  because this could really set out a great deal of discussions amongst our youth here   The Book The Giver  written by Lois Lowry  is my favorite book of all times  This has been my 7th time reading it and the book still manages to keep me entertained and doesn t bore me   The Giver Is based on a dystopian society where no one has emotions or feelings  There world is black and white and are controlled by the elers of the community  The story is based on a boy named jonas that is chosen to be the next receiver of memories  which means he receives all memories of life including color  sight  and sounds  I first chose to read The Giver because my teacher always made references to that book and always commented on how good The Giver was  The most current time I decided to re read the giver again was because I felt the need to re read it before I read the sequels of it  and also because I enjoy reading it  My favirite part in this book is when Jonas receives the memory of music  When I read that part in the book it really got to me  As a lover of music  I couldn t imagine a world where music wasn t a thing  or allowed  When he received that memory he was full of joy and found himself consumed in the sound of music  I would defintely recommend this book to any of my friends ir anyone whi hasn t read this book  It shows us how to cherish the things we don t really appreciate and teaches us good from right  I flew right through this and loved every page  I should ve read this when I was a kid  but I m glad I finally got around to reading it  I read this book when I was perhaps 8 in school  and didn t really understand it  but it s interesting what I remembered from then  the part where Jonas has the dream about bathing Fiona  the reason the book was banned   and the end where he runs off into the Elsewhere with Gabriel  because I remember being angry that it cut off like that and didn t tell us what happened   that was probably the first time I experienced an abrupt end that  left you hanging  My experience of reading it now is quite different  obviously  as I m 24 now  I love dystopian fiction  and this was quite possibly the first I ever read  I ve been a fan of Lois Lowry s writing style for years  and I ve read many of her subsequent books  but the emotional power and imagery of this one is definitely the best  I particularly adore the misdirect of the world being in black and white vs  color  which you don t find out until more than halfway through the book  which is such a clever way of both relating normalcy for the protagonist  who s head we re in as readers  and a striking metaphor for the whole society  The surreal aspects of the worlds Lowry creates are one of the things I love about her work   they always have a purpose and don t come off as fantastical For a YA level reader  I think this one is especially great because it s not that difficult to read and has enough going on that I d expect a healthy reader  or even a little more reluctant high schooler  not to get bored with it  because it s a nice balance between a lively plot and building emotional connections  And if the rest of the book doesn t do it  the end is sure to dredge up some genuine emotions from the reader  even if it s just pissed off If you liked this book  I didn t realize til rereading it  that Neal Shustermann s Unwind series reminds me a lot of The Giver  I m not sure why  because the dystopian worlds are pretty different and the writing style is totally different too  but I really enjoyed both takes on young adults raging against society  if you will   Everyone in this community is the same  Same clothes  same eyes  same houses  same food  anything you can think of  All the little girls all run around in knee length dresses  and little pigtails with bows  All the boys are running around the community  with laughter and joy  just kicking a ball around until their mothers call them in for dinner  The whole community is black and grey  nothing has a color   Not even one s own skin  Jona  the main character  is 11  On his 12th birthday he is the  chosen  one to be The Receiver Of Memory  Jona s best friend is Asher  whom he hangs out with every single day  But as the year passes  and Jonas grows older  he gradually hangs out with Asher less and less  Jona s father is a Nurturer who works with infants  He is a sweet  tenderhearted man who s job is to  release  infants who won t survive  or if there are already two children in the home  he is forced to release the odd number infant   In this community  to avoid jealousy  every single event is held as a community event  Birthdays and deaths are known as ceremonies  Every year exactly 50 children are born  any single number over 50 is to be released  even if they are a twin  On birthday ceremonies each age gets a different gift  on your first birthday you are given a name  on your second birthday you are given a comfort item  such as a teddy bear or blanket  on your third birthday if you are a girl  you get ribbons in your hair  If you are turning nine  and a girl you get the ribbons out of your hair  and if you are a boy or girl you get a bicycle  And on your 11th birthday  you are given an Assignment that you will do until you are sent to the House of the Old  As Jona finishes up school  he rides his bike  which was a gift from his 9th birthday  all the way to the House of The Old  That is where he meets The Giver  The Giver carries with him all the memories of the community  as well as all the colors  The Giver s job is to teach Jonas how to remember what the community was like before it became a colorless  no new faced  wreck  When Jona goes home he sees that there is a new child in the house named Gabriel  Gabriel is being sent home with Jona s father from the Nurturing Center  Gabriel and Jona are closer than anyone in this community  they also have many secrets they re hiding   While this book may seem boring and take a few chapters to get to the point  every single page has a secret  I highly recommend reading this book if you are interested in mysteries and if you love to be on the edge of your seat with curled toes    This story was about a boy named Jonas that turns 12  He lived in a world where the elders trap the memories of the past  They selected their next receiver of memory as Jonas  who will store all the memories of the past so that the receiver of memory can give wisdom  and not make horrible mistakes like the past again  He struggled when he received memories  which were good  evil  in between  and many others from the past  The giver  who gave the memories to Jonas  made a plan so that Jonas could escape the community  Their plan changed when Jonas realized that the baby  Gabriel will be released   killed  Jonas left in a hurry with Gabriel to elsewhere  Their escape was very dangerous  They didn t know how much farther they had to go  They just kept on going  Will they make it  I personally think that this is a really good book  The author  Lois Lowry  is really good at describing feelings  emotions  and the characters  I really enjoyed this book  I think this idea was fresh and interesting  I loved how the story went  I think this book deserves the Newbery Medal  I wanted more and more   I didn t want it to end  I read this years ago   it was the favorite book of my oldest  I picked it up again because I remembered it as being about a repressive  totalitarian society like the currently popular  Hunger Games   which I found to have no real redemptive value as a story  So I wanted to compare  Hunger Games  this 1993 young adult novel  The Giver   about a colorless dystopian society in which emotions have been removed and people exist in a state of content  sameness   Lowry asks different questions and explores the dystopian society in a different way than Collins  Lowry s society is not openly cruel in the same way Collins  is  Where Collins  series sees the rebellion through to its inevitable conclusion  Lowry leaves us to determine whether the small  personal rebellion of the protagonist would be effective or not Like  Hunger Games    The Giver  created controversy and criticism  when it was published  that the book s subject material is inappropriate for young children   The Giver  won the 1994 Newbery Medal and has sold more than millions of copies  According to Wikipedia  in Australia  the United States  and Canada  it is a part of many middle school reading lists  but it is also on many challenged book lists and appeared on the American Library Association s list of most challenged books of the 1990s Also  according to Wikipedia  the novel forms a loose trilogy 2  with two other books set in the same future era  Gathering Blue  2000  and Messenger  2004   A fourth book titled Son is in preparation in 2012 So  do I think it is a better book than   Hunger Games   Yes  in several ways   it is less cruel and graphic  It asks better questions about what it means to be human and the importance of experience and emotions  The ending is open for reader interpretation and should engender interesting conversations between the middle school reader and their parents or teachers  I read this book as a kid and absolutely adored it   yet it s one of the few books that have made it onto my  favorite books  list that I ve never read a second time   until now I was curious as to how much this book might hold up to the high esteem I had for it in my mind  And it totally did  This book is fantastic  Lowry somehow manages to describe this world without color  without emotion  without pain  and then  even more amazingly  uses the people within that world to describe ours  to describe those exact things that they don t have  Just in her description of things like sledding down a hill  one can t help but have a very specific image crafted in their mind  almost as if the reader is the receiver in training themselves But the true majesty in the story here is in the concept of hope  the dream of a brighter future  which pervades this text  This world may share some similarities with many other dystopian novels  I can t help but think this is somehow held within the same world as Orwell s 1984   but the tale is one of hope  not of loss  of change  not of how the world is too big to make a difference And in that piece we find the item that keeps us wanting to root for Jonas  wanting to root for the plan  and hoping against hope that the end doesn t mean what it appears to mean Luckily there s more books in the series that should allow us to see where things move from there   books I have yet to read but will be reading very very soon  I loved Lowry s portrayal of a society where euthanasia is their vehicle for dealing with pain  Pills are used to comatose passions   if this were re written for our culture   pills would be used to comatose energy  pain  joy  anger  sadness  purposelessness  hunger  life  Nevertheless  for the most part  Lowry gives us a picture of a society free from pain and lust  but enslaved to a governing culture who decides what the definitions of things like feelings and pain are  Dystopia is my favorite genre   but too often the era of 1984  The Giver  etc    predicted that religion was the driving force behind suppression   and our current society proves this is not so  These novels also predict a suppression of lust and feelings   but again  we see just the opposite as the current trend  What I do love about this novel is the confrontation on killing old citizens and  unnecessary  babies  Controlling population  telling people what they are good for rather than allowing them the freedom  the beautiful struggle of finding out for themselves who they are and what they can do are great topics of discussion with young people  I haven not read the books that come after this   Jonas  world is a tightly controlled society  where everyone and everything is the same  No one sees color  family units are  assigned  and those deemed unfit for the society are quickly and dispassionately killed  When Jonas discovers he s been selected to keep the memories of the community s collective consciousness  everything changes  He starts learning about love  which the society has lost  and the importance of memory The Giver is an early dystopian novel  and one that is very  very different from the novels of today  The majority of the action is the internal musings and emotional discoveries of Jonas  It s a relatively quiet book that deals with really big  heavy topics  This is a novel that you can read in sixth grade and enjoy  in 12 grade and identify with  and then when you re sixty and love  Each time you read this excellent work  you will connect with it in new and distinct ways  I loved the Giver when I was 12  and I love it now  at 22  Warnings  Mild violence Newberry Medal winner Lois Lowry  really pushed the envelope with this book  The Giver was really one of the first to include a Utopian society  The society is  what seems to be  picture perfect  There is a perfect time for everything and a perfect occupation for every person  But while there is no conflict and no hate  there is also no emotion and no color  Main character Jonas is chosen to be the next receiver of memories  In his journey to take on this new title  Jonas starts to notice the things he and his society are missing out on  Love in their society is not a concept  while their parents may feel proud of their children  they do not love them  The giver  and the receiver  Jonas decide that the few downsides to a free society  outweigh the few advantages to having such a controlled one This book really shows children and adult readers the importance of individuality and free will  We should respect the differences and place a great deal of importance on free will    Intriguing  This book is very intriguing and really makes you wonder what if this actually happened and makes you wonder what you would do in the situation the main character is in  The world has finally accomplished world peace in a somewhat utopian form but is there more to life than sameness and world peace  Is a place where everything is the same an alcatraz in disguise  One special receiver realizes there s more to life so he tries to find a place where sameness doesn t exist so he can find the true meaning of life  I connected with the main character because i felt i would have made many of the same choices in his position although i don t think i would have been brave enough to make the decision he did at the end of the book  This was a very good book its a reall page turner it makes you want to read more about the utopian society and what the main character will discover next  I feel that the plot was very believable and some people would actually do this to make world peace and experiment with it  I enjoyed reading the book and made me want to come back and read more  I highly recommend reading this book  The Giver   This book made me want to rip my hair out sometimes  cry sometimes  and laugh sometimes  This book is probably one of the BEST dystopian books I ve ever read  There was no stupid love triangle  No love interests at all  and that s a change for me  I think I like it  The relationship between The Giver and Jonas was enough to tide me  No homo by the way  It was a father and son like relationship  Speaking of fathers    Jonas s  father  was a total DOUCHE BAG  No offense Jonas Dad Lovers  Wait  What  No one likes him   AHHH   How could he  view spoiler   Release  Kill that sweet innocent baby  I cried at theat part     hide spoiler   The Giver is an intriguing story of a curious young boy living in a boring dystopian world     SPOILER   ALERT   The boy is chosen for the most honored job in the community  but is also a job of pain  Pain that no one has ever felt for ages  because the community is all the same  There leaders chose to go to sameness to keep there lives normal and the community together  Jonas accepts his job as the receiver and learns of life before sameness  he learns how things used to be  The Giver  the receiver before him  hands down the memories to Jonas and Jonas hands some memories down to a new child his family is helping  Jonas continues getting memories and learning the secrets of the community  and when he finds out that the new child is going to be released he and the giver make a plan for Jonas to escape  and in his escape the community will receive his memories  As Jonas escapes he takes the new child with him and after a long journey  he makes it to a new community  the same ones he saw in his memories  So perhaps they aren t just memories but glimpses of the future and what s to come there  I love this book  it is beautifully written and the story is so unique  Jonas  adventure was great to read about and it left me wanting more  It was so hard to stop reading and when I finished I was a little disappointed because I wanted to know what happened  but overall it was a wonderful book  In many ways  a book is a pathway to another universe  Whether that universe be similar to ours  or completely different  each has it s own way of enticing the reader  furthering their curiosity  I believe Lois Lowry s well known novel  The Giver  is a story worthy of such description We begin with the setting of a Utopian society  very much different from our own  As the story progresses however  said society begins to seem more and more dystopian  than it s previous Utopian status  The one to discover the awful truths of the society  is none other than the main character of this book  Jonas  Chosen to be the next giver at the age of 12  Jonas begins his new life learning the hidden pasts of previous societies  He learns truths that no other person  aside from him and the current Giver  know  The community Jonas has accustomed himself to is not what he believed it to be  As time goes on  The Giver and Jonas both begin to realize that their society needs to be changed  immediately  However  change does not come so easily  This enthralling story is a must read for those who love a dystopian type story  or for those who are very much into science fiction  I would highly recommend this book to any of you who are looking for an interesting story to read   This book is a must read for freethinkers aged 10 to 110  I am grateful to my friend Robert for alerting me to its existence  I know how I missed it  It was published when I was 23 years old  so a thought provoking  award winning work of literature written for young adults could easily have flown below my radar as I had different priorities at that time  In any case  this is a wonderful novel of Utopia gone awry  Jonas lives in a community in the far flung future of what I can only assume is our planet Earth  Humans have switched to  Sameness   where all people operate under very similar expectations and the same things happen to the same people at the same ages  Sexuality has been eradicated through use of a pill that is given to children when they begin to have  Stirrings  at puberty  The family unit still exists  but children are only birthed by  Birthmothers   women chosen for this purpose at the age of 12  Children are assigned to families based on the decisions of a Committee of Elders  There are many other details about this society that can be best understood by reading the first few chapters of the book  What you won t realize at first is that humans have evolved in some ways that we  as current day humans  would find disconcerting  Color has been eradicated from humanity  Not just skin color  although that is gone as well  but humans can no longer see IN color  except for a precious few who have the ability to  see beyond   They also cannot hear music and within the community  there are no longer animals  weather  and many of the other environmental and geological aspects of society we would take for granted  Jonas is chosen by the elders to become the next Receiver of Memories  and as such he will be exposed to all of the memories passed down through many many generations of that which came before  What happens next is too spoiling to discuss  but it s worth the read  So it s been a really long time since I ve finished a book so fast as I did The Giver  If you follow my book reviews at all  you know that I ve been having a really tough time reading lately  I ve really tried pushing myself into books  forcing myself to focus and forget everything around me so that I can absorb the book  It finally happened with less concentration with this book I loved The Giver  On the outset you are introduced to a new way of life for Earth  and you don t really know how long life has been like this  but you get the sense that it s been a long time  In fact  we are told it has been this way  back and back and back   That s a long time  But  it s a Utopia  People are placed in jobs that are just perfect for them  partnered with people who are perfect for them  even have nice little family units  They don t have to choose  because that s all done for them  and they don t have to worry about pain  because there s someone who keeps all the memories for the people  and those memories aren t always good  sometimes they are painful  This person is the Receiver of Memories The Giver takes us through life with the main character Jonas  who from the start seems to question how life runs in the community  but he doesn t talk about that  and he doesn t question  because that s rude  Until he s selected to be the new Receiver  and he is encouraged to question And that s about all the summary of the book I can give you without giving it all away  This book truly was an experience for me to read  and I enjoyed every second of it  It isn t overly action packed  and it goes the route of more traditional sci fi in that it has a story to tell  and it doesn t muck it up with action that s unnecessary  The Giver by Lois Lowry is a story about a boy named Jonas who is one of the only differences in his community  In his dystopian society  he is selected at the age of 12 to go a separate way than everyone else  while all his friends and family have no color  feelings or care  Jonas is trained by The Giver to see beyond and gains memories of generations before his  I think the best part of the book is when he decides to make a change in his boring  plain community and fleas with his little companion  Gabriel  By doing this  once he reaches beyond the boundaries of his community  Jonas loses all his memories and they are introduced to his whole community  In this story you will find sacrifice  adventure  and true love in a different way than normal  As a reader  I enjoyed this book greatly  It s incredibly thought provoking  as it causes readers to form their own opinions on seemingly morally ambiguous topics  As a teacher  however  I would be cautious advising this text to any of my future students  Assigning this book  even for the most advanced 5th grader  seems to be a bit of a stretch  Initially  I assumed that this would be a great recommendation for my future student  but upon further reading  I don t find this book to be developmentally appropriate  due to some of the topics presented in this text   The Giver  by Lois Lowery is an amazing read  I normally don t enjoy reading books that make me think  but this was phenominal  When I sit down to read a book   which unfortunatly is not very often  I want to relax  zone out and get sucked into the story and the adventures the character goes through  This was not the case for  The Giver   It made me think hard about society  things I take for granted  and all the freedoms I have  The book takes place in the future  The main caracter lives in a community which is blocked off from the outside world  Life is very controlled and the people of this community are not allowed to have memories  Normally I would have put the book down and picked up a comedy or an action book  but Lois Lowry does such a great job with keeping the reader glued to the book  Lois does a great job with forshadoing  On multiple occasions I knew somthing big was about to happen and when it did I was left pleasntly suprised every time  I read this book once before in fourth or fifth grade  At the time I did not apreciate it because I did not understand society as much as I do now The Giver won the 1994 Newbery Medal and has sold more than 5 3 million copies in Austrailia  Canada and here in the U S  I am not the least bit surprised  This is a book you can read over and over and get somthing different out of it every time  I recomend this book to strong readers who enjoy short novels that requires you to think  I belive it is important to read this book so you can look at society from a different angle and possibly see where our civilization is headed in the future   Wow  This book is amazing It starts off with a boy named Jonas who lives in a small futuristic community  Life is pretty easy  follow the standards  train for when you become an adult at your December Ceremony  and take the required medicines when you reach the right age  The community as a whole also works like clockwork  You are assigned your job when you are 12  and until that age you learn the skills necessary for any job  Families aren t actual blood relation families  instead  the husband and wife are matched according to their skill and brilliance levels and they receive one boy and one girl child who are born by  birthmothers  in the community  At Jonas s December Ceremony he is chosen to be the  Receiver  a special job that is only replaced once every few decades  The book follows the story of what he learns from the  Giver  and how the information he finds flips his world upside down  My favorite thing about this book was that there was so much symbolism between things in the story and things that happen in real life  There are things in the book such as loss of life and the ability to change things that may seem impossible to change that occur throughout the book and help teach a powerful lesson  It shows what a society without history or art would be like  and speaks a powerful lesson in why things like that have to be passed down to the next generation  I read The Giver after reading many reviews that Matched is very similar  After reading both novels  I prefer The Giver since the writing had so much more depth and beauty  The idea of the Sameness made so much more sense than the idea in Matched that the world was too chaotic and needed to be simplified with only 100 poems  songs  etc  Jonas seemed genuinely confused when confronted with ideas that didn t fit into his isolated world  and it was beautiful to explore how the joyful and painful emotions affected the Giver and Jonas  The idea that Jonas  world still had injustice  pain and sadness  as seen with the example of the release of the young twin and planned release of Gabe  added depth  but what was horrific was that the citizens no longer felt anything is relation to these events  Jonas  struggle with his society and its  protection  versus the new knowledge that he is gaining was well described and the ending of the novel left me both fulfilled and wanting to know more   Sad to say that I read this for Classic Novel my senior year  but it was really good  I m glad that my teacher had us read it because the cover does not portray the story within the book  The book  The Giver  is a story about a young boy named Jonas  Jonas lives in a community that was built after a great war  Built on organization and full cooperation from every community member  each child gets assigned their roll in life at a young age  Jonas  unlike the rest of his colleagues  was assigned the roll of  Receiver of Memories   This role in the community leads him to be mentored by one of the community s elders  the Giver  As the Giver explains to Jonas  Jonas s roll is to gain the memories of everything from before the community was established  both the good and bad ones  Good in the sense that he learned to enjoy himself in all he does and feel more than just normal  he learns about different colors  and how to truly love  Bad though  because he also had to receive the memories of severe pain  loss  and war  The further he goes into his studies with the Giver  the more he realizes what is truly behind the drapes of his community  My most favorite character in this great novel is the Giver  because not only is he the one who is the wisest elder  his at first serous side fades through the book  Showing a more softer and down to earth personality behind his stern act With this book  it is definitely all about emotion  whether it is relating to The feelings Jonas experiences through he book  or how its written as if you were experiencing everything right next to Jonas  I could say that I can relate to Jonas even to this day  always experiencing new emotion  not knowing how to deal with it  or even how his innocence seems to dissipate through the book From front to back of this book  I was amazed at how well written the book was  I originally read it for an assignment in class that was intended to be a  read along with the class  style assignment  but I could hardly put the book down  what was supposed to be a two to three week project turned out to be only three days with me  Honestly I can claim that this is one of most favorite books because it hit all the aspects that keep me interested and tuned in  I also have to praise this book for being one of my first dystopian society novels  taking me into an interest into that genre  My most favorite part is as well the part that made me cry my eyes out while reading  Sadly I would rather not say what it is so I do not spoil anything to people who have yet to read this book  Speaking of which  I recommend this book to anyone who has yet to read this award winning novel  as well as if you are at least past the elementary level of schooling  It is a shorter read and can be a little intense at times  dabbling in some disturbing but still pretty clean scenes This novel Receives get it   a 5 5 for being a large part of my childhood as well as actually pulling at my emotions so well   Close your eyes and be still  now  I m going to give you a memory of a rainbow  Although many people read this book as young adults  I just read it for the first time and it was a beautiful book Very simple  with a simple plot line  but quite beautiful  reminding us to be thankful of all the things and feelings we take for granted in our life    read for BookTube A Thon 2015  read in one sitting  loved that readers are meant to unravel the rules changes of society independently  Jonas is probably perfect  just saying   interested to see what who Gabe becomes  10 10 would reccomend  would hate to live in that world I don t know  I don t know    my wife recommended this book to me  she read it as a middle school student  The cover has an award  excellent writing for children  I was blown away by this novel  I think it is an adult must read The book follows Jonas  a boy of eleven turning twelve  Twelve is the age when children in this dystopian society receive adult work  At the age of twelve they know what they will be until they are  released  from their almost perfect community  Jonas is a wonderfully intelligent and inquisitive boy who understands and is loyal to the rules that govern his society  But at Twelve something starts happening that will change his life forever  This story is a masterpiece of human interaction  It creates a new and orderly world  a society very different from our modern one  that begs the reader to examine their most sacred values  The Giver forces us to analyze our freedoms  and ask ourselves if we truly are free  It is an amazing story of triumph over adversity or is it  Are we living in a utopian or dystopian society  Jonas finds out  will you  Still one of my all time favorites  Can t wait to share this with my daughter   I first read this book in 4th grade  but I just re read it and it was great as ever  This story takes place in a futuristic society  Where there is no color  feelings  war  or originality  AKA  Sameness  When a child reaches 8  they start volunteer hours at their desired job  when they turn 12  they are assigned a role in the community during an annual Ceremony  and hopefully it s the one they want  Jonas is the main character and this December  he will be a Twelve and will be assigned a job  where they ll be guided by the present employees and after their training will take up the roles themselves  Other main characters include   The Giver   or the present Receiver of Memory  Lily  Jonas  little sister  Fiona  Jonas  friend  and Gabriel  an infant that is being nurtured by Jonas  dad  Before the Ceremony even happens  Jonas starts seeing the color red  in an apple  or in Fiona s hair  but he doesn t know what it is  so he doesn t tell anybody  Jonas gets selected to inherit the position of  Receiver of Memory  which is the person who keeps all memories of the past life before Sameness  And he doesn t expect what s coming to him  feelings   I definitely love futuristic science fiction books  which is one reason I decided to read this book  This is another person s idea on what could possibly happen in the future  and it seems really cool to read about  but depressing to live in  Just imagine a world where you can t make choices  can t feel pain  can t even choose your own spouse  Horrible  Also  the fact that you can t change your job  you re stuck with it until you retire  This book is probably not for everyone  some parts can get sad or even scary for younger or more sensitive kids  these parts are usually painful memories from the past life  Even so  I love this book because it s REAL  It s not about a perfect world  it s about imperfections in the world  and how you can t try to change them  as the elders did  because it ll end up worse than it already was  Some things are definitely fiction like the passing of memories by touching the person and transferring it into their brain  but overall  it s about REAL pain and REAL feelings that these characters don t get to feel  The feelings that only make us human  In conclusion  I recommend this book to those who don t want to read about puppies and unicorns dancing on rainbows   Probably the best book I ve ever read  I feel like this is a novel that you will either love or hate  there is not much in between  For me I was able to instantly connect to the main character Jonas  I felt that Lowry does a great job of letting you feel the feelings he is feeling  The idea of a society like this  or any dystopian society for that matter  is so far fetched to us that it could sometimes be hard for us to connect with the story  I absolutely loved The Hunger Games  but at the same time the idea of a society like that is difficult for me to imagine and relate to  Lowry made Jonas character simple enough that he could fit into his story  but he was obviously different from every character in the book  and I feel that is something about 99 9  of young adults at some point in time can relate to is the fact that they are different  What I really appreciated about the novel was that it wasn t so loud and crazy that you completely miss what the author is trying to say  Sometimes that will happen to me when I m reading a book and I ll think after  so what  I think would I loved the most though was that this is a story I can read over and over again and I will learn something new or take away a new message every single time  and to me that is the sign of a book unlike any other  Es un libro muy simple y a la vez muy complejo  Me gusto mucho  Tiene muchos mensajes  La sociedades perfectas no existen  Siempre habra alguien infeliz y muchos mas pero este es el que mas destaco  Es excelente  SPOIL ALERT The genre of The Giver is Social Science  Fiction  and Young Adult  The book s theme is Importance of memory and relationship between pain and pleasure importance of the individual Jonas is 12 years old and eventually becomes a receiver he is very careful  pensive  mature  compassionate and composed  The problem is that he is gaining memory to which it may be a good thing or bad depending  To the Committee they are considering it bad  Jonas becomes the new Receiver  he receives memories that change the way he thinks about himself and his community forever  Jonas s new emotional and sensory awareness cause him to rebel against the restrictions his society places on freedom of choice  individuality  emotion  and human experience  He overcomes it by telling his loved ones the truth  And helping them to try to understand the messed up society they are living in  Jonas s world is perfect  Everything is under control  There is no war or fear of pain  There are no choices  Every person is assigned a role in the community  When Jonas turns 12 he is singled out to receive special training from The Giver  The Giver alone holds the memories of the true pain and pleasure of life  Now  it is time for Jonas to receive the truth  There is no turning back This book is completely interesting and the reason for that is because of how much honesty you need in your life and need to be  It was that kind of book you need to realize what you have then what you don t  I liked the characters they chose and I like how they were very detailed with them I love books that are very detailed  This book personally helped me realize the big picture of life  The way how his community was I felt like I was in  I read this when I was going through a lot of stuff and it seriously helped me  It s an amazing book I highly recommend this to anyone  Especially the ones that feel alone and think life is so miserable  It will want you to stay positive and know you can do anything you put your mind to  Thank you so much for your time I appreciate it and I hope you all get the chance to read it   Wow I don t remember liking this as much as I do now  I just    No words  Wow  how can I begin to describe this book  Amazing  heart wrenching and heart warming  A struggle for feelings  a struggle for love that Lois manages to unravel so magically that you can t stop reading  When I was about halfway done through it  I thought that it was going to be impossible for her to fit it all in less than 200 pages  but she actually managed to do it  I loved this so much and has definitely become one of my favorites  Book Review  The Giver By  Scott Lim  76 My favorite Golden Line is   I am going to transmit the memory of snow   The Givers says this to Jonas  What would a perfect world be like  All organized with no pain  no conflict  Like a utopia  Well  the book   The Giver   takes place in a community or like a Utopia  Everything seems so perfect in the world that the 12 year old boy lives in  but is it  After his 12th ceremony  Jonas is selected as the receiver of memory  because he is in fact  more intelligent than the others of his community  But  everything changes for him after he meets the Giver  He starts to realize pain  starvation  grandparents  an actual holiday  and about the world that he doesn t live in My rating for this book is a five star  because as I read throughout this story  it gives me good description about everything  It contains many interesting events and amazing events  As I read throughout the story  it made me feel like I was part of the community  I could also feel the difference between the world we live in and the community that Jonas is in  When you get rid of all the bad things  such as pain and hunger  you will eventually take away also the good things such as  sledding and love  This taught me that  in order to get rid of the bad feelings  you have to also get rid of the pleasure feelings  Pleasure and pain are related  I would recommend this book to people who have an interest in what the world will be like if it was a utopia  As I told you in the summary  the setting of this book is a utopia  So  this special reader would enjoy and learn more about Utopia  Also  people who enjoy reading descriptive stories would enjoy this book because  it contains many details   This is an utterly beautiful book  From the idea of the story to the delivery  it is a masterpiece  I remember seeing this book on the shelf in the library when I was in elementary school  I even saw kids my age reading it but I was never one of them Now I ask myself why    why did I never heed the rest   how have I lived all these years without having read the pages of this book   Oh  Lois Lowry   you are amazing  And so is this book If there was ever a time to read a story such as this one  it s now  In a time where those in power want us to be the  same  or on an equal level financially and socially    and in a time where those of us who are different yearn to be so   the lesson of this read is just what we all need reiterated to us  The basic moral of the story is that we all look for the things that make us different  We hate sameness  We don t want to be unoriginal  All of us yearn for life and in life  there are aspects of character that make us unique and through that uniqueness we are truly  free   It is A Okay to just BE  Long live Jonas and Gabriel  And the lesson they both teach us    The Giver  is a story about a young boy named Jonas who lives in a world with no pain no hunger and no choice  At the mere age of eleven he is elected to become the new Receiver of Memory  This detailed book with outstanding foreshadowing portrays Jonas  struggle with the absence of feeling choice and over all life  Jonas becomes aware of the fact that he is missing out on life and wants something to change I would recommend this book people of ages twelve and up due to the introduction of mature concepts  This book is over all an amazing work of literature  This book is simple  It s not going to take you long to read but you re not going to be eating it up  either  It will hold your interest  It s not suspenseful  it s steady And yet  it s so complicated Maybe that s why I liked it This book answers the question of  what would it be like if      And you know what  You get a world that s  perfect    without love  without hate  without sadness   without tears  A world with no feeling at all Euthanasia   but  unlike Miriam Webster s definition  it s not for reasons of mercy  or for a hopelessly sick person   I personally think it s wrong no matter how you look at it  though  It s just that  once you reach a certain elderly age apparently your life s not worth anything anymore Or if you re an identical twin  they don t want two of you Or if you re a premature baby    or if you re a baby who cries too much and doesn t sleep well through the night  You re not close enough to perfect  so why would they want you  little one How is this any worse than abortion  I ask  It s no worse  actually  it s all murder  And yet  how many people cry about an aborted baby  Compared to how many would cry over a baby murdered simply because they were too small  or cried too much at night How can it seem excusable when you can t see the baby   when he s still cocooned inside of his mother s womb  He ought to be safe there  but we ve taken that away from him  Is he not really alive until he s born  Then why is his heart beating  How is he kicking and sucking his thumb if he s not really alive  If he s not really a baby  then why does he look like one on the ultrasound screen  It s stuff like that  the awful stuff  that makes we who still have emotions cry I really  really liked this book  Not because it made me feel good  because it obviously did not  But because it made me think  It made me ask questions  It s true that  for some reason that I just can t put my finger on  the pain of these fictional characters seemed very real  How would you feel in a world of humans that are basically unfeeling robots and you re the only one who s feeling anything  Something that really struck me was when Jonas asked his parents if they loved him     They told him that love was obsolete And in a world where the murder of the innocents is not questioned or frowned upon  where euthanasia is a common  celebrated practice   it s not hard to believe that love is obsolete   I heard this was being made into a movie so I decided to read it  Also  to be honest  I had Lois Lowry confused with one of my favorite childhood authors  Lois Duncan  Anyway  I am so glad I read this because it was excellent  The main character  Jonas  is a twelve year old boy living in a utopian society that is seemlingly perfect  It is something of a commune  with everyone doing their assigned tasks  everyone is extremely polite and there never seems to be any conflict  Oddly  the people in the community do not seem to question whether life has always been this way  or what is Elsewhere beyond the boundaries of their community  or what happens to the elderly  convicted or infirm when they are  Released   Then Jonas is chosen to be the next Receiver of the community s collective historical knowledge and memories  He meets with an old man he calls The Giver  who transfers these memories to him after having borne their pain alone for a lifetime  Soon Jonas realizes that the sameness of their community has come with a price  The book is well written and concise and would make a perfect introduction to young adults to the world of dystopian literature  It would also be appropriate for an adult book club discussion  I found myself wondering if people would really cease to ask questions or challenge anything once all their choices are taken away from them  Isn t it human nature to look at the horizon and wonder what is out there  To seek to identify what makes one unique in one s existence   Picked this up for my kids two days ago and blazed through it myself this afternoon  couldn t put it down  cannot wait to give it to my son  The Giver1  Junior Book  Science Fiction2  This book follows the life of twelve year old Jonas as he becomes the receiver of memory in a futuristic dystopian society that has completely eliminated diversity and being unique from society  When faced with this new information  Jonas realizes the power of knowledge  and questions everything he has ever known  3  Critique a  The most important element of this book is the overall theme of memory and the importance of learning from the past  This book delves into the idea of what might happen if individuality is sacrificed for  sameness   b  Memories and history are what shape us  and this book forces teens to imagine the possibilities of a life without memories  Also  readers can imagine a society without individual choices  without freedom  without love  and hopefully learn to fight for humanity over order  c  In the book  Jonas is faced with many conflicting emotions  which is very relatable to adolescents  He must decide whether to break free from his life  now that he is filled with knowledge of the past  or ultimately remain in the  The life where nothing was ever unexpected  Or inconvenient  Or unusual  The life without color  pain or past   4  This book allows for many interesting and thought provoking lesson plans  A pre reading activity having students write down significant childhood memories  and then label the emotion attached to have students reflect on the importance of memories  Then ask them to discuss what life would be like without these memories  and if they would act or think differently    The most beautiful thing I ve ever read  The movie was okay  despite some atrocious added features  and some completely ridiculous love scenes  But I did love it anyway  Ms  Lowry has outdone herself  this is a very touching story about a boy named jonas    he lives in a town with no feelings and no color    when he is about 12 he is given the job of the giver    he receives all of the feelings and pain and happiness of life     Jonas lives in a perfect society where everyone is designated a specific job to do in their community  Everyone had a designated birthmother  a designated family unit  and when they turn twelve  the will be assigned a certain job in their community  In their society  they don t have to worry about anything  there is plenty to eat  there are people who maintain the community  and they are protected from danger  Everything is the same in their community  Jonas is about to turn twelve and he is anticipating a predetermined Life Assignment  However  he does not get what he anticipated  he is given the special job of bring the Receiver  His job is to receive information that no one else knows from the Giver  This information is only given to the Receiver because it could harm the whole community if people knew about these ideas  Will Jonas be capable to fulfill such a demanding task  After reading this book  I see why this book is such a popular book among student in my age group  This book instantly captured me with its unique and interesting plot  This book had a very simple concept and Lois Lowry was able to create a great story from this plot   The Giver  had such a different plot that it kept me interested unlike other books  The characters were all very unique even in a community where everyone is equal  The only thing that I didn t like about this book was the length of the book  This book ended too quickly in my opinion and I wanted to see what happened after the cliffhanger  I look forward to reading what Lawry does with the story in the next three books in the series  She has so many different paths that she could take with this book and I am interested to see what she does  I am also looking forward to seeing that movie that I based off of this book because I wonder if the movie will be as popular as the book  Overall  this book was great and I would recommend it to everyone  Others may not enjoy it as much as I did  however  because I really enjoy reading about dystopian societies   This little gem transported me  it is deep disturbing and beautiful  Wonderful young adult book  read with your older kids and be prepared for lots of great concepts to discuss like compliance  individuality creativity  love and social order  Wow  just wow  Lois Lowry is a talented writer who can pack a punch in an economy of pages   I think the giver was an excellent book due to its amazing plot line  The thing I liked most about the book was its detail about every subject in the book  The best part with the best detail was when Jonas was in the elsewhere  The author described the area he was in with amazing details  The strongest part of the was towards the ending to tell you to keep on reading  The beginning of the book was a little boring because it keeps on telling you what kind of rules the society has  The thing I liked most about the book was introducing the characters to the readers  For example  when the author was explaining Jonas and his family unit to the readers  The weakest part of the book was the the beginning part of the book  The ending was the most crucial part of the book    But suddenly Jonas had noticed following the path of the apple through the air with his eyes that the piece of fruit had changed   The story is about a young boy named Jonas who is an eleven year old boy with special gifts  Because of these special gifts he is chosen to be the new Receiver when he turns twelve  Jonas lives in a utopian community  The Giver  is an older gentlemen who holds all the memories of the community  Once Jonas starts to receive memoris from the Giver he starts to change the way he sees his community and all that they have hidden  I enjoyed this book a lot I found the book powerful  It made me start to think about our community and how we live our lives  The most powerful part in the story for me was when the soldier lay dieing in the field  It made me realize how war is not a game  The only weakness in the book was the ending  I m still going back and forth about Jonas and Gabriel if they made it or not  I would definitely recommend this book to a friend  I remember when I first read this book  I closed it when I d finished and said to myself   That was an incredible book  The years have passed  I haven t wanted to read any of the sequels in the series  because I just didn t see how they could compare  One of my grad school profs in library school had been on the Newbery committee the year the award went to this book  and she played us a recording of Lois Lowry s speech With the movie coming out  I decided it was time for a reread So much that was new and fresh with The Giver has been copied now  Still  the book has its own incredible charm and Lowry s talent shines I listened to the audiobook this time  and feel that Ron Rifkin did a beautiful narration  He s not elaborate in voicing the different characters  but his voice bathes you in constant warmth  and he provides the chuckles of The Giver and the tears of anger and frustration of Jonas just so perfectly Now I think I am finally ready to read the other 3 books in the series Thank you  oh thank you  Lois Lowry  The Giver was flat out amazing   but i don t want to give away anything for those who haven t read it   Jonas lives in a community where no one can be different from one another  The community has adapted the concept of  sameness  so everyone can be equals  He has reached the age of 12 which means he receives his job and he is the Receiver  There hasn t been one for a long time and now the Giver has somebody to give the memories to  Jonas learns so many new things that nobody else in the community knows and he can t share that information either This is one of my favorite books  I ve read it several different times for other classes and I love when I get the opportunity to read it  It s a great story and it makes you look at society and has a lot of good comparisons and can be a great resource for some great discussions  Lois Lowry is a very creative author and I love her writing style   As an adult reading this book for the first time  I have to remember the intended target when considering a review  I found myself wanting more  an urge somewhat quelled by the availability of the remaining companion pieces  I say  somewhat  for a few reasons  No other book quite accomplishes what The Giver manages  in tone and quality of content  I also found myself wanting more within the original story  I wanted to get lost in the world of this novel  I wanted more exposition  more detail  more background  However  like I said  I understand that what I wanted was The Giver for an older and more patient audience   With that said  I give it five stars  It is intended for young people  and communicates a valuable message to those living in a world that often appears to support conformity and the mindless adherence to social constructs  As an education student  I recently spoke to a seventh grade class that was required to read this along with several other novels  This was not a class of Honors students  but a group of fairly typical middle schoolers with its not so enthusiastic attitude toward school and occasional behavioral issues  While their reviews of the other novels were lukewarm  the overwhelming majority of students  without prompting  named The Giver as the best book of the year  if not the best book they have ever experienced  That should be the primary goal for every author of young adult novels  and Lois Lowry nailed it   The Giver is about a boy named  Jonas  who lives in a Cornucopia  His world is very ordered and perfect  everything is planned out  Even his two parents and little sister were put together by their government  As each person turns twelve  they are given an assignment for the community  Jonas receives the assignment as The Receiver  where he is required to receive special memories from the Giver  The Giver is the only person who knows the truth about real life and Jonas is going to receive it all  It s hard work  but he has to do it This is one of the greatest books I have ever read  The world Jonas lives in is so fascinating  Everything is so perfect  yet at the same time I would absolutely hate living like that  They can barely make any decisions for themselves  they can t even choose what kind of career they want to have  I thought about how grateful I am for the world we live in today  It s definitely not perfect but I d rather be able to make my own choices and see in COLOR than have everything be so ordered and monotonous  The fact that Jonas leaves his perfect family and town to get to the real world is a perfect ending to the book  I even like that it kind of ends without us knowing exactly what happens because it leaves a lot open for imagination   Not usually a fan of science fiction but I LOVE this story  Really makes you think  The Giver is a story about Jonas who lives in a community that is different than ours   utopia   Jonas is elected as the receiver of memory in the ceremony of twelves  This is an important job for the community because if the people had the memories they would destroy the community  This is hard for Jonas because he has to learn about the memories of war  pain  and loneliness  I enjoyed the book very much  I liked how the community does not have memories and only up to 2 people can have those memories  Every chapter I read I wanted to read another  The end was too confusing for me and sometimes I had to ask someone what a phrase in the book ment  I would totally recommend this book to all of my classmates   At first I did not understand why this book ended the way it did At first I was upset with the way it ended  I was expecting Jonas and little Gabe to reach the end of Sameness    I got my hopes up  I thought that they would find happiness in the world  but then after putting much thought into the book and it s content  I realized that the only way out of Sameness was death  I mean  if you knew about color and emotion in a world without either of those things    Would anyone want to stay  I don t think Jonas understood Rosemary s decision to be Released until he found his own Release  When Jonas saw all these beautiful things and fell in love with Gabe    How could he and Rosemary   or even The Giver  who was burdened with all of the memories for so long   stay in that world full of Sameness  that world full of nothing  When you get a taste of something amazing  you can t just go back to Sameness  I definitely understand all of their decisions now and how Lois Lowry ended The Giver  Now that I understand the book and it s content  The Giver is absolutely one of my favorite books  LOVED LOVED LOVED this book  What a crazy story   what a world    what an author  I am so looking forward to Gabriel reading this for school  I cannot wait to hear his take on this  Once finished it had me looking at so many things differently all day long  And yesterday in the car I actually was thinking about the book out of nowhere when I passed this lush GREEN hill     This book is amazing  I must have read it through straight from beginning to end and then several times over  I have just ended the book  And it just left me in  i don t exactly know   Maybe confusion or sadness i m not sure  But i really liked the story really liked it because i like books that has a biiit of confusion just a bit  and it made me so curious in the last couple of chapters so i went on reading didn t stop because i wanted to know more i really wanted too  I havent read books like that for a while  However the book is short and it contains only 23 chapters it is GREAT to read a book with this kind of story  I highly recommend it   But i think that i m not reading the next book of the series because from the things i m reading is that the books are not connected as one series each book has its own story and its own characters so they are different   Book Name   The Giver  O Dador de MemoriasAuthor s  Lois LowryLanguage PortugueseOriginal Title  The GiverPublisher  year  Everest Editora 2010Page total  240Date Read  July 18thGenre s  YA  future  sci fi  fictionFirst line of Book  It was almost December and Jonas was beginning to be frightened  Review  Jonas lives in a so called utopian society where everything is decided by the Elders  At the age of 12  every boy and girl get a career assignment  Jonas is about to get his In the Ceremony  Jonas becomes the new Receiver of Memories  The Giver will now pass him all memories  good or bad  that have ever existed  Now  Jonas realizes this utopian world may not be as perfect as he thought This was enough to convince me  I love Lois Lowry    It was such an easy read and  well  I m going to re read it for sure It s a very interesting utopian dystopian world because it depends on your perspective  Okay  so there are no wars  no one starves and no more killings but where re the colors  the music  all those little things that make life worth living This is a must read for everyone Rating  5 5Quotes from book  The worst part of holding the memories is not the pain  It s the loneliness of it  Memories need to be shared    Loved this book  Read the entire thing  front to back  in three hours  This utopian   dystopian novel is amazing  This is the fourth time I ve read it  and I will read it again   AMAZING  I could not predict the ending  and I love books that can accomplish that big feat  I am still left wondering what actually happened to Jonas and Gabe  Did they make it  If you haven t read this book  I suggest picking it for a 2 day quick read  It is wonderful to think what our exsistence would be if we didn t have color  or pain  or joy  or anything like it  I almost feel sad for them The Giver is based on a world of  Sameness   Jonas is a young boy of 11 when the book begins and he grows to an almost 13 year old by the books end  He lives in a community where there is nothing different  ever  In the community  people do not even see color  They do not feel pain  joy  sadness  happiness  or even  and I can t believe this  Love  How is it possible  To live with out love  Honestly  my brain can not comprehend it  As a result  the community does not have memories other than what they create within their community  The community  releases  the old and also the babies if they are not up to par or twins  At first  the reader is lead to believe that  release  means they go somewhere else  out of the community  however  the read and Jonas sadly learn that release is something very different and literal  Death  It is heart breaking to read as Lois Lowry describes the release of one of the twins because he is not bigger than his brother  Such a shame  Unfortunately  I can imagine this has happened in our human past  Jonas is the new Receiver of memories and spends his time with the old Receiver who becomes The Giver  He learns many memories and sees many things  In his time  he realizes that something must change  He doesn t like the community once he realizes there are other things  Elsewhere   The story unfolds as Gabe  a young baby  with light eyes is nurtured by Jonas  father  Gabe is going to be released and Jonas decides to act  He runs away  Which is forbidden  The story ends as Jonas and Gabe ride down a hill of snow on a sled  It is up to the reader  I suppose  to decide if he found Elsewhere  This story has such a deep meaning  We are not all the same and nor should we ever try to be the same  We should try to be ourselves and embrace color and change and chance  In the community  they can not even chose their spouses  I know some countries that still choose a spouse because when you are young it is up to change to find the right person to spend the rest of your life with  Quite a big decision  really  I can understand wanting to control everything so that nothing is ever new and unexpected  however  our lives would be bland  No sunshine  No birds  No color  No cold  No hot  And worst of all  No love   That five star rating is from an earlier read  or memory of this novel This reading  it s more of a strong four stars In large part I wanted to reread this because next I am reading a brand new book by Lois Lowry set in this world called Son   I ve read Gathering Blue and Messenger  but rereading the first was as much as I would commit to   As I recall  I didn t love this novel the first time I read it  I thought it could have been more intense  like the story  Those Who Walk Away from the Omelas  by Ursula K  LeGuin  In rereading  I quite liked it and understood why it is so popular with middle schoolers and middle grade readers  In its invented setting  it is at once very real and immediate  I have two words to describe this book  BREATHTAKINGLY BEAUTIFUL  I couldn t rein up myself not to cry because this book is a compelling read  When I ve read the first pages  the heart warming narration of the book kept me reading it from page to page  I was an emotional wreck  I couldn t describe my feelings towards Jonas and The Giver  Their interactions me cry like a pansycake I ve actually thought that The Giver was like Delirium  where the society is engulfed in a Zombieland  And it also reminds me of The Book Thief  not only because of the  colours   but because it s a life changing and life affirming book  just like TBT I was planning to read it eons ago but then I get engrossed with other books  But I think it s a blessing in disguise for me because the plot will still be fresh in my mind in time for the book to movie adaptation Thank you  Lois Lowry  for your beautifully written novel  It s a kind of book that I want my children to read  If in case I ll have kids in the future   I rarely rate a book 5 stars but because The Giver is golden  I gave it five earth shattering stars  Good lord  I actually have an uncontrollable emotional attack again whilst writing this review  This is what a great book does to me  Un libro molto particolare  Si legge facilmente  lo stile e semplice e scorrevole  ma alla fine ti lascia un senso i frustrazione  Quella che nel libro e chiamata  Uniformita  puo essere vista come una forma molto estrema di globalizzazione  con in piu la mancanza totale di diversita  sentimenti e dolore  Una societa in cui gli umani sembrano piu degli automi e che esseri viventi  in cui e tutto regolato e tutto pianificato  in odo che nessuno possa provare piu il minimo dolore  Ma non provare il minimo dolore significa non provre piu alcun sentimento  e alla fine questo porta ad una non vita  Un monito che l autrice vuole darci sul futuro dell umanita  Probabile  di sicuro e un libro che va letto e va fatto leggere  soprattutto ai ragazzi  perche sono loro il futuro e devono cominciare a capire da subito la direzione che sta prendendo l umanita  A mio avviso  e stato davvero da irresponsabili censurare questo libro  One of my favorite books  I have read it many times  It s short enough to be able to read in one sitting  and the themes in it have stuck with me and made me think about life  and how diversity  both the good and the bad  are an important factor in life   It s the choosing that s important  isn t it  Jonas lives in a world of  Sameness  with his Mother  his Father  and his younger sister  Lily  It s a world governed by rules  by rigid structure  by conformity  Jonas enjoys his life  until he is selected to be The Receiver  His job  To receive the memories from The Giver of the past  And what the past unveils shows a drastically different world than Jonas lives in This week is Banned Books Week  and in honor  I selected this from the ALA Banned Book List  Some of the reasons included euthanasia  sexual awakening  and infantcide Another reason I chose this book is I love dystopias  and with the modern crop of hideously bad insanely stupid sloppily constructed dystopias for Young Adults  I thought I would return to the roots  to see one of the first  if not the first  Young Adult Dystopia novels In short  this book is brilliant  The dystopia works  the characters are great  the writing is excellent  and I was genuinely moved A lot of recent dystopias seem to have their world building constructed like a house of cards  one little sneeze  and the entire thing falls in your lap  With the exception of the giving and receiving of memories  Is Jonas genetically modified to be able to give and receive  Is this science  Magic  How does this happen    the world building is consistent  realistic  and understandable  People have been stripped of choices  they live in a sanitized  safe  world where no conflict exists  Families are created based on strict algorithms  people are assigned their jobs  their spouses  their children  The only books are those based on the rules of the society  People must be precise in their language  you don t just toss around the word  love  anymore What I thought was most amazing was how polite everyone was  To eradicate conflict  everyone was trained to immediately apologize for sins and to accept apologies  Debate  discord  arguments  all of these never occurred because there was no outlet  I felt sad about this  particularly because my hobby is reviewing  and if there is one thing I ve learned while reviewing  it s that everyone has a different opinion about everything  But in this society  such things as a difference of opinion would never have been cultivated or encouraged  we would never have debate  we would never argue and learn to be social  Instead  we would be silenced The characters were great  I really got close to Jonas  and there were at least two times when I was nearly moved to tears after something happened to him  I was astonished at how quickly and easily I great attached to him  it s truly a gifted author who can write her protagonist so well that the reader is so close to him after so short a time  Other characters  such as The Giver  Mother  Father  Lily  Asher  Fiona  may not have been the highlight  but they were well established  Asher s clumsiness with words  Lily s impetuousness  Father s nurturing  very interesting  as it is so often the woman is pigeon holed into this role    Mother s rationality  they hint at each being an individual  straining to be free in a Same society The writing is obviously for a younger reader  probably about middle grade  While I don t typically read middle grade books  I felt I was still able to enjoy it  that it wasn t too  dumbed down  As for why it is banned    poppycock  I think this is a perfect book for a middle schooler early high school student  While I might agree that a parent should be on standby for some scenes  just in case questions or discussion topics arise   I think this book is a great gateway into a better understanding of our world and the things we hold important  What better way to show a burgeoning young man or woman how valuable choice and love and the beauty of nature around us than to show a world that doesn t have any of that  What a better way to show kids to be engaged in everything around us  that life is precious  that emotions  good and bad  are important and healthy  The Giver  may not be the first dystopian novel nor the last  but it s still an important work that can teach everyone something new  If things like loving your family  the horrors of killing someone because they aren t  useful   and the gift of choice and the beauty of nature are things we don t want in our society  then sure  this book should remain banned  Personally  I WANT to love  I WANT choice  I WANT to see beauty  I WANT to feel and think and be and have different opinions than everyone else  I think the banning of this book is the highest form of irony  I know if I ever have kids  that I won t be banning it from them   The Giver   another magnificent book of  Lois Lowry   an author with immense imagination and creative mind made this book a breathtaking and inspirational story of life in a different world  A story that will inspire a lot of people about faith  love and courage  In the story  he made a world of people who cares about  alikeness   he made a world that is a dull place to live  People in that world doesn t know the cruelty they made until the protagonist of the story realized how life shoudln t be that way  The ending of the story is such a cliffhanger which is usually Lois Lowrys style And speaking of endings  its not yet the end of the story  Lois Lowry made an extension of  The Giver   which is his new book  Son     I loved this book    I love how the author made you think to find things out in the book instead of just telling you  the author makes you use your brain  I always hate when books end and usually critique how the books usually end  I did hate it when the book ended but I loved the way it ended  the mysterious ending and they way they are almost  dead   in a way makes  you want to read the other books in the giver quartet  I am so gonna read them            Can t wait  I am gonna definitally read some other books Lois Lowry has written     D     D                                          Overall Lois Lowry is an AMAZING author  I love her style  Personal Response I enjoyed this book immensely because it kept me interested the whole time and it moved quickly  I like the fact that it is set in a different type of world and it shows the reader how much different our society could be  Plot Summary  The book follows a boy named Jonas  He lives in a community where everything is decided for them and they can t show much emotion  When a child turns twelve they are given their job to contribute to society  If a person cannot contribute to society in any way they are to be released which the reader learns is death by a lethal injection  When Jonas turns twelve he is given the job  The Receiver  where he keeps everyone s memories inside his brain  Jonas must be trained by the current Receiver who calls himself  The Giver   The Giver must transfer all the memories he has and give them to Jonas  After Jonas starts receiving these memories he starts to see in color and realizes that there is more to life than contributing to society  Once Jonas has received the whole community s memories he decides to give the people their memories back  To do so he must go past the edge of the community  He starts his journey and experiences rough weather and almost dies of hypothermia  eventually Jonas makes it to the edge and the people get their memories back  Recommendations  I would recommend this book to kids ages middle school and up because the concept is fairly easy to understand and the book itself is really interesting  I would also recommend this to people who like books about the future or alternate worlds  A really well written book about the importance of guarding the rights of free speech and thought  I loved the symbolism of the red sled  Rosebud  anyone    There are lot of basic societal truths wrapped up in this story  We should all read this one  MY MOST FAVOURITE BOOK EVER                   I don t know what I was expecting  I m skeptical sometimes of books found in the young adult section as they are usually one extreme or the other    Very rarely do I read one that is just  okay  they re either great or they re terrible  This one may have raised the bar a bit Dystopian future in which everything is a shade of grey  both figuratively and literally  Love is not a concept that is understood  The color red is something that is not seen But one person in the community maintains these memories and is a reveared person in the community who they rely on in instances where a new situation is encountered and they need to rely on his her memories to make wise decisions A new  reciever   the memory keeper  is selected  and the old reciever starts training him    Feeding him memories  The description used to illustrate the protagonist waking up to a new concious is so vivid  It s an awakening in the reader too  as we are finding for the first time that all of these intimate details  emotion  color  weather  etc    were not described earlier in the book  Really well put together  Great character development  The horrors of the society I guessed a little early on  but that s not to the discredit of the writing    This is just what I ve come to expect of the genre  even if this was a fore runner for the recent surge in popularity of this setting  This was extracted from my blog  http   mybooksfilmtv blogspot co uk 2   The book follows the life of a boy  Jonas  from the age of 11   13 in a future society where choice has been removed from the world  Everyone is taught to be pleasant  to manage their emotions  and to conform to the Rules  When children become 12 years old  in his society  a group of elders decide what work they will spend the rest of their life doing  Jonas  because he seems to have a certain talent for  seeing beyond  is selected to be the Receiver  There is only one Receiver in the community  and s he holds the memories of the past society  The memories are needed to make wise decisions  but it was decided elders in the past that in order to maintain the  sameness  i e   conflict and keep order  only the Receiver of memories should be forced to experience the joys as well as the pain of life Jonas receives a year of training from the current Receiver  who he starts to call the Giver The writing flows very well as does the story  and as readers you make the journey with Jonas  discovering that further and further unsettling things about the community   What did I expect from The Giver  Not this  The Giver by Lois Lowry is a thinker  My first thought upon finishing this book what WHAT    Shortly followed by  I hate it when books do that   That last part is not strictly true  You know when you finish a book and it isn t wrapped up  So many loose ends  the book just ends  just like that and your left to decide what happens to a lot of the characters on your own  I used to hate  hate  hate it when books did that but I m happy to say I ve matured  Sidenote  Just found out is is the first in a four part series and weirdly  although my first thought was  I hate it when books do that   I m not really eager to read the rest of the series  I m quite happy with the ending  Whatever my previous self thought The Giver is set in a futuristic world where everyone is colour blind  people take pills to stop from feeling love and the Elders decide where you work  who you end up with and who your kids are  Until he becomes a 12 Jonas had no doubts about the world he lives in but when the Elders choose him as the next Receiver the way he sees the world changes  drastically    Jonas has a thought that he had never had before  This new thought was frightening  What if others   adults   had  upon becoming Twelves  received in their instructions the same terrifying sentence  What if they had been instructed  You may lie  His mind reeled  Now  empowered to ask questions of utmost rudeness   and promised answers   he could  conceivably  though it was almost unimaginable   ask someone  some adult  his father perhaps   Do you lie   But he would have no way of knowing if the answer he received was true    The Giver is a fascinating read  The idea of the Giver giving the memories to Jonas was my favourite part of the entire book  Seeing Jonas react to these thing he s never seen before  colours  snow  sun  love  christmas  was almost mind blowing and really well done     Do you love me   There was an awkward silence for a moment  Then Father gave a little chuckle   Jonas  You  of all people  Precision of language  please   What do you mean   Jonas asked  Amusement was not what he had anticipated  Your father means that you used a very generalised word  so meaningless that it s become almost obsolete   his mother explained carefully Jonas stared at them  Meaningless  He had never before felt anything as meaningful as the memory  And of course our community can t function smoothly if people don t use precise language  You could ask   Do you enjoy me   The answer is  Yes    His mother said  Or   his Father suggested    Do you take pride in my accomplishments   And the answer is wholeheartedly  Yes   Do you understand why it s inappropriate to use a word like love   Mother asked Jonas nodded   Yes  thank you  I do   he replied slowly  It was his first lie to his parents   I would be lying if I said I didn t enjoy this book or if I didn t give it five stars  An engaging and fresh read  I would definitely recommend  This Books is original and clear  It is easy to read and hard to put down  It is one of the few books that has made me shed tears  I strongly recommend it   Review for  The Giver Memories  Memories can be a precious gift and a curse  Remembering the past may be the greatest gift of all  but once it is taken away the feelings you once felt before are now gone  One courage s  perceptive young boy was about to change the view of people and society  Jonas is an 11 year old boy who from birth was very different  From the start of the book in  The giver  the author makes an the reader interested in a topic many people can relate too  Many people can relate to being different an standing out in the world  Jonas lived in a world were society was being controlled and memories and thoughts were being suppressed  Emotions and feelings were taking away from people  The author takes the feelings of emotion and memories to real life connections so that the reader may relate to the story in a true connection with him or herself  With people not being able to feel or act on there own society was quickly corrupted and took advantage off  Jonas lived in a society were jobs and life s were planned out for you  When it was Jonas s turn to find out his career  Author makes believe it is fate that chose him the job of the giver  The givers job to take or replace memories that have been in people life  Jonas was able to be given this job because of his uniqueness and differentia from people  Jonas was not like normal people in the society were everyone was the same  instead of regular blue eyes Jonas was given different eyes  The author Lois Lowery makes the stories interesting by making life changing in life were people would need to find the answers and must face difficult outcomes  The difficulty choices Jonas had to make were unbearable for him  Soon the previous Giver was able to help Jonas  Soon after Jonas was coming clear to everything he was seeing about society and the world  He knew it was wrong how they were living in the community  Jonas quickly resolved to people and finding answers  Lois Lowery makes the main character have perception skills so that reader may look past and beyond the thinking of man kind  People s way of thinking and memories that are treasured by people and overpowering  Knowing Memories are overpowering the people don t follow Jonas  Later making a new friend along the was Jonas figures out a way out of the community to explore the true reality of thoughts and memories The Giver is a book that relates a lot to peoples emotions  thoughts and view point on many certain things  The author did a very nice job of making like connections to connect to the reader  Catching the Audience with real life connections make the story more realistic and meaning for the reader  Many reasons the author also made the book into a perceptive view point is of the perspective view point the main character has to devolved the story and advances its true meaning   This is definitely the type of book that lends itself to discussion  if you d like to read a discussion of it  go here There are so many ideas in this short book to mull over  such as the loss of emotion leading to losing the ability to see color  which could lead to the idea that what you don t use  you lose  So  letting others think for you and make all the decisions leads more and more to a strong dependency on having others make all decisions  And I love it when an author leaves events open to the reader s interpretation  I think the ending is perfect  because the reader can decide what it means or what you want it to mean  But it also means that I definitely want to read the rest of the trilogy As with almost all dystopian novels  this shows how good intentions often go too far  and so many positive things are given up or lost in the search for utopia  This book is so good  I don t have the words to describe it  This perfectly imagined world started out by giving me a riveting case of the creeps  and ended up giving me a lyrical vision of faith in the human spirit  Lois Lowry peeled away this community s suspiciously idyllic layers bit by bit  drawing me in with burning curiosity  What was wrong with this place  these people  Everyone seemed kind  helpful  and well adjusted   each appreciated for his or her role in the community  Yet something was terribly wrong  In a perfect world   free of conflict  pain  or uncertainty   the price is horrifying conformity  I was moved to find that the power of memory held the key that might set one person free  and that one person s generosity might have the power to save everyone Jonas is turning 12  the age when he ll receive his assignment  a career that isn t his to choose  but which the elders base on their observation of his talents  Most kids his age have some inkling of their skills  but Jonas has no idea where he fits in  He only knows that sometimes when he looks at things they change before his eyes   an apt metaphor for growing up  It turns out his assignment is the only one of its kind  During his training  he discovers that the world used to be different  adults didn t have their spouses assigned to them  children didn t take medication at the first hint of pain  and rule breakers weren t always  released  from the community   an ominous threat that fills Jonas with curiosity and dread The Giver trains Jonas in his new role  which will place the well being of the community in his hands  But what is really in the best interest of his community  a life free of pain  or a life free to choose  Like every young person on the brink of adulthood  he confronts the reality of human weakness  and the mistakes of the past  No matter what Jonas decides  he ll have to make a sacrifice  and his life will never be the same  This book reminded me of Madeleine L Engle s  A Wrinkle in Time   one of my favorites  It also called to mind the TV miniseries   The Prisoner   That s not to say  The Giver  was unoriginal  On the contrary  Each of these stories explores the dangers of conformity and the power of love  but in very different ways   I once heard an interview about a man that escaped as a young man from North Korea  He had always lived in a prison camp and said   I thought the whole world was like that   I almost felt as if he were describing how Jonas might have felt  It made me think that sometime fiction  even science fiction  is not so far from reality  This book was excellent  I would highly recommend it for the middle school student    or even an adult    I m not gonna lie  this book starts out slow  But then it gains a momentum that pushed me forward through the book like I was hauling a two ton Winnebago down a mountain  And by the time it ended  I was wishing for more  More book to read  More of this fabulous and impactful story  More  More  More The Giver is a dystopian Young Adult novel published in 1993  so its been around a while  The story is told from the point of view of a young man about to turn twelve and receive the assignment of the job he will perform in his society for the rest of his life  Jonas is chosen to be the receiver of memory  a prestigious position that requires him to hold all the memories of all communities and people from all the years past  As Jonas finds out  it is a difficult job wrought with horrors and pain  and one he must bare alone  never to reveal the secrets of the past to anyone else in his community  Faced with a catapulting event  Jonas must decide what to do with his knowledge and power  and how balance his own wants and desires with the best interest of the community This was a really powerful book and I can see why the gold label on the front is stamped with so many awards  This book left me   thinking  Two days later  I m still thinking about it  So  if you like a thinker  this book is for you I highly recommend The Giver for readers in the 12 and up age range  I think the lessons and themes in the book are accessible to the younger readers  and older readers will also gain deeper insights into the book  If you have a child in this age range  I can imagine it would be a great book to read together or aloud  The Giver by Lois Lowry is a great book  The genre of this book is a dystopian fiction  This book is about this boy called Jonas who lives in a   perfect   world where there is no fear nor war  Jonas goes to school with a age group called the twelves  But something happen at the ceremony of twelves people get to chose what is your job  Based on your information about you  Actually this book was not recommended to me it was given to me by my 7th grade teacher  My favorite scene in the book is when the council tells Jonas his job  The reason why I like the scene is because it creates suspense  My favorite character is Jonas he is my favorite because he takes charge and is brave  What surprise me about the book is Jonas dose something you wont believe  i will give this book a five star  i will recommend this book for any one who likes dystopian fiction  A classic  Still one of the best books I ve ever read  The protagonist Jonas was selected for the new receiver of memory  He lives in a community of sameness along with his mother  father  and little sister Lilly  Later on Gabriel has been added to their family unit because the nurturers can t care for him anymore  Jonas is receiving memories from the past  back and back and back  The before receiver is now called the  Giver   Jonas is reminded that his training of receiving memories will be painful  but it will increase his knowledge  Jonas and the Giver are planning to do something for the community to receive all the memories and knowledge that the past receivers of memory have kept back and back and back  I would recommend this book to people who like reading Fiction novels  and like to read novels that are a series  A quote that I chose from the book is   With the chant  Jonas knew  the community was accepting him and his new role  giving him life  the way they had given it to the newchild Caleb  His heart swelled with gratitude and pride  But at the same time he was filled with fear  He did not know what his selection meant  He did not know what he was to become  Or what would become of him   I chose this quote because it shows how Jonas felt towards his new job and he never knew what would come next  Overall  reading this book increased my vocabulary  and I learned lots about his community and I am prepared to read the next book  I thought the author wrote this book to  get a glimpse of a new future Even if it most likely won t happen   But for people to think in this book  because before you get to the climax  Lois Lowry gives you hints and you need to keep reading and predicting until you figure it out   Synopsis Jonas has grown up in a perfect Utopia of a world  where everyone is free from pain  there are no wars  and everyone works for the good of the community  On Jonas s twelfth birthday he is picked to the the Giver s apprentice  When the Giver begins to give memories to Jonas of another world  a world that used to be it changes everything  Jonas s world may not be as perfect as it once seemed Review I ve always loved The Giver ever since I got to read it in High School  I was so happy that it was on the syllabus because I couldn t wait to read it again and have the story fresh in my mind  The parts where Jonas is receiving memories are some of my favorite literary passages ever  Lowry s language is beautiful and flows  her characters are interesting and their drives and motives are unique  I loved the ambiguous ending  and I have fond memories of discussing it in the past  The novel has a lot of action in it but it never reads quite like that  There s so much going on in the character s minds  so it s more of an intellectual war than anything else  It s about the right to freedom  choices  happiness  and indulging in the good things  The book questions if stabilized life is worth it if we can feel nothing  For generations this book has been a classic and I hope and believe that it s importance to us will never die out Content warnings  The society they live in does some pretty awful things to some of the babies that are born and the government represses it s people pretty firmly  This is my all time favorite book and I have read  re read and will read it again  This was pretty much the first  Hunger Games   Divergent  type book back before the whole post apocalyptic world thing became a fad and it set the bar high  The theme in the book The Giver by Lois Lowry is that both freedom and individuality are needed to create a balanced society  This book takes place in the future during the winter in a town the residents call the Community  The Community shelters the residences from the chaotic outside world  The book s point of view is in the third person limited perspective of Jonas  a twelve year old boy  The Community was made to keep order in society  This means no freedom of choice or diversity  Some central characters are the Giver  an old man who holds the memories of the Community  and helps make decision with the Committee of Elders  the leaders of the Community  Some side characters are Jonas  father  who is a nurturer and delivers babies  his friend Ashur  and Gabriel  a newborn baby Jonas  family cares for at night  The book starts with Jonas going to the ceremony of twelve  This is where one in the community is assigned their job for their whole life  Jonas is assigned a very prestigious job called the receiver of memory  In this job one receives memories from the Giver  so that when the Giver dies the receiver would become the new Giver and the memories of the Community will not be lost  As Jonas works with the Giver he begins to see that a society without war  murder  and overall violence is not worth sacrificing all hope  happiness  and art  Now it is up to Jonas to change the restricting lives they live  The Giver is a great book in many ways  One of these ways is the descriptive language that paints a picture  As Jonas received memories from the Giver he thought   This time the hands didn t become cold  but instead began to feel warm on his body  They moistened a little  The warmth spread  extending across his shoulders  up his neck  onto the side of his face  He could feel it through his clothed parts  too  a pleasant  all over sensation  and when he licked his lips this time  the air was hot and heavy   84 85   The description used in these sentences demonstrates the way Lois Lowry writes throughout the book  Lowry continues to use extensive description of memory in the book  Memory to humans is very important  Without it humans are mentally the same  It is needed to shape opinions and to have happiness and sadness  In life if one is to experience something like a movie  thrilling and exciting  and not be able to recall what that felt like because of a lack of memory  how are they able to feel excited or thrilled when they have no recollection of how they felt when they experienced it  One of the strengths of this book is the great description of memories Jonas has  Points of this book can be slow and low in action  I would recommend this book to person who enjoys books with elaborate imagery and not much action  This is an amazing book  rightly a classic   should be required reading for the human race  The Giver  by Lois Lowry  is one of the most memorable books that I recall reading in school as a child  This book is a fantasy novel for young adults  written in the future in a utopian society  The book is mainly about a young teen names Jonah  The society is meant to make everyone the same  and therefor eliminate competition and bad feelings  Obviously  this system does not work  I rated this book 5 stars because Lowry managed to tackle a very difficult topic  yet she does so at a level that a middle school aged child can understand  This book deals with topics such as good vs evil  conformity  and standing out  The story can  should  make the reader feel uncomfortable as it begins to detail difficult topics such as  releasing   killing  those who should not be living in their society  Some people have criticized this book as well as the award it has been given because it is not the most original story   there have been many stories which take place in a dystopia type world  However  I feel that this book is written with a tremendous about of care and sensitivity  and I recall it being used as a launch pad to discuss even more horrific topics such as Nazi Germany  I feel that this book is very important  yet it just be read aloud with children with a careful hand  by a teacher who has a good grasp of the class and where they stand on a maturity level   Honestly loved this book to peices  this book got me back into reading  My 8th grade teacher read this to us and we were all upset we were reading a book  Once we got reading we started to love it  its a great story and should be read by all  However the movie doesnt capture it very well they could have kept somethings the same  You should read the book first before going to see the movie becuase the movie doesnt capture the book as well but the cast is amazing  They couldnt have chosen a better cast  Besides Ender s Game  this book alone  not including whole series  because Heroes of Olympus would win out  might be my favorite    ever  Allow me to set the premise  Picture a utopian society  no crimes  no fear  everyone in perfect harmony  In that  community   there is a citizen named Jonas  who approaching the age of twelve  Every time a citizen turns a certain age  a ceremony is held  Jonas s ceremony  the Ceremony of Twelve  quite obviously  is the most important  and last  ceremony that he will fore take At the Ceremony of Twelve  will be abriviated as Cot  each new year is given an assignment  more or less a job  However  Jonas has the situation a bit different  He is given the  selection  of being the Receiver of Memory  A Receiver of Memory works with the preceding Receiver to receive memories of the past  to feel such emotion and power Sounds awesome  right  Now Jonas has the ability to lie  differ from the people  sure  he has no permission to tell people what happens in his hours working  But honestly  a pessimist would have to be optimistic about this  Until one piece of information is revealed  Jonas must suffer not only physical pain  but mental pain as well  Well  Pessimist  you can break into the conversation  Yes  I can hear your retorts  Don t spoil the book  now  I won t pay you if you don t shut up  Thank you  Anyways  it s a great  fascinating  thought provoking read with many shocks to keep the reader up all night  The Giver is the dystopian sci fi YA to rule them all  The Hunger Games series and the Divergent trilogy owe so much to Lowry  And Lowry does it so exquisitely and succinctly  Her writing is enormously fastidious  precise  and stealthy  I wonder how much a typical teen gleans from the novel on first reading  As an adult  this will keep me thinking for a long time  If you have not read this book  why not  You should  Really  Jonas was the 19th child born 12 years ago  Every child that is born in a year has their annual ceremony in December and hits certain milestones with all the others of their year  When they have their twelfth ceremony they are assigned to the jobs that they will have as adults and they stop having ceremonies or keeping track of their age  After each child is given their assignment they are told  Thank you for your childhood   Jonas is given what he and everyone are assured is a great honor when he is selected to be The Receiver of Memories      there will be intense pain and the last person selected was an utter failure  but it is a great honor  When he meets The Giver and begins receiving memories of all the Receivers past his entire life will change    and everything he has been raised to believe will be revealed as the most horrible of fictions Despite it s brevity The Giver is a masterwork     it haunts you long after you ve finished it and makes you ponder the world and the things we as people do to make our lives more easy  What are we willing to give up in order to avoid making mistakes or feeling pain  Upon finishing this book  not 20 minutes ago  I m left with several thoughts 1  This book should be required reading for everyone with the emotional maturity to handle it   I believe that blindly labeling The Giver as a children s book is neither realistic nor necessarily wise  in some instances  Parents would be well advised to thoroughly screen it before offering it to an emotionally sensitive child to read  2  Very few things leave me mentally stuttering as I struggle to put my thoughts into words  but  somehow  The Giver has done just that  It will take me a while to be able to make sense of  not the story  but my response to it 3  The Giver is a deftly crafted work  both stunningly beautiful and deeply disturbing    Finding myself being imperceptibly lulled by the peace  order  safety and serenity of Jonas s world  being awakened by the sickening thud of reality s steel toed boot in the gut  leaving both him and me breathless and disoriented in the aftermath  This story is haunting and powerful  It s a raw portrayal of the presumed moral sacrifices that man would have to make in order to create and maintain a Utopian society  and the acceptable naivety of the horrors that would accompany it Perhaps what is most frightening to me is the way I so easily assumed  at first  that Jonas saw the world as I do   that the words were being used in the way I understood them  The realization that his newly deposited knowledge gives him is almost terrifying  definitely unnerving  The depth of my emotional response still has me reeling 4  This is NOT a happy ending  feel good read    although I suppose it could be for those who read books without truly experiencing them  but I don t know how to do that  so for me it was a painful experience  I m glad I read it  as it s made me think about things in a way I wouldn t have otherwise  and I appreciate that  I don t know that I would have read it had I known how real Jonas s and the Giver s pain would be to me  This book moved me in ways I did not expect it to  The writing was so simplistic yet beautiful and the themes and messages were powerful without being overwhelming  An exceptionally well thought out and written story  especially for being a children s book It moves at a fast pace but doesn t really leave you feeling that you wanted more  There is room for own interpretation  yet it is satisfying and does not beat around the bush When you really stop to think what your memories mean to you  and how we often assume knowledge of the past a given  when those things are taken away from us we will be in a world without wisdom  which is a dangerous place to be in This book conveys such a powerful and important message in the easiest way  that I can truly say it is a must read for everyone  It definitely deserves its 5 5 stars from me   The Giver was about a boy that was learning what his job was to be  He was the receiver  Which means he had to learn of all the memories  There were no memories in this town  He learned of all these things and decided he was going to leave and take a baby that was scheduled to be killed  They escaped  but barely  They then fled into the uncharted areas I liked the plot and they way the story was made up  I also liked how hey learned slowly  Another thing i liked was the way he felt about the giver Some thing i didn t like was the way the people couldn t feel the way he did  I also didn t like how he was punished for the stuff that was right  Another thing i didn t like was how long the book was  A perfect world  A world without crime or sickness  But in the pursuit of these things what price has been paid  What does it mean to be human and the attempts to control that so complete of human conditions  A must for every young reader  I m not quite sure how to describe this book  Yes  I gave it 5 stars  because I enjoyed it as much  But enjoyment is not quite the right word  And if you read the book  you ll know what I mean It is more of a novel than a book  only 132 pages long  One could read it in one sitting   as I did  It is highly thought provoking  This story dramatizes ideas of utopia gone wrong  It is a story of a boy  Jonas  who lives in a society where everything is controlled  ruled by order  where life is created for their citizens  From who gives birth  to how the newchildren are raised  to what is allowed  what is unacceptable behaviour  what is taught in school  how to speak  how to behave  who s job is what  who one can take as a mate  marry   Everything  They are also required to always use precise language to express themselves  there are specific times each day where feelings are shared and talked about  as are dreams  All is decided and governed by the Council of Elders  Everything is always the same  There are words which have lost their meanings  such as hunger  warfare  pain  even love  Noone knows what these mean since people created the Sameness  Everyone and everything is well controlled  everyone and everything is the same  Everything is  safe   Wouldn t it be wonderful to live in a peaceful world  where there is no injustice  no grief  no pain  no hunger or war  Where everything is always the same  predictable and safe  Where people live the life that was created for them  To live not knowing about anything  Life without pain  fear or past  To live in blissful ingnorance  Would that even be life  Not as welnow it  but would it be good and safe  Would it be better  But is it  Jonas is a Receiver of Memories  Memories of the past  of what life was like before the Sameness  He is the only one who  as receiving the memories from the Giver  starts to experience what colour  understand how it was before  And begin to question his reality  his present  There are aspects of this society that can be viewed as sound and desirable  but others make the hair on the back of your neck stand up  Still  this society functions and has been functioning as is  for generations  They have given up a lot  but also gained a lot  Was it worth it  Is it worth it  To eliminate hunger  war and pain do we need to live in a controlled society such as this  The ending is surprising to the point that it left me wondering  what the hell just happened   Is that it  I turned the page and      nothing  Nothing is resolved  we won t find out what happens to the main characters  to the ones left behind  How and why  I m flabbergasted  still reeling from it  This is a story that everyone should read  This book will remain with me for a very long time and I will defintiely recommend it to friends  It will raise discussions on so many levels  topics worth talking about  investigated  mulled over  Read it and think   The Giver presents a world of the future in which there is no pain  no fear  no fighting  and no decisions for anyone  All children are raised in the same manner  until their twelfth birthday when they each receive a lifelong role in the community  Jonas is singled out from the other children and is sent to learn his role from the Giver  The Giver keeps all memories  of joy and pain of real life  While learning from the Giver  Jonas makes some startling revelations and embarks on an unbelievable experience   While reading The Giver  I made a text to world connection  The controlled existence that Jonas was born into reminds me of Communism  Communism takes away so many choices from people and is structured so that no one stands out from others and that each and every person is equal in the community  As with those who escape the oppression of Communism to the freedom of democracy  Jonas learns what life is like away from the constraints of the community   I would definitely give this book 5 stars  It is exciting  thought provoking  and carries the reader at a fast pace  I enjoyed getting to know Jonas and how he views life with the Giver  It made me appreciate living as we do in a democracy  The vocabulary is excellent and the book provokes thought long after you turn the final page  I would recommend The Giver to anyone who is looking for a book that stretches the imagination yet makes you reflect on the life you live now   I think this book is a must for Book Clubs and Teachers  It s beautifully written  and the author really knows how to communicate all the ideas    it has the exact amount of words an descriptions  each chapter is an amazing experience  because each one gives us so many topics to discuss The world Lowry created is a world without mistakes  everything is calculated and measured  people can t choose what to do in their lives because someone chooses for them  So  nobody makes mistakes because everything is studied and if something goes wrong  well  there s always the chance of  release     but what about freedom   What do we prefer  Living in a world of freedom  or living in a world free of mistakes and surprises  What is the cost of living this way  What about the people that doesn t fit  What happened to the people that lived through the process of going  sameness  There are so so many things that this book leaves open to imagination  and it s full of moral lessons everywhere  I d really love to discuss this book with other people because I think it s been written in a way that every person could make its own conclusions and thoughts Beautiful book   Thank you Lois for making me re think many aspects of the way we live  Questo libro mi e piaciuto davvero tanto e ha superato ogni mia aspettativa  The Giver e un libro potente  che tratta di temi forti  come l infanticidio  l eutanasia e la sessualita  di cui non ci si occupa tanto  soprattutto nella letteratura per ragazzi  e comunque non in maniera cosi esplicita  Rientrando completamente nel genere distopico  questo libro racconta la storia di Jonas  un ragazzino che vive in un mondo  perfetto   o forse no    Il posto in un cui vive viene chiamato Comunita e li tutto e deciso  programmato e uniforme  Jonas e nato in questo posto e crede che sempre la gente abbia vissuto in questo modo  non e capace di pensare a un mondo differente da quello in cui si trova  Quando pero arriva il giorno della Cerimonia dei Dodici  in cui a ogni ragazzino di dodici anni viene assegnato il compito  che dovra svolgere per la Comunita durante la sua vita  a lui viene assegnato un ruolo completamente fuori dall ordinario  lui viene scelto come Accoglitore delle Memorie  E a questo punto che tutto inizia a cambiare  Il libro e corto e veloce da leggere  ma ti lascia tantissimo  anche grazie allo stile semplice dell autrice che sembra rendere ancor piu efficaci le cose che racconta  Mi ha veramente colpito  cosi potente nella sua semplicita  L unica cosa forse che mi ha lasciata un po  interdetta e il finale ma voglio leggere gli altri tre libri della saga  qualcuno li ha letti  Me li consigliate    Ad ogni modo questo e un libro che fa pensare e credo che ognuno dovrebbe prendersi qualche ora per leggerlo   4 5 Ahh  this book is so good  A really good kid s dystopian novel  My only real issue with this book is that it s so short  The beginning of the novel is set at a really nice pace  but so much time passes in just a few pages and the story line definitely could ve been dragged out more  The ending also leaves much to the imagination and I just find myself wanting to know more  There are other books in the series  but I read them a long time ago and I don t think they expand on the plot of this one  but I could be wrong  Jonas is a really interesting and three dimensional character  The world they live in is really interesting to read about and to think about   a world without real emotion  I really just wish this book were longer because it s so interesting and she could ve done so much with the world building  but maybe she didn t think kid s attention spans were long enough  I know I read this for the first time in sixth grade  Awesome read  Awesome re read  Definitely recommend  I read this book about 10 times from my childhood up until high school  Time for a reread  I loved this book and I think it shows how the future might become  This book was about a futuristic world where everything was the same  There was no color  weather  landscape  or choice  Everything is perfect to most people but not to Jonas  who starts to see color  in an apple and in his friend Fiona s hair  When they select the jobs for everybody Jonas gets to be the reciever of memory  He gets all the memories  good and bad  and has to store them  The current receiver of memory   The Giver   gives Jonas the memories and tells him to go past the line of memory  where once passed all the memories would return to people  In the end Jonas runs passed the line of memory and finds another community   I love this book so much I read it once a year at least  What a book   I cannot believe how the author made her idea come to life  The book is written in a very straight forward manner while not complicating  anything  whatsoever  The writing was beautiful  the plot was of very high quality  making you feel so many different emotions at the non emotional world and how the protagonist starts to understand what it means to love  to suffer and to feel pain while still not making it too tough for the reader to handle  Though it was a bit terrifing how the plot swayed Jonas s emotions while at the same time swaying yours which I must admit was very clever of the author since it made me also feel for the character more  I understand why it was awarded  I would have awarded it too  The main character was really well developed into a strong and determined person with a sense of rightness  Many people say that they didn t like the ending and that it was too simple and I get that but there was something about the ending that made me actually keep thinking about what the author was saying long after I ve finished the last page  which almost always happens after I ve read a book that I ve liked   Here is my review Jonah has finally reached the December of his 12th birthday  just like all of his classmates and will be attending the last ceremony of his childhood where he will be chosen for a job like the others  All of them  have been slowely analysed and looked on by the Elders since they could breath and now the time has come when they will be assigned the duty that s said to be the best for them  He is chosen to be the Memory Keeper or the Reciever  every 10 years one is chosen to hold the memories of life before Sameness  before the Community  before the life that they knew of  back and back and back  The role is said to be very important and is looked apon with great honor  But what if life without pain and without suffering isn t perfect  what if perfection actually comes from imperfection  What if suffering  pain and everything that we ve been freed of makes us also free of real happiness  sunshine and most importantly the freedom to love  From the award winning author  Lois Lowry  comes a tale of memories  overcoming the impossible and the true meaning of freedom I think this quote really suits this unforgatable book   To live is the rarest thing in the world  Most people exist  that is all      Oscar WildeIf all of your choices were made for you it would be easy wouldn t it  Especially if the choices were right  after all  what if you took the wrong turn  But isn t to experience sunshine or to feel snowflakes on your cheeks  just a reminder if you haven t read the book  they have never heard the words  sunshine  or  snow  and never seen or experienced it  you first have to open the door and step outside  you have to understand that it could be very possible for you to stumble  fall and scrape your knee but you would be willing to let it go for the sake of being your own I hope you would be willing to make the choice and a risk of reading this book     Interest level  High Reading level  Medium Links  http   www cliffsnotes com study_guid    I loved this book  The writing is wonderful  the characters are simple yet powerful  and the whole setting is so unique and interesting  The only thing I didn t like was the ambiguous ending Seeing Jonas discovering the truth about his community was heartbreaking  that loss of innocence that we all experience as we learn about the world growing up  Even the perfect world that Jonas lives in has a dark underside I loved how the importance of language was woven into the story  using exactly the correct word for the right thing  and then how it factored into Jonas  realizations about the people around him and the world he thought he knew The philosophy about individuality and the freedom to choose were really deep concepts for a children s book  but that is exactly the age when young people begin to fight for their own individuality apart from their parents  and they start to experiment with the responsibility of being able to choose  Wonderfully handled  and a powerfully good message Spoilers      I was especially struck with the scene where Jonas realizes that his father has killed the baby  The horror of that moment for him  Someone he trusted to be kind has done a terrible thing  There s no word for that kind of shock and terror  And obviously  it was wrong to kill the baby  Jonas later gives up everything to save another baby  So why is it that our society looks the other way while thousands of babies are killed every day through abortion  Is our society any better than the one in the book  where they suppress their feelings and kill helpless children  I say no  We ARE living in that society  happily  stupidly following the herd  and doing nothing while babies die  If only there were more like Jonas  who refuse to turn a blind eye  maybe things could change   No wonder this beat Diary of a Wimpy Kid in YA Book Madness  I simply loved this book  Everyone who knows me will be like  oh  well  what a surprise  but really  guys  this is an awesome dystopia 1   The world building makes a lot of sense  Nothing seems forced or unnatural  A lot of things stay unexplained and might cause a headache with people that like to ask  how    Me not being one of them   You ve got climate control and there s no sun anymore  Well  awesome  I d like to know how that feels    I enjoyed reading the Giver  2   Finally  a dystopia without bloody fighting  I already lost all my hopes here  3    The Giver  made me think about a lot of concepts that we accept as given  Colour  for example  Sure  deep down we all still believe that life has been black and white once  it s in the movies   but how would a person that sees colour for the first time describe it  And what if you had a memory of everything that ever happened to anyone    could you bear the grief  fear and pain   view spoiler    I wonder how the managed to have such a long succession of Givers  at least neither Rosemary nor Jonas did respond well to the training      hide spoiler   The Giver  leaves me with a lot of questions and even though I know the answers are not in the book  chances are that I will pick the book up in a couple of weeks and read it again  And again  And if that gets boring  I can buy the DVD  the movie was just as good     I really liked this book  It was about a boy who lived in a perfect community  There was no color  no feelings  and no choices  Everything was the same  The children don t even have birthdays  They only have  numbers  in which each year they have a new role  Once Jonas has reached the age of 12 he is given the role of  the receiver   He has the power to have all of the memories  Throughout his training he realizes the truth of his community  He and the giver have a plan to make a change to the community  The end of this book leaves you wanting more  I can t wait to read the next book and find out what happens   The Giver was such an unforgettable story  I remember accompanying my father to his classes and their teacher currently talking about a book they were reading  My dad explained that it was so far very intriguing  soon enough I was curious and checked it out to read on my own  Next thing I know  I m questioning life and the way things ran in our present time  leaving me to explore new futures and other human s vision of the way they see society  This story brought out the life  I was so fascinated by the way it was well put and the plot of it all  It felt as if I was in the world itself  completely blocking out our current time  it s like they always say  the book s story can be so good realistic you can literally get lost in it and having a growing imagination with more and more interest as the book goes on Jonas character  I felt  gave adventure and wonders to the book  The way his thoughts are considered out of the ordinary  and ubscured in his community  is eye opening  as if the roles were reversed n some lawful way  He then is accompanied by his two close friends  Fiona and Asher  Their way of living  their community  government and how things were runned was very new and awestrucking The story outline is so well put  this book is a definate page turner  A book that is very engrossing  you just wouldn t be able to put it down  Greatly recommend for those who are inquisitive about books who tell unique visions of future times and discovering new view points and prepective thoughts about creating utopias distopias  I was not a fortunate student forced to read this book in grade school  I do  however  wish I were  This was such a beautifully written book  very well imagined that the visions in my own imagination came alive  LL painted a whole new world  a community and place where there were no risks  no pain or beauty  It was a place of bland sameness  No color  no feelings other than a literal feeling  no feelings of overwhelming joy  nor anger or love  For somebody  anybody  who feels this all the time  these feelings  how can you begin to fathom a life like that  LL makes it real  makes you really think what it would really be like to live there  I will be honest  the ending     it was so open  What happened to Jonas and Gabriel    We re they welcomed in this beautiful community with Christmas trees and fireplaces  Dd they crash on the sled before they could get there  I will have to read the remaining three books in this quartet    I look forward to seeing this movie  I hope they stay true to the book and don t stray too far from its purpose   I really enjoyed the book The Giver By Lois Lowry  The Setting in this story is in a perfect world where everything is supposedly perfect but not everything is what it seems  When Jonas is chosen to be the new giver he sees that his father and best friend Fiona have to release people where his father has to stick a needle in a child s head and the child dies and then they send it out of their community  Jonas can also see color no one else in his community can see color the first color he can see is red and it was the color of his best friends hair Fiona  also in the book everyone takes a shot in the mornings and it makes it so you do not feel and you can t see color  When Jonas is told to not take the shot by The Giver he starts to feel things for his best friend and the new child his father brought home  After a week Jonas father is forced to bring the child Gabriel and release him but Jonas doesn t allow that  He runs and he comes to a house and meets a family like he saw in his memories  I would recommend this book to everyone i loved this book it is one of my favorites   The Giver is about the future  and a kid named Jonas  The people and Jonas have assigned jobs  they don t get to choose who they get married to  or there children  they don t even know what books are   Hah   Except there is one difference between Jonas and the people around him  they don t see in color  He does  And when Jonas gets picked for a special job  he becomes a totally different person   I loved The Giver  it s ending is almost like a mystery  It s a book that doesn t have an actual ending that tells you what happens  I think the author Lois Lowry did this on purpose  It s however YOU interpret the ending  I am having a difficult time putting my thoughts to words on this book  I thought it was beautiful but dark and sad and then joyously worry free at the same time  To live in a society without hatred and or prejudices sounds amazing  until you factor in the lack of the right to choose your own destiny or the ability to feel strong emotions like love But the book is more than this utopia dystopia  it is an exploration of the desire to make changes  relationships  communication and inner turmoil  I was very much emotionally invested in Jonas and then also Gabriel  Without being overly descriptive  the scenes and people are set in a distinctive way  I found myself wondering why a lot of the time and most of those questions were unanswered but that leaves it open to the imagination  I felt the ending was a bit abrupt and I kept trying to advance the page until I realized the struggle was over  And I do have more questions on the ending but that is how the author wanted it to be  I think this would be a great read for kids to lead to discussions on society  choices and behaviors  I would love to hear the different variations of how kids finish the story  What happens to Jonas and Gabriel I see there are two more books in the series  My initial thought is to read them as quickly as possibly but maybe I want to savor my imagination created ending a bit more  the best book i ever read wen i was in the 7th grade  sometimes i wish this world was jus like this  all black    white  no feelings or enything  Jonas lives in a perfect world  he has a best friend named Asher  a mom and a dad who listen to his problems  and a younger sister who makes their lives a little more interesting with her playfulness  This year Asher and his schoolmates are turning twelve  which means that they ll each be assigned a job in their community  This can vary from nurturer  to birth mother  to doctor or caregiver  Jonas doesn t feel like he belongs in one specific place  Over the years he s volunteered at many different locations in the community and hasn t had one area that he likes more than the others  So on the day of his twelfth ceremony he s uncertain as to which job he ll be assigned  He most certainly isn t prepared for what happens when he s singled out and told that he s to be trained by the Giver  When Jonas s training starts he learns that his little nest of a community isn t as wonderful as it first appeared  and there are many secrets being kept from him and everyone else in order to keep the people happy I found this book to be utterly absorbing  I couldn t put it down and I enjoyed every aspect of it  Jonas lives a comfortable little life before he s been chosen  but it isn t until after he s experience what the Giver has to offer that he realizes there is so much more that he s been missing out on  I like the way the story develops and how Jonas changes along with the new information being provided about his community At times you will wonder how this community could be so blinded by everything  and you along with Jonas will grow frustrated with their way of life  I really enjoyed reading this and found myself cheering on Jonas towards the end  Wow  A curiously interesting read that is told simply and beautifully with the underlying sense that something is very wrong  like watching a rosebud slowly open and then inhaling the deep fragrance knowing it s the thorniest roses that smell the sweetest  What can be delightful can also be painful I loved  The Giver as he gently prompted answers from young Jonas by encouraging him to discern using the truth he already understood  To me  it is an analogy of God and how he speaks to us  He is loving and gentle  not withholding the beautiful things of life  and comforting us through the painful I loved  The way this book stirred my soul  There is a moment we all face as we come of age  the discomfort of realizing everything in our own little worlds is not all good and perfect  It is at this time we must learn to listen to the voice of the spirit  Our conscience guides us to make the right decision and we are uncomfortable when we make the wrong  The ability to obey the voice of the spirit is empowering The great motivators of life are intense feelings and experiences  both painful and joyful  They drive us toward the decisions and paths we choose in life  Our aim should be to choose a path that leads to life and hope not only for ourselves  but for others  Choose to be a giver  I love this book so much  now that I m out of school and on the teaching side  I feel confidant in saying that this book is better for teaching dystopian topics to teens better than many others  What this book does best is it makes you FEEL something  It first numbs you up to this quant world that seems idyllic with its mastery over uncertainty and pain  But as Jonas gets introduced to feeling  we too are reminded of the value of every little joy we had like licking the cookie batter off our fingers or laughing or hearing the sound of small water droplets dripping off the paddle on a early morning in the BWCAW  With this good  we also remember the bad  The first time we fell and scraped our knees  parents fighting  or losing a family member  But no matter the memory  The Giver reminds us that our memory is part of what has defined us  To eradicate our memory is to take away all that has made us  not only individual  but it has diminished our collective memory that defines our humanity as a species  As our memories do  The Giver leaves indelible marks on us  Four years into teaching a course on dystopian literature  I finally got around to reading this  arguably one of the first young adult works in the genre   Granted  I was pushed to pick it up now by the impending release of the big budget film adaptation   Knowing that it is read widely at the middle school level  I stupidly questioned its literary weight  My bias was proven incorrect as I sped through this easy to read but hard to grapple with story  With it s story of a boy coming of age in a society of sameness  the novel pits comfortable living against the freedom of choice  it s definitely something that all adolescents should read  and then something that adults should revisit  I understand that some malign the ending  but I love that Lowry s cliffhanger ending leaves it completely open to interpretation  I sort of want to avoid reading the sequels for a while to revel in my idea of what befalls the protagonist and his precious cargo  In a word  I can call The Giver spectacular   view spoiler  One thing I can say that I disliked was that the end made me want to bash my head in  seeing as I don t like non perfect endings   Did Jonas die  Or did he perhaps find Elsewhere  Despite the confusing ending  I loved it  I loved that it didn t shield the reader from anything going on  that it didn t create the illusion of innocence in almost teenagers  I like the entire intricacy of the community  how once Jonas learns the truth of the past  nothing is the same   hide spoiler  I have met many people that really didn t like the book  and I know there are many more  but I still recommend it because it teaches something valuable  A world blind to the past is a world blind to everything  wonderful book  very well written  Imagine a colorless world where everyone is obedient and content  Everyone is assigned a job and they do that for the rest of their lives  This is the society Jonas lives in and the society he accepts until he is assigned his job as Receiver of Memory  Everyday  he meets with the Giver  The Giver gives him memories of many wonderful things  including color  love  and pain  As Jonas receives these memories he realizes that maybe his society isn t so ideal after all This is a very short read  but it is so powerful  I read through it all in one sitting  but it had me thinking for a long time afterwards  I love the unique concept  As I was reading I was trying to imagine what life would be like if we didn t hold onto memories  if we didn t have anything like love or pain  This idea is presented very well and I wanted more when the story ended  From the first page I was hooked  Immediately the book opens into a world that is unlike any we are aware of and I quickly had lots of questions that kept me engaged  The Giver is about a 12 year old boy named Jonas who lives in a dystopian  perfect society   At the age of 12 years old everyone is assigned a job and a life that a council of elders chooses specifically for you  Everything is chosen such as your spouse  your children   which can only be one boy and one girl   and your job  Jonas receives the job of Memory keeper  At first he doesn t understand but Jonas comes to find out his new job would require him to keep all of the memories of the past before the society he currently lives in turned to sameness  The key is he can only keep them to himself  In this society everyone is required to share their feelings every day and their experiences  everything is very monotonous but what they don t realize is that they never really experience true happiness  Like I said previously this book intrigued me immediately and I feel that if it was taught in the right way middle grades students would also love this book  When teaching this book to young adult students I think it would be important to explain what a dystopia is and connect this book to other popular dystopian books series such as The Hunger Games and the Divergent series  It would also be a good idea to do an intro lesson to this book with an activity where you maybe make decisions for your students or enact kooky rules in your classroom so they can get a better understanding of Jonas s society  This book lets the reader mature with Jonas as he comes to truly understand his society and experience true happiness  I am giving this book 5 stars because I loved it  I thought it was a page turner and after finishing this book it has quickly become one of my favorite  I look forward to teaching it in my classroom one day and I will for sure go on to read the rest of the series   This was the first book I read in one day  When I finished I was filled with anger  sadness  and a hunger for more of the story  Beautiful  This is my all time favorite  I focused alot of my Academic research on the book Do you believe Joshua lived or died at the end   The Giver by Lois Lowry is a book about a boy named Jonas who lives in a world where everything is perfect  He is friends with Fiona and Asher and they are turning twelve  but when they do  they will be assigned jobs  Fiona is assigned at the house of the old  Asher helps with kids  and Jonas was chosen to be the Receiver of memory  That is a job where he will experience physical pain that will effect him mentally also  Since his world is full of black and white and they do not know about colors  any weather other than sunny  and they have no idea about animals  The person who gives Jonas the memories is the Giver and he gives him memories of sledding down a hill  breaking his leg  killing elephants  and memories of war  Jonas gets upset that community members have no memory of past events and he and the giver decide to make a plan where if he goes to a specific boundary  then all the good and bad memories will return to the community  While all this is going on  Jonas  father takes care of the babies and there is one baby where he is behind in learning how to be alive and has to be taken care of at Jonas  house  Jonas has loved the baby and when he finds out that Gabe  the baby  will be killed for lack of development  Jonas decides to take him with him  After Jonas crosses the boundary  he slides down a hill on a sled to a house that seems nice and homey  Years and years ago  when I read THE GIVER as a tiny  young person  I didn t catch much of the detail and depth  Granted  I knew that it was good  and I could sense that it was deep  but my small mind wasn t large enough to go beyond that  So this time around  I was really excited to delve into the story and figure out why it stuck with me  The Symbolism  Oh my goodness  there s so much I could talk about under this category  but I ll limit myself to a couple points  For one thing  Jonas  job and his subsequent isolation from his peers quite accurately depicts the way many children feel growing up  After all  it is a common mark of childhood to feel lonely and separated from the rest of the herd  whether for reasons real or perceived  Alongside this  the pain Jonas must experience in his job mirrors the pain of growing up and losing innocence  the pain of seeing the world for what it really is  Like Jonas  as we become adults  we often learn a great deal of stuff we wish we didn t have to know  and it weighs on us in much the same way that the Giver s memories weigh on him  Emotions  With their feelings sharing exercises  the people in THE GIVER seem rather focused on emotions  But for such emotions oriented folk  they are rather callous and unfeeling  In the same way  they maintain strict rules about avoiding rudeness but do not hesitate to be insensitive  Asher gets laughed at for his inability  as a three year old  to differentiate between the words  snack  and  smack   and while that may not seem like such a big deal  the circumstances around that resulted in a painful period of his life  not something that should be joked about  If these people were truly feeling and truly considerate  they would care about details like that  Harshness  Beneath the polite surface  these people offer very little mercy and very little true kindness  Back to the unfortunate trouble with Asher  as a three year old  he was punished rather severely for innocent linguistic mistakes that are natural to young children  A society that would put so much pressure on its toddlers is twisted  regardless of how squeaky clean it appears from the outside  This overboard punishment extends to the elderly as well  people who should be afforded leniency and respect at their time of life  It s quite evident that the government requires perfect behavior  even when that expectation is unreasonable  Death  In a community that suffers few accidental or unplanned deaths  you would think this would mean they value life more  After all  they have figured out how to keep people ticking  But this is not the case  It s quite evident they value life even less now  I won t expand on the major details  in case you haven t read the book  but their most unsettling problem is hard to miss  even in some of the smaller circumstances  Take the reference to the little boy  Caleb  who once fell into the river and drowned and was then replaced by another little boy with the same name  as though humans are just interchangeable parts of machinery  The System  Their system does work  to a point  They have less crime  The streets are safer  People are more polite and more careful with their language  Everyone makes sure to be politically correct  But all of these  improvements  have come at great cost  In order to achieve this level of peacefulness  humans have had to surrender their humanity  their free will  their emotions  and their thoughts  They have had to remove all the spice of life  sunlight  weather  heat  cold  different skin tones  different features  history  everything  They have become mindless cattle that embrace their oblivion as they calmly wait for the slaughterhouse at the end of the road  And all of this begs the question  is the commonly idealized Utopia just another from of dystopia in the end  In order to achieve a more successful and productive society  the members of the community give up all choices such as choosing a partner  career  children  etc  In addition  feelings of desire and love are suppressed because they are viewed as having the ability to cause turmoil   In this community  it is believed that suffering is the root of all evil and is detrimental to the progression of society  The book takes you through a beautiful journey that demonstrates pain and suffering are necessary in order to experience the joys and pleasures of life    This book as incredible  It takes place in a utopia with a society much like ours in the beginning but you come to find out later on in the book they are not as normal as the reader thinks they are  The society is very corrupt  they took away pain and strive for everyone to be the same  A teen named Jonas is fed up with this There is a teen named Jonas who lives in a utopia where a society is nothing like ours  families are made by the government essentially  Two parents are put together and are given a son and a daughter  Each child is given a job  which Jonas is given a very special job  To be the Receiver of Memory  This gives him the ability to break some rules  to be different  to see color  make choices  and have knowledge The man the teaches him how to do things is known as  The Giver   soon when Jonas gets old he will be the giver  The stuff that Jonas sees is mind boggling for him and he cant take his society anymore and the only way he thinks he can get away from it is run   I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a lot of action and to be surprised  Somebody who has a great imagination and for young adults that is not to hard  I did not dislike one thing about this book  everything was perfect  Dystopian books may be widely popular right now  but they re anything but new  Before there was The Hunger Games and Divergent and Legend and every other new dystopian YA series  there was The Giver  which I suppose can technically be considered an utopian series  depending on your opinion   I wanted to revisit one of the classics that I remember being fascinated by as a young reader but didn t remember in detail  so I listened to The Giver on audio book and reconnected with a book that reminds me why I love reading In eleven year old Jonas  world  everything is controlled and perfect  Decisions for every facet of life are made by the government  from who they marry to how many children they have and what their job will be in society  When Jonas turns twelve he is assigned the special role of Receiver of Memory in which the Giver of Memory transmits the history of the world to Jonas by memories  With pleasing memories such as snow and love come painful memories such as sunburn and hunger  As Jonas receives memories  he begins to develop feelings that everyone else in society are void of having and he struggles with living in a society where he must carry the weight of emotions alone The premise of this story alone is fascinating  a government in which no decisions are made and everything operates perfectly  Nobody truly feels love and in effect nobody really feels loss when a member is  Released   While life may sound somewhat boring  it s simple  and even lively members  such as Jonas  friend Asher  are able to find a place  The understanding that everything that leads to choices  opinions  and emotions is sacrificed by society in order for members to live a  perfect  life becomes too great of a price to pay for ignorant Jonas as he gains emotions  This poses the same question for readers  Would we be willing to sacrifice all the good things in order to protect ourselves from the bad things  Would you sacrifice sunshine to avoid sunburn  Would you sacrifice seasons to avoid hunger  Would you sacrifice love to avoid loss This book is not very complex  The premise requires some imagination  but the questions Lowry poses can be processed by readers of all ages  As a child reader and as an adult reader I was and am captivated by this story  It causes the reader to consider life and society from any position on the spectrum of your lifespan  It calls to question whether a utopia is even achievable without sacrificing so much that said utopia can be viewed equally as a dystopia  No matter the age of the reader  this book is a great conversation piece for what we re willing to give up for a perfect life before that perfect life becomes less than ideal Bottom Line  Everyone should read this book  I believe that even people who don t consider themselves readers will be drawn in by this world and the questions this book poses  5 5 stars    THIS WAS BRILLIANT  I finished it in a couple of hours  I guess it just made me feel good about my life in comparison to these characters  lives and I honestly believe that everyone should read it  SO PUMPED FOR THE MOVIE  This is a good book to get peoples minds thinking about what the future would look like  Its odd that they get handed jobs at the age of 12 and that is the job they will have for the rest of your life  Every time i read this i have to remember what i was told in middle school what a giver was  I still don t remember  It keeps the attention in the book and its the kind of book that you want to finish it in one night and not want to put it down because there is so much to know what a give is and does to help people  The book is a book i will always keep on my shelf and let kids read it when they want to   I thought that this book was absolutely wonderful  It s well written and the sequence of events is well thought out  This book is certainly an eye opener  and makes you pretty thankful for the senses and freedoms you have  The only problem I d say is that it ends very abruptly  But even then  there was good reason  I would certainly recommend this to people who are either in a tough spot or depressed  due to the book showing that we have many things in life to look forward to  This book was great  and I m glad I read it  The Giver was one of those books everyone around me is shocked that I never read  The thing is  many of my friends  especially in the writing community  are younger than me  They forget that while they read this in school  I was already in high school when it was released  and probably in college  or nearly so  by the time it hit curriculum in my district  So it was high on my list for my 100 book challenge this year This is a quick read  but don t let that fool you into thinking it is a fluff piece  Far from it  The Giver is one of the first YA dystopian novels  and its influence on more recent titles is apparent almost immediately  Jonas  our main character  lives in a community that has placed Sameness as its highest value  All history  emotions  even colors have been suppressed  The Rules of the community are many  and maintain a strictly regimented society  When Jonas is selected to be the new Receiver of Memory the sole bearer of all the history of the world before Sameness he begins to question everything he has always taken for granted  and wonders if humankind sacrificed too much in the name of peace and civility What sets this aside from so many of the newer dystopian stories is that there are many things about the community that seem at first to be very good  Everyone has enough to eat  People are polite to each other  Since everyone is taught not to focus on what makes each other different  there are no bullies  Everybody rides around on bicycles from the age of 9 up  so there is no smog  no traffic congestion  But with everything that Lowry unveils about the Community  you discover one more way in which individuality is discouraged  In trying to keep everyone safe and protect them from the ugliest parts of human nature  they destroyed the most beautiful parts as well  This is a world without music  without color  where language is required to be precise not expressive Jonas and his mentor  the former Receiver who now calls himself the Giver since he is passing all the memories on to Jonas  both see what the world has been  They understand the cost of changing their Community  But they also see that Sameness is not always good  not always worth what has been sacrificed  The ending is deliberately vague  and in my copy which had a Q   A with the author  Lowry says she meant it to be hopeful  I ve heard mixed things about the rest of Lowry s books in the quartet  so I think I ll leave them for a bit  There is so much in this one to process that I ll probably reread it once I m done with my 100 book year  It is well deserved of all the praise it s been given  and I highly recommend it   As soon as the book began it drew you in  but at the same time was very confusing  I had so many question running through my mind  How don t they know about animals was one of the questions I asked  Why are some words prohibited was another  As the story went on  though  it all started to make sense  and the experiences Jonas was having seemed to fit into what people today are facing  Right before his  Jonas s ceremony  where he received his career  he was constantly nervous about what was going to be chosen for him  This is the same for many young people these days  they don t know who they are going to be and they are constantly thinking about it   Also during the ceremony where the elevens were becoming twelves  and they skipped Jonas  I automatically predicted that for some odd reason he had not received a job  Thankfully I was incorrect and Jonas did receive a job  the Receiver  After that I was wondering what would happen next because in the book they hadn t really explained what the Receiver did  In fact currently in the book Jonas had no idea either  The whole time I was reading this book I kept going back and re reading because at parts it was confusing  but most of the time it was so interesting I just had to read it again  Overall this book is so amazing  It s about a kid who had no idea who he was  or what he even wanted to do  in the beginning  but eventually found his true calling  After finding out his job  the Receiver  he went through important training that taught him the memories  no one but him and the giver knew  about the past  Jonas eventually found out all the deep secrets of the past  good and bad  and made a brave decision to flee in order to let these feelings and memories return to the people in the community   This is a quiet dystopia  The action of Scott Westerfield s Uglies or The Hunger Games is not at all present  but the seeming peace make Jonas s discoveries all the more important  If I didn t pay attention  I wouldn t necessarily realize that Jonas s world was as bad as it truly is  The veneer of tranquility accentuates the importance and loss of choice and feeling  The story is beautifully written  with many memorable lines  My second time round  this line broke my heart  possible spoiler     Love   It was a word and concept new to him   10 simple words that sum up all that is wrong with Jonas and the rest s existence  Read this book  and think about what gives life value   Jonnas lived in a community where you didn t make chocies choices would be made for you  They would be made for you very December you would sort of advance to a new stage like Jaonas he was a 11 now he s a 12  Once he was a 12 he was assigned a job he was a receiver  The giver  the trainer would give him memories  good memories  Sometimes Jonas would feel pain and loneliness  Towards the end he had a  brother  named Gabe  and Gabe was always crying so they agreed to release him which means basically kill him  Jonas didn t like that so him and the giver made up and escape plan and Jonas took Gabe with him  The Giver didn t go   This is my absolute favorite book  and have read it about 10 times since I was 12  Everyone should read this  It is about a town without love and the consequences that come with it  Much better than the movie  I loved  loved  LOVED this book  It s set in the future in what appears to be an ideal  utopian society   then you realize it is no utopia at all  but very dystopian  By eliminating pain  they have also eliminated any kind of deep emotion or human connection between the people living in the society  There s also the  Sameness   where everyone strives to blend in and be the same as everyone else  and no one wants to stand out and display any sort of individuality uniqueness On top of all of that  the society has basically eliminated choice    EVERYTHING is chosen for you so the individual is not required to choose  lest they make the wrong choice It s a scary world  but the story is a beautiful one  of a little boy named Jonas  It s a short read  but you will be hooked from page one Def recommended I was kind of disappointed with the ambiguous ending but I forgave her since it was book one of a trilogy  although FYI   the rest of the books center around different characters and different roles  but some of the characters from this book do pop up  especially in the third book  so you at least know what happened to them   Review also posted on http   books and insomnia blogspot co   Jonas s world is perfect  Everything is in order and everyone is happy and contented  But the peace he   and everyone else   knows came with a high price  Only one person knows the truth and Jonas is about to become that person The Giver is a powerful and thought provoking novel about the things we take for granted and what we sacrifice in the name of humanity  What I liked most about this book is that even though this is a serious story  it doesn t feel heavy at all  And because this is utopian  there s no dark and gritty that s very common in post apocalyptic books I ve read before  Just the underlying truth that there s more than meets the eye  That even the most perfect world isn t really perfect at all I loved how real Jonas s character is  He grew up in a society of rules and order  but he quickly adjusted to his role as Receiver  And even though he was prepared to take on the role  he was willing to admit that he wasn t brave enough for it  His friendship with the Giver and the memories he saw gave him the courage to do what he thought was right  I admired his faith and belief that even though the memories were painful  they were worth to be remembered by the people  And in the end  I wanted to believe that Jonas achieved what he set out and risked his life for A really good and brilliant tale  I don t know why I didn t read The Giver before now  but I m glad I finally did  Every page is a treasure  I loved this book  Sadly I went to see the movie first  I whipped through the book afterwards and learned that the movie was totally different  I think the book was so much better than the movie The Giver gave me so many ideas about living in a mindless  colorless world that is controlled completely  This is one of the only books I have ever read that reminds me that we are lucky that we live in such a beautiful world  full of love and wonder and animals  Can t forget the animals  WE NEED THE ANIMALS  Haunting for sure   once you grasp the picture being painted    a solid introduction to dystopian society for children  Certainly from my view there is no depth in that society  and quite a creepy  wicked overtone but there are 2 people with enough courage left to force changes  The very last pages left me wanting a little bit more   though beautifully written I wanted some assurance from the author  My copy is a signed paperback I found in a used bookstore   with love to those who read   remember   and GIVE   Lois Lowry  There is a bevy of books that I have heard of as being mainstream for English Language Arts curriculum  so many people read them in middle school or high school that I feel that I am barred from joining some secret club because I have yet to read them  Lois Lowry s The Giver is definitely one that falls in that category  It was  for me  and I believe most high school audiences  a very quick read  but it backed a punch  By the end  I found myself feeling deeply for Jonas  the protagonist  and I wanted more chances to explore the world in which Jonas lived  Luckily for any reader who finds themselves feeling the same  there are other books Lowry three other books in The Giver What I enjoyed most was the novel s potential to spark amazing discussion that would tell one about themselves  their values  but also allow for so much analysis of the book itself  So  in evaluating this book  it is very hard for me to distinguish my teacher side from my personal reader side   I love readings that promote self discovery  I am actually a Cognitive Science minor at UGA  and that required me to take about four philosophy classes  In these classes  we asked ourselves questions like  Are humans inherently good   or  Under what circumstances do we find happiness   The former question is something I have always been interested  If you ever feel that someone has acted selfishly against you or been simply mean toward you  you just can t avoid that question  can you  Are people good  or do we really only care about ourselves  Jonas lives in a stark  utilitarian world that attempts to remove all feelings of pain or uncomfortableness by simply not indulging in deep feeling  The same goes for whatever could make life s little chores less expedient or more of a learning process  The roads  for instance  have all been leveled out  there are no hills  And perhaps the most disturbing thing for me was that the word  love  had been obliterated from usage  It was public opinion that  love  wasn t exact enough  and it didn t describe the actual feelings healthy to have toward another person  like appreciation or enjoyment  And the elimination of pain may sound appealing toward people  but imagine that everything else not necessary for survival had also been eliminated   like color  We readers get to see Jonas become aware of the color red for the first time  which made me  as a reader  draw more attention to the beauty around me  I could not imagine not seeing the blue sky or the color of my friend s eyes  The only shortcoming I perceive in the novel is that the language in which it is written is not that captivating to me  There s not much to discuss in terms of the author s word choice or descriptions  It is a novel mostly driven by pathos and ethos  which almost eclipses the need for too flowery of language  Additionally  we could see Lowry s writing as a choice to represent the utilitarianism we find in the setting  Ultimately  that is for the reader to decide  Is Lowry s choice effective  or not  But from a simply academic standpoint  The Giver has so much worth  It references   whether Lowry intended this or not   several famous philosophical essays  One was Jackson s  What Mary Didn t Know   which argued that if someone lived in a room deprived of color but was told all the facts about a color like red  they would still not be able to summon what exactly it was like to experience the color personally  Mary feels jipped when she finally sees red  However  the most prominent parallel with philosophy Lowry constructs is Le Guin s  The Ones Who Walked Away from Omelas   Just like Jonases  world  everyone lives without having to encounter true pain  but for Le Guin  it is at the price of a horrible secret  Below the ground in a small broom closet is a ten year old child who must suffer alone  Residents of Omelas must never speak to the child or offer it comfort  and the child s only interaction is when meals are dropped off  However  to make a conscious decision to stay in Omelas  one must visit the closet and peer inside while still a child themselves  So  naturally  when some discover the grim truth  they leave Omelas  And if you read The Giver  you will find Jonas feeling compelled to do the same  I would love to teach a unit on ethics with The Giver at its core  and from there  we would branch out and read some philosophy  to ultimately ask ourselves some hard questions  I think The Giver is such a good book  I loved reading about how different their society was from ours today  I couldn t imagine growing up like that  not knowing any better than they had  The main character  Jonas was the only one who could currently do anything about how crappy his society was because he was the only one who had experience life differently through his newly gained memories  I think anyone who reads this book is just as mortified as Jonas was when he discovered what  releasing  truly meant  and I think he becomes a heroic character when he does everything he can to save the child his family was caring for  I also love the ending  where it doesn t tell the reader exactly how it ends  Lowry leaves it open to our own imaginations to choose either the good  or the bad  This book was really well written and I really enjoyed it   In this classic  film adapted novel  a young boy named Jonas lives in a world where everyone is content  The government gives drugs daily to citizens to basically wipe their emotions  and everyone is under control  Then Jonas is selected to become the new Giver during the career choosing  which means he ll be given all the memories and emotions from the past that no one else in the community experiences  As his awareness and maturity grows  he has to make a decision between letting the world stay the same or changing the way their strange society works I thoroughly enjoyed this wonderful story  Without using swearing  sex  or lots of violence  Lois Lowry creates a dynamic new world  At first I thought the place seemed like paradise  as Jonas probably did  but as he learned more about the past  I saw how terrifying his world really is  Lowry uses suspense in a masterful way  I was always asking what s going to happen next but never what s going on  She builds up to a great climax at the end  and all the action is character driven  Excellent read  It was an amazing read staring with a carefree Jonas who doesn t completely understands what happens around him  At the twelve ceremony he is chosen to be a part of the Elders  the most important people in his society  but he will not be just any elder  he will be that which keeps the memories from the past locked within him As his training begins he starts to see how twisted his society is  soon he will have a big choice to make  stay and become a sour soul  another sinner in his town or leave and take with him Gabe  a poor innocent baby who will soon be released  The choice is now his  Kak  Zashcho  Ne   Da si priznaia  ne s m ochakval knigata da mi kharesa do takava stepen  no eto me   iznenadan

always liked Lois Lowry s books about Anastasia Krupnik so I was worried about how I would like this more serious novel  It is very thought provoking  simply and well written  and it holds up to the test of time  I wish I had read this as a young adult  I was in another country for most of elementary and middle school   I can definitely see where Divergent got its inspiration from  I am curious to read the other books in the Giver quartet now   Now this is good writing for a Dystopian genre  A masterpiece of its kind  Truly this book s potential surpasses the today s way of plotting their storyline  I am actually intrigued by this book Basic fundamentals of our daily human liberty is being used as a plot to described what post apocalyptic has confined or taken away from us in their system  Rules are set which made the world a so called perfect one  Age is defined with a ceremonial gathering with a token of basic gifts across the community  Hence  by the age of 12  you are destined by the Elder s decision of the career role you re assigned for your entire life You can t interrupt  you can t steal  you can t be late  STOP     If you break these rules  a public apology has to be done  What is more interesting  you have to apply for a spouse  chosen by the Elders   you have to apply for a child  chosen by the Elders   you have to apply to be released  decides by the Elders   Where do we draw the line to this Jonas here  is our lead guy  He has been assigned to have an honorary role within his community  However  truth of the past unveils and mysteries of this community is starting to surface  Now  that s not new but what can Jonas do Fantastically written with effortless world building which has captures my attention on how their system works  Their culture and customs are subtly pronounced and I was being crept into their system subconsciously I like how the book ends it with a sense of familiarity which doesn t seem like it s made up  It s raw  it s practical and it s how we take risks for our lives just for a better tomorrow  Bravo Rating  5 out of 5 starsMy Blogspot Review I ve taught this book to my 6th graders nine years in a row  Once I realized that the book is actually a mystery  and not the bland sci fi adventure it seemed at first skim  I loved it more and more each time  Nine years  two classes most years    17 TIMES  I ve come to see that the book isn t the story of a depressing utopia  It s the story of the relationship between the main characters the Giver  Jonas  and    I won t say her name  And of course  the baby Gabe Every year  as we read the book out loud together  I am amazed at details the students notice  things I ve missed the previous 15 times   or questions they raise that lead to further insights for not just the class but ME  My God  the things they come up with  that I as an English major  or even me if I d read this with a book club  could never have gone that far in depth As I began to more fully understand the book over the years  I was better able to guide their discussions  which helped them think more deeply about the book  and made me appreciate the book even more  And by  guide   I don t mean calm  controlled  teachery   I already know the answer  talk  My discussion techniques  simple   I d stop the tape  books on tape are AWESOME  the narrator is always so much better than I could ever be  and say something like   So  what do you think  Doesn t this seem a little WEIRD   and off they d go  bouncing ideas off each other until finally someone said something incredible  something no kid had thought of in the past nine years  Once I myself knew how to be interested in this book  I knew what might keep them hooked    Or  I myself would suddenly realize something new  and I d stop reading and say   OH MY GOD DID YOU GUYS GET WHAT THAT MEANT    WHAT IT MIGHT MEAN      I feel free to participate myself  since I myself still have so many questions about the book  I m not spoiling the ending when I bring up my own questions  because I know this book is a mystery in which things don t much get answered  they re left to linger  and that s part of the beauty and hopefulness in this book  There are still lines  moments  in the book that give me chills  I wait for them greedily  just to hear the words spoken  I feel lucky to have been forced to read this book a dozen times  There are other books I ve read a lot with my students  and this is the one that most stands up over time  the only one that keeps my interest  I truly am on the edge of my seat to see what we will realize next  Because I ve seen that  even if I think I have it all figured out  some kid is going to say something to rock my world I can t believe Lowry was able to make a book this clever  part of me thinks a work this good is impossible  and that we are just reading too much into it  But no  it s all there  all the pieces  and she put them there  I just don t see how could she have written such a tightly woven mystery  how could she have know all of the questions the book would raise  And you know what  she probably didn t  A book isn t like drawing a map  You make the world  and things happen  And in this case  she did make a perfect world   I SO did not mean that as a UTOPIA PUN        I hate puns so much       I mean  she so fully created that world where everything that happens is plausible  Just read the damn book  then call me  Or  call me after like  Chapter 13  then after 18 and 19  he book  Lines that almost make me cry  A while back  this book was circulating around my mother s office  I was very surprised to see it in the young adult reading section at the library I really enjoyed this book  I read it as set in the distant future  since it seems like an extremely high tech commune  The theme was so powerful  yet it read so easily  It s Vonnegut for kids  but I personally like Lowry s take on sameness and the decline of the human race a bit better There s one thing that I didn t really feel was explained thoroughly  and of course I realize that it wouldn t be as a children s novel  The Birthmothers  They were more than likely artificially inseminated because everyone takes the pill to  you know  stop the stirrings  but where do they get the sperm  Does everyone contribute  There s no assignment called  Sperm Donor   Also  I guess since it s set in the distant future  they ve figured out a way to make a synthetic formula that s as good as breast milk  but I wouldn t have been surprised if they pumped the Birthmothers like cows after birth  Then again  they re supposed to birth three babies in three years  so the leaders wouldn t really want them to be pumped  That s just my crazy thoughts on it  I think The Giver is an excellent book because of the way it was written  The words seemed to flow perfectly with the setting  The characters are also very realistic  Anybody could relate to Jonas  Asher  or Fiona  Even though the music on the audio book is totally random and unreasonable  the book is beyond amazing  Every page is like a movie scene playing in your head and you can t seem to make it stop  The book may seem to start off slow and bland but the author has a good reason to do this  The characters development is exquisit  You will not regret reading this book  Oh my God  Probably the best dystopian book I ve ever read  The world created in the book is so amazing and interesting but most importantly   it is believable  I mean with the majority of dystopian books the worlds in them  well  some just look ridiculous and the chance of such alternative scenarios happening is like close to zero  But this books creates a world that make you feel like that something like that really might happen in the not so distant future  Conceptually it s built really well and there s nothing too extravagant  Unlike many other dystopian reads this one is more description based not action packed which I actually really enjoyed  It definitely doesn t make the book boring  On the contrary  you get to know more both the world and the characters Just to sum up  go and read the book  Like NOW     The book was AWESOME  it reminded me of Fahrenheit 451   5 more starsThis novel made me appreciate the value of feelings all kind of feelings  love  happiness  warmth even pain Indeed we can t be humans without them  I was intrigued by the upcoming movie but still doubtful despite the good reviews I have read about the book  I still gave it a try though  and I am glad I did You may find the story uninteresting during the first few chapters  You may decide to skip pages just to get to the end  You may even consider to drop it off and move on to your next read but I am telling you  you have to give this book a chance for you will be rewarded with a story that will seep right through you  The story was complex and unpredictable  It is also not for the faint of heart for it is very sad and disturbing at the same time  I finished the book around midnight and found myself still awake thinking about the ending hours after finishing it  It was well written and the kind that sticks with you for quite a time  This was indeed a very good read and I am excited to see the movie and hope it will be as beautiful and brilliant as the book   Don t misjudge this book  because of its title  It s actually a great book  and it teaches you what it s like to live in a collective community  and it gives you an idea how to live freely by choice  This book reminds me of Ayn Rand s  Anthem  the similarities how Jonas or  Equality 7 2521 depart the collective society  and found freedom the other side of the mountain or Jonas found the place called the  Elsewhere  to be free  and not be burden by abuse of the authority Jonas was chosen to be the  Receiver  since he has the capacity to see beyond  He lives in the community where everything was the same  You re not allowed to think or to have feelings at all everything was given to you  Being a receiver was a hard task  because you re trained to feel pain  and to have all the knowledge wisdom that the community doesn t have       they can t see color to them everything was colorless no distinction  The Giver  of knowledge trained Jonas to be ready  since he s the next  Giver  after he receives all the ability  judgement from  The Giver   But they re running out of time  since Gabriel was going to be release  means to be killed by lethal injection  the next morning  So   The Giver  has to help Jonas to get away from the community not knowing that Jonas was bringing Gabriel with him to  Elsewhere  This book was so good that I bought the  2 book called  Gathering Blue   and the  3 called  Messenger   I m not sure why I ve put off reading this for years  but I wish I hadn t  This book is fascinating to me and has kept me thinking about it well after I have finished  Lois Lowry had created one of the earliest dystopias I ve heard of  and she had crafted it masterfully  I really enjoyed this one and will finishing the quartet with Gathering Blue  Messenger  and Son  Thank you  Lois Lowry for making me think about and appreciate my life and the world around me  In a world without colours or memories or true emotions you can t be blamed for being ignorant  but once you gain knowledge about the true world  there s no going back  That s how life is for Jonas in Lois Lowry s book  The Giver    The Giver  captures the true meaning of being human and the hardships of life  Lowry s novel shares themes of consequences and costs  and hope  which can be relatable to anyone of any age  In a world where everything is so orderly and just  Jonas doesn t see it that way anymore  Once you turn age 12 you are to receive an Assignment  your job for the rest of your adult life  Most children receive normal jobs like Nurturer or Caretaker of the Old but Jonas is different  he is to be the next Receiver of Memory  Jonas has been given the most important Assignment the Community has given in a while but due to the failure of the last Receiver to be 10 years ago  unlike all other 12 s  Jonas can t ask to be released from his Assignment  Through the novel  the current Receiver  who insists on being called the Giver  trains Jonas to be the next Receiver by giving his memories to Jonas  With the help of the Giver Jonas goes on a journey of learning about the past  on which he learns about true emotions and can see colours  something which no one else in the Community can relate to  Jonas cannot share his experience with anyone else  he has to bear it all on his own for the sake of the Community   What if we could hold up things that were bright red  or bright yellow  and he could choose  Instead of Sameness   He might make wrong choices    On his journey to become the Receiver  Jonas learns things that hurt him beyond repair and has to learn how to face those problems himself  Jonas learns about true happiness but also about true suffering by receiving memories and learns that there can t be one without the other  but no matter what there is always hope for a better tomorrow Jonas  advanced perception of the world still with his adolescent nature makes him such an interesting character  Jonas  character development throughout the story provides the themes of the story that are relatable to everyday life  we all experience happiness but we all suffer pain  we cannot have one without the other  there is always a cost for happiness   The Giver  is an amazing novel that connects to being human  it really shows in depth how life can be  you can feel isolated and hurt but no matter what there is always at least just a sliver of hope   The Giver  isn t it just a children s novel  it has something which everyone can relate to  enjoy  and appreciate  Lowry writes in such an advanced simplistic manor that keeps the pages turning  This book is a must read that everyone should give a chance   I thank the universe for brought me up to this book  I don t know if I regret reading this or not  Well the end of the book freaking left me there hanging an wondering AND I JUST CAN T  But    Oh    The book    How the story written    The plot    The idea    Everything was just beautiful  Everyone must read this book  To feel the awesomeness I feel while I was reading this  Best feeling ever  It brought a lot of emotion  And please fyi I cry so easily  Very  easily  But even tho I m so sure I was really emotional reading the book  I didn t cry reading it  I think it s because the over awesomeness in it    you know  The idea about how boring the perfect life seems       is a good message to everyone  And the surprises   oh this book just wouldn t stop surprise me with everything  5 stars  Definitely 5 stars  One of the best written children s book that I have ever read  Each time I read it  I feel like I ve learned something new about myself  Pretty corny  huh  What a fast and interesting read  This was an unexpected content for me  I always try to pick up books not knowing much about them so I can react in a fresh and prejudice free way  in this case it was a great idea  This children book has so mucho more than an interesting story  even the author seems to be surprised by the product she ended up delivering I think this is a book that manages to combine a really good description of the system stablished in a dictatorial society and an easy to follow story about a boy who is growing up and facing really important events in his life  to me it is also refreshing the way the author shows the insight capacity of the boy and still keep it believable because as you would expect in someone so young he still needs guidance and support  I wish I had read this one when I was a kid  but it does not change the fact that it made me think a lot and observe carefully my own world I have read that some people really are angry and worried about the things that this book can put in the minds of children  in this respect I can only say that they have a point to care what kids read and how we show things to them  but I also think that we also have to try and not underestimate their young minds  where I come from  children don t really read that much and it would be so good if they were interested and have access to books that make them think and ignite a thirst to explore and understand  Now I m actually kinda dreading seeing the movie  because of how good this one was  How did I not read it for so long  Der Protagonist Jonas lebt in einer perfekten Welt  es gibt kein Leid  keine Not  kein Schmerz  kein Krieg  Zukunftsangste existieren nicht  Entscheidungen mussen nicht getroffen werden  das Leben der Menschen wird von aussen organisiert  Wie muss man sich das vorstellen  Durch Medikamente  die den Bewohnern taglich verabreicht werden  sind sie nicht imstande tiefgehende Gefuhle zu empfinden oder sonstige aussere Reize wahrzunehmen  die das Gleichgewicht storen konnten  Das Leben jedes Einzelnen wird vom Rat der Altesten bis ins kleinste Detail geplant  von der Geburt bis in den Tod  Doch Jonas Welt oder sagen wir mal  seine Sicht der Dinge  verandern sich allmahlich bevor er ein 12er wird  Er ist wahnsinnig intelligent und unterscheidet sich auch in seinem Aussehen von den anderen  Doch vor allem beginnt er die Organisation seiner Welt zu hinterfragen  Die 12er werden mit einer Zeremonie in das zukunftige Berufsleben verabschiedet   naturlich werden die Berufe auch durch den Rat der Altesten zugeteilt  Nur Jonas Zukunft bleibt bis zum Ende offen  bis verkundet wird  dass er eben durch sein Andersein zum nachsten Huter der Erinnerung ausgebildet werden soll  Von nun an hat er die Aufgabe Erinnerungen und Erlebnisse  all das Leid  all den Schmerz  aber auch Liebe und Freundschaft vergangener und zukunftiger Generationen in sich aufzunehmen und auf seinem Rucken zu tragen  Nur er weiss  wie die Welt ausgesehen hat  bevor alles der Gleichheit unterlegen war Wie hat es mir gefallen  Vielen sagen ja  dass Huter der Erinnerung ein Muss fur jeden Dystopie Fan sei  Da ich noch nicht viele Dystopien gelesen haben  kann ich das nun nicht beurteilen  aber ich muss sagen  dass mir diese Dystopie wirklich sehr gut gefallen hat  Lowry kann auf wenigen Seiten sehr verstandlich eine vollkommen neue Welt erschaffen  Vor allem fand ich genau die Passagen besonders spannend  in dem es eben darum ging  die Menschen mithilfe von Medikamenten vollkommen reizresistent zu machen  Aber Jonas kann sich bestimmten Reizen einfach nicht entziehen  Als er fur seine Ausbildung zum Huter der Erinnerung entscheidet  nicht mehr die reiz  und emotionshemmenden Medikamente zu schlucken fuhlt man sich auch als Leser so  als wurde man etwas Verbotenes tun und etwas Verbotenes empfinden  Immer in Sorge auf frischer Tat ertappt zu werden  Es war schon  mal wieder ein Buch in den Handen zu halten  das auch ohne eine Fortsetzung bestehen kann und nicht wieder in zig Reihen oder Trilogien und sub Shortstories endet  Denn ich muss sagen  dass mir der derzeitige Trend der Reihen und Trilogien wirklich ein bisschen auf die Nerven geht  Einzelbande sind in der Bucherwelt in diesem Moment schon Mangelware  Wie seht ihr das  Allerdings wurde am 7  Oktober nun eine The Giver Quartet Box veroffentlicht  Enthalten sind hier fur 22 95EUR The Giver  Huter der Erinnerung   Entering Blue  The Messenger und The Son  Also doch kein Einzelband  Wer weiss da ein bisschen mehr Viele schrieben ja auch  dass sie dieses Buch schon zu Schulzeiten gelesen haben und andere schrieben wiederum  dass sie sich gewunscht hatten  Huter der Erinnerung mal in der Schule zu lesen  Fur mich ist Huter der Erinnerung  ob nun Einzelband oder Tetralogie  wirklich ein sehr schoner Anlass mit Kindern und Jugendlichen auch mal in die Welt der Dystopien einzutauchen  denn Literaturunterricht sollte moglichst viele Genre abklappern und nicht immer nur die Klassiker  Huter der Erinnerung eignet sich da insoweit sehr gut  als dass das Preisleistungsverhaltnis einfach super ist  Dystopien generell gerade der Buchertrend uberhaupt sind und sich sowohl Lehrkraft als auch Schulerschaft mit 250 Seiten auch nicht durch endlos lange Walzer kampfen mussen  die Geschichte aber trotzdem viel Raum und Zeit fur Interpretationen zulasst  Seitenzahlen sind ja auch immer ein ganz wichtiges Kriterium bei Schullekturen  wer kennt das nicht     Von daher ist dieses Buch sowohl etwas fur das private Lesevergnugen  als auch eine nette Idee fur einen Literaturausflug in das Genre der Dystopie  Funf von funf Sternen  Mehr dazu findet ihr auf meinem Blog  http   maaraavillosa blogspot de Jonas lives in a  perfect  world where war  disease  and suffering have all been eradicated  Everything is in order  everything is under control  The people have no worries or cares  The Community strives for  sameness   in which everyone and everything are the same and equal  To help the Community function as a cohesive unit  each member is assigned a position in society  When Jonas turns twelve  the Community selects him to be the new  Receiver of Memories   Only the  Giver  knows the truth and memories of the past  and now he must pass these memories on to Jonas  I had to read this book for class  and I was not excited because of the cover  But boy was I wrong    This book has given me a whole new perspective and interpretation of life  The fact that it shows what life would be without the things we take for granted shows that we must cherish everything we have while we have it  which I believe was the message of the story   A classic novel  and series       I am such a hopeless romantic  but I absolutely enjoyed this book despite the rare scenes of romance  Helpful hint  when I read the second book  I thought it made NO connection to the Giver  but trust me  it ll fit into place like a gigantic  beautiful puzzle   Read this book in middle school and when I saw on the list had to comment  I still bring it up in conversation  I would LOVE to read it again  Absolutely Remarkable  A lot of middle grades have read this book  I on the other avoided it  I am so glad that I have read it now  This book is about a young boy named Jonas who is an eleven year old boy who lives in a very controlled society  Everyone has a place  their siblings are chosen  their spouse  and even their job  In this world there is no suffering  no color  sex  music  or sex  The Elders controls what the community does  Since Jonas is twelve it is time for him to receive his life long job  This book is amazing  I would recommend this book to anyone  I missed out on this book and now that I am an adult I can appreciate the value this book holds   Wow this book was amazing        Jonas goes through lots of changes through out his life  He discovers a new community that none of the other members know except for The Giver  Overall this book was a really fun book to read I rate this book with 5 stars  This book is hard to explain  but it was very good  It takes place in a society in the future  and tells the tale of a community centered on Sameness  everything and everyone must be exactly the same so that everybody is happy  One of the ways the community keeps Sameness is to make sure that none of the community members have memories  However  there is one esteemed official who takes up the job of holding ALL the memories  This person will soon be Jonas  and this book takes us on Jonas s journey of becoming  The Receiver   finding on his way  that the community isn t quite as perfect as it seems    I read this last night from 12 00 2 00 AM and here s my full review on this book Set in a world where there is no color  suffering  pain  diseases  war  etc   The Giver is a magnificent story that depicts a what we so called a Utopian society  Every person has an essential role to maintain and help the Community to function precisely  Everything was just PERFECT  Although everything started changing when our young protagonist  Jonas  was honoured as the new Receiver of Memory at age twelve  Memories that are utterly unknown by the society  memories that will surely change his perspectives in life  The world that Jonas lives in is completely different from he world we re living right now  Everything is controlled by government and everyone s fate is sort of planned out already  Nothing new ever happens  nothing seems to change anymore  Human feelings were eliminated  to eradicate problems and conflicts that would just ruin their perfect kind of living  Lois Lowry s writing style fascinated me  The setting was very unique and I felt a strong connection towards the characters  especially Jonas and The Giver  And of course  Baby Gabriel  The entire story used wonderful details which will surely draw every reader in  It s not very fast paced  and things weren t rushed to let everyone process every bit of detail in the story  Lowry s imagination led us to a world we know nothing about I strongly recommend this book to all ages  most importantly to children  It will teach them how to properly perceive the world with their five senses  It will not only be entertaining to read  but will also give you new perspectives in the world we re living  This book is going to leave you with a different outlook in life  and a much brightened sense of reality  I think a part of me remains so incredibly terrified and horrified by this book That doesn t mean I didn t like it  In fact  I loved it more than I will ever be able to describe in a few words  I received my shiny  new copy when I was in grade seven and now  seven years later  it still sits on my bookshelf  battered beyond belief and still greatly loved When I first read it  I was so confused  Not in the sense that I didn t understand what was going on  but I was just befuddled  How in the world could anyone conceive the idea of  sameness   It was bewildered  terrifying  horrifying and intriguing in a very strange way  A way that told me that I should not be intrigued by the idea  should not be encouraging it  that I should be running in the opposite direction from it  but I felt a profound sense of engrossment anyway How could these people live without everything that made us human I had grown up learning to appreciate the world around me  To love music  rejoice in the colours and growing things  to laugh because I want to  to cry because I could  to run about with my friends half wild without a care in the world    to get hurt and learn from it  To climb a tree only to fall and break my arm  To get back up and do it all over again until I could reach as high as I could  To make up my own little worlds and dream of fantastical things  To be what I wanted to be  Whether this was an engineer or a ballerina Reading about a world where everyone was the same  a world with no colour  no music  no sadness or happiness  no love or hate    no choice  It terrified  horrified and intrigued me all at once I grew addicted to the book  reading it over and over again  knowing it better than all of my classmates  While they would still be doing the first reading with the class  I was reading it for the ninth or tenth time The idea just so thoroughly disgusted me A world where everyone and everything was the same It was a stupid thing to even consider Sure  there was no war  No hate  No racism  no sexism  no murder or abuse    but there was nothing that made this world good either  There was no love  No freedom  No choice  No life Which is what makes this book so important to me The same ideas that terrify and disgust me are the same ideas that teach me a valuable lesson There are just some things that aren t worth giving up I would love a world with no war in it  A world with no pain or hate  A world where children didn t starve and people weren t judged based on what colour skin they had or what gender they were But at the price of love  The price of music  freedom  happiness and uniqueness  At the price of our own humanity No  It is not a price that will ever be worth it This is a story I will always remember  A story I will always share  A story I will always love  The worst part of holding the memories is not the pain  It s the loneliness of it  Memories need to be shared Wow    just wow  I m really ashamed that I haven t picked up this book sooner  I went on a vacation today  and I spent more than 10 hours in the bus  so I brought few short books to kill the time and this book was one of them  If it wasn t for this trip  who knows when I would pick it up I devoured every single page of this book so fast  and in the end I was left wanting more  But I do have to say that I m not sure if I will read the sequels  because I think that this was the perfect way to end this book Amazing book and I m sure I ll be re reading it in the future many  many times  I loved this book  I m not sure whether it was the timing  having just finished a few  heavier  books  but I really enjoyed the simplicity and seamlessness of The Giver  I didn t know it was a children s book when I first picked it up but given that it only took me about 2 3 hours to read  I suppose it all makes sense now  I loved how the concept of colour was introduced    First in the apple and then in Fiona s hair  I liked the character of Jonas  I perhaps found some elements of the story a bit creepy  e g  removing of tunics   and wasn t completely enamoured by the character of the Giver but I liked the relationship that developed between him and Jonas  The part with Jonas  father and the smaller twin wasn t pleasant but I suppose it helped to demonstrate how brainwashed the residents were  Imagine a world without memory  colour  music  books and art The book moves very quickly and doesn t go I to a lot of detail but I think this helps to keep it exciting  The start reminded me of the beginning of the Hunter Games but the stories are very different thereafter  The ending is fabulous  I d be curious to see how this is translated onto the big screen If Lois Lowry s other books weren t so expensive on Kindle  I would buy more of her stuff to read in between the more serious stuff  Excellent  I read this before the movie came out  which is really the way to go  I am often put off by reading books that are mandatory for school children  but I was never forced to read this  so I guess having free will led me to it  I enjoyed it  A lot actually  Our world is so imperfect and to read about a world  or rather the same world but a different time  where people get along  apologize for their rudeness and overall peacefully coexist  was quite pleasant  The idea that people don t lie because it s not in their nature to was interesting  It isn t really in our nature  it s a learned habit  and if you never teach those habits then they will never be picked up  But  someone always learns to do the thing that no one else can or is suppose to do  The characters are pleasant and likable  The dialogue is interesting and thoughtful  I was left daydreaming about a perfect world that could only exist in a book  But of course  nothing is really perfect and what hides behind closed doors was soon exposed  The truth behind the  releases  was horrible  upsetting and maybe not so shocking after all  This is not just a child s book  You can find much more meaning than what lies on the surface   Wars  famine  disease  hate and intolerance  the world can be a very dark place sometimes  The world in our story has experienced a Diaspora event and is now trying to rebuild  A world is being forged from the ashes that is without pain  hate and war  You would almost call it a utopia  until you keep reading  There is a price to pay for this kind of peace  Many of my GR friends have read this book  with ratings from 1 to 5 stars  While I found this interesting that among readers that often share similar opinions  this book would garnish such a spread in ratings  While the ratings varied  it was widely read  I believe there is a powerful message in this story for our society  At least one that resonated with me   This was a really good read overall  enjoyed it  D As for each dystopian novel  especially the first one in a series  the world building is the biggest part of the story  The Giver is set in a dystopian world  where Sameness is seen as the highest quality  The world unfolds slowly as you read the book   after all  you see the world through Jonas  eyes and for him it s all pretty usual  It isn t until he gets his assignment with the Giver that he learns how different his world could be  and we as readers learn how different the world is from ours   Of course  there are easier tells already in the first part of the book  the assigned families  the annual ceremonies instead of birthdays  the language precision    But for me  the moment Jonas finds out what  seeing beyond  means was really an eye opener  I loved that part  The whole world building was amazing As for the rest  the story doesn t really start until after this book  Of course  things happen in The Giver  there is a narrative  But it s the last 3 chapters  the last 15 pages  that give voice to what will actually start to happen  The book isn t so much about actions  or about a journey from beginning to an end  The book is about emotions  about growing up  about choices   The Giver  by Lois Lowry  is a fictional story  It I a very interesting book about a kid named Jonas  Jonas is a young boy who is trying to figure out his meaning in life  He has one younger sister named Lily  and a younger brother named Gabriel  This novel takes place in a community that has strict rules  and everyone in the community has no feelings  if you could guess  this is not your normal community  There is no sunshine  snow  music  color  and you can t even lie to people  This is NOT your normal town  Jonas faces a lot of conflict in this story  He faces an external conflict with his apprentice  the giver before him   because he is trying to understand him  and what is going on in his teachings  Jonas also has an external conflict with his dad  because Jonas found out that his dad lied to him  but Jonas never confronts him  Jonas faces A LOT of internal conflict with himself  He is trying to understand why he was chosen above everyone else  and he is trying to understand these concepts that he was never told   I think that the author wrote this story very well  Lois really described the characters beautifully and I could really see what was going on  I could picture this whole story in my head  and it made the book that much better I thought that this book was very interesting and good  it was boring in the beginning  but vey intense in the end  I would recommend this to anyone who likes or enjoys reading a good book  I would recommend this to any age  I ve taught this book several times and it always stimulates thoughtful discussion  One of the best aspects of this dystopia is that it describes a society that wanted to be a utopia  Unintended consequences are the fly in the ointment of every project under human control  The gentle  almost lobotomized narration perfectly suits the message of the story  Made me Cry   I read this more than five years ago and by that time The Giver was the first dystopian themed book I ve read  so I might be a bit biassed when it comes to my review  I found the concept unique and fresh  I liked how the story depicted a seemingly utopian community  when in fact it s actually anti utopian  A world where everything is controlled and uniformed  Everything is in  sameness   I remember finding myself becoming very curious about Elsewhere and about what Jonas could  see  and I was pleased when I finally found out what it was  That s probably the only time when I realized how careful the settings and the people were described  and the limitations of the adjectives used  to fit  that  restriction successfully  I didn t even notice it until it was revealed   Trying my best not to post spoilers here  Overall  I enjoyed this novel  It was short  but had substance  I read the ending a couple of times before having my own conclusion  which was somehow correct judging from the events in  Messenger  and  Gathering Blue   I ll write a review for those books when I m not as lazy  Jonas lives in a society where there is no pain  fear or individuality  Every choice is made for them   what to wear  what job they will have and who to marry  When Jonas turns twelve and becomes the community s receiver of memory  the Giver begins to bestow all the memories of the world upon him  A whole new world of color  pain and choices is now opened  Jonas wonders what to do with this new world available to him  I loved this books  I do not remember actually reading tis in grade school like most people  It was a delightful book with much to offer  It seems like the book would be well suited for boys and girls  Jonas  coming of age takes on a huge responsibility and then a wondering about what to do with this information  I appreciated the subtle ideas that helped drive the ideas forward  like the concepts of color  or lack of it   Though  I am not sure if I would have picked up on this without having seem the movie  The Giver  If you love a good thrill  The Giver is the book for you  The Giver is a general fiction book  and takes place in a community where everything appears to be perfect  well at least that s what everybody who lives there thinks  The Giver has many twist and turns throughout the book that will keep you paying attention the whole way through  Jonas is an eleven year old boy who is about to turn twelve  and at twelve he will get his assignment of what he is going to do the rest of his life  During the story Jonas is introduced to a baby named Gabriel  Jonas automatically notices that him and the baby have the same eyes and that draws a connection  There is a ceremony for everybody up to the age of twelve in December  At the ceremony Jonas is finally given his assignment of being the next giver  At first Jonas is not very pleased with his assignment and is not excited to start  As days go by Jonas starts to see why being the giver is a very important job and why the job will cause him to think about life very differently  Jonas begins to see that the world they are living in is not at all perfect but instead a lie that they all have been living  At the end of the book Jonas is faced with the biggest decision he will ever have to face  and to see what that is you re just going to have to read the book for yourself  I would recommend this book because it is very thrilling and you get to see Jonas evolve from the beginning of the book till the very end   The Giver  by Lois Lowry  is an amazing book  The plot follows that of a young boy named Jonas  Jonas lives in a small community that is absolutely perfect and serene  Everything in this community is completely under control and looked over  There is no such thing as pain  fear  choices  or anything really interesting  When Jonas turns twelve  he is assigned to learn from The Giver  The Giver is wise  and holds the memories of the past world  At first  Jonas is unsure and shocked at the pain of the old world  He soon receives the truth  When he embarks on a journey to the world outside  he finally understands something he has never felt before  death  misery  love and joy  I think this book is amazingly written  It shows how lucky we are to have what we have  The author is brilliant  the descriptive yet sly way of her words trap you into Jonas s world  I didn t really understand the meaning of what was going until certain parts in the book  When these certain parts  it made me appreciate type this type of writing and the way everything was explained  I think the characters were very credible  I could practically see the scenes happen in front of me  even though some parts were unclear  My favorite character was the Giver  Even though he had never experienced the  pain  of the past  he was so wise  He cared and loved for Jonas  even when he had just meet him  I could sometimes relate to Jonas  when he had learned secrets of the past  he felt frustrated when other people acted so immature  even his parents  I ve felt like that before when I ve known something important and I ve wanted to tell my parents  but couldn t  My favorite part of the book is when Jonas experiences the memory of Christmas  He had felt the feeling of love and joy between a family  something he had never experienced or seen  I would recommend this book to anyone who has the patience to unravel and understand the meaning of this book   PERCENTAGE RATING  94So  this book was a pleasant surprise  I read it after I watched the trailer for the movie adaptation  and sadly  I can already tell that the movie is going to be much different ANYWAY  back to the book  Jonas  soon to be twelve years old  has to attend the Ceremony of Twelve  where he will receive his Assignment that will be what he does for the rest of his life  But instead of getting Nurturer  like his father  or Assistant Director of Recreation  like his best friend  he has been Selected to be the next Receiver of Memory  He meets the Giver  who will train him in being the Receiver  and learns that once upon a time  there was much more than the  perfect  community he lives in  There was once snow  sunshine  sleds  animals  ans love  He learns that maybe  the community is not so perfect after all  and he is the only one who can change it  DO NOT CONTINUE IF YOU DON T WANT TO BE SPOILED  view spoiler  I enjoyed the giver immensely  a  it was a dystopian  and I always love dystopians  and b  it was different  At first look  I thought it would be like The Hunger Games or Divergent  but it was very different and unique  Which is why  when I went to watch the trailer for the movie once again  I was hesitant as to what I would find  Speaking of the movie  let s talk about it for a bit  When I first watched it  before I had read the book  it looked like it would be amazing  Although I still do  I also feel like it is going to be completely separate from the novel  Everything looks different  Especially since   and I think a lot of people will be going on about this   the actor who plays Jonas is EFFING TWENTY FOUR YEARS OLD  What is this   I mean  I m pretty dang sure that in the book  Jonas is twelve  Let me just check    yep  twelve  This really bothers me  And I could go on and on talking about this  but my main point is that I am quite nervous for this movie   hide spoiler  In all  I did very much enjoy this book  It was a nice  short  simple dystopian  The only thing I did not like about it was the ending and lack of character development  although I think in that type of world there really wouldn t be much personality  would there  If you are looking for a novel to get you back into reading  this is a great one  It would even be good for getting out of mourning periods  And  if you love dystopians  definitely pick this one up  I m sure it will take your breathe away  No tengo palabras para describir lo que este libro me ha hecho sentir  pero si quisiera acercarme diria  recuerdos  Uno de los mejores libros de este ano sin lugar a dudas  una resena no basta para agradecer que este libro haya llegado a mis manos  recordarme porque amo leer con todo mi corazon  Ansiosa de leer el siguiente  I read a book once that had such potential  It could have been such a great story  But the author was unskilled  the characters were weak  and the story was flat and 2 dimensional  This is NOT one of those stories  There was so much depth  It had so much meaning  I really couldn t put the book down  I wanted it to go on  However  I did have some misgivings  The story isn t finished yet  The book ended at a very crucial part  What happened to Jonas  Gabe  What happened to the community  What happened to the Giver  Either way  this book wast masterfully crafted  Louis Lowry  I salute you   one of my favorites in grade school  i need to read the sequals  i just realized they existed     The Giver is absolutely the best book in all times  It will keep you at the edge of your seat  Read it  The Giver is nonfiction book meant to entertain  I believe the author does a really good job at achieving this purpose  One thing I really enjoyed about the book was the idea behind it  Although it is a nonfiction book I believe to a certain extent it can be a futuristic book  I believe there is a possibility of the government gaining alot of control to us and keeping us from knowing certain events such as in the giver that would affect our choices like the choice of turning against the government  I didn t think there was anything wrong with the book  One of my favorite quote I read was  You will be faced  now  with pain of a magnitude that none of us here can comprehend because it is beyond our experience  The Receiver himself was not able to describe it  only to remind us that you would be faced with it  that you would need immense courage   pg  63  Lowry   I do recommend this book to other people  I think if you need something fun and interesting to read this is the book for you   This is definitely one of my favorite books of all times  The themes are controversial  but it certainly makes you think  I will never think of color in the same way after reading The Giver  Thank you Mrs  Culkin  She read this to us out loud in class   The seeming utopia Lois Lowry has created in The Giver has done away with pain and war and everything that has been deemed bad  But  as Jonas discovers when he is assigned the role of  Receiver of Memory   it has also done away with love and tenderness and art and music and the true happiness one can find in spite of the suffering  Along with these discoveries  Jonas comes to realize that the world as he knows it is false  How many times had he been lied to when he thought it was outlawed  What really happens when someone is released  These are questions that he can have answered as the next Giver but is he really prepared for the truth  When confronted with the harsh realities all citizens are shielded from  Jonas becomes distraught  The current  Receiver of Memory  who is now the  Giver   having lost one successor already  helps Jonas devise a plan that will hopefully make life a little like it used to be  This little book leaves an impact  Jonas  tears when he watches his father  release  an infant will not soon be forgotten    Komunitas yang ditempati Jonas saat ini  adalah dunia yang sempurna dan teratur  Tidak akan ditemukan perbedaan yang membuat orang orang merasa tidak nyaman  Tidak harus merasa aneh  Segalanya sama  Namun segalanya terasa berbeda menjelang Desember saat umur Jonas mencapai dua belas Dia bersemangat menunggu datangnya Desember  Dan dia gembira  tentu saja  Semua anak sebelas gembira menanti peristiwa yang akan terjadi  Tetapi ada sedikit kegugupan ketika Jonas memikirkannya  tentang apa yang mungkin terjadi  Kekhawatiran Jonas cukup beralasan  Karena umur dua belas di komunitas tersebut merupakan awal menuju kedewassa  Anak umur dua belas akan diberi tugas pada hari  Penugasan   Tugas tugas ini dilakukan oleh Komite Tetua dengan mempertimbangkan karakter anak dari bayi hingga ia berumur dua belas Seperti halnya Penyatuan Pasangan  Penamaan  dan Penempatan anakbaru  Penugasan dipertimbangkan dengan saksama oleh Komite Tetua Ya  segalanya dalam komunitas  selalu diatur oleh Komite Tetua demi menghindari perbedaan  Sayangnya bagi Jonas  saat itu ia merasa berbeda  Ada bagian dari dirinya yang merasa bahwa hari  Penugasan  akan membuat hidupnya berubah seluruhnya  Dan firasat Jonas benar adanya  Ia berbeda  Ia Yang Terpilih dari sekian banyak orang di komunitas  Ia dipilih sebagai Sang Penerima yang akan dilatih oleh Sang Pemberi  The Giver  Di awal buku ini mengisahkan ketakutan Jonas menghadapi umur dua belas  Di komunitasnya  umur tersebut sudah layak diberi tanggung jawab dan merupakan awal kedewasaan  Sejujurnya  membaca buku ini di bagian awal agak membuat bosan  oleh karenanya buku ini menumpuk di shelf  currently reading  cukup lama  Saya bertanya tanya  dimana sebenarnya letak keseruan buku ini yang digadang gadang telah terjual 10 juta eksemplar   Berniat untuk membabat habis timbunan  maka saya memutuskan menyertakan buku ini di acara GRI Readathon Day 2015 pada hari sabtu lalu  Acara ini merupakan acara baca maraton tanpa henti selama 4 jam  terhitung dari jam 12 00 16 00 WIB  Akhirnya saya berhasil menamatkan buku ini dan menemukan dimana letak keseruan itu  Hore Full Review The Giver is a tale of adventure  discovery  and wonder  It is a book that makes you think about the importance of knowledge  Without knowledge of the past  then how do you know what is true  In addition  though certain truths are painful  without them you don t learn to enjoy life  This is shown beautifully through Lois Lowry s tale of a boy and his quest for knowledge and the truth  This idea behind The Giver reminds of 1984  In both books the protagonist knows more than everybody and feels the need to share that information  There is also someone who tries to stand in their ways but they are both resilient  This book sends an important message about knowledge and sticking with your gut  This book was amazing  I can see the parts that easily could throw people off from enjoying it  but I hung on to every word  We read an excerpt from it last year in Literature class  and I was hooked  I asked my teacher for a copy and I finished it myself  This year in Language Arts we were required to read it  and it s very interesting to watch people go through the emotions that this book gives the reader  This book shows you the wonder of life  the color  and the love and happiness that everybody experiences  I loved the idea of this book  and the ending didn t bother me  My LA teacher talked on and on how she loved this book  but with the warning that the ending was terrible  I can see how this could bother a person  but I simply felt that it was part of the wonder incorporated into the story   1  The 1994 Newbery Medal The 1994 Regina Medal The 1996 William Allen White Award American Library Association

film version of The Giver is almost out  it s time for me to write a review of the book  I m going to try to keep this about just the book   if I see the movie I m going to try to evaluate that on it s own standing even though I m not entirely pleased with some of the choices they ve apparently made with it  I m also going to just review The Giver on its own as a novel  even though it s the first in a four book series  I finally did get around to reading the other books in the series  and though they take things in an interesting direction and provide some closure that The Giver on its own lacks  in some ways I prefer The Giver as its own independent story  I read this book when I was 13  and it is one of the books or maybe the book from childhood that has made the most lasting impression on me  It s just such a simply written  yet powerful story  written at a level suitable for middle schoolers but with themes much more mature than the average young adult novel  In drawing the reader into protagonist Jonas  world  Lois Lowry shows that sometimes the simplest writing is the most evocative  Jonas is a twelve year old boy  and in some ways he seems like a typical preteen boy  but in the community he lives in  everything is perfect and orderly  There is no war  hardship  or poverty  and everyone knows their place  Their future is set out by the community leaders  But as the novel opens prior to the ceremony where the  Twelves  will receive their vocational assignments  Jonas is feeling apprehensive  And when he receives the role of  The Receiver  to be trained under the wise  aged  Giver   his perfect world is turned upside down  Jonas s role as the Receiver is to receive memories from  the time before   Every time he meets with the Giver  he receives a memory of something his community no longer has  These memories start out simple   pets  Christmas  sledding   and gradually become more poignant and emotional as Jonas experiences everything from familial love to loss  fear  and pain  As he continues with the Giver  Jonas begins to question all that he has accepted about his community and his life  I think the reason The Giver works so well is that the reader experiences everything with Jonas  So when Jonas first begins to see flickers of color  yes  all color was stricken from the community in the name of sameness  we imagine what it would be like not to know the color red  From little details that we take for granted to powerful emotions  Lowry makes us question what we would really trade away in search of a  perfect  world  Yes  some things about Jonas s community don t  make sense   I m not entirely clear how they have removed color from the community  how memories are transmitted from the Giver to Jonas  etc  And then there are the pills that every community resident takes when they experience their first  stirrings   sexual urges   I had thought these pills were strictly for controlling or suppressing their sexuality  but both The Giver and later books in the series suggest that they prevent people from forming deep attachments or emotions at all  So why are they not taken until puberty  to prevent children from bonding with the people who raise them but can t be really called  parents  However  I ve never been one to need dystopian literature to be realistic  and in the case of The Giver adds to the sense of mystery  It is the same for the purposefully up in the air ending  Later books in the series do provide closure as to what happens to Jonas and to Gabriel  the baby Jonas s father had been caring for  However  I almost prefer the way The Giver ends on a note of mystery and wonder  5 stars for being one of the most powerful books of my childhood adolescence   The Giver  by the amazing author  Lois Lowry  is novel in which it captures the dark side of a seemingly perfect community  A community with no crime  hatred  and no diseases  and it seemed like the perfect utopia  But when the annual Ceremony is held for the Twelve  Jonas is about to receive the biggest change in his life At the beginning of the book  Lowry s beautiful and descriptive description of the Community was very detailed and easy to understand  The Community was a town in which people lived in perfect harmony under the rules set by the government  And the youth  when they reach the age of Twelve  they are assigned with a new Assignment  another way of saying a job  It has been said that the government will be picking the Assignment for each person  ensuring the best Assignment possible for that particular person Finally  it was the day of the Ceremony  It was a long and very formal ceremony but eventually  it was the turn for the Twelve to be assigned with a new Assignment  They were called my numbers that they were assigned at their birth  Jonas s was 19  so was very excited to be one of the first to be Assigned  But then  when they were supposed to invite Jonas up to the stage  they didn t  Lowry s writing style clearly shown the great anxiety and fear that Jonas had at the time  afraid that he might be sent out of the Community  But then at the end of the ceremony  when all is unfolded  Jonas was revealed to be the next Receiver of Memory  Lowry s clever choice of words helped to lace in with the feeling that Jonas was feeling at the time to create a very natural and uplifting tone  to celebrate Jonas s new and proud Assignment Throughout the story  The Giver passed the memory of his from the time before Jonas s  or his own birth  Some of them were fun  cheerful and unforgettable  Again  with Lowry s descriptive style of writing  these memories were being brought to life  giving the reader a Real experience of the memory being passed on to Jonas  even though they still remain on a page  But to the fun and cheerful memories  comes the painful ones as well  Lowry s descriptive writing also helped in these memories  as those painful memories unfold themselves  and the use the omniscient narrator helped the story to have multiple dimensions to the pain and sorrow of the past Closer to the end of the book  the dark side of the Community started to unfold itself  As with the Giver being a part of the Community Government  he has all the access to the secret files  Upon first reading of this book  I decided that it s one of my favorite stories  However  I haven t read it in years  so I decided it was time to pick it up again  as I plan to see the recently released movie  Reading the story again  I was immediately drawn into Jonas s world  The lack of basic things that are taken for granted  things like color  music  the tiny day to day choices we make  trying to imagine being without all of that is mystifying on several levels  Reading the story of Jonas s discovery of his abilities as a Receiver is ripe with feelings of adventure and wonder  pain and anguish  all of the things Jonas himself feels  I love that Jonas helps the Giver realize a way to bring about change in the community and allow the citizens to feel the effects of their decisions  specifically those concerning Release  I remember  when I first read the book  that I didn t have any particular feelings about the ending  outside of it being another aspect of a book I already considered good  However  reading it this time  I was stricken by the idea of it s being the starvation induced fantasy of a dying young boy  I don t know how I feel about that  I m not particularly fond of sad endings  but I know that they happen from time to time  It doesn t diminish my love of the story in the least  This is still one of my favorite books  and I m looking forward to reading the rest of the Quartet  The Giver by Lois Lowry is a short  but important book for the YA audience  But don t place it on the YA shelf to gather dust because it has the ability to suck adults in as easily as kids  Ms  Lowry is superb at character development  but beyond that  the plot is gripping  I couldn t put this one down until I d read it all  This is a story of a community that centers on  sameness  and imposes reams of rules upon a populace so accustomed to them that it no longer questions anything  Everyone must be careful not to use language that others consider offensive  sound familiar  or words that are not precise  In an effort to create  sameness   comfort  and abundance  many aspects of the human experience are virtually eliminated  No one decides what they should be when they grow up or who they should marry or how many children  2 is the limit  they should have  Instead a committee of elders makes those decisions  No one suffers pain or want and no one sees colors  Worse yet  no one truly loves or is permitted to  And those not seen as quite the  same  or those that are not needed for whatever reason are  released   That is  until a certain 12 year old boy receives his job assignment This book is classic quality with an Orwellian feel  I highly recommend it  Of course  now I need to read the next book in the series  But why not   Hey guys  So I have to say  I am embarrassed that it took me 8 days to read this book  I know for some people  that would sound about normal  but for me  thats a big no no  especially because the book is only 179 pages  I was anticipating that I would finish it in a day  but that wasn t the case  Apparently life just got in the way  So I wanted to read this book because even after 8 years  people are talking about this book  Its won numerous awards  and I have to say justly so  For such a short story  I thought it was pretty good  There wasn t much that was needed to be said in order to get the story across  but it did have a big impact  Whats the book about  The book is about a young teenager named Jonas who lives in a utopian world  Everything is controlled for the people  including their jobs  how they are raised  what they can wear  how the interact with each other  etc  When it comes to Jonas  time to be given his permanent job  he is singled out for a special job called The Receiver  in which he receives training from the previous receiver  who is now called the giver  As the receiver  Jonas will receive the memories of pain  love  anguish  etc from those who came before  Jonas  world is turned upside down when he discovers the real truth about his world  This book  I feel like  is a you love it or hate it  I ve seen people mostly love it  but the few reviews I ve seen of people hating it  man they were brutal  A lot of people like to take a book apart  provide some sort of analytical criticism for what they believe is going on  and kinda just rant about it  I m not going to do that because my days of analytical literature essays from college are done  For now at least  Instead I want to take the story as a whole  and not piece by piece  I feel like there just isn t enough there for me to take it apart piece by piece  In this book  the people individually are naive  They don t understand the world around them  but rather they understand the rules that are handed to them  Jonas and the giver share difficulties with dealing with this because they know so much more than the rest of their community  But the society as a whole  seems to be corrupt to me  but not in the way that people traditionally think  When people think of corruption  they think of one person or a set of people who instill corruption into a society or group  But no one is allowed to think inside this society  and they think that whatever is going on in the society  whatever is deemed as a rule  is good for them  They were never taught to show passion for something  or to stand up for an idea  The inability to think for themselves is the corruption  Just because something appears to be working  doesn t mean it isn t falling apart at the seams  But what I liked about this book  is the fact that when you grow alongside Jonas mentally  you first learn to accept the people and their naivety  You accept it as normal behavior  And as you learn about the truth of the world with Jonas  you feel the same things as him  I think what was brilliant about Lowry s book was the fact that she expected you to have knowledge of the pains of the world  like war  corruption  famine  etc  You also brought along your own memories of having fun  playing games  being happy  In this sense  the book was really interactive  Now onto the movie bit  So this book has been turned into a movie and is slated to come out August 15th  2014  I m having a bit of trouble with the trailer  It seems really different from the book that I read  I imagined a quiet little town  and the movie made it into a metropolis  The society in the book seemed simplistic  and the only technology I saw was intercoms and talk about a car  The trailer made it seem like life was comfortable  there was technology everywhere  There were also bits and pieces in the trailer that I didn t even see in the book  and made me wonder if the movie was changed drastically to add more action and make a bigger conspiracy  Things may have been added from the other books in the series  but I have a feeling the stuff I m talking about isn t in the series  I m not quite sure  However  there are some big actors in this movie  like Jeff Bridges staring as the Giver  Meryl Streep as the Chief Elder  Katie Holmes as Jonas  mother  Taylor Swift as Rosemary  I m unsure how I feel about this one  I used to be a huge taylor swift fan  but things change   I ve posted the trailer below so you guys can check it out for yourselves
